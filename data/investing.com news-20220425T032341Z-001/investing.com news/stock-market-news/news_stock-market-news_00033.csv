“About 8 million tons of plastics are going into the ocean annually,” he said in an interview. “If you look at plastic packaging, around 95% is not being recycled each year which is $100 billion worth of plastic, and that’s valuable for entrepreneurs.”
At the center of the effort is Asia, which consumes almost half of the world’s plastic packaging, according to BloombergNEF, and imports even more waste from the U.S. and Europe. Solutions -- such as Indian vending machines that turn plastic bottles into polyester, and researchers in Singapore who are working out ways to clean up oil spills using the waste -- will be needed to meet demand for recycled plastics that’s forecast to rise faster than supply.
The biggest challenge to the transition is to make recycled plastics at a price and quality that are competitive. Virgin plastic is derived from crude oil and is closely linked to the global oil price. Because the cost of recycled plastic is more stable, it becomes relatively more expensive when crude prices fall.
The complexity of sorting different types of plastic is another hurdle, according to Penrice, as well as dealing with waste at source rather than producing a lot of carbon emissions by sending it half way around the world.
An estimated $80 billion-$120 billion of value is lost because of packaging that goes into the environment, said Navneet Chadha, principal operations officer at the World Bank’s International Finance Corp., which helps fund private sector investment in developing countries. “We have to think of used plastic as a resource, not as a waste.”
But Chadha cautioned that standards for recycled products need to be developed to avoid “unintended consequences”. Using plastic in road construction, for example, needs to be evaluated further as microplastics may be generated as the road decays, he said.
Here are some of the ways plastic is being recycled in Asia:
Traditional Recycling
Plastic waste is traditionally reused by collecting and sorting refuse and then melting it, a process known as mechanical recycling. Part of the problem is that a lot of garbage is tainted with food or chemicals and can’t cheaply be turned into high quality raw materials.
“The biggest challenge is quality of recycled plastic,” said Jean-Marc Boursier, chief operating officer of SUEZ Group, one of the world’s largest recycling companies. “Major consumer goods companies like Danone, Pepsi or Coca Cola will not buy recycled plastic unless they are convinced that the quality is as good as virgin plastic.”
SUEZ has nine plants globally that can turn a combined 500,000 tons of waste plastic into 150,000 tons of polymers, used to make shampoo bottles, car interiors and other products. The company is opening its first Asian plastic recycling plant this year in Thailand.
Boursier suggests pricing the carbon savings into the recycled plastic price to take into account the environmental benefit.
Aerogels
A team of researchers at the National University of Singapore has developed a way to convert low-value plastic waste into aerogels -- ultra-light materials used in everything from diaper fillings to cleaning up oil spills.
Around eight average plastic water bottles produce a square meter sheet of aerogel using the method, said Duong Hai Minh, an associate professor at the university who worked on the project. The researchers have sold commercial production rights to firms including Bronxculture in Singapore and DPN Aerogel JSC in Vietnam, he said.
“People throw away plastic because there they don’t see any value,” Minh said. “As long as we can make it valuable, everyone will keep it and sell it.”
Highways
Using plastic waste to build roads is gaining in popularity, not least because all types of plastic including difficult-to-recycle multilayered packaging and flexible films and coatings used to wrap chocolates and for food deliveries can be used.   Dow Chemical   (NYSE:DOW) and India’s   Reliance Industries   Ltd (NS:RELI) have developed technologies that use this plastic as a binder, replacing some of the bitumen.
The Mukesh Ambani-led company has built 40 kilometers of road at its refineries using plastic that can’t otherwise be recycled, and is in talks with National Highways Authority of India and other road builders about using the technology more widely, said Vipul Shah, chief operating officer for the petrochemicals business.
Meanwhile   Indian Oil Corporation   Ltd (NS:IOC), the country’s biggest refiner, is trying to get the government to make the blending of non-recyclable plastics in road-laying mandatory, said S.S.V. Ramakumar, director of research and development.
In the Philippines, San Miguel Corp (PS:SMC) laid down its first road combining plastic scraps with asphalt last year, using surface material developed with Dow. The chemicals giant has also helped build plastic-based roads in India, Indonesia, Vietnam and the U.S., according to Dow’s Penrice.
“It’s relatively simple from the technology point of view: you shred the plastic waste, some sorting and selection and then you feed it into the existing asphalt machinery,” he said. “Approximately 100 tons of plastic waste can be recycled into a 40-kilometer stretch of road.”
Textiles
Shredding plastic bottles to produce polyester for clothing is another technology that’s gaining traction in Asia. Reliance has set up reverse-vending machines that collect used bottles in exchange for discount coupons that can be redeemed at its company stores.
The company, India’s largest petrochemicals manufacturer, can recycle around 2 billion plastic bottles a year, or 33,000 tons, according to Shah. Capacity will be doubled over the next 18 months, he said.
Bricks
Some non-government organizations and companies are looking at ways to use waste plastic to make bricks and other construction materials. The Global Ecobrick Alliance is promoting use of a block tightly crammed with plastic and other recyclables. Qube, an India-based start-up, has developed a brick made entirely of plastic waste. Called the PlastiQube, it’s cheaper and uses less energy to produce than conventional counterparts, according to the company’s website.
Chemical Recycling
Breaking down waste plastic into a basic feedstock like naphtha -- a process called pyrolysis -- can reprocess dirty, contaminated plastics like detergent drums and mixed polymers that can’t be dealt with through mechanical recycling.
Pyrolysis will provide around 17% of the 19 million tons of plastics recycling capacity required by 2030 in major economies, according to BloombergNEF. Dow will source oil feedstock made using pyrolysis from Dutch company Fuenix Ecogy Group, while Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) PLC and  Total  SA (PA:TOTF) have partnered with start-ups to increase use of the technology.
“Mechanical recycling will continue to be cheaper,” said Boursier at SUEZ, which is setting up a pyrolysis pilot project in Bristol in the U.K. “But for complex or polluted plastic, chemical recycling will be the future.”"

An 83% run-up this year before the offering launched might have contributed to the more buyer-friendly pricing terms, not to mention recent news of product recalls and fresh regulatory scrutiny. But Elon Musk probably isn’t losing any sleep over the matter, as the price per share was still more than double any of the company’s prior equity raises.
Six of Tesla’s previous secondary offerings -- conducted between 2011 and 2019 -- priced at discounts below 1.0%. The bullish bidding helped Tesla fuel a decade of unparalleled price appreciation.

The value of overall sales climbed 0.3% after a downwardly revised 0.2% increase the prior month, Commerce Department figures showed Friday. Excluding receipts at filling stations, retail purchases increased 0.3%, the most in five months.
Steady demand at retailers indicates the consumer remains the economy’s key fuel source. Resilient hiring and wage growth are helping to boost both sentiment and spending. Economists forecast household outlays to increase in the first quarter at about the same pace as the end of 2019.
Meanwhile, economic risks remain with sluggish export markets, weak business spending and any fallout from the coronavirus.
One caveat in today's data was the “control group” subset of sales, which was unchanged in January after a downwardly revised 0.2% December gain. The measure excludes food services, car dealers, building-materials stores and gasoline stations, providing a reading that’s tied better to underlying consumer demand.
The retail sales report showed nine of 13 major categories increased, including the largest gains at building materials outlets and non-store merchants since August. Receipts at general merchandise stores were the strongest in six months, while sales at furniture and home furnishing stores were the best in four.
Sales retreated at electronics outlets, clothing stores and personal care shops.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in congressional testimony this week that there’s no reason that a scenario of generally strong job growth and rising wages can’t go on. Central bankers have held rates steady to extend the record-long expansion.
The labor market was stronger than expected in January, faster wage growth. At the same time, job openings fell to a two-year low in December, indicating employment growth may soon cool.
The Commerce Department's report showed gas-station receipts declined 0.5% on lower fuel prices, the report showed. Consumer price index data on Thursday showed gasoline costs tumbled last month.
Sales at car dealers rose 0.2% in January. Excluding automobiles and gasoline, retail sales advanced 0.4% after a 0.5% gain the previous month.
A separate Labor Department report Friday showed the U.S. import price index was unchanged in January from the prior month and up 0.3% from a year earlier, indicating tame inflation."
4,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 14, 2020 09:19AM ET</span>",Ramaphosa Plan No Quick Fix For South Africa’s Energy Woes,"(Bloomberg) -- South African President Cyril Ramaphosa’s plans to overhaul the energy industry have some way to go before they provide answers to the nation’s crippling power shortages.
Africa’s most industrialized nation has been roiled by rolling blackouts since late 2005, a legacy of state power company Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd.’s failure to adequately maintain its plants and invest in sufficient new ones. In his state-of-the-nation address on Thursday, Ramaphosa announced a raft of measures to increase generation, including calling for new bids from private producers to supply the grid and allowing companies to produce unlimited electricity for the own use.
While the reforms are “in essence, very positive, we’re just missing time lines,” said Wido Schnabel, chairman of the South African Photovoltaic Industry Association. Plant developers will need about two months to get on site after the new bid round begins, and it would be technically possible for them to bring as much as 4,000 megawatts of capacity on line within a year, he said.
South Africa previously had the world’s fastest-growing program to procure green power from independent producers, but it stalled when Eskom refused to sign off-take agreements with the developers. Former Energy Minister Jeff Radebe signed contracts for the most recent round in 2018 with 27 companies after more than two years of delays.
Thus far independent producers have completed 64 projects that together have almost 4,000 megawatts of generating capacity and on average took 1.9 years to build, government data shows.
The need for additional power is extremely urgent and it would have been preferable if Ramaphosa had set deadlines for issuing the official requests for -- and the awarding of -- new projects, said Anton Eberhard, a professor at the University of Cape Town Graduate School of Business.
While Ramaphosa pledged to ensure that the National Energy Regulator of South Africa would handle all applications by commercial and industrial users to produce more than 1 megawatt of power for their own use within 120 days, the process currently takes much longer.
‘Bold Action’
“The state and the regulator need to step aside when it comes to self-generation,” Eberhard said. Power cuts are “causing massive economic damage. We need bold, prompt and purposeful action.”
Minerals Council South Africa, a lobby group for the mining industry, welcomed the government’s recognition that companies could help address Eskom’s capacity shortages by producing their own power. Mining companies have a pipeline of energy projects totaling about 1,500 megawatts that could be brought on stream in the next nine to 36 months, it said.
Promises to allow industrial companies, particularly mines, to build their own generation capacity “could be transformative in eroding the monopoly of troubled state-owned electricity company Eskom,” Fitch Ratings said. “It is still unclear whether licenses will be easily obtainable.”
Ramaphosa concedes that his planned reforms will take time to bear fruit.
“The reality is our energy system will remain constrained until new energy generation comes on stream,” he told lawmakers.
(Updates with Fitch comment in 10th paragraph. An earlier version of the story corrected the spelling of Eberhard’s name.)"
5,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 14, 2020 09:04AM ET</span>","Coronavirus to Have Prolonged Impact on Consumer Stocks, Barclays Says","(Bloomberg) -- Expectations that disruption from the coronavirus will be cleared up by the second quarter are “overly optimistic,” according to  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc’s consumer-staples analysts, who on Friday lowered their recommendations and estimates on three sector heavyweights.
For cosmetics giant L’Oreal SA (PA:OREP), the analysts said they wouldn’t be surprised if a full recovery took a year or more, based on how long it has taken the Chinese consumer to recover from previous slowdowns. Distillers   Pernod Ricard   SA (PA:PERP) andRemy Cointreau (PA:RCOP) also have “material exposure” to China, leaving them vulnerable to a prolonged impact from the disease.
“We expect disruption well into 2Q as a base case,” Barclays analysts including Laurence Whyatt and Iain Simpson wrote in a note Friday. “As yet, it is too soon to tell when footfall and spend in Chinese malls and travel retail might return to normal levels.”
Some investors have so far been prepared to look beyond immediate concern over the impact of the virus as evidenced by a 3.8% gain in Pernod Ricard shares on Thursday after the distiller cited the outbreak for a reduction in its forecast of full-year profit growth. Both L’Oreal and Pernod Ricard shares are showing modest gains on the year, while Remy has fallen about 8%.
The Barclays note spurred weakness in all three stocks on Friday, with L’Oreal and Remy being downgraded to underweight from equal-weight and Pernod cut to equal-weight from overweight.
“We have little visibility as to when the virus will be taken under control,” the analysts wrote about the overall situation. “To our minds, reduced earnings visibility merits a lower valuation.”"

Stocks in focus in premarket trade on Friday, February 14th. Please refresh for updates.
9 AM ET: Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock were both down by 0.5% after a judge issued an injunction to stop Microsoft building Cloud-based infrastructure for the Pentagon’s JEDI project.
8:56 AM ET:   Roku   (NASDAQ:ROKU) stock rose 8.2% to its highest in over two months after the maker of streaming devices reported revenue rose 49% in the fourth quarter to $411 million, well ahead of forecasts.
The company’s guidance of $1.6 billion for 2020 revenue was also above expectations.
The $10 billion contract was the biggest-ever given by the U.S. government. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) objected that President Donald Trump had intervened against it out of personal bias, a response to hostile coverage of Trump in the Washington Post, which is owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. 
8:45 AM ET: Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock fell 2.4% to $784.99 after the company said it priced its secondary share sale at $767. That represents a 4.6% discount to Thursday’s closing price of $804.

8:43 AM ET:   Canopy Growth   (NYSE:CGC) stock soared 22% to a two-week high after results for its fiscal third-quarter beat forecasts on both top and bottom lines.

Higher sales, improved gross margins and cost-cutting led it to cut its underlying EBITDA loss to $92 million, some 40% less than the previous three months.

The results also lifted rivals in the cannabis space. Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) stock rose 8.9% while Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) rose 8.2%.


08:30 AM ET: NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock rose 6.1% after the company’s earnings per share came in some 14% higher than consensus forecasts thanks to strong demand for its data center and gaming chips.

Revenue also came in some 5% above expectations, and the company’s guidance for the current quarter was also more optimistic than the Street’s, despite its prediction of a $100 million hit to sales in China in the current quarter due to the Covid-19 outbreak.

  Expedia   (NASDAQ:EXPE) stock rose 11.7% after the online travel agent reported earnings some 4% ahead of forecasts in the final quarter of 2019.

Market participants were more interested, however, in the group’s cost-cutting plan. It said it expected to shave as much as $500 million off annual operating costs. Consequently, it expects EBITDA to grow by more than 10% this year, despite expected impacts from Covid-19.

Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) stock fell 2.9% after Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) unveiled a copycat app called “Hobbi”, potentially exposing it to greater competition.

 Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE) stock is now only 10% below where it was before it spooked the market with its third-quarter report.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock was up 0.7%, undeterred by the prospect of higher spending on the new project.

Japan is planning to approve the construction of several integrated resorts - Las Vegas-style complexes that include casinos, shopping arcades and conference centres - to boost tourism after the Tokyo Olympics end in August.
The government has authorised licences for three resorts and is expected to receive official bids next year from regions vying to build the facilities, potentially including Japan's three largest cities, Tokyo, Yokohama and Osaka.
A consortium comprising MGM and Japan's Orix Corp (T:8591) has been selected as the sole qualified applicant for the development of the Osaka resort, its prefectural government said in a statement.
Osaka hopes to make a final decision on which bidder will win the project in June, the Nikkei newspaper said.
Despite the government's push, the casino development law is unpopular with the public, given concerns that large-scale gambling centers could lead to a rise in addiction, along with crime and corruption.
A bribery scandal that saw the arrest last December of a ruling-party lawmaker previously overseeing casino policy has increased public opposition to the government's plan to allow casinos in Japan.
Some analysts say the casino market could be worth around $20 billion annually or more, thanks to an affluent population and the proximity to Asia's wealthy gamblers."

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) said on Friday it will invest $1 billion over the next decade in initiatives that would limit the impact of global air travel on the environment, the first airline to make a commitment of that scale.
The aviation industry accounts for roughly 2% of global carbon dioxide emissions and has set out a plan to achieve carbon-neutral growth from 2020, even as air travel is forecast to accelerate.
Facing increasing demands from customers, individual airlines like Delta have taken additional steps to mitigate their carbon impact with measures ranging from eliminating single-use plastics to investing in biofuels and purchasing more fuel-efficient aircraft.
With this new investment, Delta intends to become the first carbon-neutral airline globally while helping to fund research and projects involving clean air technologies and the reduction of carbon emissions and waste. 
""There's no challenge we face that is in greater need of innovation than environmental sustainability, and we know there is no single solution,"" Delta's chief executive, Ed Bastian, said in a statement.
The airline provided no details on how it will invest the money.
Bastian is an advocate of air travel as a way to connect people and economies across the globe but has been vocal about the industry's responsibility in ensuring environmental sustainability.
As of now, there are not many quick options available for airlines to reduce their carbon footprint. Biofuels are in short supply and take years to develop, and there are no immediate prospects of newer jet engines that are more fuel-efficient than those currently in the market.
Airlines say small steps like single-engine taxiing and the use of lighter materials are cutting around 1-2% of emissions each year, but more needs to be done.
In the absence of more impactful short-term options, the industry has committed to a carbon-offset program that allows airlines to invest in verified environmental projects to offset their emissions.
Delta, for example, previously pledged to cap its greenhouse gas emissions at 2012 levels even with 20% growth by purchasing carbon offsets.
But that is not the target of the new $1 billion investment, which will begin in March.

""We are on a journey, and though we don't have all the answers today, we know that our scale, along with investments of time, talent and resources will bring meaningful impact to the planet and ensure the sustainability of our business for decades to come,"" Bastian said.

9,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2020 08:40AM ET</span>",Nvidia shares surge on signs of machine learning boom,"(Reuters) - Shares of  Nvidia Corp  (O:NVDA) rose 6% on Friday after the chipmaker stunned analysts with strong quarterly results and joined rivals  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (O:AMD) in predicting strong demand for chips used in the latest generation of data centers and AI.
At least eleven brokerages hiked price targets on the company's stock. Brokerage Cowen & Company was the most bullish, raising its target by $85 to $325, higher than Wall Street's median price target of $285.15 and Friday's pre-market price of around $287.
Analysts at Susquehanna said while they had expected the company to beat market consensus expectations thanks to the data center demand, they had never expected this kind of upside.
""Nvidia's dream-a-dream AI story is solidly back on track,"" analysts from the brokerage said in a note to clients.
Chipmakers have had a rollercoaster ride over the past two years, with Donald Trump's trade war with China and the fading of a boom in mobile phone development and sales eating into growth. New markets in self-driving cars, internet of things appliances and the huge data centers needed to drive booming e-commerce and new online functionality, by contrast, are still developing.
Sales from Nvidia's data center business, which serves clients developing products related to artificial intelligence, surged 43% in the fourth quarter to $968 million. Jefferies analysts projected a 34% jump overall this year.
The chipmaker also forecast first-quarter sales above estimates, even as it expected a $100 million hit from the coronavirus outbreak. The strong forecast also helped fuel expectations of a rebound in chip demand.
""With solid product cycles in Gaming and sustainable strong demand from Data Center customers, we continue to see an upward bias in revenues, margins, and earnings as we move through FY21,"" J.P. Morgan analysts wrote in a note.
Nvidia was the second chipmaker after  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM) to warn of the potential impact on its business of the coronavirus outbreak, which has left Chinese companies struggling to restart production after an extended new year holiday.
Cowen analysts said Nvidia was also benefiting from pent-up demand following under-investment from cloud customers in the first half of 2019 and accelerating demand for conversational AI - where computers engage in human-like dialogue."

PARIS (Reuters) - Renault's (PA:RENA) first loss in a decade triggered a no-taboos commitment to cut costs by 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) over the next three years from the carmaker on Friday, as it tries to put the Carlos Ghosn affair behind it.
As ex-Volkswagen brand manager Luca de Meo prepares to take over as chief executive of the French automaker, which has been rocked by the Ghosn scandal, it did not exclude job cuts in a promised review of its performance across all factories.
Like many auto industry rivals, including its alliance partner Nissan (T:7201),  Renault  is grappling with tumbling demand in key markets like China, and said it expects the sector to be hit further this year, including in Europe.
In a reflection of this sobering assessment of the market outlook, Renault set a lower operating margin target of between 3% and 4% for 2020, down from 4.8% in 2019, and cut its proposed dividend against 2019 by almost 70% from a year earlier. 
While Renault faces high investment costs to produce cleaner car models and supply chain problems due to China's coronavirus outbreak, a major challenge remains moving on from the scandal involving former boss-turned fugitive Ghosn, which strained its relations with Nissan and paralysed joint projects. 
""It has been a tough year for Groupe Renault and the alliance,"" acting Chief Executive Clotilde Delbos said on a conference call, adding that the broader autos downturn had hit the company ""right when we were facing internal difficulties."" 
Renault could not afford to wait for De Meo's arrival in July to attack costs, Delbos said, adding that nothing would be ""taboo"" as it reviews its business.
Meatier goals would be made public in May, she said, alongside joint plans with Nissan, as executives repeated assurances that the alliance was on track. 
Delbos also stressed that Renault's automotive operational free cash flow, under scrutiny from analysts, would be positive in 2020 after stripping out restructuring costs. 
""We're very confident that there is no topic on cash availability within the group,"" Delbos said. 
Renault shares recovered from falls in early trading, and were up 1.8% at 1200 GMT despite it posting a loss of 141 million euros ($153 million) for the group share of net income.
This followed charges linked to some of its Chinese joint ventures, where it said performance needed to improve, while the contribution from Nissan, in which Renault has a 43% stake, also fell and it was hit by a French deferred tax charge.
Nissan this week had its first quarterly loss in nearly ten years and cut its operating profit forecast. 
GLOOMY OUTLOOK
Ghosn, who ran Renault and oversaw its alliance with Nissan, was arrested in Japan in late 2018 on financial misconduct charges, but fled to Lebanon in December. 
He has denied wrongdoing and hit out at his past employers, saying the Renault-Nissan alliance was all but dead without him. 
De Meo, who used to run Seat, is taking over from Delbos, who is also Renault's financial chief and who stepped temporarily into the CEO role after Thierry Bollore, a long-standing Ghosn ally, was ousted in October.
Renault forecast that the global auto market would fall in 2020, with sales in Europe and Russia down around 3%, after it was penalised by its performance in the likes of Argentina and Turkey in 2019 and its withdrawal from Iran continued to weigh. 
The group has a factory in Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus epidemic, which has been in lockdown, and the firm said other plants might come on and off in the coming weeks due to supply chain interruptions. 

Renault's group sales fell 3.3% to 55.53 billion euros in 2019, down 2.7% at constant exchange rates, and it forecast these would be flat in 2020.

Executives of some of the companies expected to attend the meeting include Indian oil & gas company  Reliance Industries  (NS:RELI), diversified group Tata Sons and auto sector companies such as  Bharat Forge  (NS:BFRG), Mahindra and Mahindra (NS:MAHM) and Motherson, industry and business sources told Reuters.
Trump is scheduled to make his first visit as president to India on Feb. 24-25 during which he will travel to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state of Gujarat followed by talks in New Delhi. The two countries are trying to sign a trade deal during his visit.
On Feb. 25, a meeting is being planned between Trump and Indian executives, especially those focusing on job creation and manufacturing in the United States, the sources said.
The meeting, which will be held in New Delhi, was unlikely to include executives of U.S. companies, they said.
Creating new jobs and boosting manufacturing is critical for Trump in his re-election bid later this year. U.S. factory activity rebounded in January but only after it contracted for five straight months.
""President (Trump) is keen on acknowledging Indian companies which are focusing on manufacturing in the United States,"" said a Washington-based source aware of the plans.
United States is a key market for several Indian firms.
Mahindra last year said it will invest another $1 billion in the United States and was committed to creating American jobs, while Bharat Forge has announced plans to invest $56 million to set up a new plant in North Carolina.
The $100-billion Tata Group says it is one of the largest Indian-headquartered multinationals in North America, with 13 companies and more than 35,000 employees.
The Confederation of Indian Industries and U.S.-India trade groups have suggested several Indian executives for the Trump meeting and the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi was reviewing that, one source said, adding the final list was yet to be finalized.
The U.S. Embassy in New Delhi declined to comment.
Other than his meeting with Indian business leaders and Modi, Trump is expected to attend an event at a stadium in Gujarat along the lines of the ""Howdy Modi"" extravaganza held in Houston last September during which the two leaders made a joint appearance."

In 2015 the carmaker admitted to using manipulated engine management software to mask excessive pollution levels in its diesel cars, sparking a raft of prosecutions and lawsuits.
A VW spokesman confirmed that talks had collapsed, blaming excessive demands for fees by lawyers representing the Federation Of German Consumer Organisations (VZBV). Funke Medien was first to report that the talks had failed.
VW said it had struck a preliminary deal offering 830 million euros in compensation but that VZBW's lawyers had insisted on 50 million euros in fees.

Rowe Price Group Inc (O:TROW) has called its investment in WeWork a ""debacle"" that caused the firm ""outsized headaches and disappointments"" and left it holding shares worth just a fraction of their original value.
In a rare public comment on its experience with a specific investment, the U.S. fund management group said in a Feb. 12 filing that it had invested in the startup in 2014 on the premise that WeWork's management would focus on developing a more sustainable business strategy and slow its pace of growth.
Among the world's most valuable startups a year ago, New York-based WeWork abandoned its attempt to launch on the stock market last September after seeing its valuation collapse due to concerns over its mounting losses and leadership.
""They (WeWork's management) took our advice for a few months, but new investors soon arrived who convinced management to put its foot back on the accelerator,"" T. Rowe, which manages more than $1.2 trillion in assets, said in the report https://sec.report/Document/0001206774-20-000442 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
WeWork was not immediately available to comment out of regular U.S. business hours early on Friday.
The company, under new Chairman Marcelo Claure, has been implementing a five-year turnaround plan aimed at boosting valuation and winning back investor trust.
""While it's possible that WeWork's new management will improve operations somewhat, we are ready to declare this a terrible investment,"" T.Rowe said.
T. Rowe Price sold some of its stake in the company in 2017 and again in 2019 but its remaining shares were left ""worth a fraction of their earlier valuation"" after WeWork abandoned its initial public offering."

MUNICH (Reuters) - Facebook (O:FB) Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg accepts that global tax reforms mean it may have to pay more taxes in different countries, excerpts of a speech he is due to deliver in Germany on Saturday show.
Cross-border tax rules are set to be rewritten after 137 states sought last month to avoid a new trade war over the global multiplication of taxes on digital services, prompted by some countries preparing to go it alone.
""I understand that there's frustration about how tech companies are taxed in Europe. We also want tax reform and I’m glad the OECD is looking at this,"" Zuckerberg is expected to tell the Munich Security Conference.
""We want the OECD process to succeed so that we have a stable and reliable system going forward. And we accept that may mean we have to pay more tax and pay it in different places under a new framework,"" he added.
Amazon (O:AMZN), Facebook and Google (O:GOOGL) have strained existing rules because they are able to book profits in low-tax countries like Ireland, no matter where their customers are.
Government officials agreed last month to negotiate new rules for where tax should be paid and what share of profit should be taxed, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said.
EUROPEAN VISIT
A growing number of countries are preparing national digital taxes in the absence of a major redrafting of the rules, despite Washington's threat of retaliatory trade tariffs because it sees such levies as discriminatory against big U.S tech groups.
Zuckerberg's speech excerpts gave no further details on tax rates. Facebook says it pays all the tax it should and that this has averaged more than 20% over the last five years.
In Britain, Facebook paid just 28.5 million pounds ($37.2 million) in corporation tax in 2018, despite generating a record 1.65 billion pounds in British sales, media reports said.
Tax officials have only a few months ahead of an early July deadline they set for a deal on the complex technical parameters. They aim to reach a full deal by the end of 2020. 
During his visit to Europe, Zuckerberg is due to meet the EU's digital and industry chiefs on Monday.

That comes two days before European Competition and Digital Commissioner Margrethe Vestager and Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton are set to announce the creation of a single European data market aimed at challenging the dominance of U.S. tech giants such as Facebook, Google and Amazon.

Volkswagen said it is replacing the coal-fired power stations with gas turbine plants, a step which will help cut VW factory's carbon dioxide emissions by 60%, equivalent to the emissions of 870,000 cars. 

Seven out of the ten biggest carbon-dioxide polluters in Europe are coal-fired power stations in Germany, Volkswagen said.

Investing.com -- When most people think of renewable, sustainable energy, it’s a wind turbine or a field of solar panels that comes into the mind first, and certainly not the creaking nuclear reactors and famously pampered staff of Electricite de France.
It may be time to reassess that view of EdF.
Europe’s biggest electricity supplier has been a chronic underperformer. It’s lost two-thirds of its value over the last 10 years, weighed down by the costs of maintaining old reactors and developing new ones. But it’s risen 25% in less than a month since the French government proposed a wholesale market pricing formula that underpins the shaky economics of the nuclear fleet, allowing management and investors to pay more attention to its growing renewable business.
Growing renewables isn’t just necessary to make sure that France meets its CO2 targets under the Paris Accord (and French state-controlled energy companies have a unique responsibility not to undermine the most recent showpiece of French diplomacy). It’s also necessary to make sure that EDF (PA:EDF) gets the highest rating it can under increasingly influential Environmental and Social Governance (ESG) benchmarks. Assets under management at ESG-indexed funds are growing at over 20%, well ahead of the overall industry, according to various studies.
EDF (PA:EDF) already boasts a bunch of high ESG ratings, having started from a strong position as the biggest producer of hydropower across Europe with over 26,000 megawatts of installed capacity. But it is rapidly adding to that. Last year, it doubled the scope of renewable projects under construction to 5,000 megawatts (even if actual renewable output fell slightly due to some portfolio reshuffling).
It has secured some 2,000 hectares of land for solar development, and its acquisition in November of U.K.-based Pivot Power – a maker of batteries designed to be connected to the high-voltage grid - bolstered its position in the crucial growth field of storage. Pivot Power has plans for 2,000 MW of batteries to be installed in the U.K., starting this year, which would put EDF (PA:EDF) well on the way to its target of 10,000 MW of extra storage capacity by 2035.
Like most utilities across Europe, the company is also positioning for real growth for the first time in living memory, as transportation switches from oil-based fuel to electricity. The company said on Thursday it will buy Pod Point, a U.K.-based maker of charging infrastructure for electric vehicles, through a joint venture with insurer Legal & General in a deal that values the start up at over 100 million pounds ($130 million).
It will still be a long time before EDF (PA:EDF) is completely free of the burden of its nuclear obligations. But – as with Germany’s RWE (DE:RWEG) and Italy’s   Enel   (MI:ENEI) - it has a privileged position in a large domestic market that it can leverage to build up a formidable portfolio of green assets - a portfolio whose latent value can then one day be unlocked via a spin-off.
EDF (PA:EDF) has been late to a sectoral rally driven by climate change concerns. Its nuclear issues mean that even after a 25% rise, EDF stock is valued at barely half of one year’s sales and 8.5 times 2019 earnings. Even with the caveat that its unique strategic importance will always leave free shareholders at the mercy of the French government, it doesn’t take too much imagination to see how that valuation might change very quickly."

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese government employee Jin Yang returned to work in Beijing this week to find his usual workplace rules upended as China battles a coronavirus epidemic. 
His office has banned the practice of eating lunch in its canteen with colleagues, in favor of boxed meals, packaged in house and eaten at desks, he said.
""It's anything but normal,"" the 28-year-old told Reuters.
Meetings are held online, instead of in person. Employees must wear masks all day and report their temperatures twice a day. 
Jin is one of millions of workers who began streaming back this week from Lunar New Year holidays extended by 10 days in China's struggle to rein in the virus, which has killed 1,380 people and infected nearly 64,000.
But streets and subways are largely deserted in major cities such as Beijing, the capital, and the business hub of Shanghai, with many shops and restaurants empty or shut, while lots of office employees work from home.As many places still enforce containment measures, companies are adopting rules to prevent infection and banish employees' fears of catching it, such as keeping them as widely separated as possible.
Not all companies have resumed work. Many that have are asking employees returning from trips overseas or other provinces to quarantine themselves at home for up to 14 days. 
A manager at one foreign multinational said staff were concerned, particularly after China's tough step in locking down Wuhan, the central city of 11 million people where the outbreak began.
""They want no contact,"" said the manager, who sought anonymity as she was not authorized to speak to media.
""Some want people to sit with empty chairs between them at meetings, toilet visits to be assigned at staggered times, and no sharing of the water dispenser,"" she added, listing the precautions staff want followed. 
Chinese media have posted photographs of office canteens where plastic sheets and wooden boards divide up tables to form segregated dining cubicles. 
An industrial zone in the central city of Changsha has started using unmanned robots to deliver meals, the state-run People's Daily newspaper said. 
Automaker GAC (SS:601238), which has joint ventures with Toyota (T:7203) and Honda (T:7267), said no more than half its employees are allowed to work each day at its headquarters in the southern city of Guangzhou, with lunchtimes divided into four slots of 15 minutes each.
It also rearranged its canteen, and shifted tables to an outdoor terrace, with each spaced 2 meters (7 ft) apart. It has also swapped its previous buffet service for a menu of pre-arranged options.
E-commerce firm  Pinduoduo  (O:PDD) said its employees must complete a daily health-check form. It disinfects offices at least twice a day, and provides meals for everyone to minimize exposure. 
On the Weibo messaging app, the term ""hardcore armor for returning to work"" has drawn 140 million views, with users sharing safety tips, using videos and pictures.

Some images showed people wearing motorcycle helmets at their desks with others in costumes similar to space suits traveling on public transport and some in homemade protective gear fashioned from plastic bottles.

Nissan on Thursday cut its annual operating profit forecast by 43%. Sources said plans to slash jobs, close manufacturing sites and drop products have been already prompted, as the automaker steps back from an aggressive pursuit of market share championed by former leader Carlos Ghosn.
In addition to Nissan Korea's plans for voluntary redundancy, some of its around 60 employees have already submitted letters of resignation, the person said, declining to be identified as the issue was sensitive.
""We are committed to driving an efficient organization to take us on a growth path together. As such, we are carefully reviewing our operations setup. We are currently not in the position to share more details. Our primary focus remains providing great products and the highest levels of sales and services to our valued customers,"" Nissan said in a statement.
On top of a dim earnings outlook and restructuring at Japan's No. 2 automaker, Nissan's South Korean business has also suffered from a diplomatic row between the two countries that has led to consumer boycotts and efforts by Seoul to cut the economy's reliance on imports from Japan.
In South Korea, Nissan Korea sold 3,049 Nissan brand vehicles in 2019, down 40% from 5,053 vehicles a year earlier, and 2,000 Infiniti vehicles in 2019, down 6% from 2,130 vehicles a year earlier, according to auto registration data from Korea Automobile Importers & Distributors Association."

24,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2020 04:21AM ET</span>",Carney says business must come clean quickly on climate,"By Alessandra Galloni
LONDON (Reuters) - Bank of England Governor Mark Carney called on the world's businesses to publish strategies for cutting carbon emissions and adopting cleaner power sources by November, when world leaders meet in Scotland for U.N.-led climate talks.
""It's not just green assets and divestment campaigns or certain things are so brown or black. Every company ultimately has to have a plan for a transition and what the opportunities are and where the risks are,"" Carney said in an interview. 
""For Glasgow that must be well on the path. That is the norm. That the question doesn’t even have to be asked because companies are answering that question as part of their strategy.
""And the answer is, it’s the transition, stupid,"" he said, referencing a phrase coined by former U.S. President Bill Clinton’s election strategist in reference to the U.S. economy.
Carney was speaking to Reuters a month before he leaves his nearly seven-year posting at the helm of Britain's central bank to take a new role as the United Nations' envoy for climate. 
The Canadian banker, who disarmed the British insurance industry in 2015 when, in a speech called ""Tragedy of the Horizon,"" he warned of their exposure to climate-related events, has been one of the most vocal public figures to push for better supervision and disclosure of climate risk. 
The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which he launched in 2015, has become a global standard that more than 1,000 companies, financial firms, governments and other organizations have adhered to. 
The intentions behind it also chime with a shift of emphasis by another leading central banker, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde.
In her second rate-setting meeting since succeeding Mario Draghi, Lagarde last month launched a broad policy review that plans to incorporate the economic impact of climate change into its monetary framework for the first time.
For the time being, the TCFD remains voluntary, and it can be hard to compare and verify the claims of disclosures.
So hammering out a common set of global reference points on climate-related disclosures is seen by many as a crucial step to helping investors allocate capital more effectively.
MANAGING THE RISKS
Money would flow to those companies managing the risks - and therefore likely to perform better in the transition to a low-carbon economy - and away from those in danger of being impacted more severely.
Carney said November's COP26 climate talks would also be a good deadline for regulators to map out how to make the TCFD framework compulsory. 
""One of the things we will look at ahead at for the COP26 is 'should we have pathways to make the TCFD mandatory?' Not overnight, but through listing requirements or securities regulation disclosure standards,"" he said.
Such an effort needs to be global, Carney said, encompassing regions laying out their own plans for cutting emissions. The European Union recently announced a 1-trillion-euro ($1.08 trillion) effort become carbon neutral by 2050, a strategy that includes introducing a new climate law by next month.
""It would be productive if other jurisdictions that potentially will have mandatory disclosure standards... used more conventional routes than legislation, such as securities regulations or listing standards. Let’s have that conversation,"" Carney said.
Carney could play an outsized role at November's summit, especially in view of a reshuffle of government and other senior positions by Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
Johnson last month sacked former energy minister Claire O’Neill from her role as president of the COP26 talks. Newly appointed Business Minister Alok Sharma was named to the position on Thursday.
Efforts by businesses, investors and financial institutions to disclose climate risk are gathering pace. 
BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), the world's largest money manager with nearly $7 trillion in assets under management, said this month that it would take a tougher view of companies that are not properly disclosing their climate risk.
This week,  BP  (LON:BP) set out one of the oil sector's most ambitious targets for curbing carbon emissions, saying it would reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. BP plans to give details later this year.

""Last week, very few people would have said BP was Paris-aligned,"" said Carney, referring to the 2015 global climate agreement, signed in the French capital. ""They've jumped from towards back of the queue to the front of the queue.""

Japan's No.2 automaker is reeling from a scandal surrounding former chairman Carlos Ghosn that has also had a knock-on effect on its French partner  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), shares of which hit their lowest in more than seven years after it earlier posted its first annual loss in a decade.
Nissan on Thursday posted its first quarterly net loss in almost ten years and warned that full-year operating profit would be its weakest in 11 years. It also slashed its full-year dividend outlook to the lowest since 2011.
""It is too early for a halt in the downward trend in Nissan's share price in this environment,"" Jefferies analyst Takaki Nakanishi wrote in a note to clients following the results on Thursday.
Nissan shares closed down 9.6% at 513.7 yen in Tokyo on Friday, the lowest since mid-2009 and the biggest one-day fall since 2013. 
The sell-off since Ghosn's arrest over financial misconduct allegations in November 2018 has wiped out nearly half the market value of both Nissan and Renault.
The automaker's dividend cut will be particularly painful for top shareholder Renault, which in turn said it would cut its dividend for 2019. 

The financial performance of the two automakers is deeply intertwined, as a chunk of Renault's net profit comprises contributions from Nissan. In 2019, Nissan contributed just 242 million euros to Renault, a drop of 84% from the previous year and its lowest input since 2009.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian shares inched higher on Friday, on course to post the second straight week of gains, helped by hopes governments will make provisions to soften the impact on their economies from the coronavirus epidemic.
European shares are expected to rise, with pan-European Euro Stoxx 50 futures (STXEc1) up 0.21%, German DAX futures (FDXc1) adding 0.3% and FTSE futures (FFIc1) ticking up 0.21%.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) ticked up 0.25% on Friday for weekly gain of 1.77%.
China's blue-chip CSI300 shares (CSI300) rose 0.69%, having recovered a whopping 95% of their losses made after the outbreak.
The index of Chinext high-tech shares rose 0.8% to hit a two-year intraday high, led by gains in some biotech names.
""China is already easing its monetary policy and providing more liquidity while more stimulus is likely. Factories are starting to reopen albeit with some delays,"" said Yukino Yamada, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities.
Japan's Nikkei (N225) dropped 0.59%, not helped by the news of first coronavirus death and signs of a potential rise in domestic infections in the country.
On Wall Street on Thursday, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 0.16% but its futures (ESc1) gained 0.23% in subsequent Asian trade to hit record levels.
The daily death toll in Hubei, the Chinese province at the center of the coronavirus outbreak, halved and the number of new cases dropped from a record posted the day before.
Ryutaro Kimura, fixed income strategist at AXA Investment Managers, expected ""considerable impact"" on the global economy as China now accounts for around 17% compared to 4% during the SARS outbreak in 2002-2003, and it is integral to more supply chains.
""That means countries are likely to keep interest rates low for a longer period, keeping global bond yields low. Such an expectation in turn is supporting the world's share prices.""
Market sentiment improved also after World Health Organization official said the big jump in China's reported cases reflects a decision by authorities there to reclassify a backlog of suspected cases by using patients' chest images, and is not necessarily the ""tip of an iceberg"" of a wider epidemic.
Still, sceptics saw it as undermining confidence in data accuracy, a constant issue in Chinese data.
While many investors hope the epidemic will gradually slow down in coming months, allowing companies to come back to normal operations, how long that process will take remains anybody's guess.

An early end to this seems improbable,"" said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.

It also hit a nine-week low against the British pound and 4-1/2 year low against the Swiss franc.
The euro has been bruised also by rising political uncertainties in Germany as well as worries about sluggish growth in the region.
Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who had been long expected to succeed Chancellor Angela Merkel next year, earlier this week gave up her bid to run for the top job, raising more concerns about political stability in the euro zone's biggest economy.

The pound traded at $1.3045 , after 0.65% gains on Thursday.
The 10-year gilts yield jumped to a three-week high of 0.660% (GB10YT=RR), bucking falling yields in most other major bond markets.
The yen stayed in a familiar range in the past couple of weeks and last traded at 109.80 yen .
Oil prices extended their week-old recovery on hopes that the world's biggest producers would cut output more as demand looks set to drop sharply due to the outbreak of coronavirus.

The resignation comes less than two years after Lee's appointment split the chairman and chief executive roles for the first time in an effort to enhance transparency and independence of the world's top memory chip manufacturer in the wake of a corruption scandal involving group heir Jay Y. Lee.
""Samsung suffered a major setback to its bid to strengthen its board ... and it would need a fresh face to turn around,"" said Park Ju-gun, head of research firm CEO Score, adding that the move was widely expected given that Lee Sang-hoon is in prison.
Samsung said Lee's successor will be appointed in the near future and could be picked from remaining members of its board, which consists of six external directors and three internal executives. Those include the three CEOs of Samsung's components, mobiles and consumer electronics divisions. 
The change at the top comes as Jay Y. Lee faces trial on charges that he bribed a friend of former president Park Geun-hye to win government favor over succession planning at the conglomerate.
Criticized by a judge overseeing Lee's bribery case for its lack of an effective compliance system, Samsung and some of its key affiliates have recently appointed external experts to a new oversight panel to stamp out criminal conduct. 
Lee Sang-hoon was given a 1-1/2 year jail sentence in December for sabotaging legitimate union activities. He has appealed against the decision.
Samsung's board chairman is not involved in day-to-day business operations but chairs a board meeting to review and approve major business decisions including investment plans. 

The company is expected to hold a shareholder meeting in March.

Investing.com - European stock markets pushed lower Friday, with early gains overturned by losses in index heavyweights RBS (LON:RBS),   Renault   (PA:RENA) and AstraZeneca (LON:AZN).
At 03:50 ET (0840 GMT), the U.K.'s FTSE index was trading 16 points, or 0.2%, lower, France's CAC 40 was down 11 points, also a 0.2% drop, while the DAX was largely flat. The pan-eurozone index, the Euro Stoxx 50 was down less than 0.1%. 
Shares in British banking group RBS (LON:RBS) slumped 5% despite reporting earnings significantly above expectations early Friday, prompting it to announce a special dividend after group net profit soared to 4.2 billion pounds. 
RBS (LON:RBS), which plans to change its name to NatWest as part of a “new era”, dialed down its returns expectations while also announcing restructuring costs and a 200 million pound regulatory hit.
 Renault  (PA:RENA) also suffered, its shares dropping 4% after the French car maker posted an annual loss of 141 million euros ($153 million) - its first in 10 years - cut its dividend and warned that auto demand remained volatile. This follows Nissan, in which Renault is a major shareholder, cutting its annual profit forecast and canceling its dividend for the second half of the year.
AstraZeneca shares (LON:AZN) dropped 1.5% after its core operating profit fell in the final quarter of the year, missing expectations. The British-Swedish pharmaceutical giant also warned of the impact on its business of the coronavirus outbreak.
German payments company Wirecard (DE:WDIG) meanwhile reiterated its guidance for core profits this year, implying growth of 34%, after notching another solid rise in earnings and revenue, despite the ongoing controversy over its accounting practices. Its shares dropped just 0.1%, outperforming the wider market.
News surrounding the Covid-19 virus outbreak continues to keep markets on edge, although officials tried to play down a big jump in China's count of patients and victims this week.
The World Health Organization said that reflects a decision by authorities there to reclassify a backlog of suspected cases by using patients' chest images, and is not necessarily the ""tip of an iceberg"" of a wider epidemic.
Still, doubts remain over the accuracy of these figures, with the White House calling on Beijing to be more transparent over its handling of the outbreak.
In economic news, fourth-quarter growth figures for the euro zone are scheduled for release at 5:00 AM ET (1000 GMT). The German release, earlier Friday, came in flat on the quarter, instead of the 0.1% gain expected, and doesn’t bode well for the broader number.
Elsewhere, the oil market traded in a calm fashion Friday, with all eyes on Russia to see whether it agrees to go along with the rest of the OPEC bloc and participate in deeper production cuts.
AT 3:45 AM ET (0845 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% higher at $51.48 a barrel and the international benchmark Brent contract was up 0.1% at $56.39.

HSBC, which employs 21,000 people in Hong Kong, on Friday revealed one of its employees has been placed under government quarantine after “close contact” with relatives diagnosed with the coronavirus. The bank is contacting staff who may have recently come in close contact with the individual, and will advise them to observe 14-day self-care at home, according to a memo sent to staff, which was confirmed by a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman.
“All employees have been reminded to be mindful of hygiene procedures and to stay at home or see a doctor if they feel unwell in any way,” the spokeswoman said. “HSBC will continue to closely monitor the development of the case and stay in close contact with health authorities.”
Oil giant Shell sent some staff from its trading desks in Singapore home after an employee was found to have had contact with a coronavirus case, according to people familiar with the matter. Part of the company’s trading desks were already working remotely as part of a contingency plan, but now all will need to work from home.
Companies in Hong Kong and Singapore have begun taking heightened cautionary measures from closing bank branches, to temperature checks and to having employees work from home or alternative sites as well as self-quarantining to protect staff. Recessions are now threatening the two financial hubs, which have seen the largest number of confirmed cases outside China, excluding an outbreak on a cruise ship quarantined in Yokohama, Japan.
The virus has so far killed more than 1,300 people, mainly in mainland China. Hong Kong has reported one death and 53 confirmed cases. Singapore has 58 confirmed cases.
The HSBC employee has been under self-care since Wednesday after appearing at the bank’s main office in central Hong Kong for three days from the end of January. The person also visited another office in Tseung Kwan O, an area in eastern Hong Kong, earlier this month and took a shuttle bus from Taikoo to Tseung Kwan O.
In an emailed statement, Shell confirmed that an employee had close contact with a coronavirus case. As a precautionary measure, the firm advised colleagues that had close contact with the employee to work from home with immediate effect until further notice, according to the statement.
Shell said its operations aren’t impacted by the development.
Other companies in Singapore’s business district have confirmed at least three infections, one of which caused DBS Group Holdings Ltd. to ask staff on Level 43 of its Marina Bay Financial Centre Tower 3 headquarters to work from home.
Recession could be a possibility in Singapore as the country battles the coronavirus outbreak, the Straits Times reported, citing comments from Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.
MUFG Employee
Japan’s Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (T:8306) also quarantined an employee at home in Hong Kong after a family member was suspected of being infected, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. The employee, who works at the Quarry Bay office, is not infected. As a precautionary measure, other colleagues in the same office were also quarantined until further notice, according to a memo seen by Bloomberg.
Along with other banks, HSBC is rolling out relief measures to help Hong Kongers cope with the virus outbreak that is weighing on the city’s retail and tourism industries. Europe’s biggest finance company by market value said on Sunday it’s providing more than HK$30 billion ($3.9 billion) in liquidity relief to its business customers and announced other measures Thursday to ease the financial burden on personal customers."
31,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2020 02:46AM ET</span>",Cruise industry gives Asia a wide berth as it seeks to limit coronavirus risks,"By Chayut Setboonsarng
BANGKOK (Reuters) - The plight of the cruise ship off Japan with more than 200 coronavirus infections and the shunning of another by five ports despite no known cases has led to a sharp change in tack for an industry in shock: avoid Asia.
To that end, many cruises in the region are being canceled while others currently sailing are being re-routed, skipping originally scheduled stops in China, Hong Kong and Singapore.
 Royal Caribbean  Cruises Ltd (N:RCL) on Thursday canceled 18 cruises in Southeast Asia after calling off eight trips to China last week. It joined industry leader Carnival Corp (N:CCL) (L:CCL) in warning that full-year earnings would be hit by the epidemic.
""It is important that every organization acts responsibly, and we have already taken aggressive steps to minimize risk through boarding restrictions and itinerary changes,"" CEO Richard Fain said in a statement.
The flu-like virus has so far claimed 1,380 lives with the total number of infections at more than 63,000, most of them in China.
Asia accounts for just some 10% of the global cruise industry, according to the Cruise Lines International Association.
But the fear is that the negative headlines generated by the predicament of the Diamond Princess ship off Japan - the location of the most new coronavirus infections outside China - as well as by the two-week shunning of the MS Westerdam will spill over to the entire industry.
""While the early impact due to concerns about the coronavirus is mainly related to Asia, recent bookings for our broader business have also been softer,"" Royal Caribbean said in its statement.
The Cruise Lines International Association said it was confident in its members' ""resilience and ability to overcome current challenges over the long-term"".
RESCHEDULED STOPS
Ships re-routing include the Cunard Line's Queen Mary 2, owned by Carnival, which has canceled a stop in Singapore scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday, and is sailing straight to Fremantle, Australia.
Another Cunard ship, the Queen Elizabeth, called off stops in Hong Kong and Shanghai through April 4. Its revised itinerary has yet to be announced.
Both Royal Caribbean and Carnival have introduced enhanced safety measures, denying permission to board to planned guests who have been through mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau in the preceding two weeks and initiating mandatory health screenings of other guests who may be at risk due to their travel history.
The Norwegian Spirit liner will no longer conclude its March cruise in Singapore but will end in Greece, and its Asia itineraries from April through Dec. 2020 have also been canceled, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (N:NCLH) said.
Similarly, P&O Cruises' Arcadia liner has removed stops in Shanghai and Hong Kong in March, although it has yet to announce alternative ports.
Fears about the impact of the outbreak have driven sharp slides in the shares of the industry's top three liners, which together had some $34 billion in revenue in 2018.
Both Carnival and Royal Caribbean have seen their shares lose about 15% for the year to date, while Norwegian Cruise Line has fallen 8.5%.
The MS Westerdam was finally allowed to dock in Cambodia on Thursday and passengers began disembarking on Friday.
The Diamond Princess cruise ship, also owned by Carnival and which has been quarantined since it arrived in Yokohama on Feb. 3, now has 218 cases among its 3,500 passengers and crew."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Leaning on its SARS experience, Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (HK:0293) has slashed flights, asked staff to take unpaid leave and is re-assessing its fleet as it battles an epidemic and a crisis of morale after pro-democracy protests.
Planes are parked unused at its home airport, flights across its network like Rome and Washington have been canceled because of low demand, and the airline is temporarily closing some of its premium lounges.
Cathay used a similar playbook during previous shocks, including the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic and the global financial crisis, both of which it rebounded from relatively quickly.
This time, though, Cathay was already dealing with an internal crisis before the virus hit.
Last year, it fired dozens of employees sympathetic to widespread anti-government protests in the city, and its two top executives resigned after criticism from China.
That means there is less goodwill among staff being asked to take three weeks of unpaid leave, six employees told Reuters on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak with media.
""No one is lining up to personally sacrifice for this company - not anymore,"" a Cathay pilot said. ""We have all seen how quickly the company and economy recover from these things, and in hindsight they are but a blip on the timeline of Cathay's business.""
The carrier is the most-exposed airline outside mainland China to falling demand caused by the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which has killed more than 1,300 people and sickened more than 60,000.
Before the coronavirus hit, Cathay had a strong balance sheet, with powerful backers in major shareholders Swire Pacific Ltd (HK:0019), Air China Ltd (SS:601111) and Qatar Airways.
Local rival Hong Kong Airlines is on the brink of financial collapse, according to analysts, which could benefit Cathay in the long run.
At this week's Singapore Airshow, attendees said they were confident Cathay could weather the viral storm - even though some customers and corporate clients are avoiding even a transit at Hong Kong's airport as countries extend quarantine requirements.
""I think people are mindful it may be a very sharp shock, but the recovery could be equally impressive,"" said Andrew Herdman, the director general of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines and a former Cathay executive.
CASH IS KING
During a crisis, lack of cash flow can quickly become a problem for carriers, as many of their assets, such as planes, have fixed costs but are idle and no longer bringing in revenue.
""We don't know how long this will last,"" Cathay chief executive Augustus Tang told staff in a video last week seen by Reuters. ""With such an uncertain outlook, preserving our cash is now the key to protecting our business.""
The number of customers seeking refunds has skyrocketed, with the airline emailing those affected, including some air show delegates, to tell them reimbursement could take up to six weeks.
""They are in a massive world of pain,"" said an air show attendee with knowledge of the company, who was not authorized to speak to the media.
Cathay already in November deferred the delivery of four Airbus SE (PA:AIR) narrowbodies because of the downturn associated with the protests. The airline said at the time it had planned to receive 17 new planes from Airbus this year, 7 of them A350 widebodies.
It is now trying to negotiate the early return of some of its leased  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 777-300ER planes, according to a person familiar with the plans, as it focuses on operating more fuel-efficient A350s. Boeing's delays in certifying the larger 777X means Cathay can also put off taking delivery of those aircraft, which it has already ordered.
""We are continuously assessing our fleet and aircraft deployment in order to best align capacity with market demand,"" Cathay said in a statement.
Airbus and Boeing executives at the air show said they understood the need to be flexible.
""We stay very close to our customers,"" Airbus head of marketing Francois Caudron told reporters. ""Some of them are really suffering.""
Cathay has cut 90% of its passenger flights to mainland China and 30% of capacity across its global network through the end of March.
When Cathay encouraged unpaid leave during SARS and the global financial crisis, it eventually repaid most of the lost wages to staff when business recovered, employee sources said.
But with some flights to mainland China continuing despite staff concerns, some crew members said they felt the company was prioritizing revenue over their well being.
""The morale is bad,"" said a flight attendant at Cathay's regional arm, Cathay Dragon, which is now handling all of its mainland China flights. ""It is just like a wound that will never recover."""

Photos of the handwritten sign saying ""lavatory for crew members only"" went viral in South Korea this week after a passenger on a 10-hour flight from Amsterdam to Seoul's Incheon airport on Monday shared the images online.
The passenger accused KLM of discriminating against South Korean passengers because the sign was only in Korean.
""Dear KLM... Today, you made it quite clear that you discriminate against race. Using Corona Virus as an excuse. You owe my friend and Korea a HUGE apology,"" wrote one Twitter user, whose posts in English and Korean about the incident gathered thousands of retweets and likes.
The hashtag BoycottKLM was trending on Korean Twitter.
On Friday, executives with KLM bowed as they publicly apologized at a news conference in Seoul, saying they take allegations of discrimination ""very seriously"" and promising to prevent it from happening again.
""This is a human mistake, and we don't take it lightly,"" said Guillaume Glass, an Air France-KLM regional general manager. ""We are deeply sorry that this was viewed as discrimination, which was absolutely not the intention of the crew.""
The crew said using only Korean on the sign was simply an oversight. An English notice was added after passengers complained, Glass said.
It is not KLM policy to reserve lavatories for crew, he added.
On Wednesday, South Korea's transportation ministry released a statement warning KLM over its ""discriminatory measures"" and calling on the company to ensure it didn't happen again.
At a previously scheduled meeting on Friday, Dutch Ambassador Joanne Doornewaard expressed regrets over the incident to Transportation Minister Kim Hyun-mee, a ministry official told Reuters."

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. taps Wall Street for funds to turn them into reality. Banks pocket millions in fees. And rather than punish the company for diluting its shareholders, the market sends the stock higher.
The virtuous circle has enabled Tesla to raise about $14 billion over the last decade, supporting the electric-car maker through countless ups and downs. The latest offering, announced Thursday, boosted Tesla’s market capitalization to almost $146 billion, behind only Toyota Motor Corp. among the world’s most valuable auto manufacturers.
While Tesla watchers have seen this movie before, the latest script was full of twist and turns. Musk, 48, said during an earnings call two weeks ago that it didn’t make sense for the company to raise capital again. The maker of the Model 3 sedan has been spending money sensibly, he said, without holding back expenditures that would inhibit progress.
But the ascent Tesla’s stock has been on in recent months evidently changed the chief executive officer’s mind. Tesla will use the proceeds -- at least $2 billion -- from the offering to shore up its balance sheet and help fund Musk’s seemingly endless aspirations.
After Musk and Chief Financial Officer Zach Kirkhorn demurred weeks ago when asked how much spending Tesla had planned for this year, the company disclosed earlier Thursday that its budget will be as much as $3.5 billion, more than double last year’s.
Chinese banks are footing much of the bill for the factory Musk just opened near Shanghai, but he’s also already planning to build his next one near Berlin and teasing the possibility of another one going up in Texas.
Tesla is no longer a tiny niche player that makes cool-but-expensive cars only in high-cost California, but getting to this point required taking on about $12.5 billion of debt, double the amount of cash and equivalents it had at year end.
“Musk had previously assured investors that he did not plan to raise additional capital,” Gene Munster, managing partner of Loup Ventures, said in a report. “However, while Elon backpedaling on his promises is a common criticism of Tesla, the company’s balance sheet is a much more common (and valid) criticism.”
Tesla’s stock has more than tripled since the company released the first of two positive quarterly earnings reports. Musk has accelerated the production schedule for the Model Y, the crossover SUV that he sees becoming the company’s new top seller.
But the Model Y isn’t expected to contribute significantly to deliveries in the first few months of the year, and Kirkhorn has cautioned that first-quarter sales probably will slow down because of seasonality. Production in China also was temporarily halted due to the coronavirus, and ramping up output of Model 3s there and Model Ys in California is expected to pinch profit margins.
Tesla managed to time its latest offering before any of those risks weighed on the stock ahead of its next earnings report. The company is selling the shares at $767 apiece, according to a person familiar with the matter -- a 4.6% discount to Thursday’s close.
With all that Musk has planned -- eventually rolling out the Semi, Roadster and Cybertruck models and recommitting to a foundering rooftop-solar business -- some investors and analysts think the company should try to raise enough money so that it’s really done needing to seek more from now on.
While the amount the company has taken in during the last decade is significant, it’s not unprecedented. Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). took in about $15 billion in the same span, almost entirely from debt offerings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
“We have long wanted Tesla to raise a large amount of cash via stock issuance due to its lofty valuation and then perhaps never need to raise capital again,” David Whiston, a Morningstar Inc. analyst, said in a note. “We’d like to see more consistency between the company’s actions and the words of CEO Elon Musk.”

SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian investigator who helped bring criminal cartel charges against  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) told a court he met agents from another regulator in a cafe to discuss the matter but the talks were ""high level"" only.
Citi, Deutsche, their client Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (AX:ANZ) and several of their current and former executives are accused of forming an agreement during an A$2.5 billion ($1.7 billion) ANZ stock issue to withhold selling unwanted shares to prevent them from falling when they hit the market in 2015.
In pre-trial hearings, lawyers for the banks and their staff have suggested witnesses for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), which brought the charges in Australia's biggest white collar criminal case, relied on evidence that was tainted by outside influences and pressure from above.
ACCC enforcement director Michael Taylor was asked on Friday about a meeting with two investigators from another regulator, corporate watchdog the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) in a Sydney cafe in early 2016, more than two years before charges were laid.
""They would have told me they where they were at,"" Taylor told the packed Sydney court room, referring to the cafe meeting.
""They might have said, 'we have' or 'we are about to issue notice,"" he added, referring to notices which ASIC issued to the banks telling them they were under investigation.
Taylor denied ""careful coordination"" with ASIC, and said his meetings with its investigators were ""very short"" and ""at a very high level"". ASIC did not specify who they had issued notices on, other than the corporate entities, he added.
Asked if he had requested ASIC get him recordings of two August 2015 conference calls between the bankers in which they allegedly discussed the share sale, evidence at the heart of the case, Taylor said, ""it could have been discussed"".
""I just heard that they had done this. I didn't ask them to do it,"" he told the court.
Asked why he had not kept an email or other record of the cafe meeting, Taylor said the ACCC ""team knew I was meeting with them. There were lots of things that weren't necessary to put in an email.""
The case is being closely watched by investment bankers around the world because it could have implications on the way they are allowed to run share sales. If found guilty, the banks face hefty fines while the individuals face prison time.
A year and a half since the charges were brought, the matter is still at a pre-trial stage and none of the accused has entered a formal plea, although all have said they will plead not guilty.
The hearings continue."

Personal income tax changes proposed in the federal budget earlier this month were followed by the central bank’s steps to relax bad-loan rules for some small borrowers and easing reserve requirements for some lending. The measures aim to help ease a slump in consumer demand in an economy that is poised to grow at its slowest pace in a decade.
Of the 48 Nifty companies that have announced results so far, 21 have either met or exceeded analyst estimates. Crude producer Oil and Natural Gas Corp Ltd. is scheduled to announce results today, the last day for company earnings. Yes Bank Ltd. has postponed its results until March 14 as it negotiates with potential investors for raising funds.

Investing.com -  Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.  (T:7201)’s shares in Japan slumped 9.5% on Friday in Asia after the Japanese automaker reported its first quarterly loss since 2009.
 
For its latest three-month period, Nissan posted an operating profit of 23 billion yen, compared with the estimated 59 billion yen. Quarterly sales fell 18% to 2.5 trillion yen, also missing analysts’ prediction for 2.7 trillion yen.
 
The company said it is cutting its full-year profit outlook to 85 billion yen, down from an earlier estimate of 150 billion yen. Nissan also scrapped its year-end dividend payout to investors.
 
“Unfortunately, our business performance has worsened more than we anticipated, and there’s no letting up on investing in the future,” Chief Executive Officer Makoto Uchida said at a press conference. “In order to invest in growth, we ended up with this dividend.”
 
The company’s share prices last traded at 514 yen, their lowest on an intraday basis since July 2009.

Woodside and FAR said on Friday an International Chamber of Commerce panel had ruled that FAR did not have a pre-emptive right to match the offer for the 35% stake in the Sangomar project that ConocoPhillips sold to Woodside in 2016 for just $350 million.
FAR said it was reviewing the arbitration award. It holds a separate 15% stake in the Sangomar project, which also counts  Cairn Energy  Plc (L:CNE) as a stakeholder.
FAR's shares fell as much as 9% to 3.1 cents, their lowest level since the middle of 2013, on the news that it would miss out on the chance to potentially raise its stake in Sangomar for a comparatively low price, or win compensation.
At that level the shares were also well below the 4.25 cents apiece that investors paid in a recent issue of new stock by the company.
The resolution of the case comes just as Woodside and its partners have begun development of the Sangomar project, following final investment decisions in January, with first production expected in 2023.
FAR, which discovered the Sangomar field in the world's largest oil find of 2014, disputed Woodside's acquisition of its stake in the acreage, arguing it was not allowed to exercise its right to pre-empt the sale of Conoco's stake.ConocoPhillips and Woodside, now operator of the project, had maintained that FAR's challenge was without merit.
""Woodside is committed to working ... to progress the Sangomar Field Development, which achieved final investment decision in January 2020,"" Woodside said in a statement on the tribunal's ruling on Friday.
ConocoPhillips had no immediate comment.
Analysts had thought that if FAR won the arbitration, it might get some form of compensation from Conoco or Woodside which would have helped the minnow fund its share of Sangomar development costs.
""While disappointing for FAR, we think it remains in a reasonable position with respect to its forward funding profile albeit this as come at the cost of significant equity value dilution,"" RBC analysts said in a note.
The company raised A$157 million ($105 million) in December through the sale of new shares to help cover its $480 million portion of Sangomar development costs. It plans to cover the rest of its costs by taking on debt."

CannTrust fired Aceto from the top role in July last year and named Robert Marcovitch as the interim CEO, more than two weeks after Canadian health regulator's findings.
The regulator had canceled CannTrust's license to produce and sell cannabis in September last year, pushing the company to announce reductions in its workforce to recoup losses.
The company said on Thursday it anticipates remediation activities at the company's Vaughan facility to reach completion during the second quarter of 2020.
""No assurance can be given that Health Canada will reinstate either the Niagara or Vaughan Facility licenses"", CannTrust said in a statement.
Health Canada's rating for the Vaughan plant was based on an inspection between July 10 and July 16. The regulator noted that five rooms, converted from operational areas, were used for storage since June 2018 without prior approval by the regulator.
The company also said it was facing a variety of regulatory investigations and has significant contingent liabilities in both Canada and the United States, including for potential civil damages and penalties and fines."

NEW DELHI/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - India has offered to partially open up its poultry and dairy markets in a bid for a limited trade deal during U.S. President Donald Trump's first official visit to the country this month, people familiar with the protracted talks say.
India, the world's largest milk-producing nation, has traditionally restricted dairy imports to protect the livelihoods of 80 million rural households involved in the industry. 
But Prime Minister Narendra Modi is trying to pull all the stops for the U.S. president's Feb. 24-25 visit, aimed at rebuilding bonds between the world's largest democracies. 
In 2019, Trump suspended India's special trade designation that dated back to 1970s, after Modi put price caps on medical devices, such as cardiac stents and knee implants, and introduced new data localization requirements and e-commerce restrictions.
Trump's trip to India has raised hopes that he would restore some of the country's U.S. trade preferences, in exchange for tariff reductions and other concessions.
The United States is India's second-largest trade partner after China, and bilateral goods and services trade climbed to a record $142.6 billion in 2018. The United States had a $23.2 billion goods trade deficit in 2019 with India, its 9th largest trading partner in goods.
India has offered to allow imports of U.S. chicken legs, turkey and produce such as blueberries and cherries, Indian government sources said, and has offered to cut tariffs on chicken legs from 100% to 25%. U.S. negotiators want that tariff cut to 10%. The Modi government is also offering to allow some access to India's dairy market, but with a 5% tariff and quotas, the sources said. But dairy imports would need a certificate they are not derived from animals that have consumed feeds that include internal organs, blood meal or tissues of ruminants. 
New Delhi has also offered to lower its 50% tariffs on very large motorcycles made by Harley-Davidson (N:HOG), a tax that was a particular irritant for Trump, who has labeled India the ""tariff king."" The change would be largely symbolic because few such motorcycles are sold in India.
Trump will be feted in Modi's home state of Gujarat, then hold talks in New Delhi and attend a reception that the hosts have promised will be bigger than the one organized for former president Barack Obama in 2015.
ENOUGH FOR LIGHTHIZER? 
But it is far from clear whether India's offers will be enough to satisfy U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who canceled plans for a trip to India this week. Instead, he has held telephone talks with Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal. 
The U.S. dairy industry remained skeptical on Thursday that a viable deal is at hand.
""We're always looking for market access, but in terms of India, as of today I'm not aware of any real progress going on,"" said Michael Dykes, president of the International Dairy Foods Association and a member of USTR's agricultural trade policy advisory committee.
Dykes said the U.S. dairy industry was looking for access in viable commercial quantities.
A USTR spokesman and India's trade ministry did not respond to requests for comment. PRIVACY LAW COMPLICATIONS 
An Indian parliament panel is reviewing a draft data privacy law that imposes stringent controls over cross-border data flows and gives the government powers to seek user data from companies. 
It is not clear whether it will be passed, or in what form, but the possibilities have unnerved https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-dataprivacy-idUSKBN1YM0GL U.S. companies and could raise compliance requirements for Google (O:GOOG), Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), and Facebook (O:FB). 
The draft law is not part of the trade discussions, Indian officials say, because the issue is too difficult to resolve at the same time.

""The privacy and localization piece will be raised independently and in concert with the trade discussions,"" said a Washington-based source with knowledge of the U.S. administration's thinking. Trump on Tuesday was non-committal about sealing a trade deal before his visit. ""If we can make the right deal, we'll do it,"" he told reporters. Two U.S. sources said progress had been made on proposed alterations to the medical device price caps. India's new import tariffs on medical devices, walnuts, toys, electronics and other products on Feb. 1 surprised U.S. negotiators, however.. The new tariffs were aimed at China, which also makes medical devices, according to an Indian government source. ""We have to protect our market and our companies,"" the source said.

LONDON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - HSBC (L:HSBA) on Tuesday reports 2019 results and will set out its new strategy, where interim Chief Executive Noel Quinn will audition for the permanent role by announcing major restructuring efforts. Here are five key things to look out for:
1- Will Noel Quinn be confirmed as CEO?
The 57 year-old HSBC veteran has been through the world's most public job interview since being appointed interim CEO following the ouster of John Flint.
It would be odd for Chairman Mark Tucker to allow Quinn to present a new strategy if Quinn will not be the person to implement it - but media reports in the past few weeks have suggested Tucker could delay the appointment beyond Tuesday.
2- How will HSBC improve returns for shareholders?
Quinn's urgent task is to improve returns for shareholders, which have lagged HSBC's rivals in recent years.
(Graphic: HSBC one-year shareholder returns - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/2033/2001/HSBC%20returns.png)
3- How will HSBC improve its underperforming investment bank?
HSBC's global banking and markets division that contains its investment bank has been underperforming its commercial and retail banking businesses.
Quinn is expected to restructure the division that in 2018 had higher cost to income ratio and contributed a lower profit share than its two counterparts.
The bank is also cutting around 100 roles in its equities business, Reuters reported last month.
(Graphic: HSBC investment bank costs - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/2035/2003/HSBC%20costs.png)
4- Will HSBC further shrink its geographical footprint?
HSBC is in more than 50 countries across North America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia, but the latter of those regions accounted for 49% of its revenue and 90% of its profit in 2018.
The bank is now likely to accelerate efforts to boost revenues from Europe and North America, and gradually pull out from some of its low-returning markets.
    HSBC is considering leaving Turkey and may also sell or reduce its business in other markets where it is struggling to compete with local rivals, Reuters reported earlier this month.
    The bank is also likely to review its presence in some Latin American markets, a region that accounts for just 3% of its pre-tax profit.
(Graphic: Asia dominates HSBC profits - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/2036/2004/HSBC%20asia.png)
5- Will there be more cuts to senior management?
HSBC is also set to unveil a new round of job cuts targeting senior international managers at its headquarters in London and to a lesser extent in Asia.
    The bank plans to trim expenses and simplify its complicated management structure by cutting a large number of global managerial roles across all business units - from investment to commercial banking.

The protests by an indigenous community opposing the construction of a gas pipeline project in British Columbia and its supporters have disrupted passenger trains and goods transportation for the seventh straight day.
The shutdown will continue until the blockades end and may lead to temporary layoffs within its Eastern Canadian operational staff, the company said.
""With over 400 trains canceled during the last week and new protests that emerged at strategic locations on our mainline, we have decided that a progressive shutdown of our Eastern Canadian operations is the responsible approach to take,"" Chief Executive Officer JJ Ruest said in a statement.
The company's national rail passenger service, VIA Rail also said it would cancel all of its services on the network, effective immediately.
""This is devastating news for the manufacturing sector which heavily relies on rail transportation and, the overall Canadian economy,"" said Dennis Darby, President and CEO of Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters.
On Thursday, British Columbia Premier John Horgan and federal Indigenous Services Minister Marc Miller said they are willing to meet with the protesting indigenous groups. 
""My request, that I ask you kindly to consider, is to discontinue the protest and barricade of the train tracks as soon as practicable. As you well know, this is a highly volatile situation and the safety of all involved is of the utmost importance to me,"" Miller said in an email to the Mohawks.

The epidemic, which originated in China's Hubei province and has killed more than 1,300 people, has taken a toll on cruise operators as travel restriction and fear of the virus spreading have led to cancellations of trips to the Far East.
Last week, Royal Caribbean said it canceled eight cruises out of China through March 4 and warned of a 25 cent impact to its first quarter earnings.
The company said the 18 canceled cruises would cut its full-year earnings per share by 65 cents, warning that cancelling all its remaining sailings in Asia through the end of April, would reduce its earnings per share by another 55 cents in 2020.
Royal Caribbean had previously forecast 2020 adjusted earnings of $10.40 to $10.70 per share, which did not include the impact of the virus.
Shares of company were down 1.4% at $112 in extended trade, dragging peers Carnival Corp (N:CCL) and Norwegian Cruise Line (N:NCLH) lower.
Earlier this week, Carnival which also suspended cruise operations at ports in China, said it expects a 55 cents to 65 cents per share impact on its 2020 earnings, if it was forced to suspend operation in the rest of Asia."

1. How’s the Consumer Faring?
On Valentine’s Day, investors will get a double dose of insight into what many consider to be the heartbeat of the U.S. economy: the consumer.
At 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT), the Commerce Department will release the latest retail sales figures.
January retail sales are expected to have risen 0.3%, the same as in December, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
At 10:00 AM ET, the University of Michigan issues its preliminary gauge of the consumer’s wellbeing for February.
The consumer sentiment index is seen coming in at 99.5 in this first monthly measure, down slightly from 99.8 in January.
Also on the calendar, January industrial production and capacity utilization numbers arrive at 9:15 AM ET.
And December business inventories are scheduled to come out at 10:00 AM ET.
2.  Canopy Growth  to Report Results
Cannabis company  Canopy Growth  (NYSE:CGC) will be the highlight of the earnings calendar Friday.
The Canadian company is expected to report a loss of 39 cents per share on revenue of $79.6 million.
It’s been a tough time for the sector and company, with its shares down more than 40% in past six months.
But the pot stock got an endorsement from the research community at the end of last month as BMO Capital Markets upgraded it to outperform from market perform.
“We believe there is potential upside to Street expectations for the fiscal third quarter of 2020 driven by the company's pivot into a recreational product mix that should now be better aligned with demand,” analysts Tamy Chen and Peter Sklar wrote in a note.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Thursday granted Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc's request to temporarily halt the U.S. Department of Defense and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) from moving forward on an up-to-$10 billion cloud computing deal that Amazon says reflected undue influence by President Donald Trump.
Amazon, which had been seen as a front-runner to win the contract, filed a lawsuit in November just weeks after the contract was awarded to Microsoft. Trump has publicly derided Amazon head Jeff Bezos and repeatedly criticized the company.
Judge Patricia Campbell-Smith issued a preliminary injunction but did not release her written opinion. She also ordered Amazon to post $42 million in the event the injunction was issued wrongfully.
The Amazon lawsuit said the Defense Department's decision was full of ""egregious errors,"" which were a result of ""improper pressure from President Donald Trump, who launched repeated public and behind-the-scenes attacks"" to steer the contract away from Amazon ""to harm his perceived political enemy"" Bezos.
Bezos also owns the Washington Post, whose coverage has been critical of Trump and which has frequently been a target of barbs by Trump about the news media.
The Pentagon, which had planned to start work on the contract on Friday, said it was disappointed in the ruling.
Lieutenant Colonel Robert Carver, a Defense Department spokesman, said the Pentagon believed ""the actions taken in this litigation have unnecessarily delayed implementing DoD's modernization strategy and deprived our warfighters of a set of capabilities they urgently need.""
It added it remained ""confident in our award of the JEDI Cloud contract to Microsoft.""
Defense Secretary Mark Esper previously denied there was bias and said the Pentagon made its choice fairly and freely without external influence.
Alexander Major, a partner at McCarter & English, said: ""The court has confirmed through the injunction that Amazon’s challenges with respect to this procurement are not trivial. It’s not guaranteed that they will prevail but the fact that they got it at all is a big deal.""
Amazon shares closed down 0.4%, while Microsoft was down 0.5%.
TESTIMONY SOUGHT FROM TRUMP
As part of the lawsuit, Amazon asked the court in January to pause the execution of the contract, popularly known as the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud, or JEDI. The contract is intended to give the military better access to data and technology from remote locations.
Microsoft said in a statement: ""We have confidence in the Department of Defense, and we believe the facts will show they ran a detailed, thorough and fair process.” 
Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The White House declined comment.
Earlier this week, Amazon's cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services, said it was seeking to depose Trump and Esper in its lawsuit over whether the president was trying ""to screw Amazon"" over the contract.
Amazon also seeks to question other officials involved in the decision and alleged that Trump had a history of inappropriately intervening in governmental decisions. Amazon called the process ""fatally flawed and highly unusual.""
The procurement process has been delayed by legal complaints and conflict-of-interest allegations. 
The judge told Amazon and the Pentagon to confer by Feb. 27 on what portions of the opinion can be released publicly.

54,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2020 05:34PM ET</span>",Mattel beats profit estimates as cost cuts take hold,"(Reuters) -  Mattel Inc  (O:MAT) on Thursday beat estimates for quarterly profit as it benefited from a robust cost-cutting program, even as holiday season sales of its flagship Barbie brand in North America were pressured by Hasbro Inc's (O:HAS) ""Frozen"" dolls.
Shares rose 4.8% to $15.09 in extended trading. 
The company exceeded its initial 2019 cost-cutting target of $650 million by 35% as Chief Executive Officer Ynon Kreiz looks to improve profitability through cutting jobs, closing manufacturing facilities and reducing products manufactured. 
Mattel now expects $50 million in savings in 2020 from a ""capital light program"", which includes the closure of four factories in Asia, Mexico and Canada, Kreiz told Reuters.
""We're changing the way we operate,"" said Kreiz, who took the helm in 2018.
Mattel reported an adjusted profit of 11 cents per share in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, racing past expectations of 1 cent, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
However, holiday quarter net sales fell 3.3% to $1.47 billion and missed estimates of $1.50 billion as the November release of Disney's (N:DIS) ""Frozen 2"" re-energized demand for rival Hasbro's dolls based on the franchise's main characters Elsa, Anna and Olaf.
Mattel said gross sales in North America fell 1%, mainly due to a decline in the Barbie and American Girl doll sales.
Hasbro bagged the rights to make dolls based on the  Disney  Princess movies from Mattel in 2014, at a time when kids were increasingly turning to big Hollywood blockbusters and away from their traditional toys.
The releases generated more competition for Mattel's over 60-year old Barbie brand in an already sluggish holiday season for toy sales. 
Major retailer  Target  Corp (N:TGT) also said toy sales during the period were flat, as launches of new original products and brands slowed. 
Kreiz told Reuters it was still too early to tell how the coronavirus outbreak would affect supply to other countries with the company's Chinese manufacturing options currently closed.

However, he added that Mattel's ""Baby Yoda"" plush toy, based on a viral sensation character from the ""The Mandalorian"" Star Wars series on Disney+, is still on schedule to hit shelves in April.

Huawei, the world’s largest maker of telecommunications equipment, and Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou had already faced criminal charges. The fresh allegations, announced Thursday, up the ante by including racketeering conspiracy, increasing the potential punishment. They come as the global battle for supremacy in fifth-generation wireless technology, or 5G, is joined.
Huawei broke the law “to drastically cut its research and development costs and associated delays, giving the company a significant and unfair competitive advantage,” the Justice Department said in a statement. The company even launched a bonus program to reward employees who got their hands on confidential information from competitors, prosecutors said.
The new charges depict a company that won international standing by stealing trade secrets, evading U.S sanctions and lying to authorities. They are likely to increase tensions between Beijing and Washington, which has accused Huawei of spying for the Chinese government and banned the company’s technology from the U.S.
The indictment doesn’t name the businesses from which Huawei allegedly stole intellectual property, but details of the allegations match descriptions of companies including Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO)., Motorola (NYSE:MSI) Inc. and Cnex Labs Inc.
“The indictment paints a damning portrait of an illegitimate organization that lacks any regard for the law,” Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, the Republican chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the panel’s Democratic vice-chairman, said in an emailed statement. “Intellectual property theft, corporate sabotage and market manipulation are part of Huawei’s core ethos and reflected in every aspect of how it conducts business.”
Huawei doesn’t “abide by Western business practices,” Rob Spalding, a Washington-based technology and security expert at the Hudson Institute who served on the National Security Council, said in an email. “Which is why many U.S. companies are no longer competitive in the global marketplace.”
Read More: Why 5G Mobile Arrives With a Subplot of Espionage
Huawei, in turn, has accused the U.S. of orchestrating a campaign to intimidate its employees and launching cyberattacks to infiltrate its internal network.
A lawyer for Huawei had no comment on the new charges. The company has denied the allegations, while China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has urged the U.S to “stop unreasonably targeting Huawei and other Chinese enterprises.”
Huawei was previously accused of violating U.S. sanctions against Iran and North Korea. Meng, the CFO, was charged with fraud last year, with the case rippling into Canada, where she is currently fighting extradition to the U.S. Meng’s lawyers have argued in court that their client did nothing wrong.
The U.S. said Huawei stole trade secrets, including copyrighted works, source code and user manuals for internet routers, to “grow and operate” its business. The company swiped antenna technology and robot testing technology, prosecutors said.
Then, they said, it doubled down.
“When confronted with evidence of wrongdoing, the defendants allegedly made repeated misstatements to U.S. officials, including FBI agents and representatives from the U.S. House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, regarding their efforts to misappropriate trade secrets,” they said.

The U.S. dates the thefts to 2002.
In the new indictment, the government is wielding some prior allegations of wrongdoing, like Huawei’s alleged theft of a phone-testing robot developed by T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) Inc., to build a more muscular case. The U.S. alleged that a Huawei engineer secretly took photos of T-Mobile’s robot, Tappy, took measurements of parts and even stole a piece of it. Huawei blamed “rogue actors” within the company when T-Mobile threatened to sue, the U.S. said.
Intellectual property theft “explains a lot of Huawei’s success,” said Jim Lewis, of the Technology Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “Huawei is the poster child for China’s commercial spying.”
The case is U.S. v. Huawei Technologies Co., 18-cr-457, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn).

 Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE) announced earnings per share of $1.24 on revenue of $2.75B. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $1.19 on revenue of $2.76B. That compares to EPS of $1.18 on revenue of $2.56B in the same period a year before. Expedia had reported EPS of $3.38 on revenue of $3.56B in the previous quarter. Analysts are expecting EPS of $-0.28 and revenue of $2.82B in the upcoming quarter.
Gross bookings increased 6% in the quarter, driven primarily by growth in Expedia Partner Solutions, which includes the benefit from enterprise deals launched in late 2018, and Hotels.com.
Domestic gross bookings increased 7% and international gross bookings increased 4%.
Lodging revenue increased 9% in the fourth quarter on an 11% increase in room nights stayed, but that was partly offset by a 2% decrease in revenue per room night.

58,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2020 04:51PM ET</span>","Some U.S.-listed China firms see shorting spike, others see short-covering jump","By Sinéad Carew
(Reuters) - Short selling of U.S.-listed companies from China and Hong Kong has climbed since the coronavirus outbreak was confirmed on Jan. 20, according to the latest report from S3, a provider of short interest and securities finance data.
Short sellers bet that a securities price will fall by borrowing a stock with a view to buying it back later at a lower price to cover the bet and make a profit.
S3 said that $751 million new shares were shorted in the 494 U.S.-traded Chinese and Hong Kong stocks the company tracks, bringing total short interest in those stocks to $27.27 billion.
But it noted that most of the new short-selling occurred in exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with an increase of $815 million worth of shorted shares bringing the total Chinese/Hong Kong ETF short interest to $3.75 billion.
S3 said it expects to see continued short-selling in Chinese/Hong Kong stocks and that this would happen primarily in the U.S. market as Chinese regulators limit short-selling on China's exchanges.
In particular, the firm said stocks in travel, food retail and brick-and-mortar retailing would continue to take the brunt of the shorting trend because they are more directly affected by the Chinese authorities' efforts to limit mobility to try to contain the virus.
But it said internet-related securities should see short-covering as traffic flow increases among users who are stuck at home and investors eye a short-term boost to revenue at those companies.
On the equity side companies in the category with the largest amount of new short-selling since the virus outbreak included Trip.com Group Ltd (O:TCOM), with an increase of $245.4 million worth of shares sold short,  Luckin Coffee  Inc (O:LK) with an increase of $151.8 million and the U.S. shares of Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700), with a $71.6 million increase.
Other companies with a noticeable increase in short-selling included  Yum China Holdings Inc  (N:YUMC), China Mobile Ltd (HK:0941) (N:CHL),  Momo Inc  (O:MOMO) and  Weibo Corp  (O:WB), according to S3.
Companies seeing a significant short-covering included JD.com Inc (O:JD), Baidu Inc (O:BIDU) and  IQIYI Inc  (O:IQ). JD.com shares shorted fell by $314.1 million while Baidu shares shorted fell by $155.8 million and IQIYI shares shorted were reduced by $155.8 million."

It announced a schedule for 14-day term repo operations for Feb. 18 through March 12. The largest will have a maximum size of $25 billion and those starting March 3 will be reduced to a maximum of $20 billion.
The bank followed a similar pattern in announcing a new term repo schedule in mid-January, when it said it would reduce the operations by $5 billion starting in February. The newly scheduled offerings will provide liquidity through March 26.
The maximum size of the central bank’s daily overnight operations, meanwhile, will drop by $20 billion, to $100 billion. These are slated to continue until March 12, according to the New York Fed’s new schedule.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated in congressional testimony this week that the central bank stands ready to adjust the operations as conditions warrant. Powell said last month the Fed would continue term and overnight repo operations at least through April.
The Fed has been conducting repo offerings and Treasury-bill purchases in a bid to keep control of short-term interest rates and bolster bank reserves. The efforts have calmed markets since the September spike that took overnight repo rates as high as 10%, and helped quell concern about a potential cash crunch at the end of 2019.
The Fed also said Thursday that it planned to continue buying $60 billion of Treasury bills each month for reserve management."

Investing.com – The S&P ended the day well off of its lows Thursday after the World Health Organization suggested the spike in coronavirus infections may not have occurred in a day, easing fears of contagion.
The S&P 500 fell 0.18%, Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.14% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.43%.
""We are not dealing, from what we understand, with a spike in cases of 14,000 on one day,"" the WHO said in a press release after China reported 254 more deaths and 15,152 new infections.
The health watchdog said the surge in infections likely included individuals who had been infected a number of days or even weeks ago after China adopted a new method of diagnosing Covid-19 (coronavirus).
Ahead of the WHO's remarks, stocks were deeply in the red amid fears the jump in infections and deaths in China signaled a change in trajectory for the virus, stoking worries about contagion.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the fifteenth case of an individual in the U.S. with the virus.

(Reuters) - The U.S. government's antitrust victory over chip supplier  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM) drew tough questions for the Federal Trade Commision from a panel of three appellate judges in San Francisco on Thursday.
The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral arguments in a closely watched case the regulator brought against Qualcomm in early 2017.
San Diego, California-based Qualcomm supplies modem chips that connect phones and other devices to wireless data networks, but patent licensing drives most of its profits. 
The company is fighting a May 2019 decision by U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh. That judge sided with antitrust regulators, writing that Qualcomm’s practice of requiring phone makers to sign a patent license agreement before selling them chips “strangled competition"" and harmed consumers.
The panel of judges probed the FTC on how Qualcomm may have violated antitrust laws, even if the company did use its dominant position in the chip market to gain higher patent royalties.
""Anticompetitive behavior is prohibited under the Sherman Act. Hyper-competitive behavior is not. This case asks us to draw the line between the two,"" Judge Stephen Joseph Murphy III said.
The FTC argued Qualcomm applied an excessive ""surcharge"" to phone makers, charging them too high a price for patent licenses because the phone makers had to sign the deals to get Qualcomm's chips. 
""Doesn't the Supreme Court say that patent holders have the right to price their patents? What would be anticompetitive about that?"" Judge Johnnie Rawlinson asked.
Brian Fletcher, a law professor from Stanford University brought in by the FTC, responded that phone makers could not challenge the patent prices in negotiations or other court proceedings for fear of losing access to Qualcomm's chips.
Judge Consuelo María Callahan asked whether the FTC's case had conflated profits with anticompetitive behavior. She asked Qualcomm's attorney if Qualcomm's practices ""helped Qualcomm make lots of money for a few years, is that in and of itself an antitrust violation, even if consumers paid higher prices for cell phones?”
Representing Qualcomm, Tom Goldstein responded no. He conceded Qualcomm was a monopoly, but argued that it broke no laws because its chips were better than rivals.
""It is the prospect that a monopolist will make a lot of money that encourages it to do so much innovation. That is what capitalism is intended to encourage,"" he said.

A decision in the appeal could take anywhere from several months to more than a year.

Some units remain in operation at the refinery including a crude distillation unit (CDU), gasoline-producing fluidic catalytic cracking unit (FCCU) and a coker, the sources said.
A blaze on Wednesday cut output at Exxon's 502,500 barrel-per-day (bpd) Baton Rouge, Louisiana, refinery. It was the third Exxon petrochemical plant along the U.S. Gulf Coast to suffer damage in less than a year. 2
No injuries were reported because of the fire that broke out from a natural gas pipeline shortly before midnight on Tuesday and burned for about seven hours on Wednesday, the sources said.
The blaze affected pipes laid on racks 50 feet in the air, and forced the shutdown of multiple units at the oil refinery and adjoining chemical plant, the sources said.
The fire forced the shutdown of three CDUs and an FCCU, but was confined to the pipe bundle where it broke out.
Operations at the refinery and chemical plant continue, Exxon spokesman Jeremy Eikenberry said on Thursday. He declined to discuss the status of individual processing units.
Exxon was meeting contractual commitments and expected to meet all customer commitments, he said.
The company and other refiners are suffering from weak margins due to excess supplies and falling demand for some fuels. Exxon U.S. refining profits fell 42% last year over 2018 due to weak margins and higher maintenance costs.
CDUs are the heart of the refining process, providing the primary breakdown of crude oil into hydrocarbon feedstocks that other production units convert into motor fuels and feedstocks for plastics.
Traders on the New York Mercantile Exchange attributed a jump in gasoline futures since on Wednesday and Thursday to the combined impact of an FCCU outage last week at the Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) Bayway refinery in Linden, New Jersey, and the Baton Rouge fire.
U.S. gasoline futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange gained 0.18%, or 0.28 cents at $1.5838 per gallon on Thursday. On Wednesday, it rose 4.4%, or 6.68 cents.
The blaze was the third major fire to hit Exxon's U.S. operations since last March when a fire broke out in a Baytown, Texas, refinery unit. In July, a fire in Exxon's Baytown Olefins plant injured 37 workers."

Cisco is in advanced takeover talks with FireEye, which has hired Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) to manage a sale, and an offer could be seen in the coming weeks, Spanish newspaper Okdiario reported.
Another, smaller company is also interested in buying FireEye, but can’t match Cisco’s financial firepower, the paper said.
Shares of FireEye haven’t been able to build any traction in a while. They are down about 1% in the past 52 weeks and up about 2% in the past two years.
Cisco shares were down nearly 5% in afternoon trading. The networking company issues tepid revenue guidance after the bell yesterday, noting that customers may delay spending decisions due the Covid-19 outbreak."
68,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2020 02:43PM ET</span>",Emerson says it will not pursue a break-up following review,"By Rebecca Spalding
(Reuters) - Emerson Electric Co (N:EMR) told investors on Thursday it would not pursue a break-up following a review it launched last year that examined whether it should separate its industrial automation operations from its air-conditioning business.
Breaking up Emerson was one of the demands made by hedge fund D.E. Shaw & Co LP last October, when it announced it owned more than 1% of the company. Emerson unveiled some corporate governance changes in November that won D.E. Shaw's endorsement and avoided a challenge to its board.
A spokesman for D.E. Shaw declined to comment on Thursday on whether the hedge fund remains an Emerson shareholder and what its reaction to the company's announcement was.
Emerson, which pursued an unsuccessful $29 billion acquisition bid for peer Rockwell Automation Inc (N:ROK) in 2017, had long been seen as a potential break-up candidate among investors and analysts. Its automation solutions business serves mostly industrial clients, while its remaining divisions cater primarily to commercial and residential markets.
Emerson said in a presentation to its investors that it will not break up ""unless a major strategic acquisition catalyst is actioned."" The St Louis-based company also said that it had earmarked $4 billion for acquisitions.
Through a series of cost cuts and operational changes, Emerson said it aimed to reach 44% gross margin by 2023 from 42.5% in 2019,and $4 billion in operating cash flow by 2023 from $3 billion in 2019.
D.E. Shaw had argued that cost cuts, in conjunction with a break-up, could add more than $20 billion in equity value to the company.
D.E. Shaw praised Emerson in November, when the latter appointed former  Flowserve Corp  (N:FLS) Chief Executive Mark Blinn to its board after discussions with the hedge fund. Emerson also agreed to review its executive pay packages.
Emerson was the first major company to be publicly pursued by D.E. Shaw after it lost its main shareholder activism portfolio manager, Quentin Koffey, to a rival hedge fund, Senator Investment Group LP.
Emerson reiterated on Thursday that David Farr, who has been its chief executive since 2000, will retire by 2021.
Emerson shares fell about 2.5% to $73.05 on Thursday afternoon in New York, giving the company a market capitalization of $45 billion. Since D.E Shaw's stake in Emerson became public on Sept. 27, its shares have risen more than 9 percent."
69,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2020 02:29PM ET</span>",Former Trump aide Hicks to return to White House as election nears,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hope Hicks, a one-time close aide and communications director to President Donald Trump, will return to the White House next month after two years away to work closely with key advisors, administration officials said on Thursday. 
Hicks, who previously served as Trump's campaign press secretary, will be working closely with the president's son-in-law and advisor Jared Kushner and White House Political Affairs Director Brian Jack, a White House official said without disclosing the specific issues she would focus on. 
She returns as Trump steps up his campaign for re-election in November. Hicks was a spokesperson for Trump's 2016 campaign and was one of the first hires for his presidential bid.
Hicks, one of Trump's most trusted aides, served as White House communications director until resigning in Feb. 2018 when she was appointed communications chief at Fox.
In a statement, Fox praised Hicks for being instrumental in setting up a program to help veterans, youth and underserved communities and described her as ""a key executive team member"" at the inception of Fox Corporation, the company spun off from Twenty-First Century Fox's merger with Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co. 
Hicks was caught up in a controversy surrounding former White House staff secretary Rob Porter, another close Trump aide, whom Hicks had been dating. She worked to defend him when charges of domestic abuse against his two former wives emerged. Porter was ultimately forced to resign.

Last June, Hicks testified in a hearing on former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, but refused to answer questions about her 14-month White House tenure.

Investing.com – Wall Street clawed back the bulk of losses Thursday as coronavirus-led selling cooled despite a surge in deaths and infections in China.
The S&P 500 fell 0.04%, the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.03% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.19% .
A new method of diagnosing Covid-19 pushed the death toll above 1,300 and indicated that as many as 59,804 are infected, raising worries that the outbreak may be worse than many had feared.
China also confirmed 254 more deaths from disease and 15,152 new cases. But the White House thinks that China is still under-reporting cases and deaths and also noted it is not accepting offers of help from the U.S., according to published reports.
A rise in the number of infections outside mainland China exacerbated fears of contagion, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirming the 15th case of an individual in the U.S. with the virus.
Selling was seen across airline stocks as investors reassessed the risk to global travel from virus, with American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) down about 1%.
Energy stocks fell sharply, shrugging off a rise in oil prices amid growing hopes that Russia will support OPEC+ proposals for deeper production cuts.
In earnings, Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) fell 2% after its better-than-expected earnings were overshadowed by its gloomy outlook on revenue. 
The networking giant guided third-quarter annualized revenue to decline by 1.5% to 3.5%. Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) said the Covid-19 outbreak could keep businesses away from making major investment decisions.
MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) slumped 5% after it pulled its 2020 guidance amid concerns about impact of the coronavirus concerns. The company also said its chief executive Jim Murren would step down.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), meanwhile, climbed 2% despite detailing plans to raise $2 billion through an equity placing. Proceeds of the deal would be used to bolster the company’s balance sheet and for general corporate purposes."

Huawei was already facing a series of criminal charges for allegedly violating U.S. sanctions against Iran and North Korea.
The new charge steps up U.S. pressure on Huawei. The government already had banned the company’s technology and accused Huawei of aiding Beijing in espionage. Now the company faces even more significant criminal penalties if prosecutors win a conviction in federal court in Brooklyn, New York.
Huawei has accused the U.S. government of orchestrating a campaign to intimidate its employees and launching cyberattacks to infiltrate its internal network. The accusations have ratcheted up tensions between Huawei and the Trump administration.
As the criminal case against Huawei moves forward, the prosecution of its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, remains on hold. She is fighting extradition from Vancouver, Canada, after being arrested at the request of the U.S. last year. She is accused of defrauding banks when she made a presentation to one of its major banking partners and lied about by lying Huawei’s business dealings in Iran, in violation of U.S. sanctions.
The case is U.S. v. Huawei Technologies Co., 18-cr-457, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn)."

LISBON (Reuters) - The United States would like to see Portugal's main utility EDP-Energias de Portugal expanding in the U.S. market, but Chinese investment in the company could pose risks that need to be evaluated, U.S. energy secretary Dan Brouillette said on Thursday.
Brouillette, in Portugal to attract American investment to the deep-sea port of Sines, said: ""We are evaluating Chinese investment in EDP,"" Brouillette said. ""The ultimate outcome of this is going to depend on EDP, on whether they are willing to mitigate some of that risk.""
State-owned China Three Gorges (CTG) has a 23% stake in EDP. 
He said EDP's growth in the U.S. renewable energy market was welcome but did present a challenge because of the Chinese investment.
The same, he said, applied to Chinese investment in European and other allied countries, due to the risk it might allow their infrastructures ""to be used for intelligence gathering purposes"".
""It hinders in many respects our ability to share critical information with our allies, so we take these things very-very seriously,"" he said.
Brouillette said the United States was sharing its findings on ""some of the incidents of Chinese activity in the United States"" with its European allies. He said it was up to those allies to decide if there were any specific risks. 
""The Europeans have their own decisions to make about companies like Huawei, about CTG, others who have invested in critical infrastructure in Europe,"" he said.
Sines, south of Lisbon, is viewed as having a strategic location by the U.S. government. Brouillette said there was no U.S. pressure on the Portuguese government to pick a U.S. firm for the port's expansion plans. 
""We understand fully what the tender offer is about. If it ultimately ends up with the Chinese investor it is the decision the Portugal government will have to attend to in its own right,"" he said.
""The purpose of my visit to the port is to attract U.S. interest and investment in that particular port because we see it as critical for moving not only gas but also other products into Europe.""

The American delegation included natural gas companies Cheniere, Venture Global LNG, Next-Decade and Penn America Energy, as well as construction companies and operators of container terminals - Ports America, Jacobs Engineering, Bechtel Civil Infrastructure and AECOM.

Investing.com – Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten has shed its entire stake in social media company Pinterest (NYSE:PINS), according to a published report Thursday.
Shares of Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) fell 0.1% in afternoon trading.
Rakuten, known as the Amazon of Japan, sold $1.4 billion in tech holdings, including all of its shares in Pinterest, of which it was an early investor, Nikkei Asian Review reported.
The move underscores concerns about overvaluation in tech and communications services, the Nikkei said.
Rakuten first invested in Pinterest when it was a startup in 2012. The social media scrapbook company went public in April 2019.
Pinterest shares shot up last week after the company reported strong fourth-quarter results, accompanied by solid guidance.
Investors and Wall Street analysts had been concerned following a third-quarter miss in revenue, but the latest numbers indicated the company was bouncing back."

If approved, that will bring Dominion's share in the pipeline to 53%, up from 48%.  Duke Energy  Corp (N:DUK) will own the remaining 47%. Southern will remain an anchor customer of the pipe through its Virginia Natural Gas subsidiary.
In addition, Dominion said it agreed to buy Southern's Pivotal LNG, which distributes liquefied natural gas for marine and road transportation. The total cost of the Atlantic Coast stake and Pivotal was about $175 million, Dominion said.
Atlantic Coast, the nation's most expensive gas pipe, is one of several projects that have received federal permits in recent years but have been delayed by state opposition and local and environmental legal and regulatory battles.
Some analysts have questioned whether Dominion will be able to complete Atlantic Coast following numerous delays and cost increases related to regulatory and legal battles over state and federal permits.
Dominion CFO James Chapman told analysts on Tuesday: ""Major project customers have confirmed their willingness to take on higher project rates given the strategic importance of (Atlantic Coast) as an alternative pipeline option to the region.""
Dominion CEO Thomas Farrell told analysts the company could restart pipeline construction after receiving some key permits that are expected during the first half of this year. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule in May or June in a case about whether the pipeline can run underneath the Appalachian Trail in Virginia."
78,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 13, 2020 12:36PM ET</span>",Tesla's Stock Sale Is So Right But Feels So Wrong,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- If it involves a flurry of announcements, filings, subpoena disclosures, a stock with Lebowski levels of insouciance, a surprise equity raise and Larry Ellison backing up the truck, then we must be talking about Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).
It’s been a busy Thursday morning for the electric-vehicle phenomenon. Not long after Tesla Inc. filed its 10-K annual report, the company announced it would sell up to $2.3 billion worth of new equity, with CEO Elon Musk and director Ellison indicating their “preliminary interest” in buying $10 million and $1 million worth, respectively.
The 10-K itself contained several interesting details. There was a reference to a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission seeking information on unspecified contracts and financing arrangements. Regional data for 2019 showed sales in Tesla’s biggest market, the U.S., fell by 15%. Meanwhile, the full cash flow statement confirmed that $204 million of fourth-quarter cash from operations was largely a mix of foreign-exchange gains and amortization and write-down effects. As I wrote here, along with a positive swing in working capital and sales of regulatory credits, those “other” items contributed more than half of Tesla’s free cash flow in the quarter.
Let’s stay with free cash flow. Another item in the 10-K was Tesla’s capital expenditure guidance. This is notable because management was unusually reticent on that item when it announced year-end results about two weeks ago, telling investors and analysts to wait for the filing. It is also notable because the new guidance implies a jump of somewhere between 88% and 164% this year — and maybe staying there through 2022.
One of the strange things about Tesla is that its valuation and ambitious narrative are pure growth-stock stuff, but its capex in 2019 was more like that of an old car business. At 62%, its ratio of capex to depreciation wasn’t much different from the 54% reported by General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). Now it seems as if Tesla will make up for that and then some. Plotting the new guidance versus consensus forecasts shows just how much last year stood out in this regard.
The final capex bill for 2019 was $1.3 billion. That’s about $1.2 billion lower than the original guidance given a year ago. Meanwhile, Tesla’s free cash flow in 2019 was $1.1 billion.
Which brings us back to the surprise equity raise. It’s a surprise because, about two weeks ago, Musk answered a question on this very subject by saying “it doesn’t make sense to raise money because we expect to generate cash despite this growth level.” It’s also a surprise because Tesla had $6.3 billion of cash and equivalents on its balance sheet at the end of December. Plus, the company expects “positive quarterly free cash flow going forward, with possible temporary exceptions.” Certainly, current consensus forecasts for free cash flow imply Tesla could absorb the jump in capex without resort to new financing.
It shouldn’t be that surprising, though. Tesla’s stock has gone parabolic. Just six months ago, a $2.3 billion equity raise would have diluted shareholders by almost 6%; at today’s price, it’s just 1.6%. Investors may as well be begging the company to sell more equity (Musk’s compensation package encourages this too).
In that sense, Tesla is doing the sensible thing by giving the punters what they want and shoring up its balance sheet. And yet, alongside the stalled growth in revenue, losses and capex-budget boomerang, doing the sensible thing also happens to undercut the price-boosting narrative that Tesla has turned the corner on self-funding. Even if companies can sell equity cheaply, they tend not to do so unless they think they need the money. "

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) has told financial technology companies that they will be barred from accessing its customer information by July 30 if they do not sign data access agreements with the bank and agree to a plan to stop using customer passwords to gather the data.
The largest U.S. bank by assets set the new deadline in a letter sent to the companies in late January, in which it also said they must agree a ""concrete plan"" to transition to a new method of collecting customer data, according to two people familiar with the matter.
Otherwise, JPMorgan will block all automated access to the data, including through so-called screenscraping, or the process of collecting data from one application to use it in another, the people said.
A JPMorgan spokesman confirmed the contents of the letter and said the company already has agreements with more than 95 percent of companies that request data access.
The deadline is the latest move in the bank's effort to transition fintechs and data aggregators to what it has said is a more secure way of accessing customer data.
Fintech startups, such as those that offer budgeting apps or digital wealth management, usually connect to a user's bank account to gather the necessary data to provide their services. Some gather the data through aggregators such as  Visa Inc  (N:V) -owned Plaid or Yodlee, while others request that customers provide their password.
Through JPMorgan's new method, fintechs will not be able to use customers' passwords to access their entire financial data, but will instead connect to a set of bank programming code known as an API, that grants access only to limited account information authorized by the consumer.
The transition comes as large banks and fintech companies globally tussle over data-sharing. Banks have said their wariness to grant access to third parties stems from a need to protect highly sensitive information, such as transaction history and income.
Fintechs have been skeptical, arguing that it should be up to consumers, not banks, to decide what companies can look at that information.
JPMorgan said earlier this year that it was preparing to crack down on the use of customer passwords for data-sharing purposes, and had been discussing another method to access information since 2016.
However, some startups said they were surprised by the stringent requirements and strict deadline in the letter, according to one fintech source.
""We've been working on this with aggregators and fintechs since 2016 because our secure API is the best way to help our customers make smart money decisions more easily and safely,"" Paul LaRusso, managing director of digital platforms at Chase, said in a written statement to Reuters.
The bank said companies that have agreed to JPM's terms would be able to continue accessing customer data using existing tools, provided they have a concrete plan in place to move to the new method and are making progress toward that goal.
""Customers can still use their favorite apps and websites while these companies migrate to our API,"" LaRusso said."

BOSTON (Reuters) - T. Rowe Price Group Inc said on Thursday it would ratchet up the risk in its target-date retirement portfolios, boosting stock allocations to as much as 98% for younger investors. 
Target-date funds are popular in 401(k) plans because they do the work of allocating worker and employer retirement contributions into stocks and bonds. Funds with distant retirement dates typically allocate about 90% of their portfolios to stocks, with that percentage declining as retirement nears.
T. Rowe, which manages $292 billion in active target-date portfolios, said it would hold the 98% allocation constant until investors are 35 years from retirement. Currently, the T. Rowe Price 2060 fund has about 89% of its assets in stocks. 
The company also said it would boost stock allocations for investors in their retirement years. The final allocation, 30 years past retirement, would be 30% stocks, up from the current level of 20%, the company said.
The transition will happen over a two-year period starting in April. Portfolios closest to retirement will not experience an increase in stock allocations from current levels, the company said in a statement.
Assets in target-date portfolios have been growing at a rapid clip since the 2007-2009 recession, surging to more than $1.7 trillion at the end of 2018, from investor deposits and stock market gains, according to research firm Morningstar Inc.

Vanguard Group dominates the target-date market with nearly 40% market share in mutual fund portfolios, followed by 19% at Fidelity Investments and 13% at T. Rowe Price, according to 2018 figures provided by Morningstar.

84,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2020 11:22AM ET</span>",Tesla seeks to tap into stock surge with $2 billion share sale,"By Supantha Mukherjee and Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc on Thursday announced plans to raise $2 billion in a stock offering, tapping into an astronomical jump in its share price over the past few months and reversing the electric-car maker's often-stated policy of avoiding sales of new stock.
Tesla said it would offer 2.65 million shares, of which Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk will buy up to $10 million in shares, while board member and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) co-founder Larry Ellison will purchase up to $1 million worth of Tesla shares.
Tesla's shares were down roughly 1% in morning trading, retracing losses after sliding as much as 7% in premarket trading. The stock has tripled since October when the company posted a rare quarterly profit. Its market capitalization now exceeds the combined value of General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co.
Musk has repeatedly assured investors that Tesla will not need to raise more money for costly initiatives including production of a new vehicle model, the ramp-up of its China production and the construction of its first European factory.
""It doesn't make sense to raise money,"" Musk said during a Jan. 29 earnings call when an investor asked why Tesla does not take advantage of its favorable share price to accelerate production. Musk said the company would generate enough cash on its own to fund ambitious expansion plans.
""Diluting the company to pay down debt doesn't sound like a wise move,"" Musk said on the same call.
Musk also said Tesla needed to produce more batteries to increase vehicle production, adding that some projects like its electric semi-trailer truck program could not proceed without battery improvements.
Tesla is also working on an electric pickup truck, a new generation of the Tesla Roadster, an electric sports car, and automated driving features. The company did not immediately respond to a request for further comment on how to reconcile Thursday's announcement with Musk's previous statements.
The decision to raise money will come as a shock to some investors following Musk's previous comments, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a note.
""In our opinion the size of this offering is larger than many had anticipated, but we believe it’s a smart move by Musk and the Board to take advantage of being back in a position of strength,"" Ives said.
Tesla, whose outstanding debt was $13.42 billion at the end of 2019, posted its second quarterly profit in a row in January and said it would comfortably make more than half a million cars this year.
The company said it plans to use proceeds from the offering to strengthen its balance sheet and for general corporate purposes.
Tesla raised about $2.3 billion in May to start production in China and spend on developing new models, including the high-volume Model Y SUV and a Semi commercial truck, whose launch has been delayed due to a lack of battery production capacity.
Since the last capital raise, Tesla has built a $2 billion factory in Shanghai and unveiled the futuristic Cybertruck pickup. The Shanghai factory started delivering cars last month.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) are the lead joint book-running managers.  Barclays  (LON:BARC), BofA Securities,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Securities and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) are additional book-running managers.

Investing.com -   Caterpillar   (NYSE:CAT) fell Thursday, but the stock was one of the few Dow components showing a little resilience after a heavyweight Wall Street upgrade.
Shares were down 0.5% in morning trading, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 0.6%.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) upgraded the stock to buy from neutral today, raising its price target to $168 per share from $156 per share.
The heavy-equipment maker’s stock is showing an attractive risk-reward scenario, according to Goldman analyst Jerry Revich.
Factors that should help include “tightening U.S. construction equipment capacity utilization and dealer inventories and backlog approaching trough levels,” Revich wrote.
Shares of Caterpillar are down nearly 8% year to date, with selling pressure coming as the impact of Covid-19 on the Chinese economy and demand from the country becoming clearer.
Opinion of the stock on Wall Street is fairly split.
Among those covering Caterpillar there are 11 buy ratings, 12 neutrals and 3 sells, according to Investing.com."

The deal had been approved without restrictions on Jan. 27 by Cade's General Superintendent Alexandre Cordeiro Macedo. Cade's top administrative council can still call for a review of the case, putting the matter to a vote.
In the appeal filed on Wednesday, prosecutors referred to ""some omissions"" in the decision made by Macedo when assessing the markets that would be affected, citing the regional aviation market, which uses aircraft with fewer than 100 seats.
Boeing has offered to pay $4.2 billion for 80% of Embraer's commercial jet division, which builds passenger jets in the 70- to 150-seat segment.
The appeal, seen by Reuters, was filed by Deputy Attorney General Samantha Dobrowolski. Under Brazilian antitrust law, it will be now be assigned to a reporting commissioner who will decide whether it should be considered by the body.
The reporting commission's opinion on the appeal will then submitted to Cade's top administrative council, which will decide whether to review the case."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group aiming to spur climate change legislation that would tax carbon emissions stepped up efforts by issuing a blueprint on Thursday and previewing it with a group of bipartisan U.S. senators earlier this week.
The Climate Leadership Council's plan aims to halve carbon emissions by 2035 from 2005 levels with a tax starting at $40 per ton. While that would make products like gasoline more expensive, the plan would return dividends to families of about $2,000 in the first year.
Council Chairman and Chief Executive Ted Halstead said the group hopes that bipartisan climate price legislation based on the blueprint will be introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate this year. ""The objective is to tee it up as a bipartisan alternative going into the (November) 2020 elections,"" Halstead said.
The CLC dined with nine of the 16 members of the bipartisan Senate Climate Solutions Caucus this week, according to a person familiar with the meeting.
Senior officials from 15 large companies including  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) dined with senators in the caucus on Tuesday, according to a document seen by Reuters. Some of the officials also met with House lawmakers.
As voters demand action on climate change, lawmakers in Congress have begun to put forward legislation but are struggling to agree on how to tackle the problem. 
Republican lawmakers in the House proposed legislation on Wednesday that included setting a goal to plant 1 trillion trees to address climate change by sucking carbon out of the air, an idea President Donald Trump has supported.
Several House lawmakers including Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy said carbon taxes are not needed to spur innovation. 
But Halstead predicted Republicans would soon show support. ""Our plan ticks every box of conservative orthodoxy,"" he said, adding that it is market-based, pro-business and cuts regulation.
Senators Chris Coons, a Democrat, and Mike Braun, a Republican, said they were happy that the Senate climate group, which they head, has received outreach from industry and advocates, but did not say whether they supported the plan. Coons introduced a carbon tax bill last year. 
Republican Senator Mitt Romney considered supporting carbon price legislation last year, but did not ultimately do so. His office did not immediately return a request for comment.
The CLC said its founding members include Goldman Sachs & Co (NYSE:GS) , JPMorgan Chase & Co and former United Nations climate chief Christiana Figueres.

88,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2020 10:11AM ET</span>",Competition heats up in turboprop market,"By Tim Hepher and Jamie Freed
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Competition is cranking up in the world of turboprops.
For years turboprops were an ignored corner of the aircraft industry, accounting for about 120 aircraft a year compared with the more than 1,000 jets made by giants Airbus and Boeing.
But growing rivalries in the turboprop business cut through a Singapore Airshow depleted by coronavirus this week.
While intercontinental jet travel is vulnerable to trade wars and disruptions such as epidemics, regional development in archipelago nations like Indonesia is favouring the turboprop. 
The market has been dominated for years by Europe's ATR, jointly owned by Airbus (PA:AIR) and Italy's Leonardo (MI:LDOF), which enjoys a relatively undisturbed lion's share of the market with a small slice also held by the Canadian-owned De Havilland Dash 8.
But the commercial arm of Brazil's Embraer (SA:EMBR3) is sharpening a pitch to return to the market and Chief Executive John Slattery told Reuters he expected a decision by the end of the year.
""We should be positioned in the mid-to-late fourth quarter to bring a business case with a recommendation to our board,"" he said in an interview.
In a sign that the development is accelerating, Slattery said he had held talks with three potential engine suppliers - Rolls-Royce (L:RR),  General Electric  (N:GE) and Pratt & Whitney Canada, part of the engine unit of United Technologies (N:UTX).
""We are fully engaged with engine manufacturers now and meeting here at the air show...We are excited by where we are.""
Until now, planemakers have found it difficult to justify the estimated $2-4 billion investment needed to develop a new turboprop, despite its efficiency on relatively short flights.
The market has been stagnant at about 120 deliveries a year and demand for the planes is dependent on volatile oil prices, with turboprops displacing small jets when prices are high.
The thrumming noise of the propellor-driven turboprop also puts some passengers off, travel experts say, even though many in the industry say that reputation is already out of date.
Slattery said quiet new engine technology and advances in passenger comfort would stimulate demand.
""We believe the market opportunity going forward is significantly different to what past decades have shown.""
COMPETITION BOOST
China has already entered the fray with its planned MA700.
At ATR's bright-red stand inside Singapore's exhibition hall, Chief Executive Stefano Bortoli shrugged off the threat of a comeback by Embraer which already makes smaller turboprops.
""I think once Embraer will let us know their decision you will have our comments. At this point in time it is simply commenting on opinions. Not that we will stand still,"" he said.
The fundamental shape of the two-aircraft ATR family seating 40-78 people has not changed in about 30 years, but the aircraft was modernised with the -600 variant around a decade ago.
ATR recently launched a freighter and a version designed for use on short runways, which has opened opportunities in markets such as Japan and Papua New Guinea, where PNG Air emerged as a launch customer this week.
""The approach we've taken...is let's consolidate the platform that we have...and when the right time comes and there are solid options available, let's go for that,"" Bortoli said.
ATR shareholders have clashed in the past about whether to launch a bigger new 90-seater, with Toulouse-based Airbus blocking the investment. But industry analysts say ATR would have to consider responding to a new plane from Embraer.
The prospect of greater competition in turboprop adds zest to efforts by Embraer to complete a tie up with Boeing (N:BA), which has agreed to acquire control of its commercial division.
The European Commission has extended its scrutiny of the $4 billion deal, fearing that it would narrow options for airlines.
Slattery reiterated Embraer would only have the appetite to invest in a new turboprop in the context of the Boeing venture.
He declined to elaborate but industry experts say it is a signal to Europe that the Boeing deal would improve choice for airlines by prompting ATR to come up with its own new product.

One European source said it remained doubtful whether Boeing would support a new turboprop once it gained control of Embraer, but analysts note the U.S. planemaker has not yet ruled it out.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Activist investor Sahm Adrangi's Kerrisdale Capital hedge fund is taking aim at  Match Group Inc  (O:MTCH), arguing that the company behind dating sites Match.com and Tinder will see its shares drop as it faces threats of increased governmental regulation.
""The thrill of the unexpected should be confined to going on a new date, not investing in the company that helped you find it,"" Adrangi told Reuters in an interview.
""We are short Match Group and think the stock price is worth less."" He declined to say where he thinks the stock, which closed trading at $75.58 on Wednesday, should be trading.
Congress is investigating the safety of online dating apps amid complaints of underage use and the Federal Trade Commission sued Match Group last year over alleged ""deceptive or unfair practices"" used to get people to subscribe to the site.
""Federal investigations not only mean soaring legal costs and potential legal damages but more importantly, they will likely result in a lasting impact to Match’s business model,"" Adrangi wrote in a 26-page report on the company that will be published on Thursday.
Match said it had no comment.
The man behind the $500 million Kerrisdale fund rose to fame as one of a small number of so-called short sellers who bet correctly that Chinese logging company Sino-Forest Corp was a fraud.
Last year Kerrisdale earned a 21% return as bets against companies, including molecular diagnostics firm CareDx (O:CDNA) and semiconductor and telecommunications equipment company Qualcomm (O:QCOM), paid off.
Kerrisdale's report on Match Group comes as it and rival dating companies Bumble, Grindr, the Meet Group are due to respond to a series of questions recently submitted to them by the U.S. House Oversight and Reform subcommittee on economic and consumer policy.
The questions focus on users' ages, age verification, and any complaints about assault.
Dating services generally require their users to be at least 18 years old.
Match Group, which went public five years ago and has a market capitalization of $21 billion, has seen its share price drop 8.8% so far this year. Last month Chief Executive Mandy Ginsberg said she was stepping down, citing health challenges."

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks opened lower on Thursday as market participants took money off the table in response to a sharp rise in confirmed coronavirus cases in China, which tempered earlier hopes that the disease will peak soon.
By 10:10, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 165 points, or 0.6%, while the S&P 500 was down 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.5%. 
Outside of the DJIA, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock fell 0.4%, the electric vehicle maker paring early losses after saying it wants to sell up to $2 billion in new stock via a secondary offering. 
The broad risk-off move in markets followed a decision by Chinese authorities to rejig its way of counting cases of the Covid-19 virus in such a way as to correct previous under-reporting. The Communist Party also fired its top officials responsible for the city of Wuhan and the region of Hubei, the outbreak’s epicenter.
The outbreak was indirectly behind a 6.3% drop in Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), which warned after the closing bell on Wednesday that related macroeconomic uncertainty was likely to depress investment spending by businesses. Cisco, a maker of routers and other telecoms gear, is viewed by some a good rough proxy for business investment.
Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) stock was another big loser, the food group losing 7.9% after reporting a steeper drop in organic sales for the last quarter of 2019 than had been expected. Overall organic sales fell 2.2%, rather than the 0.9% forecast, while U.S. sales fell by an even sharper 2.7%.
Among the biggest gainers was e-commerce company Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), which shrugged off valuation-driven downgrades from   Credit Suisse   (SIX:CSGN) and others after soaring on the back of better-than-expected earnings on Wednesday.
Also making a big move up was insurance giant AIG (NYSE:AIG), whose core underwriting business returned to profit in the fourth quarter from a $1.1 billion loss a year earlier.
Oil and gas stocks remained under pressure after the International Energy Agency joined OPEC and the U.S. government in slashing its forecasts for global oil demand. The IEA said global demand growth would fall by 325,000 barrels a day on average this year, while demand could drop in absolute terms in the first quarter due to the Covid-19 outbreak. 
  Exxon Mobil   (NYSE:XOM) fell 0.2%, while   Marathon Oil   (NYSE:MRO) - an upstream exploration and production specialist - fell 7.2% to its lowest in two and a half years.
U.S. crude futures managed a 0.6% bounce from oversold levels, while gold futures also rebounded 0.5%. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of developed-market currencies, was flat near a four-month high of 98.930. The dollar also advanced further against emerging market currencies."

The S&P 500 Index opened lower, a day after hitting fresh records, as the jump in infections undercut optimism the spread of the virus was slowing. Treasuries trimmed an earlier gain after a mixed reading of American consumer prices.
“The sudden sharp re-acceleration in new coronavirus infections in China has investors reassessing risk,” said Alec Young, managing director of global markets research at FTSE Russell. “Given the inherent uncertainty of this macro risk, we believe a focus on the bottom line can be helpful. While China and travel-focused companies are obviously most vulnerable, as long as the economic impact on the U.S. economy remains modest, expect U.S. equities to maintain their relative immunity to the virus.”
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index was on pace for its biggest drop this month. The euro traded near the lowest since 2017, while the U.K. pound gained and gilts retreated after Sajid Javid quit as Chancellor of the Exchequer. The FTSE 100 Index also declined.
Investor sentiment had improved in recent sessions amid speculation the impact from the coronavirus outbreak on global growth would be short-lived. That assumption was thrown into doubt when Hubei, the province at the center of the epidemic, reported almost 15,000 new cases after it revised its data to include “clinically diagnosed” cases in its daily disclosure.
In company news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. shares fell after the carmaker announced plans to offer about $2 billion of common stock.  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. fell after warning that its revenue growth will be negatively impacted in the March quarter.  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc slipped as the bank revealed British regulators are probing Chief Executive Officer Jes Staley’s relationship with financier Jeffrey Epstein.
Elsewhere, stock gauges in Japan, Shanghai, Hong Kong and South Korea all declined, though shares in Australia edged higher. Oil continued Wednesday’s surge even as the International Energy Agency said the coronavirus means global demand will drop this quarter for the first time in over a decade.

(Reuters) -  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd warned of a drop in revenues at its key e-commerce businesses this quarter as the coronavirus sweeping China hits supply chains and deliveries.
The warning from executives came during an earnings call for the quarter ending in December 2019, during which the company beat analyst estimates and brought in record transactions for its annual Singles' Day shopping event.
CEO Daniel Zhang said the delayed return to work following the Lunar New Year, due to the virus outbreak which has killed more than 1,350 people in China and infected thousands more, had caused problems for merchants and delays in fulfilling orders.
He said food delivery orders had dropped year-on-year due to the number of restaurants that had closed as a result of the outbreak. And while the company has seen a surge in demand for goods from its Hema supermarkets, it has been held back by limited delivery capacity.
Finance chief Maggie Wu said most of Alibaba's businesses that rely on the sale of physical goods would likely see a decline in revenues this quarter.
""We like other businesses are not immune to supply and demand,"" she said. ""Their recovery and long term success will translate to long term growth for Alibaba Group.""
Despite the downbeat forecast, Zhang said that as of Monday Alibaba had observed more people in large cities going back to work and logistics networks returning to normal operations.
He also said DingTalk, the company's enterprise chat app, had seen ""explosive growth"" during the crisis as white collar businesses and schools use it for remote working and online lessons.
""Alibaba's earnings for the next couple of quarters are certainly likely to take a hit from the coronavirus outbreak. However, the company's business is strong enough to withstand the brief downturn, with its cloud computing business set to lead the charge for a more positive outlook,"" said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at financial markets platform Investing.com.
Q3 BEATS FORECASTS
Alibaba usually reports its highest revenue in the December quarter due to its mega Singles' Day shopping bonanza in November. The company said sales during the 24-hour event hit a record $38.4 billion in 2019.
The group primarily generates revenue by selling advertising and promotional services to third-party merchants that list products on its e-commerce sites, Taobao and Tmall.
The company said it was supporting the fight against the coronavirus outbreak by ensuring supply of daily necessities and introducing relief measures for its merchants.
Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial's MYBank unit has said it will offer 20 billion yuan ($2.9 billion) in loans to companies in China in the wake of the outbreak.
The outbreak, which originated in the city of Wuhan, has resulted in companies laying off workers, seeking cheaper funding and struggling to restart production after an extended Lunar New year holiday, as supply chains are disrupted.
Alibaba is often viewed as a window into the health of China's consumer economy, which Beijing views as key to continued economic growth.
The epidemic is expected to pile more pressure on China's economy, just as the government had hoped a preliminary deal with the United States would ease a protracted trade war that had weighed on its growth.
Sales in Alibaba's core commerce business jumped 38% to 141.48 billion yuan in its third quarter ended Dec. 31, while revenue at its cloud computing unit surged 62% to 10.72 billion.
Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders rose to 52.31 billion yuan from 33.05 billion.
Excluding items, the company earned 18.19 yuan per American Depository Share (ADS). Analysts had expected 15.75 yuan per ADS, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's financial regulators are probing historical links between  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Chief Executive Jes Staley and the U.S. financier Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, the bank said on Thursday.
Barclays said its board had looked into media reports on Staley's relationship with Epstein, and probed Staley's characterization of it. The Financial Conduct Authority and the  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority are investigating. 
The bank said its board believes Staley has been sufficiently transparent about his ties to Epstein, whom Staley said he had not seen since taking over as Barclays CEO in 2015.
Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Staley said he regretted his relationship with Epstein, which began in 2000 while he was employed by JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and ""tapered off significantly"" after he left the Wall Street lender. 
The relationship ended in late 2015, Staley said.
""I thought I knew him well, and I didn't. I'm sure with hindsight of what we all know now, I deeply regret having had any relationship with Jeffrey Epstein,"" he said. 
The New York Times last year said that Epstein had referred ""dozens"" of wealthy clients to Staley when the CEO ran JPMorgan's private banking business. 
It also reported that Staley visited Epstein in prison when he was serving a sentence between 2008-09 for soliciting prostitution.
Staley also went to Epstein's private island in 2015, Bloomberg reported.
Barclays has previously said that Staley never engaged or paid fees to Epstein to advise him or provide professional services.
The probe is the second regulatory investigation into Staley's conduct in recent years, after the FCA and PRA fined him 642,000 pounds in 2018 for trying to identify a whistleblower who sent letters criticizing a Barclays employee.
Barclays shares fell 3.4% on Thursday morning.
Staley received a bumper pay package of 5.9 million pounds ($7.64 million) in 2019, up from 3.36 million a year earlier. The sum was boosted by the paying out of a long-term incentive plan worth 1.48 million pounds. 
His bonus also rose to 1.65 million pounds, reflecting the bank's strong annual performance.
Both Staley and Finance Director Tushar Morzaria took cuts to their pension allowances in 2019, and will now receive fixed cash contributions equating to 10% of salary in line with the broader workforce. 
Lower-paid employees will see their employer pension contributions rise to 12%. 
The bank meanwhile reported a better-than-expected profit before tax of 6.2 billion pounds for 2019, as its investment bank reported bumper returns from fixed-income trading.
Its profit was 9% higher than in 2018 and above the 5.7 billion pound average of analysts' forecasts compiled by the bank.
The British lender also reiterated its ambition of achieving a 10% return on equity this year, although it repeated a warning from October that the worsening economic outlook might make reaching that target difficult. 
Staley has said that Barclays' mix of investment and retail banking businesses should partly insulate it from economic and market fluctuations.

Barclays paid a dividend of 9 pence for the year, compared with 6.5 pence for 2018, as its core capital ratio came in at a better-than-expected 13.8%.

Investing.com -- Stocks in focus in premarket trade on Thursday, 13th February. Please refresh for updates.
9:03 AM ET: BorgWarner (NYSE:BWA) stock was up 1.2% after announcing profit and revenue ahead of expectations for the three months through December. The auto supplier is still trading well below the level it was at before announcing the acquisition of rival Delphi, however.

9 AM ET: Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) stock was up 0.6%, extending its outperformance after reporting earnings on Wednesday that were well ahead of expectations.
That’s despite downgrades on valuation concerns from   Credit Suisse   (SIX:CSGN) and others since the move.

8:57 AM ET: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock rose 2.4% after the company said it expects to reopen some of its stores in Beijing from tomorrow. Albeit with reduced opening hours.

8:54 AM ET: Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) stock fell 1.9% after organic sales growth in the final quarter of 2019 came in below expectations.
U.S. organic sales fell 2.7% in the quarter, while overall organic sales fell 2.2%, more than the drop of 0.9% expected. The company still met forecasts for profit.

8:48 AM ET: Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock fell 4.4% after the company said it wants to sell up to $2 billion in new stock to strengthen its balance sheet.

CEO Elon Musk has indicated he will buy up to $10 million of stock, or 0.5% of the shares on offer. That would result in a modest dilution of his holding in the company.

MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) stock fell 2.9% after the company scrapped its guidance for the year, unable to quantify the hit to earnings from the closure of its casinos in Macau due to the Covid-19 outbreak.

The company also said long-serving CEO Jim Murren will step down ahead of schedule. He’ll stay on until a successor has been found. Murren had been responsible for diversifying MGM away from the casino business and into a broader portfolio of entertainment and hospitality operations.

Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) fell 5.4% after predicting a prolonged soft patch in revenue as uncertainty caused by the Covid-19 outbreak keeps businesses away from making major investment decisions.

The company expects revenue to fall by between 1.5% and 3.5% in the current quarter.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) said on Thursday it would launch its first direct U.S. flight to Bangalore from Seattle, a new route meant to meet corporate customers' demand for travel to the center of India's high-tech industry.
As part of the launch targeted for October, American is expanding its codeshare with Seattle-based Alaska Airlines (N:ALK), which is expected to help feed passengers on American's international routes out of the city.
Alaska Airlines is one of the biggest operators of flights along the West Coast, where businesses from Seattle to San Diego have bases of operation in Bangalore, and American is one of the largest U.S. long-haul carriers.
""Bangalore is one of our highest demand destinations for our corporate accounts, really all over the country,"" Vasu Raja, American's senior vice president of network strategy, told Reuters.
The partnership with Alaska will provide connections through Seattle to Bangalore from 100 U.S. cities, he said, citing demand from markets as vast as Boston, Raleigh, Austin, Chicago and the West Coast.
The new Bangalore route, which American plans to service with a Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787-9, will be the carrier's only U.S. flight to India since it stopped flying to Delhi in 2012.
There is more demand for business class seats to India than the last time American flew there - partially due to improved premium cabins with lay flat seats - making flights more viable, Raja said.
American continues to see strong bookings across the world despite a recent drop in demand to China following the coronavirus outbreak, he said, adding that by building up networks and partnerships, airlines can be more nimble in terms of adjusting to any fall-offs in demand.
By teaming up with Alaska Airlines, American can also explore new markets in South East Asia and the South Pacific from Seattle that were previously beyond the carrier's range, Raja said.
The two airlines will expand their codeshare to include international routes from Los Angeles and Seattle, and Alaska Airlines intends to join the oneworld alliance by summer 2021, the two companies said.
Current oneworld members include American and British Airways, which is part of the International Airlines Group (L:ICAG).
American said it also plans to add a direct route between Seattle and London in March next year."

The iPhone manufacturer said on Feb. 8 it was extending its retail store closures in China, even as it worked toward opening its corporate offices and contact centers.
Its decision to shut its stores came after local authorities across China imposed travel curbs and warned residents to stay away from public areas in a bid to curb the spread of the coronavirus, which has so far killed 1,367 people.
Its five stores in Beijing will open from Feb. 14 between 11 a.m. and 6 p.m., according to Apple's website, shorter than its usual hours of 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Stores in cities such as Shanghai and Shenzhen remain shut. 
""In view of public health and prevention, some of our retail stores are temporarily closed,"" it said in a notice on its website, which also asked customers visiting outlets that were open to wear a mask and cooperate with temperature taking. 

Apple was not immediately available for comment.

The Chinese e-commerce giant made the comments after reporting revenue for the December quarter that surged to 161.5 billion yuan ($23.1 billion), versus projections for 159.5 billion yuan. The company reported a 58% rise in net income to 52.3 billion yuan.
But Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang and Chief Financial Officer Maggie Wu also focused on fallout from the deadly virus and its effect on employees, suppliers and merchants. Alibaba is the first major Chinese technology corporation to report results since the epidemic emerged in January.
It is “really difficulty to have an estimate on March quarter” because it is only halfway through period, Wu said in a conference call after the results. “Overall revenue will be negatively impacted.”
Zhang explained that many merchants that work with the company have not been able to return to normal operations because of a shortage of employees. He warned that the core e-commerce business suffered a negative impact in the first two weeks after the Lunar New Year holiday. Restaurant orders and travel bookings have also taken hits.
“It will present near term challenges to Alibaba’s businesses across the board,” he said on the conference call, adding that there will also be opportunities.
Alibaba is rolling out special programs to support merchants, including lowering the fees it charges and providing subsidies for delivery personnel. Zhang said the company is trying to keep its own workers safe, including having many work from home.
“We took every effort to protect the safety of our employees,” he said.
Alibaba shares slid about 3% in pre-market U.S. trading.
Already, China’s most valuable corporation has struggled to sustain growth during an economic slowdown in its home market, and is now grappling also with the uncertainty of the coronavirus outbreak. While widespread home confinement is spurring demand for online services from grocery delivery to office apps to streaming entertainment, the disease is snarling nationwide transport and threatens in the long run to dent the consumer spending Alibaba depends on.
“There’s certainly some short-term challenges as the merchants and delivery networks are all bottlenecked,” Hong Kong-based Bernstein analyst David Dai said before the earnings were released. “But in the mid to long term, people are getting more used to shopping online. Grocery, the most difficult-to-penetrate segment, is also moving online because of this.”

This week, the company declared a waiver of some service fees for merchants on its main direct-to-consumer Tmall platform to help those struggling with the fallout from the outbreak. That may further depress the top-line in 2020.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
Alibaba’s decision to waive platform service fees in the first half of the year, to support Tmall merchants, not only dampens revenue, but also signals that online retail may not be immune to China’s coronavirus outbreak. This increases the possibility of downbeat guidance for the March and June quarters in the company’s earnings report on Thursday.

FRANKFURT/ NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam, ousted over a spying scandal, stands to collect as much as 30 million Swiss francs ($30 million) after resigning this month, two people familiar with the matter said.
The compensation for Thiam, including pay, bonus and stock options, marks the end of a five-year reign at Switzerland's second-largest bank that ended after a split with the chairman following revelations of spying on top managers.
Thiam has denied any knowledge of staff surveillance, which first came to light in September when former executive Iqbal Khan confronted a private detective who was following him through Zurich.
The package would make Thiam, who has on average been awarded roughly 10 million francs annually by the bank in the three years to 2018, one of the highest-paid European bank chiefs. Credit Suisse declined to comment.
High executive payouts at the bank have irked its investors, prompting a protest in 2017. During Thiam's tenure, its share price has fallen by almost half as it raised fresh funds from investors.
Thiam, however, is entitled to the money because he is resigning from the bank this week officially on good terms, which means there is no need for the management board to dock his pay.
He nonetheless departs under a cloud. Although Credit Suisse cleared Tidjane of snooping on former star manager Khan, the suicide of a private investigator involved and the emergence of a second spying case as it sought to draw a line under the first sparked an outcry in Switzerland. The scandal rattled faith in the Swiss bank, a pillar of the local economy that was founded to finance the building of the nation's rail network that tunnels through the Alps.
Credit Suisse has said Thiam was unaware of the surveillance and that former Chief Operating Officer Pierre-Olivier Bouee, a longtime Thiam aide, initiated it in a solo run. He was since fired and has not commented publicly.
Ultimately chairman Urs Rohner won board backing to ask Thiam to leave, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.
For many investors, Thiam leaves behind a mixed legacy.
""He took out 4 billion francs of costs. That was critical,"" said Andreas Venditti, an analyst at Vontobel. ""On the downside, he had to cut his original targets because they were too optimistic.""
As he handed over to his successor on Thursday at a press conference, Thiam took issue again with what he described as false reports, including one that he had chartered helicopters for work.
""I've given five years of my life to this company, it's not nothing,"" he said. ""Now I'm going to go and get some rest."""
103,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2020 08:07AM ET</span>",Southwest extends 737 MAX flight cancellations through early August,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) on Thursday extended its cancellation of 737 MAX flights through early August as the grounding of the  Boeing Co  (N:BA) jet continued and threatened to impact nearly all of the busy U.S. summer travel season.
Southwest, the largest operator of 737 MAX airplanes worldwide, said it would now keep the aircraft off its flight schedule until Aug. 10, instead of through June 6.
The revision will remove roughly 371 weekday flights from its total peak-day schedule of more than 4,000 daily flights, which is about 10% higher than the 330 weekly flights it said were being cut through June 6.
 American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) and United Airlines Co (O:UAL) have both canceled flights into June.
Boeing did not immediately comment, but said last Thursday it was standing by its ""present mid-2020 estimate for return to service"" of the best-selling MAX, which has been grounded worldwide since March after two fatal crashes killed 346 people.
The Federal Aviation Administration declined to comment.
One unresolved issue remains over whether Boeing will need to adopt design changes to address two bundles of wiring that may be too close together, which potentially could lead to a short circuit and a crash if pilots do not respond appropriately. 
The issue has been under discussion by the FAA and Boeing for more than a month and it is not clear when it will be resolved.
Last week, Boeing said it was continuing to ""perform the appropriate analysis including lab testing, fleet data assessment and third party reviews."" It said it was ""premature to speculate as to whether this analysis will lead to any design changes.""

104,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2020 07:43AM ET</span>",Jet market oracle Tinseth bows out with Boeing at crossroads,"By Tim Hepher and Jamie Freed
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Years ago, when Randy Tinseth was still running Boeing's sales account for United Airlines, the plane company's designers pulled him aside.
""They called me in and said we want to show United this interesting product and we can't tell you about it until we get there,"" Tinseth recalled. ""We get to United and this dented silver case comes off the conveyer belt for bags and ... I don't even know what is in it.""
Out came the model of a futuristic, high-speed airliner called Sonic Cruiser.
But the plane never made it off the ground, as airlines in the early 2000s put more emphasis on efficiency than speed. The company quickly shifted to the high-tech but more conventional 787 Dreamliner - so quickly that rival Airbus suggested the Sonic Cruiser was just a bluff.
Tinseth, who recently told colleagues he plans to retire after 38 years at Boeing (NYSE:BA), said he had plenty of such stories about rollercoaster bets in an often-volatile industry.
""I remember it was a couple years of talking about (the Sonic Cruiser) and then it turned into the 7E7 and the 787,"" Tinseth said at the Singapore Airshow.
The 60-year-old Montana-born engineer has attended dozens of shows as one of the industry's most influential forecasters. This week's expo, thinly attended because of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus fears, is his last before stepping down as Boeing's vice president of marketing.
""In two days, you can get a sense of what is going on more than you ever could. This show is really about the virus without question, and it is about the MAX for us,"" he said, referring to the 11-month-old grounding of Boeing's best-selling model.
Eighteen years after the ambitious Sonic Cruiser project died, and in the midst of a crisis over the 737 MAX, which was involved in two high-profile fatal crashes, Boeing has shelved another mid-sized jet project for further study.
Whatever decisions Boeing takes now on mid-sized jets will shape its eventual path out of the MAX crisis, analysts say. So far, it has said abandoning the MAX and building a direct replacement is not an option.
Tinseth declined to be drawn into a discussion on the mid-sized airliner situation. ""The dynamic has changed. I'll leave it at that,"" he said.
But he sees the trend towards lighter, nimble jets started by the 787 continuing. Such aircraft allow airlines to start new routes unavailable to thirstier, larger planes.
And it is a trend that has paid off for Boeing, which sold 1,485 Dreamliners. But lately it has been on the losing side of the same battle, as airlines rushed to buy the smaller Airbus A321XLR.
BOOM AND VROOM
Tinseth began his career as a flight-test engineer on the aircraft the A321XLR and the potential Boeing mid-sized jet both aim to replace: the Boeing 757. With long wings and sporty engines, the out-of-production airliner remains his favourite Boeing model.
""When it takes off you feel the performance in the back of your neck,"" he said.
He said his favourite aircraft by a competitor was Airbus' strong-selling A350-900. But as usual in the jet marketing war, there was a sting in the tail.
""I think we have got a huge advantage, but it's a good airplane, unless you are under 5 feet tall and can't reach the bins,"" Tinseth joked. Airbus says its A350 overhead bins are among the largest.
Tinseth said curbing emissions would be the industry's main challenge of this century.
""There are innovations that I don't know yet, but we will find a way as an industry to innovate to address that problem,"" he said.
He poo-poohed as an old idea a ""blended-wing body"" airliner design Airbus presented this week, which Airbus says will greatly increase efficiency and reduce emissions.
The Singapore Airshow this week included a rare appearance of both U.S. and Chinese fighter aerial demonstrations at the same event. Combined with the coronavirus fears, it was a surreal atmosphere for many.
""It is kind of strange to go out on such a strange show but at the same time, it still probably makes this special,"" Tinseth said. ""I watched those airplanes flying today, the boom and the vroom."""

LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Google's battle against a $2.6 billion EU antitrust fine was dealt an apparent setback on Thursday, when one of the judges hearing the case said the company had committed a ""clear infraction"" in its handling of price-comparison shopping services.
The comments by Colm Mac Eochaidh, one of the panel of five judges, came on day two of a three-day hearing at Europe's General Court - its second highest - as Google (O:GOOGL) seeks to overturn the first of a trio of EU antitrust penalties.
In its 2017 decision to impose a 2.4-billion-euro ($2.6 billion) fine, the European Commission said the world's biggest internet search engine unfairly favoured its own price-comparison shopping service over smaller European rivals.
Irish judge Mac Eochaidh concurred.
""For me, this case really is visibility. This is a very important point in the case. It is perfectly apparent what has happened is this: you have promoted your own service and demoted that of others,"" he said. ""That is a clear infraction.""
Mac Eochaidh repeatedly asked Google what it had refused to supply to its competitors that had forced them to air their grievances to EU enforcers.
Google's lawyer Christopher Thomas faulted the Commission for not taking Amazon (O:AMZN) into account when defining the market for assessing the competitive harm caused by Google's practices.
Regulators were right to discount Amazon's role, said Thomas Hoppner, lawyer for several German complainants.
""Merchant platforms and CSSs (comparison shopping services) simply cater to different needs of different types of online retailers. These different needs mean that CSSs cannot easily be transformed into merchant platforms and vice versa,"" he said.
""The entire Google story that the condemned conduct was a means to compete with Amazon has no merits.""
Judges are expected to issue their ruling next year, which can be appealed to the Court of Justice, Europe's highest.
The case is T-612/17 Google and Alphabet v Commission."

TOULOUSE, France (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) pledged higher jet deliveries and operating profit this year, after an international bribery settlement and problems with the A400M transport plane plunged the aerospace group to a 1.36 billion euro ($1.48 billion) net loss for 2019.
A weaker sales outlook for the military transporter led to a 1.21 billion euro charge and will continue to weigh in coming years, Airbus said on Thursday. Its full-year loss also reflected a provision for last month's $4 billion settlement with prosecutors over past corrupt practices.
Adjusted operating income, excluding the charges and other one-offs, rose 19% to 6.95 billion euros and should top 7.5 billion in 2020, Airbus said. Revenue increased 11% to 70.48 billion.
Airbus turned in a ""strong underlying financial performance"", Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said, and will focus this year on operational and cost improvements as well as ""reinforcing our company culture."" Airbus shares were down 1.3% at 1002 GMT.
Airbus is well placed to benefit from the crisis surrounding arch-rival Boeing's (N:BA) 737 MAX airliner, grounded since last March after two deadly crashes. But production issues with the European group's own single-aisle A320 jet family may limit its ability to respond.
While setbacks with the A321's new ""ACF"" cabin design have been mostly resolved, Faury said, Airbus plans to raise single-aisle production by only ""one or two"" planes after hitting its monthly goal of 63 for 2021.
The group also announced a deal to buy Canadian group Bombardier's (TO:BBDb) remaining stake in the A220 jet programme, part of a market for smaller passenger planes shaping up to be another major battleground with Boeing.
'WHAT WAS INAPPROPRIATE IS BEHIND US'
Airbus played down the potential damage from the virus outbreak currently rattling airlines and the broader global economy - endorsing traffic growth forecasts that ""assume no major disruptions, including from the coronavirus.""
Faury acknowledged some Chinese airlines had requested ""very short-term"" postponements of new jet deliveries that he described as logistical. Airbus is targeting about 880 commercial jet deliveries this year.
The bribery settlement, which has prompted investigations by foreign governments and some protests that they were not forewarned, remains positive for the ""vast majority"" of ongoing customer relationships, the Airbus CEO said.
""It's very important to show that face and make sure what was inappropriate is behind us,"" Faury said. ""There are a few cases that need to be mitigated ... but not that many.""
Raising its proposed dividend by 9% to 1.80 euros per share, Airbus predicted full-year free cash flow of around 4 billion euros, up from 3.509 billion in 2019.
The A400M earnings hit comes on top of billions of past charges for Europe's biggest defence project, which has been a financial thorn in Airbus' side for more than a decade.
The programme delivered 14 planes in 2019, on schedule, but now faces ""increasingly challenging"" obstacles including repeated extensions to a German export ban on Saudi Arabia, Airbus said. The group said it expected about 2 billion euros in further related losses by mid-decade.
For the fourth quarter, adjusted operating income fell 9% to 2.81 billion euros, ahead of the 2.74 billion expected by analysts, according to an Airbus poll. Quarterly revenue rose 4% to 24.31 billion euros.

AIG, one of the largest insurers in the United States, posted an underwriting income of $12 million in its general insurance business for the quarter, compared with a loss of $1.07 billion, a year earlier.
Underwriting income is the difference between premiums an insurer collects on policies and claims it pays out.
Net pre-tax catastrophe loss at the general insurance unit narrowed to $411 million from $826 million, a year earlier. 
AIG is in the midst of a turnaround effort launched by Chief Executive Officer Brian Duperreault, who joined the insurer in 2017.
Duperreault has been overhauling the underwriting culture at AIG's general insurance business, through initiatives including raising rates and shedding unprofitable lines.
AIG's general insurance business posted an underwriting profit in the first quarter of 2019, the first since 2007.
Total net investment income rose 30% to $3.6 billion in the reported quarter.
AIG's general insurance accident year combined ratio, a key metric, which excludes changes from losses incurred in past years was 95.8 for the quarter, compared with 98.8 a year earlier.
A ratio below 100 means the insurer earned more in premiums than it paid out in claims.
Net income attributable to the company's shareholders was $922 million, or $1.03 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared to a loss of $622 million, or 70 cents per share, a year earlier.
On an adjusted basis, AIG earned $1.03 per share, beating Refinitiv estimates of $1.00. 
The insurer also said it expects to pay $1.7 billion as part of a tax settlement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, which could be made as early as the first quarter of 2020. 

The settlement amount, which AIG had previously disclosed, is related to cross-border financing transactions dating back to 1997.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open lower Thursday, retracing after a series of record highs as the number of people officially recorded as being affected by the coronavirus outbreak in China soared.
At 7:00 AM ET (1200 GMT), futures for the S&P 500 traded 24 points, or 0.7%, lower, futures for the Nasdaq down 75 points, or 0.8%, while the Dow Jones futures contract fell 211 points, or 0.7%. 
China's Hubei province, where the Covid-19 virus is believed to have originated, reported 242 new deaths late Wednesday, double the previous day's toll, and confirmed 14,840 new cases. This pushed the national death toll above 1,350 - with almost 60,000 infections in total.
The rise in the number of Hubei cases came as officials adopted a new methodology for counting infections, effectively lowering the bar for classifying new infections.
This dent to sentiment presented a selling opportunity, particularly as Wall Street notched Wednesday a third-straight record close this week. The S&P 500 rose 0.7%, the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.9% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 0.9%. U.S. stocks have been having their best month since June last year.
With China in mind, e-commerce giant   Alibaba   (NYSE:BABA) reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue, as its core e-commerce and Cloud computing businesses posted steady growth. These results, however, are for the three-month period just before the coronavirus outbreak.
Elsewhere, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is likely to be in the spotlight after announcing the recall of 15,000 Model X SUVs because of concerns over the potential loss of power steering.
Shares in Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) will be in focus after offering up a lackluster forecast for third-quarter revenue and profit, while MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) scrapped its earnings guidance for 2020 and announced that chief executive James Murren was leaving ahead of schedule.
Inflation numbers lead Thursday’s economic calendar, with the January consumer price index due at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT). This is expected to have risen 0.2% last month, the same as it rose in December
At the same time, weekly initial jobless claims figures will also be released, with claims for first-time unemployment benefits for the week seen bouncing up to 210,000 from the unexpectedly low 202,000 seen the week before.
Elsewhere, the oil market fell back Thursday, after the International Energy Agency said late Wednesday that global oil demand will drop this quarter, by 435,000 barrels a day, for the first time in over a decade on the back of the coronavirus damage.
AT 07:00 AM ET (1200 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 0.4% lower at $50.98 a barrel, after having fallen below $50 to a one-year low last week. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.9% to $55.31. 
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.4% to $1,577.15 a troy ounce, while EUR/USD traded at $1.0856, its lowest level since May 2017."

The efinancialcareers website reported that SocGen would cut 120 staff from its London-based middle and back office workforce.
""Societe Generale UK's platform has proposed a local cost reduction plan impacting UK headcount, mainly across the support functions,"" a spokeswoman for Societe Generale in London said.
She said the decision followed a local review.
According to its website, SocGen employs 3,646 employees across Britain. They straddle corporate, investment and private banking, asset management, prime brokerage and clearing services.
The bank's management announced plans last year to cut 500 million euros ($543.55 million) in costs and to restructure its corporate and investment unit.
When reporting 2019 results last week, SocGen said it would reduce operating expenses in 2020 and maintain ""rigorous cost discipline""."

YOKOHAMA (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) on Thursday cut its annual operating profit forecast by 43%, hit by a slump in vehicle sales and heaping more pressure on new management to fix a company still reeling from the scandal surrounding former leader Carlos Ghosn.
Nissan's sharply waning earnings power has already prompted plans to slash jobs, close manufacturing sites and drop product offerings, sources have said, as the automaker steps back from an aggressive pursuit of market share championed by Ghosn.
The dismal outlook comes after Japan's No. 2 automaker posted its first quarterly net loss in nearly a decade, and contrasts with upbeat forecasts from rivals Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and Honda Motor Co (T:7267).
""We are making progress, but sales volumes have been weak so we need to do more restructuring than initially planned,"" Makoto Uchida, Nissan's new CEO and its third since September, told reporters.
He did not elaborate on what steps might be taken but added that the company's financial position would continue to be tough in the next business year as it would take time to repair profitability in the United States, its No. 2 market.
Nissan now expects operating income of 85 billion yen ($775 million) for the year to March, far less than an average forecast for 134.5 billion yen from 20 analysts polled by Refinitiv.
It also said it would not pay a dividend for the second half and that its annual dividend would be 10 yen per share, a steep drop from the 57 yen paid a year earlier.
VIRUS IMPACT 
The automaker, which has suspended operations in China due to the coronavirus epidemic, said it would restart output at three vehicle plants on Feb. 17. Two plants, including one in Hubei Province, the epicentre of the outbreak, will remain shut until at least Feb. 20.
The outbreak has also caused Nissan to reduce production at three domestic vehicle factories throughout February due to a lack of parts and logistics issues.
Nissan's global vehicle sales tumbled 11% during the quarter, its brand image hurt badly by years of heavy discounting in the United States and other countries.
Sales dropped 18% in the United States, with once popular models like its Rogue SUV crossover and its Sentra sedan falling out of favour. In China, the world's biggest auto market, sales slipped 0.6%. 
It now expects to sell 5.05 million vehicles for the entire year, which would be its weakest sales performance since 2013.
During the October-December third quarter, operating profit tumbled 78% and it booked a net loss of 26.1 billion yen.

Sources have said Nissan is set to eliminate at least 4,300 white-collar jobs and shut two manufacturing sites as part of broader plans to add at least 480 billion yen to its bottom line by 2023.
The moves, an expansion of a plan unveiled in July, will also include fewer car models, options and trims on offer, while marketing budgets as well as jobs at head offices in the United States and Europe will be slashed, the sources said.
Ghosn, who was also head of alliance partner  Renault  (PA:RENA), was arrested in Japan in November 2018, accused of understating his salary and using company funds for personal purposes. He has denied any wrongdoing, and staged a dramatic escape to Lebanon in December while awaiting trial. 

Nissan on Wednesday said it had filed a civil lawsuit in Japan against Ghosn, seeking 10 billion yen in damages over his alleged misconduct.

115,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2020 06:04AM ET</span>",China pushes for cheaper health insurance products to battle virus: sources,"By Sumeet Chatterjee, Cheng Leng and Zoey Zhang
HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - China is nudging insurers to work on cheaper medical cover linked to the coronavirus and is assuring them of fast-track approval for these new products, people with knowledge of the matter said.
The move will mark a shift in the Chinese insurance market where the bulk of existing products are essentially investment schemes and pure healthcare coverage accounts for only about a fifth of the total life insurance premium.
In the last one week, China Life (SS:601628),  China Pacific Insurance  (HK:2601), Ping An Insurance Group (SS:601318) and Zhong An Online P&C Insurance Co (HK:6060), among others, have included coverage for the virus in their existing medical insurance products, according to their websites.
At least half a dozen more are in the process of requesting approval for products with coronavirus coverage in the coming weeks, said the people, declining to be named as they were not authorized to speak to the media.
The scramble comes as the Chinese province of Hubei, at the epicenter of the outbreak, reported a record surge in the death toll on Thursday and as global health experts warned the epidemic could get far worse before it is brought under control.
China's Banking and Insurance Regulator (CBIRC) last week adjusted actuary rules for healthcare, accident and life insurance as well annuity insurance, which will help lower premiums for such insurance by 3% to 5%.
The sources said the lower premiums and push for cheaper, basic medical cover, were largely prompted by the need to deal with treatment for those who may get infected by the coronavirus. 
CBIRC did not respond to Reuters request for comment. 
QUICK APPROVALS, AWARENESS
Despite a weak government healthcare system, private health insurance has been slow to take off in China as insurers mainly catered to demand for high-margin investment-like insurance products.
The high cost of coverage for critical illness products, which typically exclude insurance for epidemics, has put them out of reach of many, industry officials said.
Beijing, however, has been pushing private insurance firms to expand their product coverage to ease pressure on the healthcare system, and as part of a broader crackdown on the sale of shadow banking-linked investment products by insurers.
As a result, health insurance in 2019 accounted for 23% of life premiums in China, up from just 8% in 2003, according to Fitch Ratings. In the United States, this figure is about 30% of the life premiums.
That share in China is expected to go up significantly in the near future as individuals rush to buy coverage for treatment of the new virus with a large number seeking admissions to private hospitals, the people said. 
The regulator has assured insurers of approvals to launch those products within a few days, they said, compared to the usual timeline of two weeks or more for investment-linked insurance products.
The premium charges for low-severity medical insurance, which will typically include virus treatment coverage, could be 15%-30% cheaper than the critical illness products, industry officials said.
The demand for products with basic healthcare coverage, including for coronavirus, is already soaring.
""There is no doubt that awareness for insurance will significantly increase in the near future,"" said Sam Radwan, president of consultant ENHANCE International, which advises China's top insurers.

""Customers will be more understanding of the need to buy these products as opposed to in the past when my clients had a very difficult time convincing customers to buy these products and the net result was acquisition costs were very high.""

SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese companies are rushing to access cheap funds via ""virus bonds"" as they capitalise on Beijing's efforts to channel money into virus-hit areas of the economy, but prospectuses show most of the funds so raised will be used for other purposes.
A Reuters analysis reveals only a third of the roughly 14 billion yuan ($2.01 billion) being raised under a new fast-track regulatory process for ""virus prevention and control bonds"" will actually be used for the cause.
A top glass maker, for instance, plans to deploy the bulk of the money raised to repay bank loans, and a property developer is raising money mostly to restock cash and repay debt.
Numerous companies ranging from drugmakers to food producers have announced plans over the past week to issue such virus bonds via the interbank market. But many say they will put just 10% of the cash in virus-related investments, a regulatory minimum for such issuance.
Some fundraising plans raise the concern that these companies could be exploiting regulatory loopholes and possibly crowding out other struggling smaller firms.
Virus bonds go through a faster approval process that takes just days, rather than weeks for other types of bonds. They also carry yields much lower than on other debt as state-controlled banks are encouraged to buy such instruments.
The virus epidemic has killed more than 1,350 people and sickened 60,000 in China, stretching the country's resources at a time when the economy is already slowing down..
The Shanghai Clearing House said on Feb. 5 that the first batch of virus bond issuers completed their deals just one day after making disclosures.
 Fuyao Glass  Industry Group (SS:600660) (HK:3606), a top Chinese glass maker, is raising 600 million yuan via a three-year virus bond, but the company said 500 million yuan will be used to repay bank loans.
The company said that 60 million yuan, or one-tenth of the proceeds, will be used to produce glass for ambulances, which are ""indispensable resources"" in virus-hit zones.
Huafa Group, a property developer in southern Guangdong province, said it is raising 1 billion yuan to fight the virus, citing the company's 20 million yuan worth of donations to the Red Cross. Half of the proceeds will be used to replenish liquidity and the rest will be used to repay debt, it said.
Pig-producer Muyuan Foods (SZ:002714) said about half of the proceeds from its planned 500 million yuan bond issuance will be used to repay bank loans, while the remainder will be used to ensure adequate meat supply during the outbreak.
Xiamen Airlines and Shenzhen Airlines are also issuing virus bonds, but will use most of the money to refinance debt.
Just two issuers - drugmakers Tasly Holdings Group and Jointown Pharmaceutical Group (SS:600998) - say all the money raised from the bonds will be used in the anti-virus campaign.
Jointown, the biggest private pharmaceutical firm in Hubei province, the virus epicenter, said it was facing challenges supplying facial masks, protective suits and medicines.
""We are under sustained stress in working capital and there is a liquidity shortage,"" said Jointown, which is issuing a 1 billion yuan virus bond. That bond was priced at a mere 92 basis points above treasury bills of the same tenor .
Sandra Chow, head of Asia-Pacific at CreditSights, an independent credit research company, said the policy of virus bond issuance is a form of credit easing.
""It is not being marketed as such, but that is the practical impact,"" she said. Most investors will be savvy and focus on the borrowers' fundamentals, whether they come with the 'virus bond' label or not, she said."
118,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 13, 2020 05:15AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Barclays Rocked by FCA Probe in CEO's Epstein Links,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Have the famous bullet-dodging skills of   Barclays   (LON:BARC) CEO Jes Staley finally failed him?
The man who survived the fallout for harassing a whistleblower, who saw off the threat of activist investor Edward Bramson and who rode out widespread discontent over bonus cuts (and his own generous pension allowance) has a new problem to deal with: his past friendship with the convicted, and deceased, sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) said on Thursday that U.K. regulators were investigating the relationship between the two men, amid concern that Staley may not have been entirely straight with the bank about it while interviewing for the CEO job in 2015.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) shares took the news badly, falling as much as 3.5% before recovering to be down only 2.3% by 5:15 AM ET (1015 GMT). The FTSE 100 was down 1.5% and the Stoxx 600 Banks index down 1.2% on a down day for markets that were spooked by a big jump in the number of coronavirus cases and deaths due to changes in the way Chinese authorities compiled their records.
The bank said in a statement to the London Stock Exchange that Staley still enjoys the “full confidence” of the board, which has unanimously recommended him for re-election at its annual shareholder meeting on May 2. It added that it’s cooperating “fully” with the investigation. According to previous reports, Staley had visited Epstein on his private island as late as 2015, just before taking the  Barclays  (LON:BARC) job. Staley said he had had no further communication with the convicted paedophile after taking over as CEO. 
The two had had a professional relationship since 2000, when Epstein was a client of the private bank at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), which was then run by Staley. 
The loss of Staley would risk destabilizing  Barclays  (LON:BARC) just a time when it is emerging from an acute and prolonged period of uncertainty. In recent months, not only has some of the risk around Brexit receded, but the bank has also drawn a line under the payment protection insurance scandal that lasted most of a decade.
Just as importantly, it appeared to have settled a long-running argument over what sort of bank it should be in the future. Shareholders voted decisively to back Staley’s commitment to a global investment bank – a decision that has paid off with an 11% rise in pretax profit at the unit last year and gains in market share as rivals such as   Deutsche Bank   (DE:DBKGn) and   Credit Suisse   (SIX:CSGN) scaled back their activities. Net profit rose 24% to 2.46 billion pounds.
All that gave the bank confidence to raise its final dividend to 6 pence, making 9p for the full year, a yield of around 5%. It also promised progressive dividend increases “supplemented with additional cash returns to shareholders, including share buybacks, as and when appropriate.”
However, the bank still had to warn that low interest rates and “global macroeconomic uncertainty” have made it less likely the bank will reach its target of a 10% return on tangible equity this year, as originally planned. Instead, Finance Director Tushar Morzaria said the bank “believes it can achieve meaningful improvements in returns in 2020.”"

The company will pay up to 7 million pounds ($9.08 million)for the Norway business' operating expenses in addition to funding its losses until the completion of the sale."
120,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 13, 2020 04:51AM ET</span>","JPMorgan Asset Bets on Treasuries, Aussie Dollar to Cope With Virus Impact","(Bloomberg) -- Follow Bloomberg on Telegram for all the investment news and analysis you need.
JPMorgan Asset Management is taking a two-pronged approach to trading the impact of the deadly coronavirus, buying Treasuries for safety but also the Aussie and Singapore dollars which it thinks have dropped too far.
The money manager is snapping up U.S. five- to 10-year notes as a hedge against a slowdown in the Chinese economy and also against some of the currency risk it is taking, said Julio Callegari, a fixed-income money manager at the firm that oversees $1.7 trillion. JPMorgan Asset is also buying Chinese government bonds on expectations the central bank will introduce more monetary stimulus.
“The virus will have a significant impact, but concentrated in the first quarter,” Callegari said of the effect on China’s economy. “We’ve added a bit of U.S. Treasuries, the idea is to have some quality duration,” while the Aussie has suffered a lot and could see some recovery, he said.
In turning bullish on Treasuries, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset joins the likes of  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) SA and Saxo Capital Markets.
BNP said earlier this week that U.S. 10-year yields may test lows of below 1.40% last seen in 2016, while Saxo Capital sees a risk they will slide below 1%. Benchmark yields declined to 1.58% early Thursday in London, compared with 1.92% at the end of December.
While Treasuries are attractive as a haven, the market’s knee-jerk response to the outbreak has also thrown up buying opportunities elsewhere, Callegari said.
Aussie Recovery
The Aussie has tumbled 4% versus the dollar this year with investors selling on speculation the shuttering of Chinese factories will sap demand for Australia’s commodity exports.
JPMorgan Asset expects the currency to bounce back, though given the prospect that the U.S. dollar will strengthen, it is choosing to buy the Aussie against Malaysia’s Malaysia’s ringgit.
The ringgit “should suffer more” than the Aussie if economic losses from the virus outbreak deepen, especially as the ringgit is closely correlated with the Chinese yuan, Callegari said.
The money manager also sees scope for Singapore’s dollar to rebound after the currency was sold off this month when the central bank said there’s room in its exchange-rate band to accommodate further weakness.
JPMorgan Asset is building its long Singapore-dollar position by buying it against the euro, he said.
Bearish Peso
The fund manager is also exploring going short on the Philippine peso by using it as a funding currency, though it has not yet had the opportunity to build up a position, Callegari said.
The peso will find it “hard to outperform from here,” he said. “If you have an alternative where there’s more value, then on a relative basis you could use the peso as a funder.”
JPMorgan Asset is long Chinese government bonds maturing in five-to-10 years on expectations policy makers will introduce additional monetary stimulus to cushion the economy from the impact of the coronavirus.
It’s not alone is seeing value here. The asset management units of UBS Group AG, Pictet Group and BNP Paribas SA have all been buying China’s sovereign and policy bank bonds on bets the virus outbreak will take a toll on the slowing economy.
Chinese bonds can act as a portfolio hedge and provide “decent” yield pick-up to Treasuries, Callegari said."

Schneider, who took the helm in 2017, had initially targeted mid-single-digit organic sales growth and an operating margin of 17.5-18.5% in 2020. The margin target was achieved a year early, with cost cuts helping to lift it to 17.6% last year.
""The guidance is probably not a surprise given what is happening in China - its second-biggest market and accounting for 8% of group sales - and the coronavirus,"" said Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Jon Cox.

Nestle shares, which have climbed more than 30% last year as investors acknowledged Schneider's progress, were down 1.8% by 0830 GMT.
Schneider said it was too early to quantify the financial impact on Nestle from the coronavirus outbreak in China. He said operations had resumed at the beginning of the week, albeit at a reduced rate because some staff had not been able to return to work.
The company reported full-year net profit up 24% at 12.6 billion Swiss francs ($12.89 billion), against a consensus forecast of 12.36 billion francs in a company-supplied analyst poll.
It proposed a dividend of 2.70 Swiss francs per share - its 25th consecutive increase.
Rival Unilever reported underlying sales growth of 1.5% in the final quarter of 2019, the slowest in a decade. Danone reports results on Feb. 26.
Under Schneider's leadership, Nestle has sought to focus on premium products in fast-growing market segments such as coffee and more recently in plant-based foods while retreating from slower-growth areas such as chocolate and processed meat.
Schneider has already conducted more than 50 transactions and reviews since 2017. (https://reut.rs/34b1H2z)
""Transactions, both acquisitions and divestments, have affected about 12% of our group sales over the last three years. You can expect to see roughly the same level of activity over the next three years,"" he said on Thursday."

Investing.com - European stock markets pushed lower Thursday, as a jump in the number of people recorded as being affected by the coronavirus in China prompted a rush to safe havens. This comes as the corporate earnings session enters full flow.
At 03:35 ET (0835 GMT), the U.K.'s FTSE index was trading 67 points, or 0.9%, lower, France's CAC 40 was down 12 points, or 0.2%, while the DAX lost 55 points, or 0.4%. The Stoxx 600 index, which represents a broad swathe of companies across 17 countries in Europe, traded 0.4% lower, having hit a new record high Wednesday. 
China's Hubei province, where the virus is believed to have originated, reported 242 new deaths late Wednesday, double the previous day's toll, and confirmed 14,840 new cases.
The rise in the number of Hubei cases, which came as officials adopted a new methodology for counting infections, is a ninefold increase from a day earlier.
The new methodology effectively lowers the bar for classifying new infections, contributing to the spike in cases, but this dent to sentiment was enough to present a selling opportunity after several days of gains.
That said, there has been a surge in earnings reports in Europe early Thursday, and these are likely to attract most of the attention.
Shares in   Barclays   (LON:BARC) dropped over 2% despite the U.K. bank raising its dividend after a strong fourth quarter and issuing an outlook free of the burdens of payment protection insurance. This news was overshadowed by the announcement of a probe by the Financial Conduct Authority into the relationship between CEO Jes Staley and the late sex offender Jeffery Epstein.
Shares in   Credit Suisse   (SIX:CSGN) dropped 2% despite posting a 69% rise in annual net profit on Thursday, its best numbers since 2010, just as Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam bids farewell to the Swiss banking giant.
It’s Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) that takes the plaudits from investors Thursday, as its shares climbed over 4% despite the German bank swinging to a net loss for the final quarter of 2019 as it booked a restructuring charge related to planned job cuts at the lender. It also lowered its dividend for the year, but these weak figures were still better than expected.
Away from the banking sector, shares in   Pernod Ricard   (PA:PERP) climbed 2.5% after the French premium spirits maker reported higher net profit and sales for the first half of its fiscal year. Still, it was forced to slash its full-year guidance, expecting the coronavirus outbreak to have a severe impact on its third fiscal quarter.
Shares in Nestle (SIX:NESN)fe ll 2% after delaying a key growth target as chief executive Mark Schneider pushes to achieve a turnround at the world's largest food company. The Swiss food giant also discarded its range of chocolate that used a new low-sugar technique, less than two years after it was launched. 
In some positive economic news, French unemployment fell unexpectedly in the final three months of last year to 8.1%, an 11-year low, from 8.5% in the third quarter, offering President Emmanuel Macron a boost on the economic front. But the hefty fall of German inflation on a monthly basis shows how far the European Central Bank has to go to try and get inflation in the eurozone back to target.
Elsewhere, the oil market sold off after the International Energy Agency slashed 365,000 barrels a day from its forecast for world oil demand this year due to the Covid-19 outbreak. Gold pushed higher. The U.S. dollar also saw gains, particularly against the euro, with the greenback profiting from safe haven inflows from emerging currencies and the euro.
AT 04:30 AM ET (0930 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% lower at $50.77 a barrel and the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.2% to $55.14. Additionally, gold futures rose 0.4% to $1,577.55/oz while EUR/USD traded at 1.0885, only just off an overnight low of $1.0865, which marked its lowest level since May 2017."

The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) fell 0.4% by 0803 GMT. The index had notched new highs in the last two sessions on optimism over what appeared to be a decline in new cases of infection in China.
But a jump in new cases after China deployed a new diagnostic method and a record rise in the death toll swiftly subdued risk appetite.
European sectors with heavy exposure to China, such as basic resources (SXPP) and automobile stocks (SXAP) fell 0.9% and 1.1%, respectively."

Presenting its goals for the 2021-2023 period, the company said revenue growth would be at least as high as the market's average in those years, with its return on sales increasing by 50 basis points a year.
""Ultimately, our goal is to take our rightful place among the frontrunners in paints and coatings, when it comes to both size and performance,"" said Chief Executive Thierry Vanlancker.
In 2017 Akzo promised frustrated shareholders it would improve profitability and refused to consider an unwanted takeover offer by U.S. rival PPG Industries (N:PPG).
Akzo then said it would increase return on sales to 15% by 2020. This week the maker of the Dulux and Flexa brand of paints said it was still on track to meet that target after the ratio improved to 12% last year.
The company is the world's third-largest paints and coatings maker by revenue, trailing U.S. rivals PPG and Sherwin-Williams (N:SHW).
As part of Akzo's defense strategy against PPG, Akzo sold its speciality chemicals business for 10 billion euros ($10.9 billion) to a group of buyers led by  Carlyle Group  (O:CG), with the proceeds distributed largely to shareholders."

ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) posted a 69% rise in annual net profit on Thursday in a bittersweet swan song for outgoing Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam.
Thiam quit after a spying scandal at the bank sparked a boardroom revolt and will leave formally on Friday. He will be replaced by company veteran Thomas Gottstein.
Gottstein said the group remained committed to its strategy and previously announced targets.
Net income rose to 3.419 billion Swiss francs ($3.50 billion) for the year. Analysts had on average expected Credit Suisse to generate 3.5 billion francs, according to a consensus of 13 analysts compiled by the bank.
Thiam spent much of his four and a half years at Credit Suisse trying to put the lender on a more stable footing - slashing costs and exiting riskier and more capital-intensive investment banking activities.
But his legacy will be defined by the spying controversy which saw Credit Suisse, one of the most high-profile names in European banking, admit to snooping on two former executives. The bank blamed the espionage on a rogue operation run by one of Thiam's closest lieutenants. Credit Suisse and Thiam have said the CEO knew nothing of the activities.
Even with the restructuring undertaken by Thiam, Credit Suisse is facing a tough operating environment with more competitors now focusing on wealth management, ultra-low interest rates and the threat from passive investing.
The bank lowered its 2019 and 2020 profitability targets in December, blaming a drop in dealmaking, negative interest rates and global trade tensions for the climbdown.
At 9%, the bank's return on tangible equity (RoTE) for 2019 matched the lowered expectation of above 8% it flagged in December. It had previously targeted 10-11%.
Over Thiam's tenure, operating costs have fallen by more than 20% while net revenue has shrunk nearly 13% since 2014, the last full-year before Thiam's arrival in July 2015.
For 2019, the group reached a cost/income ratio of 77.6%, its best since 2010.
On the downside, the investment banking and capital markets unit posted a loss in the fourth quarter of $59 million hit by a struggling M&A business and low bond underwriting volumes.
Its global markets business though ended the year a high, with a 73% surge in bond trading volumes in the fourth quarter and a 10% rise in equities.

The only divisions to have grown revenue since the former  Prudential  (LON:PRU) boss announced an overhaul in late 2015 has been International Wealth Management (IWM), a standalone unit managing money for the rich outside Asia and Switzerland, and the Swiss business previously under Gottstein.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asia's share market rally paused on Thursday, bonds rose and trade-exposed currencies fell as a sharp rise in new coronavirus deaths and infections dented hopes that its spread was slowing.
China's Hubei province, where the virus is believed to have originated, reported 242 new deaths, double the previous day's toll, and confirmed 14,840 new cases on Feb. 12.
The rise in the number of Hubei cases, which came as officials adopted a new methodology for counting infections, is a ninefold increase from a day earlier.
E-mini S&P 500 futures (ESc1) were down 0.4% by the afternoon, pointing to a fade in Wall Street's strong rally, while Futures for the EUROSTOXX 50 were 0.1 weaker.
Ten-year U.S. Treasuries fell below 1.6% (US10YT=RR), the yen strengthened past 110 per dollar and a rally in oil prices halted.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) snapped two days of 1% gains to sit 0.2% lower as most markets across the region posted modest declines.
""There is no panic on this,"" said Frank Benzimra, head of Asia equity strategy at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) in Hong Kong, since the dramatic rise seems so far to be contained to Hubei.
The new methodology effectively lowers the bar for classifying new infections, contributing to the spike in cases. It relies on computerized tomography scans to find signs of the virus, rather than waiting for slower ribonucleic acid tests for confirmation. Chinese officials said the method is only being used in Hubei.
Despite that context, the dent to sentiment was enough to present a selling opportunity after several days of gains.
The virus has also cast a shadow over life in Asia's financial markets, with Benzimra himself logged in from home and speaking to clients by phone as meetings are increasingly canceled, even in cities not subject to quarantine.
""Most markets were recouping their losses so that has offered maybe some excuse to sell Asian markets,"" he said. ""But there is not much energy in this.""
Japan's Nikkei (N225) fell 0.1%. Australia's ASX/S&P 200 index (AXJO) retreated from a record high. The Shanghai Composite (SSEC) fell 0.5% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng (HSI) was 0.3% softer. Gold rose 0.6% to $1574.86 per ounce.
MORE FORECASTS CUT
On Tuesday, markets had taken comfort from the World Health Organisation's (WHO) emergency program head describing the apparent slowdown in the epidemic's spread as ""very reassuring.""
Yet WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus had also warned that it should be viewed with extreme caution. ""This outbreak could still go in any direction,"" he said.
More than 1,300 people have died from the epidemic in China and the total number of cases in Hubei province now stands at 48,206.
Even before the rise in cases, economists were turning more bearish on the likely hit to China's growth as factories idle and supply chains are upended.
Citi on Wednesday again downgraded its 2020 GDP forecast for China to 5.3%. The bank had forecast it to be 5.8% in its January outlook, before cutting it to 5.5% two weeks ago.

132,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 13, 2020 01:24AM ET</span>",SoftBank’s Son Considers New Type of Fund for Startup Investing,"(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. founder Masayoshi Son said he is considering a new type of fund for startup investing, showing his determination to keep cutting deals after missteps with WeWork and several other companies.
The Japanese billionaire unveiled his $100 billion Vision Fund three years ago and had been planning on raising a similarly sized second Vision Fund. But as he discussed earnings in Tokyo Wednesday, he conceded that raising money from limited partners for the second fund has been difficult and he may instead make startup investments solely with SoftBank’s capital for a year or two.
“A lot of our planned investors have been worried by the trouble at WeWork and Uber and we heard their feedback,” Son said. “So before we officially launch SoftBank Vision Fund 2, maybe we start from a smaller scale and start from a shorter period in terms of investment as sort of a bridge.”
“So I’m beginning to think about that kind of two-step approach,” he said. “We have not made any official decision yet, but that’s one of the options that we started considering. Again, we have not come to a conclusion yet.”
Son’s somewhat opaque comments came after SoftBank reported that the Vision Fund had lost money for the second quarter in a row, reflecting the decreased value of startups it has backed. The Vision Fund lost 225.1 billion yen ($2.05 billion) for the three months ended in December, after losing 970.3 billion yen the quarter before including WeWork and Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc.
”Mr. Son said that he may consider delaying SVF2 or a smaller SVF2. Given our view that SVF2 is a big risk, this statement is welcome,” said Atul Goyal, an analyst at Jefferies Group, in a research report.
SoftBank set up the original Vision Fund with money from outside investors, led by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund and Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment Co. But for years before that, SoftBank made deals with its own capital, including early investments in  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. and Yahoo! (NASDAQ:AABA) Corp. During the dot-com boom, Son took stakes in hundreds of internet companies.
Indeed, before the first Vision Fund, SoftBank set up an entity called Delta Fund that was used for startup deals, including some that eventually were moved into the Vision Fund. Son could simply inject capital into that vehicle. SoftBank had weighed contributing $40 billion to $50 billion of its own capital for the second fund, people familiar with the matter have said.
“We can make investment on our own or we can work with partners, new or existing,” Son said.
He did explain that SoftBank continues to back startups with its own money.
“We made several investments because we do have a very good pipeline,” Son said Wednesday. “It’s a hundreds of billions yen level.”
He added that he is no longer targeting $108 billion for the second fund and wasn’t precise about what the expected size would be.
“We shouldn’t be postponed too long,” he said. “First, make it a little bit smaller for 1 to 2 years, raise some bridge money, while were are building a track record. Then once we have results, I want to raise an official second fund.”"

134,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 13, 2020 12:58AM ET</span>","All Eyes on Exxon, Chevron After BP Pledges to Be Carbon Neutral","(Bloomberg) --  BP  (LON:BP) Plc’s pledge to zero out all its carbon emissions by 2050 deepens the divide between major European and American oil producers on climate change, increasing the pressure for  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). and  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX) to do more.
The U.S. supermajors have only committed to reducing greenhouse gases from their own operations, which typically account for just 10% of fossil fuel pollution. BP on Wednesday followed Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc and Equinor ASA in pledging to offset emissions from the fuels they sell to customers, representing about 90% of the total.
“If we do see capital flowing into BP, that may force the U.S. majors to rethink the speed at which they move on carbon reduction targets,” said Noah Barrett, a Denver-based energy analyst at Janus Henderson, which manages $356 billion. Still, he doesn’t see “Chevron or Exxon adopting a BP-like strategy in the near future” as they “have historically been less aggressive in their shift away from traditional oil and gas.”
Concerns about global warming are increasingly reshaping investment policies, with BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). and  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT). becoming the latest high-profile investors to demand companies improve environmental, social and governance metrics, or ESG.
Exxon and Chevron, the West’s number one and three oil producers, say it’s not up to them to offset emissions from cars, factories and other polluters known in the industry as Scope 3. For Exxon, such emissions are the “result of choices consumers make.” Chevron says “well-designed policies and carbon pricing mechanisms” are needed.
But BP’s announcement “could be a real tipping point where the norm becomes taking responsibility” for customer emissions, said Kathy Mulvey, a campaign director at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “For a company to continue to stick their heads in the sand and refuse to take responsibility for those harmful impacts is not a sustainable business model.”
Exxon and Chevron do agree with the goals of the Paris Agreement, support a carbon tax and are committed to cleaning up emissions from their vast network of wells, refineries and pipelines. They joined the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative later than their European rivals but are still fully paid up members. They even lobbied against U.S President Donald Trump’s plan to roll back Obama-era emission standards.
The fundamental difference with European peers, however, is that neither is reducing commitment to their oil and gas business by chasing the crowd into lower-margin renewables such as wind and solar.
When asked about potentially following Shell into the power sector, Chevron CEO Mike Wirth was clear in an interview with Bloomberg News last year.
“We don’t see distinctive differentiating capabilities that would say, ‘wow we can do this better,’” he said. “And it’s inherently lower return than the other things we could invest money in.”
Chevron is investing in early-stage technologies that could help aid carbon capture and energy storage, but that’s a small fraction of its budget. The company helps customers clean up their energy usage by supplying gas for power generation that’s cleaner than coal, developing biofuels and adding renewable energy sources like wind and geothermal, it said in a statement.
Exxon CEO Darren Woods says the real answer to climate change will come through technologies that haven’t yet been invented. The company said in a statement it has invested more than $10 billion over the past 20 years in researching and developing low emissions technologies.
The oil giant is working on proprietary technologies that would reduce emissions in areas like aviation, heavy duty vehicles and industrial processes. “We can bring more value in the space where we don’t know what the solution is but we need one,” Woods said in an April interview. Exxon has pedigree in this field. It invented the lithium-ion battery in the 1970s.
This approach will likely come under attack at this year’s round of shareholder meetings in May. Both companies are being asked by Dutch activist investor group Follow This to align their strategies with the Paris Agreement. Exxon is asking the Securities and Exchange Commission to exclude that proposal from a shareholder vote, arguing it “seeks to micromanage” the company."

The country's flag carrier is reducing operations and trying to cut costs to ride out the impact of the epidemic and ""achieve a positive financial result"" for this year, it said in an emailed statement.
It has suspended all flights to and from mainland China since the end of January, directly affecting 70,000 visitors per month between the two countries, it said.
""The epidemic has significantly reduced the travel demand of domestic and international tourists in the Vietnam network,"" the company said, adding that its passengers on domestic routes have also fallen by 20%-30% over the past two weeks.
China, where the coronavirus epidemic has killed more than 1,300 people, is Vietnam's largest source of foreign tourists and largest trading partner. Chinese tourists accounted for one-third of the 18 million foreign tourists visiting Vietnam last year.
Vietnam Airlines' pre-tax profit rose 1.72% last year to $145.4 million.

The deal signals Bombardier's exit from commercial aviation by transferring its remaining interest in Airbus Canada to the main parent Airbus SE company and the government of the Canadian state of Quebec.
Bombardier will receive $591 million, net of adjustments, and will no longer have future funding capital requirements to Airbus Canada. The deal will secure more than 3,300 Airbus jobs in Quebec, the companies added.
Bombardier added that the transaction would also help the company - which faced a cash crunch in 2015 - improve its overall financial position.
""This transaction supports our efforts to address our capital structure and completes our strategic exit from commercial aerospace,"" said President and Chief Executive Alain Bellemare.

Hong Kong's retail sector, battered by months of often violent anti-government protests, is likely to suffer in the coming months as the outbreak in mainland China has emptied shopping centers and closed down tourist attractions.
Henderson Land (HK:0012) said it will cut February rent by 20% to 60% for its small- to medium-size tenants in retail, food and beverage, as well as education businesses following similar moves by its peers.
""Hong Kong's retail and food and beverage businesses have been greatly affected since February due to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus outbreak,"" Henderson Land said in an emailed statement on Thursday.
The city's largest property developer by value, Sun Hung Kai Properties (HK:0016), which owns major district malls that host international fashion brands ranging from Coach to Zara (MC:ITX), said on Wednesday it would reduce February rent by 30% to 50% for most of its tenants.
New World Development (HK:0017), whose tenants include many luxury brands, also said it would reduce the February rent, while MTR Corp (HK:0066), which runs malls on top some of its subway stations, said it would adjust rent for small-medium sized companies.
MTR also said it would launch relief measures for its chain and international brand tenants after collecting their sales data.
Link Real Estate Investment Trust (HK:0823) has set up a HK$80 million ($10.30 million) relief scheme for its community malls, including measures like allowing rent payment by installments, waiving off late payment interest and service charges, granting rent-free periods and reducing rents.
Separately, Sun Hung Kai Properties said home sales and hotel occupancy rates have been affected by the epidemic.
Hong Kong's economy contracted for the first time in a decade in 2019 and the worst yet to come, with no end in sight to the protests in the Chinese-ruled city and the virus outbreak in mainland China.
Hong Kong, which has confirmed 50 coronavirus cases and one death so far, has taken measures to reduce the number of visitors from China. The city's retail and tourism sectors rely heavily on spenders from the Chinese mainland.
The Chinese province of Hubei, which is at the epicenter of the virus, reported a record 14,840 new cases on Thursday under a new method for diagnosing cases.

Investing.com - Softbank Group Corp. (T:9984)’s shares in Japan dropped 2.8% on Thursday in Asia after the company said its quarterly profit dropped 99%. 
 
In a statement, SoftBank said its quarterly profit fell to 2.59 billion yen following steep losses related to its Vision Fund, which lost 225.1 billion yen for the quarter.
 
Overall, SoftBank reported a profit of about $501 million for the quarter, missing analysts’ expectations. Its profit was less than one-tenth of last year’s earnings.
 
Despite the results, founder and CEO of the company Masayoshi Son said the company was already turning the corner. 
 
“At the last earnings briefing, I used the words ‘I regret’ 20 times. But after a difficult winter always comes spring. The tide is turning,” Son told a briefing following the release of SoftBank earnings. He added that the Vision Fund is on track to return to profit in the current quarter.
 
The news came one day after the Japanese conglomerate said a US court approved the $26 billion merger between T-Mobile (TMUS) and Sprint (S), the carrier SoftBank acquired nearly a decade ago.
 
SoftBank’s shares surged as much as 14% on Wednesday following the merger news, before trading 2.8% lower today. "

MONTREAL/BEIJING/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A drop in airline flights from China and Hong Kong due to the coronavirus is increasing demand for private jets as wealthy passengers try to get out, executives say, but travel bans and nervous crew have kept that from translating to more business.
The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus outbreak, which has killed more than 1,300 people in China, has led premium Asian airlines like Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (HK:0293) and Singapore Airlines Ltd (SI:SIAL) to drastically cuts their flight schedules.
UK-based consultancy Ascend by Cirium said the number of flights scheduled to operate to, from and within China had dropped by 34% from Jan. 23 through Feb. 11.
Those cuts have left stranded passengers to rely on government-led evacuations. For those who can afford it, there are private jet charters carrying smaller groups and promising less risk of exposure to the virus, executives said.
Strict quarantine requirements, travel bans on Chinese citizens and concerns for crew safety have left only a limited pool of private jet operators willing to fly to China compared with the situation during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003, operators said.
""This time the operators and countries have put lots of restrictions on the usage of private jets to the countries affected by this virus,"" said Logan Ravishkansar, chief executive of Singapore-based charter operator MyJet Asia Pte Ltd. ""Business leaders are scared and confused to go in and out of Asia. Flight crews are afraid to fly as well.""
Private jet companies VistaJet and NetJets said they have suspended their China operations, while manufacturers Gulfstream and  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) canceled plans to market jets at this week's Singapore Airshow.
""While we are receiving an uptick in inquiries, it has not amounted to more flights,"" said Patrick Gallagher, president sales and marketing for Berkshire Hathaway Inc's (N:BRKa) NetJets.
A South American government asked PrivateFly, a global booking service for charter flights, to set up four flights out of Wuhan, the Chinese city at the center of the coronavirus outbreak, although the request might not be possible, chief executive Adam Twidell told Reuters.
Onboard a private jet carrying passengers away from coronavirus outbreaks, the volunteer flight crew and passengers would wear masks that they change every hour, and a medical crew would be dressed in full protective gear, he said. After the flight, the crew get three weeks of paid leave but must stay close to home.
Unlike a regular business jet flight, passengers would serve themselves food from a spread laid out in the cabin. 
""Movement during the flight is kept to a minimum and there is very little interaction between anyone onboard to reduce any chance of infection,"" Twidell said.
Jackie Wu, president of Hong Kong-based JetSolution Aviation Group, said her company had received a ""significant increase of private flight charter requests,"" from Asia.
The requests are mostly for flights departing from Hong Kong or China to destinations like Auckland, Taipei, Phnom Penh, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur.
She said she cannot fulfill about half of those requests because of travel bans on visitors from China."

The world's largest contract electronics maker, formally Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, is a supplier to tech giant Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and others.
It was among many businesses that shuttered their mainland China plants due to the coronavirus outbreak and subsequently delayed resuming output.
""Recently, Reuters reports on the group's overall resumption schedule for the mainland China plants are not factual, and Hon Hai hereby clarifies it,"" Foxconn said in the statement.
""In the past, the aforementioned media's reports related to the group's mainland China plants resumption are mostly not factual,"" it said, adding that the reports have caused ""misunderstandings and difficulties for employees, investors and the general public.""
When asked to clarify which aspects of the reports Foxconn was referring to, company spokesman Jimmy Huang told Reuters by telephone on Thursday that all elaborations were made in the statement to the stock exchange.
Reuters reported on Monday that Foxconn got the green light to reopen two major plants in China closed due to the coronavirus, citing a person with direct knowledge of the matter.

(Reuters) - E-cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc bought online advertisements on teen-focused websites for Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network and Seventeen magazine after it launched its product in 2015, according to a lawsuit filed on Wednesday by the Massachusetts attorney general's office.
The allegations in the lawsuit, stemming from a more than year-long investigation, contradict repeated claims by Juul executives that the company never intentionally targeted teenagers, even as its products became enormously popular among high-school and middle-school students in recent years.
The lawsuit filed by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said the company worked through online ad buyers to purchase space on websites that were ""highly attractive to children, adolescents in middle school and high school, and underage college students,"" including educational websites such as coolmath-games.com and socialstudiesforkids.com.
The attorney general's office said those ad purchases began in June 2015, when the product launched, and continued into 2016. Juul had the ability to put certain websites onto a ""blacklist"" that would prohibit ads from appearing there, according to the attorney general's office, but the company chose not to do that.
A Juul spokesman said in an emailed statement on Wednesday: ""While we have not yet reviewed the complaint, we remain focused on ... earning the trust of society by working cooperatively with attorneys general, regulators, public health officials ... to combat underage use.""
Over the past year Juul has faced a hail of criticism and regulatory scrutiny over its role in what public health officials call an ""epidemic"" of teenage nicotine addiction.
The lawsuit, filed in Suffolk County Superior Court in Boston, seeks unspecified damages from Juul to compensate those affected by nicotine addiction and to pay for the costs associated with ""combating this public health crisis,"" the Massachusetts attorney general's office said.
In addition to the online ad purchases, the lawsuit alleges that a marketing firm Juul hired ahead of its 2015 launch initially proposed an advertising campaign that would have positioned the firm as a ""technology company"" that had invented products that were ""better than cigarettes."" It contrasted the Juul vaping device with items such as boom boxes or retro mobile phones that are recognizable to adults, with the tagline ""everything changes, eventually.""
Juul rejected that campaign, according to the lawsuit, and instead chose a strategy meant to ""win with the cool crowd in critical markets,"" choosing to promote ""fashionable young people, frequently in a sexually provocative context."" Images from that marketing campaign in 2015 were used in the banner and video advertisements used on the teen-focused websites, according to the lawsuit.
Juul has previously said the early marketing campaign targeted young adults in their 20s and early 30s, not teenagers, but that it regretted the style of the advertising in hindsight.
The company in recent months has tried to revamp its image, as it faces a critical May regulatory deadline with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In September it brought on a new chief executive officer, K.C. Crosthwaite, a veteran of Marlboro maker  Altria Group  (NYSE:MO) Inc, who has restructured the company around gaining approval to sell its products in the United States."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The New York Stock Exchange has told the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission it does not believe it legally needs to make public the fees for a new high-speed connection to the exchange, questioning the scope of the regulator's authority.
The issue is part of a decade-long dispute between stock exchanges and brokerages, banks and asset managers over what the financial firms see as excessive fees for market access and essential data charged by the bourses, which became for-profit companies in the early 2000s.
The SEC has in recent years challenged the exchanges' ability to raise those fees if they do not adequately explain why increases are justified. In October 2018, the regulator retroactively overturned hundreds of exchange fee filings, leading to an ongoing legal appeal by the exchanges.
In a Feb. 11 SEC filing, the NYSE, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc, laid out the fees for a new microwave data transmission service run by an ICE (NYSE:ICE) affiliate. (https:// It will cost firms an initial $10,000 per connection and $9,000 to $45,000 per month, per connection, depending on the bandwidth requested.
At the same time, the exchange said that because of ICE's affiliate structure, there are instances in which it should not have to go through the filing process.
""The Exchange does not believe that the present proposed change is a change to the 'rules of an exchange' required to be filed with the Commission under the Act,"" the NYSE said, referring to the 1934 Exchange Act.
It said it made the filing only because the SEC's staff advised it to do so in order to meet its exchange obligations.
An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment.
In a market where microseconds separate winners and losers, the new service will arguably be the fastest way to access ICE's Mahwah, New Jersey, data center, where the exchange's electronic trades are executed, due to its proximity to New York City.
But because the service is run by an ICE affiliate that the NYSE does not control, the exchange said it should not have to file the fees with the SEC.
Doing so puts ICE's data affiliate at a disadvantage to other non-exchange affiliated vendors, it said, noting that while ICE's affiliate has exclusive access to the Mahwah data center property, three firms have wireless connections nearby, allowing them to compete.
Trading firm Virtu Financial blasted the NYSE's plan for exclusive access to the site last July, calling it monopolistic. [nL2N2521A1]"

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) is recalling 15,000 Model X SUVs because of a potential issue that can lead to a loss of power steering assist that could make steering harder and increase the risk of a crash.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and Transport Canada said aluminum bolts that attach the electric power steering gear assist motor to the gear housing may corrode and break causing a reduction or complete loss of power steering assist.
The recall applies to 2016 model year X vehicles. Tesla said the vehicles being recalled include most Model X vehicles built before mid-October 2016, but the move does not affect vehicles built after that date.Tesla issued a similar recall in March 2018 for 123,000 Model S vehicles worldwide built before April 2016 that called for replacing steering assist motor bolts.
NHTSA said there are no known crashes or injuries associated with the Model X recall. The recall covers 14,193 U.S. vehicles and 843 in Canada. Tesla will arrange for the replacement of the mounting bolts and will also replace the steering gear if needed, Transport Canada said.
Tesla said it has ""observed excessive corrosion on the bolts that attach this component to the steering gear in affected Model X vehicles"" and primarily in areas with very cold climates that use road salts. Tesla said if the bolts fail it would require ""more force to turn the steering wheel, especially during low speed parking maneuvers.""
Tesla said it was not aware of any injuries or collisions relating to the power steering component.
Tesla added drivers can continue to operate their Model X SUVs before the issue is addressed. Tesla said it will contact owners to schedule appointments when parts are available.
Tesla said it will also apply a corrosion-preventative sealer in all affected Model X vehicles to account for the possibility that vehicles may later be used in cold climates.

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

The company forecast adjusted profit of 79 cents to 81 cents per share, the midpoint of which was in line with analysts' estimate.
Revenue in the current quarter is expected to drop 1.5% to 3.5%, which translates to $12.51 billion to $12.77 billion, according to Reuters' calculations. Analysts are expecting revenue of $12.62 billion.
""We are seeing longer decision-making cycles across our customer segments for a variety of reasons, including macro uncertainty as well as unique geographical issues,"" Chief Executive Officer Chuck Robbins said on a post-earnings call.
""(Customers) are just a little cautious and trying to see what's going on.""
Cisco's infrastructure unit, which includes its traditional business of supplying switches and routers, posted an 8% drop in revenue to $6.53 billion.
The business has struggled as customers increasingly prefer using cloud-based services offered by companies such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) instead of upgrading their networks and servers.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean car giant  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380) has increasingly relied on China to supply auto parts to its manufacturing hub at home in recent years. As the coronavirus spreads, its strategy could be backfiring.
One of its main suppliers, Kyungshin, which has rapidly boosted capacity in China over the past two decades to capitalize on the country's lower labor costs and proximity to South Korea, has seen its operations hit hard by the epidemic.
Hundreds of workers failed to turn up for work last week at two of its four plants, in Jiangsu and Qingdao, following a Chinese New Year holiday that was extended due to the outbreak, according to a source familiar with the matter. In Jiangsu, only about 300 of the 600 employees who were due to return showed up, the source said.
Now Kyungshin, which supplies almost half of the wiring harnesses for Hyundai's auto electrical systems in the carmaker's South Korean manufacturing hub, is scrambling to make up for production shortfalls.
It has increased output at its factories in the United States, India, Cambodia and South Korea, according to three people with knowledge of the measures, who told Reuters the company was running its Korean plants around the clock.
As it falls behind schedule, the company plans to use planes as well as ships to speed up the transport of its parts to South Korea, added the sources who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.
Kyungshin said it was doing all it could to normalize parts supply.
Hyundai told Reuters it was reviewing various measures to minimize the disruption to its operations and ""ensure a stable and optimal production system.""
The carmaker's South Korean hub accounts for about 40% of its global production, with vehicles exported to the United States, Europe and Middle East as well as other countries.
The return to work by millions of people in China, where the coronavirus has killed more than 1,100 and infected over 44,000, has been marked by public fears over safety and mistrust of authorities.
Kyungshin's travails in part reflect those of several global automakers, including Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Ford (N:F),  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), and their suppliers who have seen operations disrupted by the coronavirus outbreak, highlighting their China exposure.
However, Hyundai and South Korean automakers have been hardest hit in their home market. Kyungshin, founded by a friend of Hyundai's former chairman 45 years ago, and a host of the carmaker's other South Korean suppliers have rapidly increased their capacity in China over the past two decades.
They have been able to swiftly supply not only Hyundai's Chinese factories, but increasingly its assembly lines back home.
""South Korean automakers are heavy on just-in-time delivery due to close geographic proximity to China. Other automakers have to carry more safety stock,"" said Paul Stepanek, president at Complete Manufacturing and Distribution, which advises companies on sourcing supplies in Asia.
""Therefore, when there is a crunch on supply chains, the South Korean automakers feel it faster.""
'NO CHOICE BUT CHINA'
In an illustration of South Korea's increase in outsourcing, the country's exports of auto parts to China have slumped by two-thirds over the past five years to $2.18 billion last year, while imports of parts made in China have risen by almost a fifth to $1.56 billion, according to South Korean trade data.
About 170 South Korean first and second-tier parts suppliers run a total of around 300 factories in China, according to South Korean auto industry association data.
(Graphic: Auto parts trade with China - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/CHINA-HEALTH-HYUNDAI-SUPPLIER/0H001R8B1BTX/index.html)
South Korea sources more than 80% of wiring harnesses from China, according to the government, as the parts require labor-intensive assembly and lower labor costs are crucial.
""Suppliers have no choice but to go to China because of cost pressure,"" said one of the sources of the supply disruption.
Another of the sources, a senior industry figure, told Reuters the latest disruption caused by the coronavirus outbreak had underscored how exposed Hyundai's South Korean operations were to problems in China.
""This is an opportunity to address that,"" the source told Reuters.
Analysts said that, while the disruption would put pressure on Hyundai to rethink its China strategy, diversifying supplies would take time, money and diplomacy.
""Hyundai had close relationships with local suppliers. It was not easy to go beyond the relationships,"" said Jo Hyung-je, an adviser to Hyundai and its union, referring to how many suppliers like Kyungshin have grown up with the automaker.
""They share a common destiny."""

""When you see trades around 50 cents in big blocks - 25,000, 50,000, 100,000 - people think of that historical trader,"" Murphy said. The unknown trader made such purchases in late 2017 leading up to the February 2018 sell-off in U.S. stocks, and similar trades have shown up periodically since then.
The block trades come ahead of March 3, when 16 U.S. states and territories hold contests toward determining the Democratic presidential nominee. Super Tuesday results are widely seen as a potential market mover, given that some of the biggest electoral prizes are up for grabs in those contests.
The VIX ended Wednesday's session at 13.74, down from 19.99 during trading on Jan. 31, when worries over the impact of the coronavirus outbreak lifted the index to its highest level in three months.
The VIX would need to hit 24 to make the calls purchased on Wednesday redeemable, though the price of the calls would generally increase as the index approached that number.
A similar position paid off last month, when at least one investor bought calls expiring in February priced at about 50 cents each in large blocks. [nL1N29X1BT] Some of those calls were later sold for an estimated profit of around $7 million on Jan. 31, according to options analytics provider Trade Alert.
March brings other events that also could hold sway over U.S. markets performance, Murphy said.
China is expected to release trade data for January and February, which could provide a glimpse into the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. [nB9N29N017] The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which is weighing further curbs on output, is scheduled to meet on March 5-6. [nL8N2AC4LH]
The calls are not necessarily outright bets on a surge in volatility. They can also be used to offset potential losses from a sharp fall in equity prices."

1. Retail Inflation Seen Rising, but Still Contained
Inflation numbers lead Thursday’s economic calendar, with the latest on retail prices arriving.
The Labor Department will issue the January consumer price index (CPI) at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).
The CPI is expected to have risen 0.2% last month, the same as it rose in December, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
The core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is forecast to have risen 0.2% for January as well.
At the same time, weekly initial jobless claims figures will also be released.
Claims for first-time unemployment benefits for the week are seen bouncing up to 210,000 from the unexpectedly low 202,000 seen the week before.
2. Nvidia Gives Insight on Chips
As strength in tech stocks continues, investors will be to Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings after the bell, which are traditionally very important for gauging the health of the semiconductor sector.
Nvidia is expected to post a quarterly profit of $1.66 per share, with revenue coming in at nearly $3 billion, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
The company got a big vote of confidence just before it’s scheduled to report.
Susquehanna boosted its price target on the stock today to $310 per share from $285, the highest price target on Wall Street at present.
“Overall, we believe that NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) is well positioned to outperform peers in (calendar) 2020 as they are set to benefit from a litany of upcoming 7nm launches throughout the year,” Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland said in a note.
“Additionally, we believe the company would report a beat-and-raise on Thursday night in a normal environment, but are unsure how management will treat the coronavirus when issuing guidance,” Rolland said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Republican lawmaker on Wednesday urged California to fire the chief investment officer of its public pension fund, the nation's largest, citing what he called the CIO's ""long and cozy"" relationship with Beijing, and assailed the fund's investments in Chinese companies.
In a letter to California Governor Gavin Newsom, U.S. Representative Jim Banks of Indiana said Yu Ben Meng, the CIO of California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS), should at least be investigated.
""Governor Newsom, if it were up to me, I would fire Mr. Meng immediately,"" Banks wrote in the letter.
""At the least, I think a thorough investigation of Mr. Meng's relationship to the Chinese Communist Party and a comparison of CalPERS investments in Chinese companies before and after Mr. Meng's 2008 hiring are both warranted,"" he added.
A U.S. citizen born in China, Meng has twice worked for CalPERS, the first time starting in 2008 and the second time beginning in January 2019 when he became CIO managing $400 billion in investments, according to the CalPERS website.
In between the CalPERS stints, Meng worked for three years as deputy CIO with China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE), which oversees China's U.S. Treasury security holdings, the website says.
Citing an online article in China's People's Daily, Banks asserted that China's Thousand Talents Program recruited Meng for the job at SAFE. According to the FBI, TTP is a part of ""China's non-traditional espionage against the United States.""
'REPREHENSIBLE ATTACK'
CalPERS CEO Marcie Frost defended Meng in a statement.
""This is a reprehensible attack on a U.S. citizen. We fully stand behind our Chief Investment Officer who came to CalPERS with a stellar international reputation,"" she said.
A CalPERS spokeswoman declined to provide a method to contact Meng, saying they had no further comment.
The Trump administration has been urging U.S. states to join the geopolitical battle with China. In a speech to governors on Saturday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged states to be vigilant against local threats ""with consequences for our foreign policy,"" specifically pointing to CalPERS.
""California's pension fund...is invested in companies that supply the People's Liberation Army that puts our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines at risk,"" Pompeo said.
Echoing Pompeo's comments, Banks specifically criticized CalPERS' investments in China's Hikvision, (SZ:002415) whose surveillance equipment is used in detention camps for China's minority Uighurs.
The Banks letter criticizes the fund for holding shares of China Communications Construction Co (SS:601800), which has helped build naval bases for Beijing in the South China Sea, it said.
CalPERS' Frost defended the holdings, saying, ""We've had a globally diversified portfolio for decades. This is a politically opportunistic attempt to force us to divest, undermining our ability to perform our fiduciary duty to provide retirement security to California's public employees."""

The A220-300 flight, traveling from Riga, Latvia, to Malaga, Spain, was diverted to Bordeaux because of a technical failure in the left engine, France's Bureau d'Enquêtes et 'Analyses (BEA) said on Twitter. The flight landed safely.
Airbus SE (PA:AIR) and United Technologies Corp, (N:UTX) maker of the Pratt PW1500G engines, confirmed in statements that they were aware of the flight and working ""to provide assistance"" as required.
The incident follows three emergency landings involving the GTF engine on Airbus's smallest jet, the A220.
""NTSB has accepted delegation for 3 previous incidents so NTSB will also look at the most recent incident,"" a spokesman for the U.S. government investigative agency said by email.
""NTSB is in the process of gathering initial data. It is still in the early stage of any investigation cannot make any conclusions at this time.""
Pratt & Whitney has said that a software update for the GTF engine on the A220 is expected in the spring, pending regulatory approval."

OTTAWA (Reuters) - A Canadian federal court has ordered a group of major agriculture companies to hand over records and communications in an antitrust probe sparked by allegations some businesses tried to block online farm-supply startup Farmers Business Network Inc (FBN).
In a series of court orders issued on Tuesday, Federal Court Justice Denis Gascon said he was satisfied that Canada's Competition Bureau was conducting an antitrust probe and that the named companies - which include  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN), Corteva Inc and BASF - would have or were likely to have information relevant to the inquiry.
Farm supply wholesalers, including Cargill Inc, Univar Solutions Inc and Federated Co-Operatives Ltd, have also been ordered to produce records. The companies have 60 to 90 calendar days to comply, depending on the specific order.
Canada's Competition Bureau said on Wednesday it had obtained the court orders in order to advance its investigation into allegations a number of manufacturers and wholesalers of seed and crop products had refused or restricted supply to FBN.
The Canadian regulator said in a release it was also ""investigating whether some of these entities may have engaged in coordinated behavior against FBN,"" and added there was ""no conclusion of wrongdoing at this time.""
California-based FBN said in a statement: ""We believe competition and price transparency is fundamental to a market economy, and to lowering farm expenses, so we are pleased that the Bureau is looking into this matter.
BASF, Corteva, Bayer and Cargill said last Thursday they would cooperate with the Competition Bureau's investigation, which was launched following a complaint from FBN
The Competition Bureau had told the court in Jan. 30 filings that it was seeking records and communications from the seed, pesticide and wholesaling companies over allegations that its stopped supplying FBN's newly acquired Canadian business in 2018. 
The alleged conduct by the agriculture companies under inquiry, the regulator told the court, may also impede or delay FBN's successful expansion into the Canadian marketplace and/or cause the company to exit altogether.
Founded in 2014, Farmer's Business Network is developing an online marketplace for farmers to order crop inputs like pesticides, seed and other agricultural supplies. 
Canada's Competition Bureau said on Wednesday the company's online platform also included a pricing comparison tool that allows farmers to receive aggregated information on what other farmers are paying for agricultural products.

FBN, which has been selling crop inputs through its e-commerce platform in the United States since 2016, entered Canada in November 2017.

157,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 12, 2020 05:21PM ET</span>","Short Seller Makes His Case, Triggering a Rare Feud in Brazil","(Bloomberg) -- For three years, reinsurer IRB Brasil Resseguros SA has been a darling of analysts and a boon for investors. Then came the short seller.
Asset manager Squadra Investments said Feb. 2 in a 150-page report that it holds a short position in IRB, triggering a 24% stock plunge and setting into motion a heated public feud that’s the talk of Latin American investment circles. Squadra’s campaign lopped off about 10 billion reais ($2.3 billion) in IRB’s market value.
While fairly common in other parts of the world, with high profile bearish cases made by the likes of Muddy Waters and Spruce Point Capital, it’s rare in Brazil for short sellers to publicly point the finger at a specific company and lay out their rationale so thoroughly.
IRB clapped back by filing a claim with Brazil’s CVM securities regulator, accusing Squadra of stock price manipulation and insider trading, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said. The CVM confirmed that administrative processes are open, without disclosing the content.
Squadra, founded by Brazilian investor Guilherme Ache and with 3.7 billion reais in assets under management, said IRB included one-offs in its recurring pre-tax income figures. IRB pushed back and plans to hire third-party firms to vet the numbers. It has declared itself the most profitable company in the global reinsurance sector and, over the past 12 days, has called up banks including  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Santander (MC:SAN) Brasil to explain how its higher-than-average return on equity is sustainable.
Clashing Over the Numbers
The difference in calculations is stark: Whereas IRB reported a pre-tax profit of 1.39 billion reais for the first nine months of 2019, Squadra says it actually had a loss of 112 million reais.
“The recurring profitability of IRB’s business is much smaller than what the market believes,” wrote Rio de Janeiro-based Squadra. “There’s a huge discrepancy between the price and value of IRB’s shares.”
The public disparaging marks a change in tack -- and in fortunes -- for Squadra. While the firm previously said it had shorted a company in the insurance sector, it never disclosed the name. But with the release of the report this month, Squadra revealed that it started betting against IRB in May 2018, adding to the position until the reinsurer became the biggest short wager in its $330 million Squadra Master Long Biased Fund. Until now, the bet backfired as the stock nearly tripled since mid-2018 through the end of last month.
At an impromptu press conference on Tuesday, IRB Chief Executive Officer Jose Carlos Cardoso said he was “shocked” by the recent events and promised to disclose more information in its earnings release scheduled for Feb. 19. The company, which declined to comment because it’s in a quiet period, says Squadra’s report includes technical errors. Squadra didn’t reply to requests for comment. Valor newspaper was first to report IRB’s securities claim against Squadra.
Split Opinion
Analysts are divided.  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and Morgan Stanley have reiterated their buy ratings, but XP Investimentos placed the stock under review, citing a lack of visibility. IRB has 13 buy ratings and four holds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s never had a sell rating since its initial public offering in 2017.
“What we heard suggests a buying opportunity,” Morgan Stanley analysts led by Jorge Kuri wrote in a note last week after reaching out to IRB management about the accusations.
Squadra is sticking to its call. In a second letter to investors, it said new data provided by the company to refute its claims haven’t altered its view."

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The dispute over who will run operations for a major offshore oil discovery in Mexico could eventually come down to the technical opinion of the country's independent oil regulator, according to one of the body's commissioners.
Closed-door talks between national oil company Pemex and a private consortium led by U.S.-based  Talos Energy  (N:TALO) over who will control operations of the so-called Zama project in the southern Gulf of Mexico have recently slowed, according to the Talos chief executive.
If they deadlock, the National Hydrocarbons Commission or CNH would be called upon to provide the country's energy ministry with a legally binding technical assessment that would determine the project's operator, Commissioner Sergio Pimentel said in an interview.
""The energy ministry has to take as a baseline the technical aspects that the regulator provides it,"" said Pimentel, a lawyer. ""Legally, it can't go in a different direction.""
Both Pemex and Talos have publicly expressed a desire to operate Zama.
The struggle over who will run operations for Zama, as well as which side holds most of the nearly 700 million barrels it is believed to contain, marks a major test case for the government of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who has repeatedly pledged to boost Pemex and downplayed the role of private oil companies.
Pimentel added that ""ideally"" Pemex and Talos will together reach an agreement, and then present a joint development plan.
Earlier this month, commissioners were briefed on Pemex's exploration plans for its adjacent block to Zama, after the regulator requested the briefing, but Pimentel said the meeting was confidential.
Last year, Pemex sought and received authorization to drill its Asab well near the border between the two blocks, but it more recently said it would drill a different well called Niquita, within its block but further to the east and potentially associated with a separate prospect.
In its latest plan, Pemex also put Asab in a more speculative drilling scenario, and Pimentel said the state-run firm will eventually need to seek fresh authorization to drill Asab.
The Talos-led consortium has already notified the government that it believes Zama extends into Pemex's next-door block, but Pemex has not done the same and it remains unclear what steps toward an eventual joint operating agreement for Zama the energy ministry has taken.
The energy ministry did not respond to requests for comment."

Murren will remain CEO and chairman until a successor is named. MGM's board has formed a committee to search for a successor, the company said.
The casino operator is also working with a nationally recognized search firm to identify candidates for the CEO role.
Murren, who has been at MGM since 1998, has been chairman and CEO since 2008.
Under Murren, MGM had said it would sell its Bellagio and Circus Circus resorts in Las Vegas in separate deals valued at about $5 billion, and had promised to use the proceeds from the deals to ""build a fortress balance sheet"" and return capital to shareholders.
Last year, MGM announced plans to cut costs and boost growth, proposing to increase annual adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by $300 million by the end of 2021.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler expects Latin America auto sales to grow 1.5% this year, to 4.2 million units, as Brazil's economic recovery offsets economic crises in other markets such as Argentina.
Fiat Chrysler's CEO for the region, Antonio Filosa, told journalists the automaker will increase its powertrain production and begin sales of a 100% electric vehicle in Brazil. Filosa predicted a 6% rise in Brazilian auto sales this year, with Fiat sales increasing by 7% to 9%.
Auto sales in Argentina may drop as much as 15%, below 400,000 units, as the country faces a difficult debt restructuring and economic crisis. Even so, Filosa said the automaker plans to keep its production in the country considering its long-term prospects.
Fiat is currently the third largest automaker in Brazil, behind General Motors Co (N:GM) and Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p), after losing its top spot as sales of SUVs grew in the country. Fiat expects to launch new SUVs in 2021 and 2022.
The company will increase powertrain production from 1.1 million to 1.3 million units a year, Filosa said."

(Reuters) - Charlie Munger, the longtime business partner of Warren Buffett, on Wednesday said Chinese companies are stronger than American companies, lamented a ""dying"" newspaper industry, and offered passing praise for Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) Elon Musk though he would never invest in his company.
Munger, 96, spoke at the annual meeting of  Daily Journal Corp  (O:DJCO), the Los Angeles newspaper publishing company he chairs.
He remains better known for having since 1978 been a vice chairman at Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa).
Munger showed no sign of wavering in his longstanding admiration for China and its economy, even as officials combat the coronavirus outbreak whose epicenter is in that country's Hubei province.
""The strongest companies are not in America,"" he said. ""The Chinese companies are stronger than ours, and are growing faster.""
Munger also appeared to admonish both countries' leaders to work out their economic differences.
""The United States ought to get along with China, and China ought to get along with the United States,"" he said.
Wednesday's meeting was webcast by CNBC.
Munger spoke two weeks after Berkshire threw in the towel on its newspaper empire, agreeing to sell 80 daily and weekly papers including its hometown Omaha World-Herald in Nebraska to  Lee Enterprises  Inc (N:LEE) for $140 million.
He echoed Buffett's sentiment that only a few newspapers, such as the New York Times and Wall Street Journal, may survive the shakeout as the Internet and changing reader preferences cause advertising revenue to plummet.
""What's happened is that technological change is destroying daily newspapers in America,"" Munger said. ""They're all dying.""
That's not how many investors feel about Tesla, Musk's electric car company, whose share price has more than quadrupled since June, punishing short-sellers betting it would fall.
""I would never buy it, and I would never sell short,"" Munger said, prompting laughter.
""Elon Musk is peculiar,"" he added. ""He may overestimate himself, but he may not be wrong all the time.""
Munger is Berkshire's chief supporter of that company's investment in Chinese electric car company BYD Co (SZ:002594), which began in 2008.
With U.S. stocks at record highs, Munger also cautioned investment managers to ""prepare for tougher times ahead,"" echoed the billionaire Buffett's recommendation that many investors are better off in index funds.
""There are wretched excesses in a lot of well-paid hedge fund and private equity businesses,"" Munger said.
Munger also made many several references to his age, but offered no explanation of how he got there.
""I don't think I deserve any credit for longevity,"" he said. ""It just happened.""

Investing.com – Boeing's attempts to put the piece of its shattered reputation back together following the 737 Max crisis have suffered numerous setbacks. But as the aircraft maker is expected to enter a ""period of goods news,"" in the run-up to the 737 Max return to service, according to   Credit Suisse   (SIX:CSGN) analyst Robert Spingarn.
""While nothing material was revealed, the perspectives offered by the company ... left us incrementally more constructive on the name,"" Spingarn said in a note following a sitdown with Boeing's management earlier this week.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) raised its price target on Boeing (NYSE:BA) to $367 from $321, sending its share more than 1% higher.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) is ""entering into a positive news period"" ahead of expectations that the return Max will get the regulatory nod to return to service by mid-year.
The grounding of the Max since March, following two fatal accidents, has cost the company billions of dollars to compensate airline customers that count the Max among their fleet.
Efforts to restore its reputation and regain trust, meanwhile, have come unstuck amid numerous setbacks including internal memos showing employees had mocked regulators and customers.
Earlier this week, Boeing (NYSE:BA) said it did not receive any new orders for commercial jets in January for the first time since 1962.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) believes the free cash flow lost from the Max grounding is largely recoverable, but if it fails to hit the mid-2020 timeline, then it will likely have to fork out further cash to its customers for the delay. "

(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co on Wednesday ended its forced arbitration policy for employee sexual harassment claims, opening the lender to potential lawsuits in the future.
The San Francisco-based bank made the decision following a shareholder proposal from Clean Yield Asset Management which has since been withdrawn, asking for a public analysis of mandatory arbitration's impact on sexual assault claims within the company. 
“Wells Fargo has zero tolerance for sexual harassment,” David Galloreese, head of human resources at Wells Fargo, wrote in an article posted on the company’s internal and external websites. ""The treatment of sexual harassment claims has become an increasingly prominent issue across industries.""
The new policy applies to all future harassment claims. 
Since 2015, Wells Fargo has required employees to sign arbitration agreements when they are hired to that require them to settle workplace disputes privately, not in court. 
In December, a representative from Clean Yield Asset Management, an impact investing firm with a roughly $2,000 stake in Wells Fargo, submitted a proposal asking the board to conduct a review of mandatory arbitration's effect on sexual harassment claims and make the report public.

“Wells Fargo has raised the bar for financial institutions aiming to root out sexual harassment in the workplace,"" said Clean Yield’s Director of Shareholder Advocacy, Molly Betournay. ""We urge other companies, particularly other big banks, to follow suit.”

PARIS/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Gucci and other luxury labels owned by France's  Kering  expect smaller crowds at their catwalk shows this month, with Chinese buyers and influencers set to miss the major marketing fixture.
Luxury companies including Kering (PA:PRTP) already face a sales hit from the coronavirus outbreak as they shutter shops in China and shelve advertising campaigns in one of the top markets for luxury goods.
Chairman Francois-Henri Pinault said on Wednesday that Kering hoped to used video links to patch in guests unable to travel as a result of the outbreak.
Designers are set to present their latest women's styles in London from Friday after New York's fashion week, while presentations by some of the world's biggest brands are scheduled for later in February in Milan and then Paris.
""All of the industry professionals who would have come from Asia are not going to come,"" Pinault said after Kering's results, estimating that they would normally constitute up to 40% of the attendees at its fashion shows.
Kering's Gucci and Bottega Veneta brands do their presentations in Milan, while Saint Laurent, Balenciaga and Alexander McQueen host their showcases in Paris, where they rival the likes of Chanel or LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Christian Dior.
INFLUENCERS
Although shoppers and fashion fans can often view the catwalk extravaganzas online, fashion weeks remain the equivalent of a trade show for luxury goods companies.
Department store buyers, clients and journalists usually attend, alongside social media influencers, who are now a core part of a brand's publicity strategy, especially in China.
""Not having the Asian retailers and buyers would be a big disadvantage,"" said Robert Burke, of Robert Burke Associates luxury consultants, adding that New York fashion week had been ""leaner than usual"".
""Fashion weeks are still important, particularly in light of the global attention that brands receive through press and social media reviews,"" he said.
Pinault said seating at some shows would be reduced and that Kering would trim its budget for ferrying attendees around. Firms rarely disclose the cost of organizing a show, but it can run to well over $1 million, industry insiders said.
Italy's national fashion chamber CNMI said last week that three Chinese designers had canceled shows at Milan's fashion week on Feb. 18-24, and about 1,000 Chinese people who had been expected to attend were unlikely to show up.
France's fashion federation said six Chinese designers will also cancel presentations scheduled between Feb. 24 and March 3."
176,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2020 02:01PM ET</span>",Boeing unlikely to hit pre-grounding output targets for 737 MAX before 2022,"By Tracy Rucinski
CHICAGO (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) is unlikely, for several years, to hit the monthly 57-unit production rate it had targeted for the 737 MAX preceding the grounding of the jet due to delays in regulatory approval, Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith said on Wednesday.
Boeing was building 52 MAX aircraft per month before the plane was grounded last March following two fatal crashes, which slowed production rates and ultimately spurred an output freeze beginning in January this year.
U.S. approval for the 737 MAX to fly again is now expected by mid-year and Boeing has said it could slowly resume production before the plane is allowed back in the air.
""As we gain confidence in that time frame of when the grounding will be lifted, that's when we'll reassess and start to wake the line up,"" Smith said at an investor conference.
But the monthly output rate will depend largely on the suppliers that feed the program, and the 57-per-month target will not be reached for ""a couple of years,"" he said.
The company's suppliers have been shedding jobs and capacity to cope with the production halt. While that staves off chaos, aerospace executives worry the industry might be unable to ramp up factories quickly enough when the plane wins approval to fly again.
Boeing said last October that it would bring the production rate to 57 in late 2020, though sources told Reuters in December that a new target was set for April 2021.
Discussions on the supply chain have been ""front and center"" of daily company calls on the 737 MAX, Smith said on Wednesday.
Boeing is eager to boost production as more plane deliveries would mean more cash, and lower payments for parts.
The company also collects pre-delivery payments according to production rhythms.
The number of 737 MAX jets it can make each month will also depend on how quickly it will be able to deliver planes that have already been produced but could not be delivered due to the global grounding, Smith said.
Returning the aircraft safely to service following the two crashes was the ""single biggest"" cash driver for the planemaker, Smith said.
The two 737 MAX crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia in 2018 and 2019 killed 346 people.
Speaking separately at the Singapore Airshow, Boeing executives warned that concerns were growing over the impact of travel restrictions to and from China following the outbreak of the coronavirus, adding to recent worries over trade tensions and signs an industry cycle is peaking."
177,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 12, 2020 01:55PM ET</span>",S&P 500 Forecasters Under the Same Roof Have Different Views,"(Bloomberg) -- The relentless rally of U.S. stocks to another record has forecasters within the same firm making different predictions for the market.
At Fundstrat Global Advisors LLC, Tom Lee, the head of strategy, sees the S&P 500 ending the year at 3,450, or just about 2% higher than current levels. Meanwhile, Brian Rauscher, the company’s global portfolio strategist, is more optimistic. He sees a gain of nearly 7%, all the way to 3,620.
Wall Street firms sometimes house strategists with contrasting opinions on the market’s direction -- a phenomenon owing to differing methodologies used in forecasting. Just last November, UBS Group AG’s Francois Trahan gave a bleak outlook while Keith Parker predicted monetary support would help boost equities. Fundstrat’s duo have reached different conclusions because the profit assumptions on which they base their calls vary widely.
In a note sent to clients Wednesday, Rauscher said he derived his prediction from a 2021 profit estimate of $197 a share and a flat price-earnings ratio from current levels. Lee’s forecast, published in December, was based on a 2020 earnings estimate of $178 a share and a small contraction expected in multiples.
“We firmly believe that it should not be confusing as long as everyone is aware we come at things independently and where we may differ,” Rauscher said in an interview. “At the moment, we are looking for higher, so the fact that levels are slightly different doesn’t change the larger message that we are all constructive on the market for the coming year. If/when we all disagree on up or down, it might get a bit more challenging.”
This is a difficult market to handicap. Many underestimated the equity rally last year after focusing on weak corporate earnings while overlooking the boost from Federal Reserve monetary stimulus. Now, six weeks into 2020, the S&P 500 has already exceeded the average target of 3,355 that strategists in a Bloomberg survey have for the full year.
Stocks have advanced this year, defying growth risks posed by the spread of coronavirus in China and looming uncertainty over U.S. presidential elections. At 19 times forecast earnings, the S&P 500 has traded at the highest multiple in almost two decades.
Is it time to sell? Both Lee and Rauscher at Fundstrat say no. Still, their different forecasts for the benchmark measure could be confusing, according to Robert Pavlik, the chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth.
“Having two differing views doesn’t help,” Pavlik said by phone. “Just at about every single firm, nobody is going to have the exact same opinion. It’s truly just the consensus that the firm decides to go with.”"
178,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2020 01:40PM ET</span>",Coronavirus outbreak begins to disrupt booming China drug trials,"By Tamara Mathias, Roxanne Liu and Manojna Maddipatla
(Reuters) - The fast-spreading coronavirus is starting to disrupt testing of experimental medicines in China, posing a threat to plans by global drugmakers that have invested billions of dollars to harness the potential of the Asian economic powerhouse.
The U.S. clinical trials database lists nearly 500 studies with a site in the city of Wuhan, which has endured the brunt of an outbreak that has killed more than 1,100 people and infected more than 44,000 in China. About 20% of global trials are now conducted in China, up from about 10% just five years ago, according to GlobalData Plc. 
China has imposed a virtual lockdown on Wuhan and severely restricted travel in its wider province of Hubei and some other cities.
While it is too early in the outbreak first detected in December to fully assess its impact on clinical trials, if it goes on much longer the pharmaceutical industry's China strategy is likely to be disrupted. 
Virus-curbing efforts by the government have made it difficult for trial patients to reach hospitals running studies, according to interviews with two contract research organizations that conduct trials for drugmakers, local drug companies and doctors. 
Others fear becoming infected if they return to a healthcare facility for a trial. 
""Hospitals aren't focused on clinical trials right now,"" said Ian Woo, president and chief financial officer of Everest Medicines, which is developing drugs for the Chinese market. ""They have plenty of other things to be focused on."" 
The outbreak has delayed the launch of new studies, and research organizations like dMed Biopharmaceutical Co said they have been unable to send staff to monitor trial sites.
Affected ongoing studies include trials testing a Novartis medicine for a rare blood disorder, a cancer drug from BeiGene Ltd and a treatment for a type of spinal arthritis from Chinese drugmaker Tasly Pharmaceutical Group, according to doctors involved. 
Beijing-based BeiGene, which has more than 20 trials ongoing in Wuhan, said it was working to minimize potential delays and disruptions, but that it was ""too early to speculate on any specific impact on our clinical trial and commercial progress in China."" 
Other drugmakers with trials in China, including Roche, Zai Lab Ltd and Hutchison China MediTech Ltd (Chi-Med), also said it was too soon to speculate on the outbreak's consequences. But the impact is being felt.
Shenghao Tu, who is working on the Tasly clinical trial in Wuhan, said the study in his hospital has been suspended. 
""This is a problem that (we) never encountered before,"" Tu said.
The issue is not limited to Wuhan. 
Two doctors testing the BeiGene cancer drug tislelizumab in Beijing and Guangzhou city said efforts to contain the virus have hampered patient enrollment and capacity. 
Both their hospitals now require that each room hold only one patient to prevent cross-infection, reducing the number they can accommodate.
The delays are disrupting a booming, homegrown pharmaceutical industry China hopes will supply its domestic market and compete globally. 
INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT
International drugmakers including Britain-based AstraZeneca Plc, Swiss drugmaker Roche Holding (SIX:ROG), U.S. biotech  Amgen Inc  (NASDAQ:AMGN) and Switzerland's Novartis AG have made big investments, hoping to benefit from cheaper trial costs in China, access to large patient populations and the ability to identify new drugs for Asian markets.
Amgen last year agreed to pay $2.7 billion for a 20.5% stake in BeiGene to develop cancer drugs for the Chinese market. A few weeks later, BeiGene in November became the first drugmaker to receive U.S. approval for a cancer therapy based on trials conducted largely in China.
Amgen research chief David Reese said at the time BeiGene has built ""one of the premier clinical trial platforms in China,"" noting its strong relationships with trial investigators and regulators.
Deals and joint ventures between international companies and China-based biotechs surged to at least $10 billion in 2019, from about $3.2 billion in 2015, according to a Reuters analysis of GlobalData information.
(Graphic: China's growing global drug development footprint, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/CHINA-HEALTH-CLINICALTRIALS/0H001R8B4BV6/index.html) 
BeiGene's chief advisor Eric Hedrick sees the potential for more lucrative deals for his company.
""We think that there are other companies out there, like Amgen, who have the same sort of ambitions where BeiGene would make a good partner,"" Hedrick said in an interview prior to the outbreak.
BETTING ON RESILIENCE
The surge in investment followed years of effort by Chinese regulators to elevate healthcare facilities to match global standards and increase the role China-run trials play in U.S. and European drug approval decisions.
Brad Loncar, chief executive of Loncar Investments who created a fund that tracks the Chinese pharmaceutical industry, said the epidemic could delay deals in the short run. 
Longer term, investors expect the outbreak will prompt China ""to accelerate its plans to really modernize its drug and healthcare sector,"" he said.
Amgen said it had not yet seen disruptions to BeiGene operations. Novartis said it was monitoring the situation and would handle any disruptions. Tasly declined comment.
Much will depend on how long the outbreak lasts, particularly for trials set to begin later this year and ongoing studies that will take years to complete.
Chi-Med Chief Executive Christian Hogg was optimistic about a resolution. ""This a relatively new phenomenon ... and China is a resourceful country,"" he said. 
Roche, which last year opened a drug development center in Shanghai, sees China as key to its strategy to get new treatments to the global market. 
""You can imagine the large number of patients (in China),"" Jing He, head of Roche's Shanghai pharmaceutical development center, told Reuters. ""We will be able to enroll patients faster.""
For now, that may not be the case. 

A doctor working on a study of Novartis' eltrombopag for severe aplastic anemia who asked to remain anonymous because he is not authorized to speak with media, told Reuters the trial could be slowed due to patient recruiting obstacles. Some patients are not allowed to travel from their cities to qualified hospitals for required screening procedures, he said.

The document, seen by Reuters, said the investigation relates to the period between Jan. 1, 2015 and May 2, 2017 when the loss-making carrier asked to be put under special administration for the second time in less than a decade.
UniCredit (MI:CRDI) boss Jean Pierre Mustier and Intesa Sanpaolo's (MI:ISP) Paolo Colombo sat on Alitalia's board during that time. The other people that were investigated by prosecutors in the town of Civitavecchia near Rome, include former Alitalia executives and other board members.
   The document said prosecutors had looked into whether those investigated had committed bankruptcy fraud by approving financial statements that did not reflect the company's real state of health.
When wrapping up an investigation, prosecutors in Italy issue an official document that sums up the main elements of the probe and usually the next step is for prosecutors to request a trial.
UniCredit and Intesa Sanpaolo declined to comment. No comment was immediately available from lawyers for Mustier and Colombo.

SINES, Portugal (Reuters) - American companies have a strong interest in expanding Portugal's deepwater port of Sines due to its strategic position for liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports to Europe, U.S. Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette said on Wednesday.
Portugal launched an international tender in October for a contract to build and operate a new container terminal in Sines, continental Europe's closest port to the Panama Canal. It expects to pick the winner in the last quarter of this year.
Simultaneously, Singapore's PSA, which operates the only existing container terminal in the port, is also in the process of increasing its capacity.
The planned overall expansion will be crucial to also increase the port's capacity to receive larger ships and more LNG cargoes from abroad for further shipments to Europe.
""It is a very unique and strategic point for us and a very good part of the economics of natural gas,"" Brouillette said during a visit to Sines. ""We are excited to see the development here ... and we look forward to working with Portugal and the industry here for this upcoming tender offer.
""I think you'll see much U.S. interest in this port. We’ll wait and see, as the tender closes, to see which companies may be on this. The fact they are here today looking at this, I think it indicates a very strong American interest in this port.""
Portuguese Infrastructure Minister Pedro Nuno Santos said the U.S. interest and potential investment was ""an opportunity we must seize"".
In the tender, U.S. companies may still face competition from Chinese rivals such as state-owned Cosco or Shanghai International Port Group, which have expressed interest in expanding the port, according to Portuguese newspaper Publico.
Brouillette made no reference to Chinese plans in Portugal, but in the past Washington has expressed concerns about heavy Chinese investment in Portugal's energy sector including large stakes in grid operator REN and power utility EDP-Energias de Portugal.
EDP has a significant wind power operation in the United States. REN, in its turn, owns the Sines LNG terminal.
Chinese firms have invested around 10 billion euros in Portugal, particularly during its economic and debt crisis in 2010-14.
In late 2018, Beijing and Lisbon signed a memorandum of understanding on cooperation on Beijing's belt and road initiative - which promotes expanding land and sea links between Asia, Africa and Europe."

Investing.com – Wall Street continued to trade in record territory Tuesday, led by a surge in energy stocks and signs the Covid-19 (coronavirus) outbreak may be reaching a peak.
The S&P 500 rose 0.42%, Nasdaq Composite added 0.70% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.62%.
Energy stocks clawed back some losses from a day earlier, underpinned by a jump in oil prices as investor hopes of deeper OPEC-led production cuts offset weekly U.S. petroleum data showing a larger-than-expected build in crude inventories.
Signs that the Covid-19 outbreak is beginning to peak also supported energy stocks and the broader market.
New infections of the deadly virus in Hubei province, the outbreak’s epicenter, fell for seven days in a row on Tuesday, according to health authorities in China. Although there are doubts about numbers now that China has changed its methodology for counting the virus.
The easing worries over the virus pushed up travel and entertainment stocks, which were the worst hit when fears of contagion threatened to boil over.
Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN),   Las Vegas Sands   (NYSE:LVS) and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) traded higher for the day.
On the earnings front, meanwhile, investors cheered mostly bullish quarterly results.
Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) jumped 12% as its quarterly earnings markedly topped estimates and e-commerce company delivered an upbeat outlook on revenue.
  Lyft   (NASDAQ:LYFT) slumped 9% after the company said it doesn’t expect to become profitable until the end of 2021. But   Molson Coors   Brewing (NYSE:TAP) reversed gains, falling 2%, despite quarterly results topping consensus estimates on both the top and bottom lines.
Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY), down 20%, kept a lid on consumer discretionary stocks, after it reported a decline in sales in December and January.
Monetary policy was also in focus as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell testified before the Senate Banking Committee.
Powell did not, however, sway from his narrative a day earlier, reiterating that the central bank's current monetary policy measures remain appropriate as there is ""nothing about this economy that is out of kilter or imbalanced."""

Last year, the company set aside over $1 billion to strengthen its delivery network in its biggest market, the United States, which is dominated by bigger rivals Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and eBay Inc (O:EBAY).
Shopify has been investing in warehouse technologies such as machine-learning and robotics and in October, bought warehouse technology provider 6 River Systems for about $450 million.
The company is trying to be more than just an e-commerce platform, Wedbush analyst Ygal Arounian said, adding that it is aiming to offer warehouse robotics, easy delivery through fulfillment centers, and everything else that merchants need to succeed. 
Gross merchandise volume (GMV), a metric used in the e-commerce sector to measure transaction volumes, rose 47% to $20.6 billion in the fourth quarter, edging past estimates of $20.03 billion. 
The coronavirus outbreak did not have a material impact on Shopify's GMV, Chief Financial Officer Amy Shapero said in a post-earnings call.
The company would invest and focus more on expanding outside the U.S. and Canada, Shapero said .
It forecast 2020 revenue in the range of $2.13 billion to $2.16 billion, above the average analyst estimate of $2.11 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

188,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2020 11:17AM ET</span>","Boeing sees airline profits hit, stagnant freight due to virus","By Tim Hepher and Jamie Freed
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Airlines are facing a fall in profits as the coronavirus crisis hits passenger demand and prolongs weakness in economically sensitive air freight, planemaker Boeing (N:BA) warned on Wednesday.
After years of financial volatility marked by a race for market share, the airline industry has been profitable for the past decade due to widespread restructuring and strong demand.
But concerns are growing over the impact of travel restrictions to and from China following the outbreak of the virus, which come on top of recent trade tensions and signs an industry cycle is peaking.
A two-thirds drop in the number of seats offered by Chinese airlines will hit their revenues, Ihssane Mounir, Boeing's senior vice president of commercial sales & marketing, said.
""China has reduced capacity by 70%; that is money, that is revenue,"" he told reporters at the Singapore Airshow, attendance at which has been sharply reduced because of the virus.
Boeing also said the air cargo industry was unlikely to grow this year because of challenges in China where the coronavirus was first discovered in December.
The world's biggest manufacturer of freighter aircraft had previously forecast air freight would grow by 1% to 2% this year, in part due to the United States and China forging an interim trade deal.
""That is going to see pressure as well,"" Randy Tinseth, vice-president of marketing at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, told reporters separately, referring to the U.S.-China deal. 
The coronavirus crisis has dimmed hopes of a rebound for air cargo after its worst year since the financial crisis, the International Air Transport Association has said.
CHINA DELIVERY DELAYS
The trade deal had been expected to spur Chinese purchases of wide-body jets including the 777X, which staged a maiden light this month amid a lull in sales.
While Boeing said it was too early to say whether orders from China would be disrupted by the virus, some deliveries of 777 and 787 aircraft previously sold to China have been delayed.
Boeing started the year with zero overall sales in January for the first time in decades, while rival Airbus (PA:AIR) had its strongest showing in at least 15 years. 
January, however, is not always a reliable indicator for the year as a whole, analysts said. 
Mounir said Boeing was in talks with several potential customers for wide-body aircraft.
""It was a slow January but it doesn't mean it is going to be a slow February or slow March, so watch this space.""
Leasing firms could benefit as airlines try to lighten balance sheets and rent rather than buy during the health crisis.
""Before the virus even started to become a news point in January, we’d already seen airlines come to us in scale...with concerns of a slowing economy and trade war,"" Domhnal Slattery, chief executive of Dublin-based Avolon said after reporting higher 2019 results.
Against such a backdrop, airlines were likely to become conservative and prudent with their cash, he added. 

""That trend had already started and will unquestionably be accentuated now with the coronavirus, although the airlines involved in relation to the virus tend to be much more Asia-centric,"" he told Reuters in a telephone interview.

189,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2020 11:16AM ET</span>",BP boss Looney sets out to 'reinvent' oil giant with zero carbon goal,"By Ron Bousso and Shadia Nasralla
LONDON (Reuters) -  BP  (LON:BP) set one of the oil sector's most ambitious targets for curbing carbon emissions on Wednesday as new chief executive Bernard Looney began the biggest revamp in its 111-year history.
While investor groups welcomed the 2050 targets set out by Looney, which put BP ahead of rivals Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa),  Total  (PA:TOTF), Equinor (OL:EQNR) and all of the U.S. oil majors, environmental campaigners criticized a lack of detail.
""We have got to change and change profoundly because the world is changing fast and so are society's expectations of us,"" Looney said in his first major speech as CEO, after earlier highlighting a need to ""reinvent BP"".
""It is aiming to reduce and neutralize the carbon in the oil and gas that we dig out of the ground,"" Looney added.
BP did not say how it intends to get emissions from its operations and barrels produced to net zero and halve the intensity of emissions by all products it sells, including diesel and petrol, a measure known as Scope 3.
The company has tried, and failed, to reinvent itself before, with a pioneering plan to build a large renewables business in the early 2000s which ended with huge losses.
One possible way to hit greenhouse gas reduction targets is to buy offset certificates and bet on carbon capture and storage technology, which is not yet used on a commercial scale.
But Charlie Kronick, Oil Advisor from Greenpeace UK, was skeptical about how BP can deliver.
""How will they reach net zero ... When will they stop wasting billions on drilling for new oil and gas we can't burn?"" 
Shares in BP were up 1.3% at 1423 GMT, roughly in line with the broader European energy sector index (SXEP) after the news, which confirmed a Reuters report in January.
RAPID TRANSITION 
The world's top oil and gas companies are under heavy pressure from investors and climate activists to meet the 2015 Paris climate goal of limiting global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels.
U.S. groups such as Exxon (N:XOM),  Chevron  (N:CVX) and ConocoPhillips (N:COP) are far less ambitious with their greenhouse gas reduction targets than their European rivals. 
Stephanie Pfeifer, a member of the global Climate Action 100+ Steering Committee and CEO of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change welcomed BP's plan.
""Building on the positive engagement with BP ... investors will continue to look for progress from the company in addressing climate change. This includes how it will invest more in non-oil and gas businesses,"" she said in a statement.
BP's absolute net zero carbon target relates to every barrel it produces, based on its equity stake in oil and gas fields, from the well to the petrol station. It does not encompass oil products which BP markets, but does not produce itself.
BP, which produced around 2.64 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2019, said it would cut emissions to net zero from some 415 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent a year. 
Near term plans will be published by a September investor day, Looney said, adding BP is likely to produce fewer barrels by 2050.
""We welcome BP’s recognition of the reality we now live in but 2050 is too late,"" a spokeswoman for climate change activist group Extinction Rebellion said.
(Graphic: Oil majors&apos; carbon emissions png - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/OIL-CARBON/0H001QEMZ7NW/eikon.png)
Anglo-Dutch group Shell has set Scope 3 targets based on intensity rather than on absolute reduction terms.
Intensity-based targets measure the amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per unit of energy or barrel of oil and gas produced. That means that absolute emissions can rise with growing production, even if the headline intensity metric falls.
Scope 3 emissions vastly exceed greenhouse gases caused by the production of crude oil, natural gas and refined products, including electricity generation, typically by a factor of about six among oil majors, according to Reuters calculations. 
'NEW EXPECTATIONS'
BP will also set ""new expectations"" for relationships with trade organisations and be ready to quit if they are not aligned.
Last year, BP invested around $500 million in low-carbon technologies including wind power, electric vehicle battery charging systems and solar power firm Lightsource BP. That compared to an overall budget of $15.2 billion in 2019.
In perhaps its biggest-ever corporate shake-up, BP will dismantle the traditional model of an oil and gas production, or upstream, unit and a refining, trading and marketing, or downstream, unit to ""become more integrated and more focused"".
A new production and operations unit, which includes oil and gas production as well as refining and chemicals, will be led by Gordon Birrell. Meanwhile, customers and products will be led by Emma Delaney, gas and low carbon energy by Dev Sanyal and innovation and engineering by David Eyton.

BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shareholder activists focused on climate issues vowed to press proxy battles with JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) after getting a cold reception from the top Wall Street bank, even though Chief Executive Jamie Dimon has vowed to protect the environment.
Activists, including the As You Sow Foundation, Trillium Asset Management and Boston Trust Walden, said they had received notices that the bank has asked for regulatory permission to skip votes at its spring annual meeting on proposals such as reporting on greenhouse gas emissions tied to its lending.
JPMorgan's position creates reputational risks at a time when clients and investors want banks to help slow the rate of a global rise in temperature, according to a joint statement from the activists on Wednesday.
""They're not walking their talk,"" said Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow, in an interview. 
She noted how, in correspondence with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission posted on the agency's website, JPMorgan argued that her group's request for an emissions report amounted to an attempt to ""micromanage"" the company.
""I was surprised at the depth and breadth of the argument saying there’s no way you can talk to us about anything,"" Fugere said. 
Asked about the matter, a JPMorgan representative referred to arguments it laid out in filings to the SEC. In addition to the micromanagement concern, JPMorgan, among other things, said the issues related to ""ordinary business"" and that its board does not approve its proxy voting policy.
Top U.S. corporations routinely seek permission to skip controversial shareholder proposals. Activists have also filed climate proposals at other banks and energy companies, and have sought votes against JPMorgan lead independent director Lee Raymond, a former  Exxon Mobil  Corp CEO. (N:XOM)
The activists hope to get a boost from a recent announcement by top asset manager BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) to put more focus on environmental issues. 
Indeed, other banks have been more receptive to such proposals, or at least, not tried to block them, said Christina Cobourn Herman, program director at the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, which represents the activists. The group says JPMorgan is the largest financier of the fossil fuel industry among 33 top global banks.

Dimon has expressed support for the Paris Agreement to combat global climate warming, and in August joined the CEOs of more than 180 U.S. companies who signed a ""statement of corporate purpose,"" arguing that corporate America should focus on social responsibility, including protecting the environment.

FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF, Germany (Reuters) - Swiss elevator maker Schindler (S:SCHP) would embark on an all-out antitrust offensive in the courts to stall any deal to combine Thyssenkrupp's (DE:TKAG) lift division with rival Kone (HE:KNEBV), board member Alfred Schindler told Reuters.
His comments came a day after the deadline for bids for Thyssenkrupp Elevator, with Finland's Kone and three private equity consortia vying to buy it in a deal sources say could be worth up to 17 billion euros ($18.6 billion).
A Kone-Thyssenkrupp Elevator merger would create the world's biggest lift maker, leapfrogging market leader Otis, owned by United Technologies (N:UTX), and Schindler in second place.
""We would probably file lawsuits in Europe, the United States, Canada, China and possibly Australia. These cases would take at least three to four years,"" said Schindler, who is now chairman emeritus of the company he ran for 26 years.
He said other rivals would probably take legal action too: ""You can safely assume that neither Otis nor Schindler will simply accept being driven out.""
Thyssenkrupp and Otis declined to comment. A Kone spokeswoman said the company continued to believe there was room for consolidation in the sector.
Shares in Kone fell as much as 3.9% following Schindler's comments to Reuters while Thyssenkrupp rose slightly.
Once a symbol of Germany's industrial power, Thyssenkrupp is struggling with 12.4 billion euros of debt and pension liabilities after years of ill-fated investments and needs to raise money from its prized elevator division to restructure.
Thyssenkrupp's supervisory board is due to meet on Feb. 27 and a decision on the fate of the elevator business could be made then, two people familiar with the matter said.
Besides selling all or part of the business, Thyssenkrupp is also considering an initial public offering, though sources said this option was less likely.
Solely based on bids, Kone and a consortium of Blackstone (N:BX), Carlyle (O:CG) and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board look best-placed to reach the final round but no decision has been made, the people said.
Kone has made a non-binding bid of 17 billion euros while the consortium has offered about 16 billion. It was not clear whether Kone had improved its earlier offer.
RULES OF WAR
A consortium comprising Advent, Cinven (CINV.UL) and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and an alliance between Canada's Brookfield (TO:BAMa) and Singapore's Temasek (TEM.UL) are also in the running, sources have said.
While a sale to Kone would probably raise the most cash for Thyssenkrupp, the beleaguered conglomerate is concerned it could trigger antitrust investigations where the combined company would be a major player, such as Europe and the United States. 
""Such a hypothetical takeover would ... have considerable effects on the structure of the relevant markets and most likely lead to significant negative impacts on effective competition in many markets,"" DICE Consult said in a report https://www.dice-consult.de/content/5-publikationen/1-a-note-on-the-sale-of-thyssenkrupp-s-elevator-and-escalator-business/brief-notice-on-the-takeover-tk_kone.pdf.
Kone has drawn up plans to hand Thyssenkrupp's European assets to private equity firm CVC (CVC.UL) but the European Commission typically prefers industrial buyers that can compete better with the firm offloading assets.
Powerful labor unions, who control half of Thyssenkrupp's supervisory board, oppose any breakup of the business as well as antitrust reviews.
""What Thyssenkrupp needs now is high transaction certainty for the remaining group, not hanging in the balance for 1 to 2 years,"" said Knut Giesler of IG Metall, Germany's largest union, and vice chairman of Thyssenkrupp Elevator's supervisory board.
Kone is the world's third biggest elevator maker, followed by Thyssenkrupp and Japan's Hitachi (T:6501).
Schindler was the Swiss firm's CEO from 1985 until 2011 and his views carry significant weight as the Schindler and Bonnard families, and related parties, hold 71.1% of the voting rights.
Schindler, who transformed the company into a global player, said it would also intensify its operational efforts to fight a combined Kone and Thyssenkrupp.
""There will be a technology war. It is already ongoing but it will intensify massively,"" he said, without giving specifics.

""Surprise lies at the heart of any defense strategy. A strategy that you lay out in advance would go against any rule of warfare.""

193,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 12, 2020 10:11AM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Hits New Records at Open on Virus Hopes,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Wall Street raced to new all-time highs at the opening on Wednesday, driven by growing hopes that the coronavirus, now known as Covid-19, could soon peak.
However, China changed its methodology for counting new cases last week, and no longer includes those patients who test positive without showing symptoms. Given that the virus’ incubation period can last up to 24 days – also according to official Chinese data – that creates a clear risk of under-reporting. The economic impacts of the virus continue to become more visible, with big downward revisions to global oil demand and the increasing use of force majeure clauses by Chinese companies to get out of contractual obligations to buy inputs or deliver finished products.
By 10:05 AM ET (1505 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average had risen 199 points, or 0.7%, while the S&P 500 had risen 0.4%. Both touched new record highs in the opening minutes of trading after China’s authorities published figures showing a sharp fall in new cases of Covid-19 for the second day in a row. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.3%.
Buying was again concentrated in mega-cap stock such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), despite a lack of newsflow out of either company.
Among those companies that did generate news on Wednesday, Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) rose 13.8% to a new all-time high after blowout numbers for its fourth quarter, and   Molson Coors   (NYSE:TAP) rose 5.1%, also helped by solid results (although nowhere near as solid as Heineken's (OTC:HEINY): the Dutch brewer’s ADRs rose 5.9% after its quarterly report.
Elsewhere, the shorts betting against Bed Bath & Beyond's (NASDAQ:BBBY) turnaround were vindicated after the company’s same-store sales fell short of expectations in December and January. CEO Mark Tritton blamed product availability and weaker-than-expected store visits. BB&B stock fell 25%, reversing all the gains since October.
CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) stock ground out another 1.2% increase after reporting above-forecast earnings for the fourth quarter, which were again supported by the contribution of Aetna, the insurer that it bought late in 2018.
Elsewhere, oil and gas stocks were lifted by a 2.9% rebound in U.S. crude futures, after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries cut its estimate for world oil demand this year by ‘only’ 230,000 barrels a day. The U.S. government had on Tuesday estimated demand destruction of 300,000 bpd.   Exxon Mobil   (NYSE:XOM) rose 1.4%, while   Chevron   (NYSE:CVX) rose 0.9% and   Devon Energy   (NYSE:DVN) rose 4.3%.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six developed-market currencies, found a bid again, rising 0.1% to 98.72 as the euro struggled to defend the $1.0900 level."

French TV station BFM reported earlier on its website that  Alstom  is set to make a firm offer for the Bombardier division, valuing it at just under $7 billion. 
Alstom and Bombardier declined to comment.
Quoting several sources close to the company, BFM said the two firms had been discussing a deal for months and that Alstom had recently made a non-binding offer valuing the business at $7 billion. The new offer would be binding and would be worth less than the first one, BFM said. 
BFM reported that Alstom would finalise its offer after Bombardier releases earnings on Thursday. It said that following Alstom's first offer, considered attractive by Bombardier, the firm had opened its books to Alstom for due diligence. BFM quotes sources as saying that while the firm has a $35 billion order book, many of its contracts are not very profitable.
BFM wrote that Alstom would offer cash for Bombardier's 70% stake of its railway business and Alstom shares for the 30% held by Canada's Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec. It also said that Alstom was the only bidder for the railway business, after  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) and Hitachi (T:6501) withdrew. 
Reuters reported late last month that Bombardier had approached Alstom and Japan's Hitachi to find a merger partner for its rail business as it struggles to contain costs.

195,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2020 09:59AM ET</span>",New coronavirus: what markets should watch now,"(Reuters) - World markets started shrugging off the worst of the coronavirus impact last week and stock markets have since reached record highs. China's announcement that new cases of the so-called COVID-19 detected on Tuesday were at their lowest since Jan 30 has only consolidated those gains.
Here are some factors to watch in coming days:
HAS THE OUTBREAK PEAKED?
In short, no one can say. Disease epidemic models include factors such as the number of known infections, time passed, frequency of travel or human contact, the ease of spread and mitigating measures like quarantine or screening. 
But even those who use such models to understand the evolution of the outbreak are always updating their datasets with new information.
""In a situation like this where there are so many unknowns, it's fair to say it's impossible to predict with any kind of precision at all when the peak is going to happen,"" said Robin Thompson, a mathematical epidemiology specialist at Oxford University.
WHAT SHOULD WE LOOK FOR NOW?
World Health Organization epidemiologists are currently watching: 
-anything that sheds new light on the ease of human-to-human spread, including new cases from people with no travel history to China and geographical ""clusters"" of cases
-the emergence of a highly contagious ""super-spreaders"", such as the Chinese doctor who infected many others during a stay at a Hong Kong hotel at the height of the SARS outbreak in 2003. So far, WHO has not identified any super-spreading event and says such events should not be personalized.
-why some people die. People who are older or have underlying medical conditions are most at risk. The overall death rate among reported cases is 2% but WHO wants more data about the disease that in severe cases can cause pneumonia and organ failure.
CAN WE TRUST THE CHINESE NUMBERS?
A moot point. There has been skepticism both inside and outside China about the official tallies of new cases, without anyone coming forward with reliable alternative data. The Chinese government last week amended its case definition but it is not clear what impact that is having on the figures. Health experts also note the sheer strain on resources in some cities could mean delays in getting people tested.
WHAT'S THE IMPACT ON THE GLOBAL ECONOMY?
While the disruption caused to the world's second-largest economy is already tangible, the bigger question is whether the economic output stalled by the outbreak will simply be postponed until later in the year or lost for good. The current market assumption is that the worst will be over soon enough for the former scenario to happen. JP Morgan for example thinks that China’s annualised GDP growth rate could fall to 1% in Q1 but rebound to as high as 9.3% in the second quarter as factories start making up for lost orders and travel resumes.
The hit elsewhere could be uneven, however. The combined drag from bushfires and the coronovirus fall-out could stunt Australia's 28-year run of GDP growth, some economists fear.
Meanwhile, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell says the U.S. economy appears to be ""resilient"" and EU officials see only ""marginal"" impact on Europe so far.

196,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2020 09:40AM ET</span>",Bed Bath & Beyond's gloomy sales indicate tough turnaround ahead,"(Reuters) - Shares of  Bed Bath & Beyond Inc  (O:BBBY) were on pace for their worst day ever on Wednesday, as disappointing sales numbers raised concerns on Wall Street that the retailer's turnaround would take longer and be much tougher than anticipated.
Analysts were hoping the home furnishing chain's new Chief Executive Officer Mark Tritton to quickly overhaul the business after almost three years of falling same-store sales through divestitures, cost cuts and a revamp of merchandise.
But after Bed Bath & Beyond's Tuesday announcement of a 5.4% drop in same-store sales from the first two months of its fourth quarter due to increased promotions and falling store traffic, Wall Street dimmed its expectations.
""Tritton has a more difficult job ahead than we anticipated and more aggressive changes are needed. We are disappointed with the large step back in the business,"" analysts at Telsey advisory group wrote in a note.
Telsey said consumers were not responding well to Bed Bath & Beyond's products and pricing, and lowered its price target on the company's stock by $3 to $15. At least four other brokerages cut their price targets to as low as $10.
Bed Bath & Beyond's warning of a torrid final quarter comes just a little over a month after it withdrew its forecast for fiscal 2019.
""We are experiencing short-term pain in our efforts to stabilize the business, including the pressures of store traffic trends coupled with our own executional challenges,"" Tritton, a former  Target  Corp (N:TGT) executive, said on Tuesday.
Only five out of 18 Wall Street brokerages rate Bed Bath & Beyond's stock ""buy"" or higher. Ten rate it ""hold"" and 3 ""sell"".
The unusual mid-quarter sales announcement also led to a plunge in earnings expectations with Refinitiv's fourth quarter SmartEstimate falling to 20 cents per share on Wednesday, compared with $1.05 per share before Tuesday.
""Looking ahead, competition remains intense from both online and physical retailers, and it will take significant work to reposition the business to remain viable,"" KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Bradley Thomas said.
Shares of the company fell 24.4% to $11.22 in premarket trading."

198,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2020 09:27AM ET</span>",Royal Bank of Scotland whistleblower sues U.S. agencies in bounty battle,"By Sinead Cruise and Michelle Price
LONDON/WASHINGTON DC (Reuters) - An ex-Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) (L:RBS) employee is suing the U.S. Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for records that could relate to a bounty he says he is owed under a post-crisis whistleblower program. 
Victor Hong alleges the U.S. agencies ""capriciously"" and ""in bad faith"" flouted the law when assessing whether he was due a payout for information he provided to probes into the British bank's mis-selling of mortgage bonds in the run-up to the 2007-08 financial crisis, court filings show. 
In August 2018, RBS agreed to pay $4.9 billion to end the probes, which were led by the Justice Department. No portion of that fine has ever been deemed eligible for a reward under the whistleblower program, public records show. 
The Justice Department and the SEC have not said publicly why the RBS settlement was not deemed eligible for a potential tipster reward. 
The SEC declined to comment while the Justice Department did not respond to requests for comment. 
The Justice Department has objected to being named as a respondent in the case saying in a Jan. 30 filing that the SEC was ""the only appropriate respondent"".
Hong's move is an example of the disputes that can result from what from campaigners say is the opaque nature of the whistleblower program, set up after the financial crisis revealed a swathe of improper and illegal activity across Wall Street.
The program, which promises cash rewards should information lead to regulatory action, receives thousands of tips a year. Some advocates say only a token number of whistleblowers receive compensation and that the decision-making process over who should be rewarded is shrouded in secrecy.
""I'm sorry to say Mr Hong's experience is not atypical,"" said Tom Devine, legal director at the Washington-based Government Accountability Project.
""The bounty has been an excellent boost for law enforcement but the programs are using whistleblowers rather than rewarding them.""
SEC chairman Jay Clayton has said in the past that the program is sometimes constrained by rigid rules and that a pending proposal to tweak those rules aims to get more money into the hands of whistleblowers. 
Since it made its first payout in 2012, the whistleblower program has resulted in more than $2 billion in penalties and $387 million in rewards, SEC data shows. 
Currently, the SEC can reward tipsters whose original information leads to a penalty exceeding $1 million with rewards of between 10% and 30% of the fine. 
The SEC may also pay a reward in a related enforcement action brought by the Justice Department or other agencies, provided that settlement was based on the same information the tipster originally gave to the SEC. 
The SEC may deny claims for a range of reasons, including that the tip did not offer new information or prompt any action. Hong has supplied evidence and testimony to other legal actions against the bank but Reuters could not determine what role, if any, the information Hong provided played in the RBS settlement. 
Over the past 18 months, Hong has tried unsuccessfully to access SEC and Justice Department records that could shed light on why the agencies determined that the 2018 RBS settlement was not eligible for a reward, according to court filings. 
On Monday, he filed a motion with the U.S. Second Circuit Appeals Court seeking to compel the SEC and the Justice Department to produce the full set of records relating to the RBS settlement and the decision to deem it ineligible for a reward. 
A former managing director of risk management at RBS's U.S. operations, Hong resigned after two months on the job after discovering the mispricing https://www.reuters.com/article/us-banks-rbs-lawsuit-insight/court-documents-allege-clashes-inside-rbs-over-2008-toxic-assets-idUSKBN13B0IP of billions of dollars of mortgage bonds. 
He first approached the SEC and Justice Department offering information in December 2007, after leaving the lender the previous month, according to the filings.
He later met with Justice Department officials in December 2014, and provided testimony and documents on RBS misconduct, according to the filings which include copies of subpoenas, Hong's formal SEC tip, and emails with Justice Department officials.

The company may be “too far gone for a turnaround to ultimately succeed,” Loop Capital’s Anthony Chukumba said Wednesday, after the home goods retailer’s holiday sales decline and shrinking gross margin sent shares plunging 25% ahead of the bell. The stock is poised to fall to its lowest level since October.
The update was worse than than he and other analysts expected, leading Chukumba to question the “recently-minted president and CEO’s decision to fire nearly the entire senior management team prior to the crucial holiday selling season.” He lowered his price target to $12 per share from $15, but maintained his rating at hold, giving CEO Mark Tritton the “benefit of the doubt.”
Chukumba isn’t alone in his view. Telsey analyst Cristina Fernandez believes Tritton will need to make “more aggressive changes,” while Baird’s Peter Benedict believes the dividend is at risk given the “deteriorating” free cash flow profile. Benedict rates the stock neutral, with a $10 price target, cut from $15.
Still, Fernandez maintained her outperform rating amid her belief that the new management team can make “meaningful changes” to merchandising, stores and e-commerce capabilities, and ultimately improve performance. Her price target is $15, down from $18."

203,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 12, 2020 08:34AM ET</span>",Greek Bonds Breach 1% for First Time as Rally Defies Junk Status,"(Bloomberg) -- Greek bonds have breached a threshold that would once have been scoffed at during the financial crisis: benchmark yields below 1%.
It marks a rapid turnaround from less than a decade ago, when yields soared to nearly 45% amid fears the country would crash out of the euro area. The fact that the debt is still deemed junk seems not to have put off investors scrambling to find the last remaining pockets of yield in the government bond market.
Investors holding the nation’s debt saw returns of over 30% in the last year, according to Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) indexes. The latest rally comes on a day when most other European bonds are falling and stocks are rising, highlighting how Greek assets have turned from looking risky to act more as a bet on growth.
“It’s the hunt for yield, it’s the fear of missing out,” said Jens Peter Sorensen, chief analyst at Danske Bank A/S in Copenhagen, Denmark. “The EU has more or less bailed them out for the next eight to nine years and now they actually have a well-functioning government.”
Shrinking Debts
The economy is showing signs of getting back to normality, with growth expected to be around 2% last year, helping to shrink Greece’s debt load to about 185% of GDP last year. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said last week that she was confident the country’s debt would be eligible for its bond-buying program at some point. It needs an investment-grade rating from one of the four main agencies to be accepted.
Greek 10-year yields fell five basis points to 0.98% as of 1:00 p.m. in London. By comparison, those on similar-dated Italian bonds were at 0.93%, while much of the euro-area’s debt has negative yields. During the height of the financial crisis Greek 10-year yields topped out at nearly 45% before the country embarked on the biggest debt restructuring ever seen.
Greek Bondholders Bet on Once Unthinkable Investment-Grade Rally
The Mediterranean nation’s comeback was given extra momentum last year following the election of the center-right Kyriakos Mitsotakis and his New Democracy party. The country was able to sell 15-year debt for the first time in more than a decade last month.
It has also put in place a plan to help banks address their stockpile of bad loans, which amounts to 71 billion euros. The program, called Hercules, promises to reduce this by about 40% and Eurobank Ergasias SA is ready to be the first to make use of it by applying as soon as this month.
Banks have also been among the main beneficiaries of a stock rally that made the country’s benchmark index one of the world’s best performers in 2019. It touched a five-year high last month.
Now Sellable
The surging demand for Greek debt is helping local lenders cut pricing on bonds that would have been unsellable a year or two ago. Piraeus Bank SA drew more than 4 billion euros of bids for a syndicated 500-million euro Tier 2 note on Wednesday, letting it slash the yield to 5.5% at final terms. The group paid 9.75% on a similar deal in June.
“Greece is in a position to benefit from the increased demand for higher yielding euro bonds if the business climate and economic conditions continue to improve,” said Dimitris Dalipis, head of fixed income at Alpha Trust Mutual Fund Management SA in Athens, Greece. He said that yields could go even lower should the country benefit from rating upgrades, especially the “wildcard” of inclusion into the ECB’s bond-buying stimulus program.
Last month Fitch Ratings lifted Greece to BB with a positive outlook, or just two levels below investment grade, while S&P Global Ratings will review the country on April 24. It has Greece at BB-, or three steps into junk territory, but also with a positive outlook. Moody’s Investors Service has a one-step lower rating.
While Greek yields were already at record lows before hitting 1%, the latest milestone keeps them vying with the borrowing costs of Italy, which is rated at investment grade.
“This seemed to be only a matter of time, but it’s still amazing,” said Christoph Rieger, head of fixed-rated strategy at  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG) in Frankfurt. “What clearly helps besides the general risk-on and hunt for yield is lack of supply pressure and hopes about an investment grade-rating that could trigger ECB buying.”

Zaffino, 53, is now poised to become the next chief executive of American International Group Inc (N:AIG), one of the largest U.S. insurers, after being named president in December.
Current CEO Brian Duperreault, 72, who has not said that he is leaving, hired Zaffino as AIG’s chief operating officer in 2017 and soon after also named him head of AIG's general insurance business.
AIG declined to comment on succession planning. Zaffino did not respond to a request for comment.
Reuters spoke to 11 associates who offered a portrait of what Zaffino may be like as AIG’s next CEO, as is widely expected.
They said Zaffino is as rigorous about underwriting as he is enthusiastic about revenue growth. He expects his team to rattle off performance statistics on demand while knowing how they align with the company's goals.
AIG’s next CEO will be the seventh since 2005. The company is in the midst of a turnaround launched by Duperreault nearly three years ago.
Zaffino is described as a hard-driving “numbers guy” who digs deep into raw data to evaluate business lines instead of relying on managers’ reports.
“He appears demanding and task-oriented,"" said  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Andrew Kligerman. ""The good part is that he will likely work extremely hard and press his team to work extremely hard to achieve the objectives.""
Added another person who knows Zaffino and who spoke on condition of anonymity: “You can’t outwork him. He’s on the job 24-7.”
The person described Zaffino as always ""on,"" coaching his deputies during short car trips between events at off-site management meetings.
SOCCER GOALIE
Zaffino is fiercely competitive and disciplined, characteristics that date back to when he played as a Boston College soccer goalie and trained with the U.S. Men’s national team, they said.
Zaffino grew up as his father, longtime insurance executive Salvatore Zaffino, rose through the ranks of the industry, exposing him to industry leaders.
An operating chief is generally next in line for the CEO job, executive consultants said. That does not always happen, but naming that person president typically signals an imminent transition, perhaps within a year.
AIG has struggled to right itself after accepting a $182 billion U.S. taxpayer bailout in 2008 to save it from collapse. Since then, the company has sold off big chunks to pay back the debt plus a $22.7 billion return. It also had to work through hefty losses from claims occurring in prior years that led to more than $11.2 billion in unexpected reserve increases since 2015, most of which occurred under prior leadership.
LOOKING BEYOND DAMAGE REPAIR
Analysts and investors want Duperreault to be the last CEO whose chief responsibility is fixing old problems instead of finding ways to increase revenue. When AIG reports 2019 earnings on Thursday, Wall Street is hoping it will have significantly improved commercial underwriting profit, and is on track to meet a double-digit return-on-equity goal by 2021.
In May, AIG reported its first underwriting profit in general insurance since the financial crisis, a key goal.
Before joining AIG, Zaffino accumulated a wealth of experience as CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc’s (N:MMC) reinsurance arm and its retail insurance brokerage. He was also an executive for a former  General Electric  Co (N:GE) subsidiary that focused on alternative risk insurance and reinsurance, after launching his career at Hartford Financial Services Group Inc (N:HIG).
Duperreault has focused on sharpening underwriting, doing more with worthwhile customers, investing in technology, restoring talent and cutting costs.
Zaffino has been the point man to execute those goals, partly by mitigating losses in commercial property and casualty businesses and relying more on reinsurance while also modernizing technology and processes. He also helped to recruit a number of executives.
Nonetheless, AIG’s stock has dropped more than 11% since the current management team arrived. Analysts say whoever runs AIG next will have to fix that, too.
“They want things to happen right now,” said Piper Sandler analyst Paul Newsome, of AIG’s executives. “If you are working in that group, you are under pressure to do it right, do it now, and do it big.”"

TOKYO (Reuters) - Quarterly profit at SoftBank Group Corp (T:9983) was almost wiped out as the Japanese technology giant was hit for a second straight quarter by losses at its $100 billion Vision Fund. 
Wednesday's dismal results could further dampen investor enthusiasm for founder Masayoshi Son's big bets on untested start-ups. While Son told a news conference SoftBank had turned a corner, he also said he has been forced to scale back a second Vision Fund while investing with only SoftBank's own capital. 
That marks a major climbdown from July, when SoftBank said it had attracted $108 billion in pledges for a second mega-fund.
More pointedly, it shows how the bailout of start-up WeWork last year and other missteps have put a chill on the tech investing scene and given SoftBank shareholder Elliott ammunition to lobby for change.
""We have caused a lot of concern,"" Son said in Tokyo following the results, adding he needs to ""give everyone piece of mind"" to secure outside funds for Vision Fund 2. 
Group profit was 2.6 billion yen ($24 million) in the October-December quarter versus 438 billion yen a year before. The Vision Fund posted an operating loss of 225 billion yen ($2.05 billion) for the quarter compared with a 176 billion yen profit in the same period a year earlier. 
But Son, known for an ebullience and charisma that is still rare in corporate Japan, said the company's performance was already improving. 
""The tide is turning,"" he said.
BIG STAKE
""Softbank should focus on one thing, shareholder value creation,"" said Jeffries analyst Atul Goyal in a note to clients ahead of the earnings.
Son pointed to a rally in prices at the Vision Fund's handful of listed investments and news overnight that a U.S. federal judge had rejected an antitrust challenge to the proposed merger of SoftBank's Sprint Corp (N:S) and T-Mobile US Inc (O:TMUS).
Shares of SoftBank finished up 12% in Tokyo before the results and after the U.S. court decision. 
Son has long argued SoftBank's shares are undervalued, a position shared by U.S. hedge fund Elliott Management, which has recently emerged as a prominent shareholder. Elliott, one of the world's best known activist investors, is pushing for changes including $20 billion in stock buybacks, sources said last week. 
SoftBank has held discussions with Elliott and is aligned on improving shareholder value, Son said, adding that while open to potentially buying back shares, he was in ""no hurry"" to sell part of a 26% shareholding in  Alibaba  (N:BABA) to fund buybacks.
The Vision Fund, which is backed by Saudi Arabia and has single-handedly changed the face of tech investing, said it had invested $74.6 billion in 88 companies as at the end of December, when those investments were worth $79.8 billion.
Analysts have said it is difficult to evaluate SoftBank's performance due to a lack of disclosure around Vision Fund's internal valuations.
Son's investing credentials took a hit in the August-September quarter when the Vision Fund recorded an $8.9 billion operating loss.
Since then, a slew of portfolio companies - from hotel-booking platform Oyo to cloud robotics firm CloudMinds - have cut jobs and come under pressure to demonstrate the long-term viability of their business models.
The fund itself has also lost key employees.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open higher Wednesday, continuing the recent positive trend as investors take heart from signs the coronavirus outbreak might be peaking. 
At 7:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), futures for theS&P 500 traded 12 points, or 0.4%, higher, futures for the Nasdaq were up 49 points, or 0.5%, while the Dow Jones futures contract rose 125 points, or 0.4%. 
The death toll from China’s coronavirus, officially called Covid-19, now exceeds 1100, but there have been signs the outbreak may be peaking at the epicenter of the crisis. 
Authorities in Hubei, the province where the outbreak likely originated, said there were an additional 1,638 confirmed cases of the virus Wednesday. That is almost one-third less than the previous day's new cases. However, reports from outside China suggest that this may be due more to changes in China’s way of counting. China's National Health Commission said last week that it would no longer count new cases as confirmed until patients started showing symptoms of the disease. China's own studies suggest that people can remain asymptomatic for up to 24 days after catching the virus.
Both the S&P and Nasdaq again closed at record high levels Tuesday, posting gains in six of the last seven trading sessions and having their best months since June. 
The large-cap tech companies, which have been behind a lot of the recent gains, will be in focus Wednesday following the announcement of a regulatory probe into previous deals by these firms. The move raised fears over a more aggressive regulatory crackdown on big tech.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) is also expected to be in the spotlight after the aircraft maker reported late Tuesday that it received no new orders for commercial jets in January. By contrast, its major rival Airbus (PA:AIR) received 274 orders.
Elsewhere, the U.S. earnings season may be coming to an end, but there are still some well-known names reporting. 
Shares in   Lyft   (NASDAQ:LYFT) traded over 4% lower after hours despite reporting late Tuesday more than $1 billion in quarterly revenue. However, the ride-hailing company didn’t move up its estimates for making a profit, a disappointment in the light of Uber's hopes of becoming profitable at an underlying level by the end of this year.
Shares in Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) slumped 25% after announcing late Tuesday that same-store sales declined in December and January. The company, whose stock is heavily shorted, said it was facing inventory challenges and issues attracting customers to its stores.
CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat analysts' forecasts and revenue that topped expectations. These numbers may have impressed, but investors in CVS, as well as other stocks tied to healthcare, will be keeping an eye on developments in the Democratic primaries. This is especially with respect to Sen. Bernie Sanders, who won in New Hampshire on Tuesday and is running on a platform of single-payer health care.
Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) reports quarterly results after the bell Wednesday. The networking giant is expected to report a profit of 76 cents per share on revenue of about $12 billion, according to analysts’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
The economic calendar is pretty bare Wednesday, but Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will be back on Capitol Hill for the second half of his semiannual Congressional testimony.
Powell will start speaking to the Senate Banking Committee at 10:00 AM ET (1500 GMT), after testifying before the House Financial Services committee Tuesday. 
Elsewhere, the oil market has pushed higher Wednesday, rebounding a touch after recent losses. The U.S. government cut its forecast for world oil demand this year by 300,000 barrels a day, due to the virus outbreak, while the latest OPEC monthly report followed suit by cutting its forecast by 230,000 barrels a day.. 
The Energy Information Administration will report the latest weekly figures for U.S. oil supplies at 10:30 AM (15:30 GMT). Analysts are expecting the EIA to report a rise in inventories of about 3 million barrels, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Late Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute said that according to its measure crude stockpiles rose by 6 million barrels for the week ended Feb. 7.
AT 07:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 1.7% higher at $50.77 a barrel and the international benchmark Brent contract rose 2.2% to $55.20. Additionally, gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,569.85/oz while EUR/USD traded at 1.0923, up 0.1%."

210,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 12, 2020 06:36AM ET</span>",Bernie Sanders’s Rise Sparks Re-Evaluation by Detractors on Wall Street,"(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street has little use for Bernie Sanders. The Vermont Senator and self-described democratic socialist boasts about his antagonistic relationship with the moneyed class and plans to tax the rich and hamstring banks.
Yet the market’s been calm as he climbed in the national polls, notching a win in the New Hampshire primary -- the S&P 500 closed at an all-time high Tuesday. The reaction was different last fall, when Elizabeth Warren, another Wall Street foe, surged. Ask around now, and investors will say Sanders’s rise is different. He has no chance to beat Donald Trump in November, so why fret over him?
Another cohort on the Street is taking a different view, mindful that predicting political races, let alone the winner’s impact on stock prices, is a perilous exercise that strategists have shown little ability to get right. Recall the epic misjudgment on Trump just four years ago and prudence requires an assessment of how a Sanders administration might reshape markets. While few in the industry would cheer his victory, some are now arguing that at least some sectors could thrive.
“There are no parts of the market that would welcome Bernie Sanders, but maybe there should be,” said Kristina Hooper, Invesco’s chief global market strategist in New York.
To find a silver lining, investors have to look beyond the obvious economic criticisms leveled at Sanders, Hooper said. Chief among them is his Medicare for All plan that would upend a key pillar of the American economy, with rough implications for banks and insurers. But there would be winners, too, Hooper points out. The broader health-care sector, including hospital administrators and medical-devices makers could see gains.

Ed Al-Hussainy at Columbia Threadneedle also focused on the brighter side of Sanders’s plan. He thinks retooling the market to free employers from having to provide health insurance could boost wages and household income that have stagnated even as the job market tightened.
“One of the reasons wages remain relatively depressed is because productivity has been weak, but also because health-care costs have gone up,” said Al-Hussainy, a senior interest rates and currency analyst. “If some of that burden shifts to the government, wage growth should pick up.”
A Sanders win would do more than reshape health-care, especially if his proposals lead to a predicted bulge in the federal deficit. The long-term effects of that can be debated, but the immediate impact would be a stimulus for the economy that would buoy pretax corporate profits, according to Naufal Sanaullah, chief macro strategist at Eia Alpha Partners.
“Deficit expansion in general feeds through to other sectors of the economy,” he argued last week on Bloomberg TV. Universal health-care with an attendant reduction in individual premiums can put more money in the pockets of the lowest earners with a bigger propensity to spend, translating to stronger demand for goods and services, he said.
Read more: Bernie Has a Fan Club on Wall Street That Frets Over Inequality
For now, much of Wall Street views such logic with consternation. But the evidence is scant a president’s political leanings do much to sway stocks. Variations in equity performance when a Democrat is in the White House are almost negligible when compared with Republicans, according to research from Vanguard that was published before the 2016 election.
That won’t stop investors from assigning correlation, though, and reactions to Sanders’s policies skew to the negative because, if implemented, the immediate effects would shake up the status quo. The longer-term impact might surprise investors, Al-Hussainy says. On the rates side, he says Columbia Threadneedle is digging into how cutting health-care costs could affect the path of inflation, given that they’re among the biggest contributors to increases in the consumer prices index.
“If there is wholesale reform of the health-care system or the market gets a whiff of that, it could actually be disinflationary,” he said.
And that would keep the Federal Reserve firmly on the sidelines, pinning interest rates at historical lows that have been a boon to equity investors. An easy policy stance for years to come would depress market volatility and yields -- in contrast to expectations for a spike in rates caused by deficit spending.

Sanders’s advisers favor modern monetary theory, which argues countries that issue debt in their own currency can borrow as much as they like at low interest rates until inflation poses a problem. That could lead to an infrastructure bill to remake the nation’s crumbling bridges and roadways, or a version of the Green New Deal to rewire energy infrastructure. Both programs would ostensibly be financed by cheap government borrowing.
The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated Sanders’s program could add a whopping $13.4 trillion to the budget gap over the next decade -- more than double the impact of rival Elizabeth Warren’s plan. President Trump’s proposal, released Monday with no provisions for additional health-care spending but a line item for a Space Force, would push the gap to $1.2 trillion.
For now, it’s the threat of runaway debt and a reshaping of the American social fabric that has Wall Street on edge over Sanders. Some investors take succor from polls showing that Trump fares better against Sanders than he does against other Democratic front-runners. But his rise into real contention for the White House will keep investors scouring for any upside, no matter how difficult it is to unearth.
“It’s easy to find losers, but the relative winners are tough,” said Isaac Boltansky, financial regulation analyst at Compass Point Research & Trading.

211,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 12, 2020 06:35AM ET</span>",Sovereign Debt Funds Be Warned: Climate Activists Are Coming,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors are saving the world! Look at them out there: filing shareholder resolutions, threatening to divest from fossil fuel companies—sometimes actually doing so! Even the investment managers and pension funds that don’t do these things are often at pains to point out that they instead “engage” with companies on their concerns about climate change. 
Yet companies aren’t the only significant actors on climate change, any less than they’re the only ones affected by it. Eventually, investors concerned about how climate change will affect their portfolios will have to contend with other asset classes, including sovereign debt. 
Some countries are more dependent on high-emissions industries than others. Russia, Australia, Saudi Arabia, and Indonesia, for instance, have economies that are heavily dependent on fossil-fuel exports. If demand for these exports falls as a result of a transition to lower-carbon alternatives, that may become a problem for their creditors. To take one example: Norway’s central bank plans to exclude some oil company shares from its huge sovereign wealth fund to reduce its own exposure to a long-term decline in oil demand. 
Even those less dependent on fossil fuels are going to have to enact wrenching economic changes. Only a handful have made commitments that are consistent with limiting warming to below 2C, as the Paris Agreement states, according to Climate Action Tracker, a nonprofit research initiative. And just two—Morocco and Gambia—are 1.5C-aligned. 
Governments need financing just as much as companies, so sovereign debt holdings should in theory give investors a way to tailor their tolerance for climate risk and a lever to pull with some of the most powerful political decision-makers. The fact that it’s possible to buy information about environmental, social, and governance risks of sovereign bonds from ratings agencies and other information providers suggests there’s some interest in it already from the investor community.
So far, however, there hasn’t been much sign that investors are either punishing or rewarding governments for their climate exposure via capital markets. While poor political governance has long been a predictor of higher borrowing costs for sovereigns, there’s little evidence to date that climate exposures attract a similar penalty. 
A new paper from London School of Economics’ Grantham Institute, together with Planet Tracker, an nongovernmental organization, argues that will change over the coming decade. This focus may be particularly acute for the bigger exporters of agricultural products—particularly Argentina and Brazil—because their ability to repay debt is more dependent on “natural capital,” which will be stressed by a combination of resource depletion, changing demand, and climate impacts. 
There are a few signs of this investor focus already emerging, even if it’s not yet showing up in prices. Sweden’s Riksbank last year sold its holdings of debt from Canada’s Alberta province and the Australian states of Queensland and Western Australia on the basis that these governments are highly exposed to rapid cuts in global carbon emissions. Alberta exports an expensive and high-emissions form of crude from its oil sands, while mining of thermal coal and iron ore is a significant earner in the Australian states.
The governments in question don’t seem to be worried that the Riksbank decision will catch on. They may be assuming that the characteristics of sovereign debt markets will make it harder for climate-sensitive investors to make their displeasure felt.
It’s hard to envisage large numbers of investors following the Riksbank’s lead in the very near future, especially at a time when the hunger for safe assets has driven the interest rate on swathes of the government bond market below zero. Investors have typically demurred on passing specific comment on government policies, instead preferring broad statements exhorting all governments to act. Debt investors may be particularly constrained: They’re “often obliged to hold specific bonds when benchmarking an index or because of credit rating constraints,” according to a paper on ESG and sovereign debt published in October by the UN Principles for Responsible Investment, or PRI. “It remains to be seen how ESG integration can play a role.”
Still, it would be a mistake to bet that sovereign debt will remain immune forever. The PRI, one of the biggest sustainable finance initiatives in the world, already has a program dedicated to it. The World Bank last year launched an ESG data portal on sovereign debt and plans to release a guide to help investors engage more effectively with issuers in the next few months. 
It wasn’t so long ago that people doubted divestment campaigns would ever directly affect the cost of capital for fossil fuel companies, either—but nowadays coal executives are constantly complaining about the withdrawal of finance, and even BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). has promised to join the debt-divestment crowd. Sovereign debt issuers, especially those that are smaller or “semisovereign” states and provinces, may be more vulnerable than they realize.

Investing.com -- Heineken’s veteran chief executive Jean-Francois van Boxmeer is bowing out with a flourish - and his successor is going to have to work hard to match it.
The Dutch-based brewing giant reported better-than-expected trends in both price and volume growth in the fourth quarter, giving it the confidence to predict another increase of around 5% in operating profit this year.
That had seemed in doubt after Heineken’s last update, when it warned of all the usual headwinds to growth worldwide, but strong performances in Brazil and south-east Asia in the last three months of 2019 appear to have allayed those risks.
The company both sold more beer and got a higher price for it, thanks to past spending on persuading customers that fermented barley water is actually a premium product.
Organic sales volumes were up 3.1% on the year, while average selling prices were up 3.3%, not bad for an industry considered to be facing structural decline as consumer tastes evolve.
Heineken’s stock rose to a new all-time high in response before easing off slightly. By 5:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), it was up 5.9%, on course for its best one-day gain in a year.
That came on a day when Europe’s stocks were again in risk-on mode on growing hopes that the coronavirus outbreak in China (now officially dubbed Covid-19) is peaking. The benchmark Stoxx 600 also hit a new all-time high before retracing a little to 430.04, up 0.4% on the day.
Heineken’s numbers reinforce the positive mood music created last week by Carlsberg (CSE:CARLa), which raised its dividend sharply after reporting a 24% increase in profit for the year.
But what’s true for Heineken’s premiumized beers is also true for its stock, which looks expensive at over 30 times trailing earnings and a dividend yield of less than 2%. Even after today’s hike in the dividend, the payout is still less than 40% of net earnings, which compares poorly to the 50% payout ratio at Carlsberg (CSE:CARLa). Nor was there any mention of future share buybacks in today’s release.
Carlsberg (CSE:CARLa) can afford its (still-modest) buyback plan because it has the stronger balance sheet: net debt is only 1.25 times EBITDA, compared to Heineken’s 2.6 times (although AB Inbev would happily change places with either of them, given a ratio of nearly four times).
Both of northern Europe's big brewers emerged with credit from a difficult year. And it will do Heineken no harm that the new CEO, Dolf van den Brink, is steeped in the group’s Asian business, which arguably faces the stiffest challenge of all in 2020. He’ll need all that expertise to defend a valuation which is higher than ever in absolute terms, and looking increasingly stretched on relative ones."

PARIS (Reuters) - Major aircraft lessor Avolon and its peers stand to benefit from the coronavirus outbreak as airlines shore up cash by refinancing their planes, the Dublin-based firm said on Wednesday.
A sale-and-leaseback trend among airlines ""will unquestionably be accentuated now with the coronavirus"", Chief Executive Domhnal Slattery told Reuters after Avolon posted $718 million in net income for 2019.
""The phone hasn't stopped ringing,"" Slattery said.
Privately-held Avolon, the world's third-biggest lessor of commercial jets, is 70%-owned by a subsidiary of Chinese conglomerate Hainan Group.
Plane refinancing tends to pick up when airlines are buffeted by global crises such as the 1990-1 Gulf War, the Sept. 11 terror attacks a decade later or 2003 SARS virus epidemic.
""If we look at the past as a guide it typically has allowed us to outperform,"" Slattery said, adding that sale-and-leaseback interest had already risen on trade tensions and economic uncertainty, and would get a further boost from the virus.
""We never set out to exploit or anything like that in a scenario like this, but obviously the risk profile is changed as a consequence of (the virus) so they tend to be strong transactions from our perspective.""
Slattery acknowledged a refinancing surge would also benefit rivals - which include listed firms Aercap (N:AER) and  Air Lease Corp  (N:AL) - but said Avolon's cash resources and 2.2 debt-to-equity ratio made it particularly well placed.
""With $6 billion of cash available to us now, I think we're in the strongest position of any of our lessor competitors to be proactive and supportive,"" he said."
216,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2020 04:55AM ET</span>","U.S. stores, online sales boost Ahold's quarterly profit","By Anthony Deutsch and Toby Sterling
AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Food retailer Ahold Delhaize (AS:AD) met forecasts with a 3% rise in fourth-quarter core earnings on Wednesday helped by its Food Lion and Hannaford U.S. grocery chains and strong online sales.
Ahold, which generates two-thirds of its sales in the United States, forecast 2020 margins ""broadly in line"" with last year and mid-single-digit growth in underlying earnings per share.
Overall underlying operating income rose to 765 million euros ($834 million) for the three months to Dec. 31 from 743 million. Sales rose 5.5% to 17.4 billion euros, helped by a strong dollar.
The results were in line with the profit of 762 million euros on sales of 17.3 billion forecast by analysts, Refinitiv Eikon data showed.
""Total results ended with a strong fourth quarter and good closure of the year. We are, across the numbers, indeed better than consensus, so we are pretty happy with the results,"" Ahold Chief Executive Officer Frans Muller told Reuters.
In the U.S. market, where it is concentrated in the eastern United States and also operates the Stop & Shop and Giant chains, comparable sales grew 2.3%.
Ahold, which competes with the likes of Kroger (N:KR), Walmart (N:WMT) and Amazon (O:AMZN), said its U.S. online sales jumped nearly 43%.
""Last year, we made $1.1 billion in online sales in the U.S. and that's a strong number,"" Muller said. ""That makes us still the leader on the East Coast.""
The company maintained its online sales target of 7 billion euro by 2021, up from 4.55 billion in 2019.
For 2020, the business is targeting 30% online sale growth in the United States, where it is opening hundreds of new grocery pick-up points and expanding warm meal delivery.
""We are going to make that number organically ourselves, but when we see opportunities to add additional capabilities, then we are alert on that,"" he said.
In the Benelux countries, where Ahold operates the dominant Albert Heijn supermarket chain, comparable sales rose 4.3%. Ahold said it had won market share for the first time in several quarters, as online sales continued a strong upward trend.
Its online store, Bol.com, with roughly 2.8 billion euros in sales and 10 million customers, is planning a French language site for customers in Belgium, Muller said.
Online sales in the Netherlands, where Amazon has been making inroads, rose 27.5% in the quarter.
""We've been in business a long time with Bol.com,"" he said. ""It is up to us now to show how strong that local network is."""

(Reuters) - European shares hit a record high for the second straight session on Wednesday, as a drop in new coronavirus cases prompted buying in China-focused stocks, even as investors remained wary of the epidemic's economic impact. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) rose as much as 0.4% to a fresh peak of 430.29. A drop in new virus cases on Tuesday as well as optimism over China's liquidity measures had seen gains in China-sensitive stocks.
""There is a risk-on-and-on-and-on sentiment at this moment... Markets have swallowed the coronavirus issue with ease and have just continued buying,"" said Teeuwe Mevissen, senior market economist at Rabobank in Amsterdam. 
""You would almost expect some kind of correction for stocks markets to be around the corner. I don't see it continuing at this pace."" 
China reported its lowest number of new infections since late-January on Wednesday, leading many to believe that the outbreak, which caused widespread disruptions in one of Europe's biggest trading partners, could have peaked.
However, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that the virus outbreak may have some impact on the U.S. economy.
Basic resources (SXPP) and automobile stocks (SXAP), which depend heavily on Chinese demand for their exports, rose about 1.4% and 2%, respectively.
The resources sector also took support from stronger iron ore and base metal prices, which rose on optimism over a resurgence in Chinese demand.
Among individual movers, Swedish casino software developer Evolution Gaming AG (ST:EVOG) topped the STOXX 600 with a 10% gain after its fourth-quarter revenue and core earnings surged.
Dutch bank ABN Amro (AS:ABNd) dropped to the bottom of the STOXX 600 after it clocked a weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter net income. Losses in the stock also weighed on the banks subindex (SX7P).
Markets were waiting for December data on European industrial production, which is likely to have slowed from the prior month, according to a Reuters poll. 
Rabobank's Mevissen said a drop in production was largely priced into markets, given the long-drawn decline seen in the sector over the past year.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) may report its first quarterly loss in more than a decade on Thursday because of slumping sales, sources familiar with the company said, adding more pressure on efforts to rebuild the company after Carlos Ghosn's ouster.
Deteriorating profits underscore the challenges facing Nissan, which is unwinding many of the expansionist strategies championed by ex-Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Ghosn by slashing jobs, production sites and product offerings to save cash and ensure its survival.
In addition to slumping sales, production disruptions caused by China's coronavirus outbreak could also drag profits lower.
Three senior officials at Japan's No. 2 automaker told Reuters that they anticipate a poor results announcement on Thursday, with one of them calling the figures ""dismal"".
Two of the officials cautioned that there is the possibility of an operating loss, which would be the first quarterly loss since the period ending in March 2009.
Nissan said it could not comment on its financial results ahead of its official announcement.
The company is likely to report operating profit of 48.6 billion yen ($442.5 million) for the quarter ending in December, less than half the 103 billion yen profit a year ago, according to SmartEstimate's survey of three analysts, who revised their forecasts in January.
However, those forecasts were issued before the release of the December vehicle sales figures on Jan. 30, which show third-quarter sales dropped by 11% from the year earlier period, according to Reuters calculations. That is the biggest quarterly slump of its current sales downturn that began two years ago.
That sales decline led one auto equities analyst based in Japan to scrap his forecast and also warn that Nissan could post a loss.
""It will be a question of whether there will be a profit or a loss. For the quarter, a loss is a possibility,"" he said, declining to be named as his forecast had not been updated to reflect his latest view.
One of the three Nissan officials said there is a risk the automaker may cut its full-year profit forecast of 150 billion yen, which would be an 11-year low. The company announced that forecast in November after an initial 230 billion yen outlook.
Since the start of the fiscal year in April, Nissan's global sales have slumped 8.3% versus the year ago period as it struggles to sell its Rogue SUV crossover and its Sentra sedan, two of its three top-selling models in the United States, after years of heavy discounting in that key market has tarnished its image.
For the first nine months of the fiscal year, the company has sold 3.81 million vehicles. It risks missing its full-year target of 5.24 million, a decline of 5% from the prior year's sales, amid prolonged production halts in China.

Jiangsu New Times Shipbuilding Co, with a production capacity of 5 million deadweight tonnes (DWT) per annual, has issued a force majeure notice to 2020 Bulkers , a Bermuda-based cargo operator, following the virus epidemic.
Two newcastlemax dry bulk vessels due to be delivered in April and May are facing possible construction delays, 2020 Bulkers said in a statement on Tuesday, citing a force majeure declaration from New Times on Feb. 5.
A New Times spokesman confirmed the force majeure on the two vessels. ""Workers are still not coming back to their positions due to the coronavirus. It is not known when they will resume work and when the two vessels will be completed.""
The death toll of the coronavirus in the country reached 1,113 by the end of Tuesday, while total infections hit 44,653, according to the state's health commission.
Chinese authorities have asked companies to put workers into quarantine for 14 days after returning from their hometowns for the Lunar New Year holiday, which has been extended by a week, in order to rein in the spread of the virus.
The China Association of the National Shipbuilding Industry data shows that around 75% of workers have come back to work at key shipbuilding companies in the southeastern provinces of Fujian and Liaoning, but only around 62.5% workers returned to Shanghai as of Monday.
However, shipbuilding companies at Guangdong, Shandong and Jiangsu, where New Times is located, are seeing workers ""gradually"" restart to work, the association said."

Investing.com - European stock markets pushed higher Wednesday, helped by strong earnings from the likes of brewing giant   Heineken   (AS:HEIN) and chemicals company   Akzo Nobel   (AS:AKZO), amid signs that the coronavirus outbreak is peaking. 
At 04:08 ET (0908 GMT), the U.K.'s FTSE index was trading 18 points, or 0.2%, higher, France's CAC 40 was up 18 points, or 0.3%, while the DAX gained 75 points, or 0.6%. The Stoxx 600 index, which represents a broad swathe of companies across 17 countries in Europe, traded 0.3% higher, albeit off a new record high of 430.30 it hit earlier. 
Shares in  Heineken  (AS:HEIN), the world's second-largest brewer, soared over 5% after the company said it expects operating profit this year to grow by a mid-single digit percentage. It reported a 14% rise in 2019 net profit, with solid increases in both volumes and average selling prices in the fourth quarter. The brewer announced on Tuesday Jean-François van Boxmeer is to step down after almost 15 years at the helm.
Shares in   Kering   (PA:PRTP) climbed over 3% after the Gucci owner posted higher-than-expected sales for the fourth quarter of 2019. It warned that the coronavirus health scare in China could heighten uncertainties for the luxury goods market.
On the flip side, shares in Dutch bank ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd) fell over 6% after missing expectations for its fourth quarter net earnings as interest income fell and impairments rose.
Earlier Wednesday, an influential economist at a top government think tank Wednesday helped the tone by saying China will be able to achieve its long-term goal of doubling gross domestic product and incomes in the decade to 2020, despite the impact from the coronavirus.
This comes amid signs the outbreak may be peaking at the epicenter of the crisis. Authorities in Hubei, the province where the outbreak likely originated, said there were an additional 1,638 confirmed cases of the virus Wednesday. That is almost one-third less than the previous day's new cases, suggesting that the spread of the virus may be leveling off in this key province. 
However, Taiwan News reported that Chinese authorities have stopped counting new cases if patients display no symptoms. As the incubation period of the disease can last up to 24 days, this would appear to create a significant risk of undercounting.
Back in Europe, the economic calendar in Europe is thinly populated Wednesday, with the only release of note being the December industrial production figure for the euro zone, at 05:00 AM ET (1000 GMT). This is expected to illustrate the extent of the manufacturing slowdown in the region.
Elsewhere, the oil market has pushed higher Wednesday, rebounding a touch after recent losses. The release of the latest OPEC monthly report, at 06:00 AM ET (1100 GMT), should provide some guidance as to the key developments impacting oil market trends in world oil demand, supply as well as the oil market balance. The U.S. government cut its forecast for world oil demand this year by 300,000 barrels a day.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.7% higher at $50.80 a barrel and the international benchmark Brent contract rose 2.2% to $55.18. Additionally, gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,565.75/oz while EUR/USD traded at 1.0923, up 0.1%."

LONDON (Reuters) - Serbia aims to make its local debt euroclearable by year-end and to ramp up foreign holdings in its debt markets to 40% in the near future, the country's finance minister Sinisa Mali said.
Making local debt euroclearable means investors would then be able to settle through Euroclear. The Belgium-based firm specializes in the settlement and safe-keeping of domestic and cross-border securities for bonds, equities and derivatives, making it easier for international investors to trade.
The Serbian government is expected to sign the terms for an agreement with Euroclear in October.
""For me this is the cherry on the cake... We will do whatever we need to do in the next couple of months,"" Mali told Reuters after signing a memorandum of understanding with Euroclear.
""We will work on this process and have euroclearable bonds, maybe even as early as the end of this year.""
Access to an international settlement system usually brings more foreign capital to a market and often lowers bond yields, as was the case in Russia, where rouble debt became ""euroclearable"" in 2013.
Mali said he hoped this would help attract more foreign investors to Serbia, largest of the Western Balkan nations.
""Euroclearability will broaden the base of international investors, that is why I expect a huge jump from 30% to 40%,"" said Mali, adding he hoped eventually that half of all local bonds would be held by investors abroad.
RATINGS UPGRADE
Mali said the government was in regular contact with ratings agencies and that Serbia was in line for its first investment grade rating.
""We expect this as early as this year,"" he said.
Both S&P Global Ratings and Fitch have upgraded Serbia to BB+ - one notch below investment grade - in the past five months. S&P also has a positive outlook, citing strong FDI inflows and fiscal discipline.
The government plans to issue around 230 billion Serbian dinars ($2.14 billion) of debt in local markets and another $2 billion euros on international capital markets, denominated in euros.
The government has ramped up investment spending plans, pledging to spend around 14 billion euros ($15.3 billion) in the next five years to improve living standards and infrastructure.
The investment plan comes ahead of a parliamentary election expected in late April. President Aleksandar Vucic's ruling Serbian Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party has faced anti-government protests and scandals involving top officials in recent months, and the opposition has said it will boycott the vote.
Mali said the government was looking at possibly adding a Chinese yuan-denominated instrument to its debt mix in coming years and could also issue a green bond either on domestic and international markets in 2021.
Mali was also hopeful Serbia's local currency bonds would be included on the widely tracked JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Government Bond Index Emerging Markets (GBI-EM) in the coming two months after making it onto the index provider's watchlist some 10 days ago.
The minister said Serbia's economy was on track to ramp up its economic growth to 7% in the next five years.
""The worst in austerity measures is behind us, now it is time to grow,"" he said."

At 02:25 ET (0725 GMT), the DAX futures contract traded 40 points, or 0.3% higher. France's CAC 40 futures were up 18 points, or 0.3%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 24 points, or 0.3%. Futures on the pan-eurozone index, the Euro Stoxx 50, climbed 12 points, or 0.3%. 
Helping the tone were comments from an influential economist at a top government think tank Wednesday, who stated that China will be able to achieve its long-term goal of doubling gross domestic product and incomes in the decade to 2020 despite the impact from the coronavirus outbreak. 
A growth rate of about 5.7% this year will be enough for achieving the goal of doubling GDP and incomes, said Cai Fang, the vice head of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, in an article in the People's Daily, the newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, reported by Reuters.
This would still represent a drop from the 6.0% growth rate seen at the end of last year, but would be a considerable improvement on the dire predictions that a number of economists have recently offered up.
And this comes amid signs the outbreak may be peaking at the epicenter of the crisis. Authorities in Hubei, the province where the outbreak likely originated, said there were an additional 1,638 confirmed cases of the virus Wednesday. That is almost one-third less than the previous day's new cases, suggesting that the spread of the virus may be leveling off in this key province.

The company said the virus outbreak, which has particularly affected its key Chinese market, could have an impact on ""consumption trends and tourism flows, and their ability to affect economic growth."" 
Last year Kering, like other luxury labels, managed to offset a sharp decline in sales in Hong Kong, due to months of protests in the Chinese-ruled city, thanks to strong growth in mainland China.
But with entire cities in the world's second biggest economy shut off, flights canceled and many countries banning entry to visitors coming from China, Kering and other high-end houses could face a major sales hit. 
Kering's financial chief Jean-Marc Duplaix told reporters the company ""remained very confident about its growth potential in the medium and long term"" despite the current uncertainty. 
Kering's revenues rose 13.8% to 4.36 billion euros ($4.76 billion) in the October to December period, up 11.4% on a like-for-like basis, which strips out currency changes and acquisitions. 
That was broadly in line with its performance in the previous quarter and beat analyst forecasts, despite sales halving in Hong Kong, according to Duplaix. 
Kering, which also owns brands like Saint Laurent and Balenciaga, now relies on Gucci for 83% of its recurring operating income. 
Duplaix said Gucci had returned to growth in the United States in the fourth quarter after an advertising and diversity campaign helped reverse a decline in sales there. 
The group posted a 37.4% drop in net income for 2019, penalized in part by a record Italian tax settlement of 1.25 billion euros linked to Gucci. 

Italian puffer jacket maker Moncler warned this week that shopper numbers at its stores in China had plunged 80% since the coronavirus outbreak, while jewelery maker Pandora has said business in the country had ground to a halt.

LONDON/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - JPMorgan (N:JPM) has been picked as an adviser for the sale of a stake in a $7.3 billion motorway in Turkey, four sources familiar with the matter said.
Billed as a landmark project in the financing of infrastructure schemes involving the government and the private sector in Turkey, the final section of the 426 km-long Gebze-Orhangazi-Izmir motorway was inaugurated last year to link Istanbul in the northwest to the western port city of Izmir.
Construction consortium Otoyol AS said in late January last year that it had started seeking international advisers to value the project ahead of a possible stake sale.
One of the sources, who had direct knowledge of the matter, said the total value of the sale depended on interest from potential buyers.
JPMorgan declined to comment, while Otoyol did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Italian contractor  Astaldi  (MI:AST), which has a stake of just under 19% in the project, has been hard hit by a downturn in Italy's construction industry and is under a creditor protection scheme. It has already agreed to sell its 33% stake in the third Bosphorus Bridge to its Turkish partner, a move aimed to help the Italian builder complete a rescue plan.
Turkish firms Nurol Insaat, Özaltin and Makyol each hold a 26.98% stake in the consortium while Göçay, another Turkish company, has a 0.2% share in the consortium, according to their filings.
The joint venture was awarded a 22-year and four month build, operate, transfer contract in 2009, a model used to finance large-scale infrastructure schemes where the government grants a concession to private firms to finance, build and operate a project.
Total investment in the project was $7.3 billion, including $5 billion from debt, $1.5 billion from equity and $800 million from operational revenues, according to the consortium's website."

The company had tempered profit hopes in October, saying it would rise by 4%, the bottom of its previous forecast of mid-single digit percentage growth.
Heineken said volume and price growth, together with consumers shifting up to more expensive beers, and a more moderate rise in input costs would lead to mid-single digit percentage rise in operating profit this year.
The average market expectation is for profit growth of 6% this year, according to a company-compiled consensus."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Global share markets nudged higher on Wednesday amid hopes the worst of the coronavirus in China may have passed, although prevailing uncertainty about the outbreak kept investors wary.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) was up 0.9% while Chinese shares (CSI300) reversed early losses to trade up 0.41%.
Oil futures, which have been in a downtrend since the start of the year, rose in Asia from 13-month lows due to budding optimism about the virus and hopes that output cuts by major producers will support prices.
The yuan gained slightly in onshore trade and safe-havens such as Treasuries, the yen and the Swiss franc were marginally weaker in a sign of slowly improving sentiment.
The global mood brightened after China's senior medical adviser said on Tuesday the number of new coronavirus cases was falling in some provinces and forecast the epidemic would peak this month.
Shares in Hong Kong rose 0.9% to a three-week high. Australian shares (AXJO) were up 0.47%, while Japan's Nikkei stock index (N225) rose 0.53%.
Euro Stoxx 50 futures (STXEc1) were up 0.05%, German DAX futures (FDXc1) were up 0.08%, and FTSE futures (FFIc1) were up 0.13%.
The number of new cases in Hubei, the province at the epicenter of the outbreak, was 1,068 as of Tuesday, down from a peak of over 3,000 new cases on Feb. 4, and the lowest number of new infections since Jan. 31.
However, investors will likely need to see more evidence that the virus, which emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year and has spread to 24 other countries and territories, is indeed receding before they take on more risk.
Concerns that the virus will slow factory activity and consumer spending in the world's second-largest economy have roiled global stocks and commodities, and many of these markets are still trying to regain their footing.
""Evidence suggests the positive mood will continue, and we see some coordination in markets with oil rallying, base metals up and Treasuries coming under pressure,"" said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney.
""It does appear there is increasing comfort that the virus won't impact growth in a significant way, but I am not ready to buy risk assets yet.""
U.S. stock futures (ESc1) rose 0.22% in Asia on Wednesday. The S&P 500 (SPX) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (IXIC) inched to their second consecutive closing high on Tuesday.
Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes (US10YT=RR) fell further in Asia, pushing yields up to 1.6195%.
Treasury prices declined on Tuesday after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the U.S. economy is resilient.
Powell also said he is closely monitoring the coronavirus in China, because it could lead to disruptions that affect the global economy.
Chinese firms and factories are struggling to get back to work after the extended Lunar New Year holiday. Some companies say they need loans and are laying off workers as supply chains for global firms from car manufacturers to smartphone makers ruptured.
Stocks in New Zealand (NZ50) rose to a record high and then pared gains. The local dollar rose 0.83% to $0.6460 for its biggest daily gain since December after the country's central bank dropped a reference to the chance of further cuts, suggesting its easing cycle might be over.
In the commodities market, U.S. crude futures (CLc1) rose 1.36% to $50.62 a barrel, while Brent crude (LCOc1) rose 1.74% to $54.95 per barrel on hopes that Chinese demand for oil will pick up once the flu-like virus is contained.
Saudi Arabia wants global oil producers to agree a quick supply cut in response to the coronavirus, sources familiar with the kingdom's thinking have told Reuters, which is another supportive factor for crude futures.
In the onshore market, the yuan inched higher to 6.9624 per dollar.
The yen traded at 109.83 versus the greenback, on course for its third day of decline, while the Swiss franc held steady at 0.9755 against the dollar."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian investigator who helped bring criminal cartel charges against  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) told a court on Wednesday he felt ""pressure"" after his boss made public comments suggesting imminent prosecutions.
The disclosure in a pre-trial hearing relates to a central plank of the defense in Australia's biggest white collar criminal case, over a controversial 2015 stock issue for Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ): the banks' lawyers want to show investigators used tainted evidence and deviated from regular process due to pressure.
The matter of Australia vs Citi, Deutsche, ANZ and several of their current and former executives is being closely watched by investment bankers around the world because it could have implications on the way they are allowed to run share sales. If found guilty, the banks face hefty fines while the individuals face prison time.
Citi, Deutsche, ANZ and their senior staff are accused of colluding during a 2015 stock issue for ANZ to withhold unsold shares and keep the stock from falling. Though none of the defendants has entered a formal plea, all have said they will plead not guilty.
In his third day testifying at the hearing, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) enforcement director Michael Taylor said that while he was looking into the capital raising the regulator's chairman made public comments ""saying we had some criminal prosecutions in the works"".
Asked by ANZ's lawyer, Tim Game, if the comments had created ""pressure from above"", Taylor replied: ""in general terms, the chairman had been saying, 'we've got a number of criminal cartel investigations...that are nearing completion'.
""Would that constitute pressure? I think yes,"" Taylor told the packed court room.
Taylor did not describe the chairman's comments further. The ACCC has declined to comment on the matter while it is before the court.
Taylor was also asked about a witness statement made by an executive at a third investment bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), which worked on the same share sale but agreed to cooperate with the authorities in exchange for immunity.
An early draft of the JPMorgan person's statement had said the banks acted as a ""syndicate"" and it was impossible to predict what effect it would have if they sold their ANZ shares. Those remarks were not there in the final statement.
Game, ANZ's lawyer, asked Taylor if he had removed the passage because it ""counters the idea that there was a cartel to fix the price"".
""I would have liked it to stay in the statement,"" said Taylor.
""It shows a disorderly market,"" said Game. ""You didn't want this in the document.""
Taylor said he had ""absolutely no issue"" whether the passage was in or out of the statement and the witness alone chose to remove it.
""I've had no preordained conspiracy theory here,"" Taylor said.
The hearing continues on Wednesday."

The court ruled that since the tests were paid by their medical insurance companies the patients were not deprived of any money or property in taking Theranos blood testing services.
It also said there was no evidence to show that Holmes and the company's former president Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani directed doctors to make misrepresentations to their patients.
However, the federal court refused to dismiss the charge of wire fraud.
According to the indictment, Holmes and Balwani encouraged doctors and patients to use the company's blood testing services even though they knew Theranos was not capable of consistently producing accurate and reliable results for certain blood tests.
Holmes and Balwani were indicted in June 2018 on 11 counts of conspiracy and wire fraud. They have pleaded not guilty.
Holmes, a Stanford University dropout, started Theranos at age 19. Questions were first raised about the accuracy and reliability of the company's signature blood-testing device in a series of articles in the Wall Street Journal in 2015."

MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines'  DoubleDragon Properties Corp  (PS:DD) plans a sale of shares worth up to 66 billion pesos ($1.3 billion) in a real estate investment trust (REIT), starting this year, to generate funds for expansion, its chairman said on Wednesday.
DoubleDragon is one of the largest landlords of Chinese offshore gaming operators, which are the biggest office tenants in Manila, the capital, occupying 1.26 million sq. m. of space by the end of 2019, data from Colliers International shows.
Last month, the Philippines made rules on REITs more attractive by lowering public float requirements and offering tax perks, a move expected to entice property firms to tap the markets for new capital.
DoubleDragon plans annual share sales of 11 billion pesos ($217.56 million) in its REIT from 2020 to 2025, Chairman Edgar Sia told Reuters in an e-mail.
Each REIT offer will include 200,000 sqm of DoubleDragon's leasing assets, he added.
""We intend to choose the most mature assets for the first tranche of REIT listing in the first year, and then the following year choose another batch of leasable space that has ripened and matured that year,"" Sia said.
Property firms shied away from the REIT law of 2009 because of a high public ownership requirement and transaction taxes.
Last week,  Ayala Land  Inc (PS:ALI) filed an application for a share sale of up to 14.4 billion pesos ($284.9 million) in a REIT, the country's first.
REITs, which manage real estate assets such as hotels, office buildings and malls that regularly generate profits, are attractive to investors seeking regular dividends.
DoubleDragon targets a portfolio of 1.2 million sq.m. of office leasing, provincial retail and industrial warehouse by 2020.
New funds from the REIT offering will be used for provincial projects, Sia said. Most of DoubleDragon's commercial projects are in the provinces, where retail is not as saturated as the capital."

However, sellers aren’t willing to budge much, betting the outbreak of the deadly virus will be short-lived and demand in the world’s least-affordable housing market will soon rebound. Prices in the secondary market rose 0.8% between Jan. 19 to Feb. 2, according to Centaline.
“Owners believe the disease can be contained, therefore their outlook on the property market isn’t very bleak,” said Benny Wan, a branch manager at Centaline. “This is unlike SARS, when people had to slash prices drastically because they had never witnessed anything like that. The market condition isn’t that severe now.”
The number of diagnosed coronavirus cases in Hong Kong climbed to 49 as of late Tuesday, RTHK reported. Fear of catching the disease has also deterred people from visiting showrooms, while would-be sellers are reluctant to open their homes for inspection.

Boeing is re-examining plans for a mid-market jet designed to carry 220-270 passengers after a crisis over the grounding of its smaller 737 MAX absorbed its attention in the past year, leaving the door open to rival Airbus to sell its A321XLR.
The delay gives Rolls-Royce more time to develop its efficient new Ultrafan engine technology, for which it has started building parts for a demonstrator.
""We are open-minded ... and will stay open-minded when we know what Boeing plans to do,"" Chris Cholerton, president of civil aerospace at the British engineering company, told reporters at the Singapore Airshow.
The comments came a year after Rolls-Royce dropped out of the race to power Boeing's planned mid-market aircraft, saying it did not want to risk more disruption for airline customers by rushing out a product without extensive testing.
Boeing had originally planned a 2025 entry to service for its New Midsize Airplane, but industry sources say any new attempt could result in an aircraft reaching the market closer to 2028.
Boeing chief executive Dave Calhoun has said the company is taking a fresh look at the opportunities for a new aircraft. 
Cholerton also said Rolls-Royce was progressing well in resolving reliability issues with its Trent 1000 engine that resulted in dozens of Boeing 787s being left idle. Other members of the 25-year-old Trent engine family are unaffected, he said.
""We making good progress with understanding and implementation of those fixes,"" he added.

Investing.com - Softbank's (T:9984) shares in Japan surged 14% on Wednesday in Asia after a U.S. judge approved a $26 billion merger between T-Mobile and Sprint, the carrier SoftBank bought nearly a decade ago. 
""All necessary federal approvals required for the [merger] to close have been obtained,"" SoftBank said in a press release on Wednesday.
Masayoshi Son, CEO of the company, attempted to merge Sprint and T-Mobile back in 2013, but the deal was blocked by the Obama administration amid concerns about regulatory challenges.
""I lost my confidence that moment ... I really didn't like the world anymore, I did a lot of thinking, and I lost my hair,"" Son joked at a 2017 earnings presentation.
Sprint's (NYSE:S) stock soared more than 70% in New York on Tuesday after the court approval. T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) finished up nearly 12%.
SoftBank is due to report its quarterly earnings later in the day. "

Investing.com - Asian markets were mixed in morning trade on Wednesday as investors digested the latest views from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.
China’s Shanghai Composite slipped 0.1% by 10:01 PM ET (02:01 GMT). The Shenzhen Component gained 0.6%. 
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index also rose 0.5%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 traded 0.6% higher after returning from a holiday. Softbank's (T:9984) stock skyrocketed as much as 12% after a U.S. district judge approved a merger between Sprint (NYSE:S) and T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS). SoftBank is a major shareholder of Sprint.
South Korea’s KOSPI edged down 0.2% after government data today showed the country’s unemployment rate rose for a fifth month in January. 
The jobless rate climbed to 4% during the month, increasing from a revised 3.7% in December, government data showed Wednesday. Economists had forecast a rate of 3.8%.
Down under, Australia’s ASX 200 advanced 0.5%.
Overnight, Powell said in remarks before U.S. lawmakers that the fed is closely monitoring the fallout from the deadly coronavirus outbreak in China.
“In particular, we are closely monitoring the emergence of the coronavirus, which could lead to disruptions in China that spill over to the rest of the global economy,” he said.
However, Powell stopped short of saying the disease had changed the central bank baseline outlook for the U.S. economy. 
“The FOMC believes that the current stance of monetary policy will support continued economic growth, a strong labor market and inflation returning to the committee’s symmetric 2% objective,” Powell said. “As long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with this outlook, the current stance of monetary policy will likely remain appropriate.”"
241,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2020 09:53PM ET</span>",SoftBank stock surges to seven-month high after judge OKs Sprint-T-Mobile merger,"By Sam Nussey
TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) stock surged to its highest price in over half a year in Tokyo on Wednesday, after a U.S. federal judge rejected an antitrust challenge to the proposed takeover of subsidiary Sprint Corp (N:S) by T-Mobile US Inc (O:TMUS).
The ruling brings the Japanese technology conglomerate a significant step closer to slashing its exposure to a troubled asset at a time when other major bets face investor scepticism, and as it struggles to find backing for a successor to its $100 billion Vision Fund.
""This is obviously great news for Sprint... It is better news for SoftBank,"" analyst Kirk Boodry at Redex Holdings wrote in a note on the Smartkarma platform.
A deal would remove the risk of SoftBank having to inject further funds into Sprint, though T-Mobile may push for better terms given Sprint's relative weakness, Boodry wrote.
Sprint is one of SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son's biggest overseas investments with Japanese ownership reaching 84%, but the U.S. wireless carrier has struggled to compete with larger rivals, weighing down the group.
It has long been linked with a merger with rival T-Mobile - leaving SoftBank with a minority stake - and on Tuesday, a federal judge rejected a claim by a group of states that such a tie-up would violate antitrust laws or raise prices.
The ruling sent Sprint shares soaring 78%, while those of T-Mobile climbed 12%. SoftBank saw its shares open 12.5% higher in Tokyo on Wednesday, ending morning trade up 13.7% at 5,843 yen.
The Japanese firm reports its earnings later on Wednesday, with Son speaking at an earnings briefing from 0700 GMT.
Analysts on average expect SoftBank to report a 20% on-year fall in operating profit for the October-December quarter, weighed down by the performance of some of its Vision Fund's tech bets.
SHAREHOLDER VALUE
The ruling is the latest news to boost SoftBank stock, which has risen 20% year-to-date, after sources last week told Reuters that activist hedge fund Elliott Management has amassed a stake of almost $3 billion in SoftBank and is pushing for change at the firm including $20 billion in stock buybacks.
Under pressure to boost shareholder value, SoftBank is likely to launch a share buyback this month, Jefferies analyst Atul Goyal wrote in a note. The purchases should be funded by a partial sale of SoftBank's 26% stake in Chinese e-commerce major  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA), Goyal said.
Son previously dipped into the stake - which is currently worth $150 billion - selling Alibaba shares ahead of the 2016 acquisition of British chip designer Arm.
SoftBank won big with Alibaba but has fared less well with its massive bets on U.S. office-sharing company WeWork and ride-hailing firm  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER), and is struggling to raise outside capital for a second Vision Fund.
WeWork Chairman Marcelo Claure has pulled forward the start-up's target of becoming free cash flow positive by a year to 2022 in a boost to SoftBank's bid to win back investor trust."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Google (O:GOOGL) will on Wednesday seek to overturn the first of three hefty European Union antitrust fines at Europe's second-highest court in a landmark case that could determine how EU enforcers take on U.S. tech giants for abuse of market power.
The company will lay out its arguments against a 2.4-billion-euro ($2.6 billion) fine handed out by the European Commission during a three-day hearing at the General Court.
EU regulators said this penalty was for Google's favoring its own price comparison shopping service to the disadvantage of smaller European rivals. 
The EU has fined Google a total of 8.25 billion euros in three separate cases, including one involving its Android smartphone operating system. This is four times more than its rival Microsoft's (O:MSFT) EU fines of 2.2 billion euros. Both companies' regulatory troubles in Europe have lasted a decade.
Google is expected to launch a three-pronged attack against the Commission's 2017 decision which also included an order to treat competitors equally.
""It is wrong on the law, the facts, and the economics. Shopping ads have always helped people find the products they are looking for quickly and easily, and helped merchants to reach potential customers,"" Google said in a statement.
The key issue is whether self preferencing is anti-competitive and whether Amazon (O:AMZN) and eBay (O:EBAY) should be counted as Google's rivals.
For rivals, the case centers on Google's role as a central online gatekeeper.
""Google's search service acts as a de-facto kingmaker. If you are not found, the rest cannot follow. No company should be allows to abuse such position to promote its own services at the detriment of competitors and consumers alike,"" said lawyer Thomas Hoppner who advises clients who are critical of Google.
""The judgement will have repercussions for a large variety of industries that depend on fair ranking of their services on Google Search,"" he said.
The court ruling is likely to come next year. 
In the meantime, Margrethe Vestager in her new beefed-up role as Europe's digital chief will not be idle. She is set to announce several proposals in the coming months to rein in dominant U.S. online groups amid push back by the United States and the companies.

243,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2020 09:08PM ET</span>",FAA agrees it must boost safety oversight for Southwest Airlines,"By David Shepardson and Tracy Rucinski
(Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration says it should have done a better job of ensuring Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) had certified completion of maintenance on 88 used Boeing 737 jets, as noted in a report by the U.S. Transportation Department's Inspector General released on Tuesday.
Budget-friendly Southwest bought the planes in question between 2013 and 2017 from 16 foreign carriers.
The final report, first seen by Reuters, said Southwest operated more than 150,000 flights carrying 17.2 million passengers on the jets without confirmation that required maintenance had been completed.
The report said the FAA has not ""effectively overseen Southwest Airlines' systems for managing risks"" and made 11 recommendations to improve oversight, including retraining inspectors and developing better control over maintenance records and inspector guidance on evaluating air carrier safety culture.
While the U.S. commercial airline industry is considered safe, with only one fatality in recent years, the FAA is under heightened scrutiny by lawmakers over its relationship with the industry after two crashes overseas on the newer  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 737 MAX killed 346 people and led to that aircraft's global grounding.
""Given the significant unresolved safety concerns that FAA has identified at Southwest Airlines, it is clear that the agency is not yet effectively navigating the balance between industry collaboration and managing safety risks at the carrier,"" the report said.
The FAA said in a response included with the report it concurred with all 11 recommendations and the inspector general's conclusion that its office overseeing Southwest did not perform in accordance with existing guidance by allowing the 88 planes to enter service and that it ""lacked a comprehensive conformity inspection for used aircraft.""
Southwest told Reuters on Tuesday that eight of the 88 jets remain out of service until needed repairs are completed and that it disagreed with the report's findings.
The report chided the FAA, saying the agency ""accepted the air carrier’s justification that the issues identified were low safety risks.""
The FAA noted it changed the leadership of its office that oversees Southwest and ""continues to address deficiencies in the work functions and culture."" The agency has agreed to ensure Southwest ""complies with regulatory requirements that the 88 previously owned aircraft conform to U.S. aviation standards.""
Last month, the Wall Street Journal published an article on a draft of the inspector general report.
The report also said the FAA violated its own guidance in addressing noncompliance by Southwest on baggage weight and balance data. The FAA agreed to ensure Southwest complies with requirements.
On Jan. 10, the FAA said it was seeking to impose a $3.92 million fine on Southwest for alleged weight infractions on 21,505 flights on 44 aircraft between May 1, 2018 and Aug. 9, 2018.

245,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2020 06:45PM ET</span>","Lyft forecasts slower growth in 2020, leaves target profit date unchanged","By Tina Bellon and Akanksha Rana
(Reuters) -  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT) on Tuesday forecast slower revenue growth in the new year and the company refused to match larger rival Uber, which recently moved up a key profit target by a year, sticking to its later date of projected profitability.
Investors were left disappointed, sending shares down 5.5% after hours.
While Lyft reported record quarterly revenue of more than $1 billion, it failed to change its target to achieve profitability on an adjusted basis by the end of 2021. This was in contrast to its larger rival  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER), which last week moved its own profitability target, previously the same as Lyft's, to the fourth quarter of 2020.
Analysts during an investor call repeatedly pressed the company on prospects for profitability, leading Lyft executives to defend their target and insist the company was on the right track.
""We remain truly confident we can achieve our Q4 '21 target,"" Chief Financial Officer Brian Roberts said.
Lyft reported revenue of $1.02 billion in the fourth quarter, ahead of analysts who expected $984 million in quarterly revenue, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
For now, the company continues to make losses, reporting a fourth-quarter net loss of $356 million, or a loss of $1.19 per share, narrower than analyst estimates for a $1.38 loss per share.
Lyft operates only in the United States and some Canadian cities. Its active rider customer base in the fourth quarter grew to 22.9 million from 22.3 million the previous quarter. That compares with Uber's global 111 million active platform users in the same period.
While Lyft's ridership grew by more than 6% in the first half of 2019, growth in the second half slowed to around 2.5%.
The company said it expects an adjusted EBITDA loss of between $450 million and $490 million for all of 2020.
""Lyft’s problem is that its smaller scale means that profitability is harder to achieve than it is for Uber,"" said Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell.
'DURABLE GROWTH'
The adjusted EBITDA profitability metric at both companies excludes expenses for stock-based compensation and other items. Share-based payments at Uber in all of 2019 amounted to nearly $4.6 billion, or roughly a third of revenue.
Lyft's stock-based compensation came in at $1.6 billion for all of 2019, or 44% of full-year revenue.
Both companies went public last year, Lyft in March, Uber in May, with many early employees and investors selling their shares.
CFO Roberts in an interview with Reuters on Tuesday said 2020 created the foundation for ""more durable growth"" in 2021 and beyond.
Uber and Lyft, both based in San Francisco, are pursuing different roads in search of profitability, with Uber pouring money into side businesses which have so far lost money and Lyft remaining focused solely on moving people around. 
Lyft in January cut 2% of its workforce in its sales and marketing department to achieve its profitability target, but said it plans to hire more people this year.
The company is still spending heavily, with total costs in 2019 growing to $6.3 billion. Lyft executives said on Tuesday the company was committed to its ""low-cost culture"" with employees, including executives and board members, flying in coach class.
Uber and Lyft have historically relied on heavy subsidies to attract riders.
Lyft in October said a growing number of customers were paying full price, with discounts and promotional incentives decreasing.
Roberts on Tuesday said Lyft aimed for further cuts to marketing spending as a percentage of revenue in 2020.
""We want to win on innovation, customer experience and brand reputation, not on coupons or discounts,"" he said.
But Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi told investors during an earnings call on Thursday that Lyft over the past month or so had been more aggressive in giving out discounts to attract customers.
Lyft also said a restructuring of its insurance policies would improve contribution margins, but did not elaborate. Cost of revenue, which includes insurance expenses, accounted for roughly 37% of Lyft's 2019 costs.

246,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2020 06:18PM ET</span>","FTC demands data on small buys by Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft","By Diane Bartz and Nandita Bose
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Concerned that big tech companies are unfairly engaging in potential anti-competitive behavior, the Federal Trade Commission said on Tuesday it ordered Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google unit, Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), Apple Inc (O:AAPL),  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) to provide information on mergers that were too small to report to antitrust regulators.
The queries come as the Justice Department, the FTC, state attorneys general and the House Judiciary Committee are investigating the big tech platforms, which are accused of unfairly using their clout to defend market share or expand into adjacent markets.
Much of the criticism has focused on massive deals such as Facebook's acquisition of Instagram and Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods, but the companies also have spent billions on smaller companies, dramatically changing the competitive landscape in emerging tech sectors. 
FTC Chairman Joseph Simons said notices being issued to Big Tech companies were intended for research but could lead to enforcement action.
""If during the study we see that there are transactions that are problematic ... we could go back and initiate enforcement action to deal with those transactions,"" said Simons.
The notices were not meant to be a warning to the companies but were designed to identify areas that need more antitrust enforcement, he added. 
The FTC will study ""hundreds"" of acquisitions made by the companies and aims to finish its study ""quickly,"" agency officials said.
""It depends what they do with it,"" said Matt Stoller, research director at the American Economic Liberties Project and a vocal critic of big tech companies. ""I'm not going to say this is good until they do something that impacts power.""
Google, Amazon.com, Apple and Facebook did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
""We look forward to working with the FTC to answer their questions,"" a Microsoft spokesman said.
The agency asked for information about deals that were done between Jan. 1, 2010 and Dec. 31, 2019, and require each company to identify transactions that were too small to report to the FTC and Justice Department, which assess mergers for compliance with antitrust law.
The tech giants have come under fire from both sides of the political spectrum, with Republicans irked by what they say is a stifling of conservative voices on social media and Democrats angered by increasing consolidation.
Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is running for president, has explicitly urged federal regulators to undo ""anti-competitive mergers,"" including Amazon's purchases of Whole Foods and Zappos, Facebook's purchase of WhatsApp and Instagram, and Google's acquisitions of Waze, Nest and DoubleClick.
Paul Holland, a general partner at Foundation Capital, said big tech players' frequent purchases of start-ups have been a double-edged sword.
""They've created a true marketplace for startups. They've created a destination for them,"" he said. But Holland added that the limited number of potential acquirers has also created an ""oligopolistic competitive environment"" for those sales.
Facebook acquired dozens of companies between 2010 and 2019, according to S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Market Intelligence data, including eye-catching purchases like WhatsApp and Instagram as well as smaller transactions in ad tech, facial recognition and social analytics.
Alphabet spent $1 billion on an unspecified number of small acquisitions in 2019, according to securities filings. Many were companies working on artificial intelligence research and cloud computing services, areas in which Google is trying to innovate quickly and has sought to bolster hiring.
With the exception of its $3 billion purchase of headphone and streaming company Beats in 2014, Apple has mostly made small deals valued at less than $500 million over the past decade, snapping up small companies working on key technologies such as augmented reality displays, camera sensors and artificial intelligence software.
In fiscal 2019, Microsoft made 19 small acquisitions for $1.6 billion, mostly in cash.

Microsoft has sought to consolidate its position in the business software market, with major acquisitions such as the LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) social network for business professionals and the code repository site GitHub. Since buying LinkedIn, which also fielded offers from Salesforce Inc (N:CRM), Microsoft has begun integrating its social network data with Microsoft products such as Outlook email.

1. Cisco, CVS Health Weigh In
Networking giant Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) reports quarterly results after the bell Wednesday.
Cisco is expected to report a profit of 76 cents per share on revenue of about $12 billion, according to analysts’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
In early January, Bank of American Merrill Lynch moved its rating on the stock to neutral from buy, nudging down its price target to $52 per share from $56.
Merrill said it saw a lack of catalysts for shares in 2020.
The stock is down more than 4% in the last six months.
Before the bell, CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) will report numbers.
The company is expected to earn $1.68 per share on revenue of about $64 billion.
Like other stocks tied to healthcare, CVS will also be tethered somewhat to developments in the Democratic primaries, especially with the respect to Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is running on a platform of single-payer health care.
2. Oil Inventories Seen Rising Again
OPEC decisions and indecisions have been calling the tune for oil prices so far this week. But tomorrow will bring some fundamental trading on the weekly oil inventories numbers.
The Energy Information Administration will report the latest weekly figures at 10:30 AM (15:30 GMT).
Analysts, on average, are expecting the EIA to report a rise in inventories of about 3 million barrels, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Late today, the American Petroleum Institute said that according to its measure crude stockpiles rose by 6 million barrels for the week ended Feb. 7.
3. Powell Back for Day Two
The economic calendar is pretty bare tomorrow, but Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will be back on Capitol Hill for the second half of his semiannual Congressional testimony.
Powell will start speaking to the Senate Banking Committee at 10:00 AM ET (15:00 GMT).
Prepared remarks will be the same, so attentional will be on the question-and-answer session with lawmakers.
Investors will also be looking at results from the New Hampshire Democratic Primary."
248,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2020 06:16PM ET</span>",Factbox: China takes major steps to prop up coronavirus-hit economy,"(Reuters) - Chinese policymakers have implemented a raft of measures to support an economy jolted by a coronavirus outbreak that is expected to have a devastating impact on first-quarter growth.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) is attempting to restore investor confidence and as global markets shudder at the potentially damaging impact of the virus on world growth.
Below are some fiscal and monetary policies put in place by the government and the central bank since the outbreak:
** On Feb. 3 and Feb. 4, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) pumped in 1.7 trillion yuan ($242.74 billion) through open market operations.
** China's central bank unexpectedly cuts some key short-term money market interest rates, and analysts predict more are likely. A central bank adviser says the possibility of a cut in the country's benchmark loan prime rate (LPR) on Feb. 20 has significantly increased.
** The central bank said on Feb. 6 that it will use tools such as targeted reserve requirement cuts, re-lending and rediscount, to support key sectors.
The cost of special re-lending, at 300 billion yuan, from the PBOC to commercial banks is relatively low, it said.
The PBOC has told banks to cap rates on loans for selected firms at 3.15%, 1 percentage point lower than the latest LPR.
** China's finance ministry said on Feb. 9 that all levels of government had allocated a total of 71.85 billion yuan ($10.26 billion) as of Saturday afternoon to fight the virus.
** China's finance ministry said on Feb. 1 materials directly used for epidemic control will be exempt from import tariffs from Jan. 1 to March 31.
Imports of donations including ambulances and disinfectant products will also be exempt from tariffs, value-added tax and consumption tax, the finance ministry said.
** China's bond market regulator said on Feb. 5 it will actively support debt financing and debt issuance by companies heavily affected by a fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak.
The National Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors (NAFMII) also said it would support companies that have participated in containing the spread of the virus.
The association also said it would allow virus-hit firms to issue bonds and raise funds via other instruments including asset-backed notes."
249,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2020 06:06PM ET</span>",Japan's efforts to raise wages wane as firms embrace merit-based pay,"By Tetsushi Kajimoto and Izumi Nakagawa
TOKYO (Reuters) - More Japanese companies are shifting to merit-based pay as competition for workers heats up, but the change risks holding back the sort of blanket wage hikes the prime minister says are needed to inflate the economy.
Ahead of annual labor talks set for March 11, the momentum to agree broad wage rises is waning as the focus shifts to merit-based pay scales. Bellwether auto giant Toyota Motor Corp's (T:7203) labor union is no longer seeking blanket pay rises, likely prompting others to follow suit.
It could give Japanese firms the excuse not to boost overall labor benefits, with many wary of fixed costs as profits are seen squeezed by Sino-U.S. trade tensions, the new coronavirus outbreak and global slowdown.
For workers, the shift would boost salaries of younger workers and potentially widen the country's wage gap.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government has been pushing for a more flexible labor market that would boost wages and revive consumption, but ironically, firms have also been asked to keep offering blanket pay rises.
""The momentum towards base pay hikes is waning, while the October sales tax hike has added a burden on households. Declines in company profits are also casting a chill over the wage-hike mood,"" said Masaki Kuwahara, senior economist at Nomura Securities.
Sluggish wage recovery bodes ill for private consumption and the central bank's aim of hitting its elusive 2% inflation goal.
""Japanese firms no longer see the point of doing what everyone else does to raise wages in unison,"" said Hisashi Yamada, senior economist at Japan Research Institute. ""As Abe's campaign on wage hikes runs its course, wages will struggle to rise ahead.""
Some 57.8% of Japanese firms have adopted merit-based pay as of 2018, up from 17.7% seen in 1999, data from Japan Productivity Center, a non-governmental organization, show.
MERIT-BASED PAY
Electronics maker Fujitsu Ltd (T:6702) is one of the leading companies that have adopted merit-based pay. It is offering annual salary of up to around 30 million yen ($273,000) for skilled workers such as high-tech engineers while keeping average annual per capita pay at around 8 million yen for its 32,000 employees.
""I understand the government's intention of trying to boost wages to stimulate the economy. But wages and labor costs are something that individual firm should decide based on results,"" said Manabu Morikawa, senior director at Fujitsu's employee relations division.
""As we compete globally, we should take global labor market and pay standards into account so that wages are set in the way that should compare favorably with our rivals,"" Morikawa said.
Toyota's labor union is demanding an average pay rise of 10,100 yen per month this year, down from last year's call for 12,000 yen, or 600 yen less than the agreed increase in 2019.
The union has agreed to Toyota's shift towards merit-based pay, which will make distribution of corporate income vary from employee to employee depending on their performance, so as to lure talent, said Takayuki Furukawa, spokesman for the union.
""Merit-based pay will create a pay gap between able workers and those who are not, but we share the need to help the company overcome rapid change surrounding the car industry,"" Furukawa said.
""We used to focus on base pay and job security. But now the competition is so tough that we need to support our company to secure workers amid labor shortages,"" he said.
Japan has lagged industrialized economies in adopting merit pay systems and blanket pay rises based on years of service have come to symbolize the country's inability to compete in the global marketplace.
BARGAINING POWER
Last year, big firms raised wages by some 2% for a sixth straight year as Abe kept up the pressure on businesses to boost pay to beat deflation that has dogged Japan for two decades.
Some analysts believe efforts to boost wages though may be limited as Japan's work structure diversifies.
About 40% of workers are lower-paid part-time staff and contract workers - double the proportion seen in 1990, just before the asset bubble burst. Seven of 10 workers are also employed by small businesses, often with much lower salaries than those at big firms.
The growing rank of low-paid workers has led unionists to prioritize addressing the income gap between permanent employees and low-paid workers, instead of a broad uniform pay raise.
For decades since the mid-1950s, spring labor negotiations dubbed ""shunto"" have served as a platform for wage talks in Japan. But with less than one in five Japanese employees being union members, the bargaining power of unions has been on a steady decline, making annual talks more symbolic, analysts say.
""Wage gaps among businesses and within the same company are getting wider and wider, making effects of wage talks unclear,"" Shintaro Nakao, president of Pasona Inc, a human resources service company, told Reuters.
""As merit-based pay replaces seniority-based pay, wages for those in their 20s and 30s may increase more than the middle-aged and elderly workers, causing the wage curve to flatten."""

(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) Chief Executive Charles Scharf on Tuesday announced his first major reshuffle since taking over in October, naming several executives to new roles while also tapping a JPMorgan veteran to head consumer lending.
The shakeup is aimed at putting a new structure in place as the bank looks to rebuild its reputation and increase accountability, Wells Fargo said in a statement. 
The new structure, which increases the bank's business lines to five from three, closely resembles that of JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), where Scharf was mentored by CEO Jamie Dimon earlier in his career. 
Scharf has already brought on several former colleagues from the No. 1 U.S. bank. The latest addition, Mike Weinbach, will join the firm after 16 years at JPMorgan to lead the San Francisco-based lender's new consumer lending division in May.
Wells Fargo also hired a third executive from Santander (MC:SAN) Holdings USA, Andrew Heller, to serve as strategy and operations planning leader. 
The consumer bank will be split into a consumer lending division and a retail banking division, and the wholesale bank will be divided into a commercial banking unit, and a corporate and investment banking unit. The wealth management division was left unchanged.
As part of the management overhaul, the bank is seeking to fill a number of new executive positions. It is searching, among other openings, for a segment leader for its small business unit, a consumer banking marketing head and an executive to run its digital strategies for the consumer and small business unit, according to internal memos seen by Reuters.
The bank is also seeking a lead business control executive to supervise control executives across its business lines, the memos said.
Additionally, Wells Fargo has disbanded its Payments, Virtual Solutions and Innovation Group and formed a new group called Strategy, Digital Platform & Innovation focused on digital strategies and customer experience. 

New Chief Operating Officer Scott Powell, a former JPMorgan and Santander executive, will run the unit until a permanent replacement is found.

256,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2020 04:16PM ET</span>","U.S. says Michael Avenatti shook down Nike, defense disagrees as extortion trial nears end","By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Michael Avenatti's extortion trial neared its end on Tuesday as a federal prosecutor said the celebrity lawyer had an ""agenda"" to shake down  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) by threatening to tar it with corruption allegations, while the defense said Avenatti was simply representing his client aggressively.
Prosecutors have charged Avenatti with threatening to hold a press conference to discuss Nike's alleged payments to families of college basketball recruits, unless the apparel company paid him and another lawyer $15 million to $25 million for an internal probe and his whistleblowing client $1.5 million.
Avenatti was also accused of defrauding his client Gary Franklin, the coach of California Supreme, once part of a Nike-sponsored basketball league.
He testified he did not seek a probe, preferring a quieter settlement in which Nike would fire executives behind the payments.
Avenatti, 48, became famous representing the adult film actress Stormy Daniels in lawsuits against Donald Trump and becoming a self-described ""nemesis"" of the U.S. president, including through hundreds of television appearances.
In his closing argument in Manhattan federal court, Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Podolsky said Avenatti was trying to escape ""a mountain of debt"" when he tried to extort Nike last March.
He also said a probe would have made no sense for Franklin, who wanted to restore his relationship with the company.
Podolsky replayed a recording of Avenatti telling a Nike lawyer a settlement of a few million dollars would not ""move the needle"" for him.
""The defendant had his own agenda, an agenda he never bothered to mention to his client,"" Podolsky said. ""That's what this case is about, a betrayal of trust and a shakedown.""
Lawyers for Avenatti countered that Franklin had ""authorized"" him to demand a probe.
One of the lawyers, Scott Srebnick, said emails and text messages between Franklin and his adviser Jeffrey Auerbach show they were uninterested in ""diplomacy,"" and hired the brash, aggressive, tenacious, ""bullish"" and hard-charging Avenatti to root out Nike's alleged corruption.
Srebnick's brother Howard Srebnick told jurors that Avenatti ""went in there, in the words of Nike itself, to 'just do it' for his client.""
Franklin and Auerbach testified for the prosecution. Jury deliberations in the two-week trial could begin on Wednesday.
Avenatti also faces scheduled trials this spring in Manhattan for allegedly defrauding Daniels out of proceeds from a book contract, and in California for allegedly defrauding several other clients.
He chose not to testify in the Nike case, after U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe said prosecutors could question him about his behavior toward Daniels and other clients, without mentioning the criminal charges."

Investing.com – The S&P and Nasdaq eked out record closes despite giving up some gains on Tuesday as a regulatory probe into previous deals by large-cap tech companies soured investor sentiment on stocks.
The S&P 500 rose 0.17%, Nasdaq Composite added 0.11% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat.
The Federal Trade Commission issued special orders to five tech giants - including Alphabet's Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) – requesting information on historical mergers to gauge reporting practices to antitrust authorities.
The request was for research purposes, but FTC Chairman Joseph Simons reportedly said ""hundreds"" of deals under scrutiny could lead to some ""unwinding"" of mergers.
The move raised fears over a more aggressive regulatory crackdown on big tech at a time when U.S. authorities are already investigating Google, Facebook, Amazon and others over potential anti-competitive behavior. 
Also adding pressure on tech, Facebook fell 2.8% after Pivotal Research downgraded the stock to sell from hold and lowered its target price to $180 from $215.
In telecoms, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) surged after winning approval to go ahead with their merger. U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero concluded the deal was unlikely to lessen competition.
As sentiment on tech stocks turned sour, the broader market gave up some gains, following Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's testimony early Tuesday.
Powell expressed confidence in central bank's current monetary policy measures and reiterated that the economy remained in a good place in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.
""We’ll be watching this (coronavirus impact) carefully,"" Powell told lawmakers on the House Financial Services Committee. ""'What will be the effects on the U.S. economy?' 'Will they be persistent?' 'Will they be material?' That’s really the question.""
But with the death roll in China rising above 1,000 and those infected topping 40,000, corporate earnings are reflecting the threat of the virus to the bottom line.
  Under Armour   (NYSE:UAA) slumped 19% after reporting mixed earnings and warning that sales would come under pressure from the coronavirus.
Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS), meanwhile, fell nearly 1% after the toymaker reported earnings that topped Wall Street estimates.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) gave up gains early-day gains to end flat, after the aircraft maker said that it booked no new jetliner orders in January, as it continues efforts to restore its reputation following the 737 MAX crisis.
Energy, meanwhile, rebounded from recent weakness amid an upswing in oil prices on rising hopes that Russia would support OPEC+ proposals for deeper production cuts to offset the impact of the coronavirus on Chinese oil demand."

Investing.com - Boston Beer surged on Tuesday, after   Credit Suisse   (SIX:CSGN) upgraded its outlook on the beverage company, forecasting its seltzer brand to rack up strong gains this year.
Credit Suisse upgraded shares of Boston Beer to outperform from neutral and lifted its price target on the stock to $525 from $400, representing more than 40% from current prices.
Boston Beer (NYSE:SAM) surged 6%.
The decline in beer consumption in the U.S., prompted Boston Beer to turn to launch an alcoholic seltzer brand Truly in 2016. The Truly brand has gone from strength to strength in a market that has seen sales more jump sharply over the past year.
With an increasing number of beer, wine and vodka drinkers making the switch to seltzer, Credit Suisse forecasts the business to double this year and grow to 8% to10% of the beer industry volume by 2023 from about 2.6% today.
Boston Beer's Truly will ride the wave of growth to become and is estimated to become 60% of Boston Beer's portfolio, totaling more than 50% of overall earnings, according to the bank.

The biggest auto dealer in the U.S reported record fourth quarter and 2019 earnings thanks in part to profits from used cars, which jumped 21% in the last three months of the year on a same-store basis.
Automakers had another year of more than 17 million new-vehicle sales in 2019, though they propped up deliveries by spending on incentives and relying on rental-car companies. Consumers are likely to buy fewer new cars and trucks in 2020, but the used market will keep total volume for dealers roughly flat, said Cheryl Miller, AutoNation’s chief executive officer.
“That’s because of affordability,” Miller said in a phone interview. “Given that increase again in new-vehicle pricing, we’re going to see some preference for used vehicles for consumers.”
AutoNation earned $1.74 a share from continuing operations in the fourth quarter, up from $1.02 in the year ago period. The Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based retailer’s shares surged as much as 11% on Tuesday, their biggest intraday jump since July."

GUANGZHOU, China/GENEVA (Reuters) - The coronavirus outbreak in China may be over by April, the country's senior medical adviser said on Tuesday, but deaths surpassed 1,000 and the World Health Organization (WHO) warned of a global threat potentially worse than terrorism.
The world must ""wake up and consider this enemy virus as public enemy number one,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters, adding the first vaccine was 18 months away. 
As the epidemic squeezed the world's second-biggest economy, Chinese firms struggled to get back to work after the extended Lunar New Year holiday, hundreds of them saying they would need loans running into billions of dollars to stay afloat.
Company layoffs were beginning despite assurances by President Xi Jinping that widespread sackings would be avoided, as supply chains for global firms from car manufacturers to smartphone makers ruptured.
China's foremost medical adviser on the outbreak, Zhong Nanshan, said numbers of new cases were falling in some provinces and forecast the epidemic would peak this month.
""I hope this outbreak or this event may be over in something like April,"" Zhong, 83, an epidemiologist who played a role in combating an outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in 2003, told Reuters. 
The WHO said on Tuesday 1,017 people had died in China, where there were 42,708 cases.
Only 319 cases have been confirmed in 24 other countries and territories outside mainland China, with two deaths: one in Hong Kong and the other in the Philippines.
World stocks, which had seen rounds of selloffs because of the coronarivus' impact on China's economy and ripple effects round the world, surged to new record highs on Zhong's comments.
Statistics from China indicate about 2% of people infected with the new virus have died, and many had pre-existing medical conditions or were elderly. But the spread of the virus, which causes fever, cough and breathing difficulties, has already caused widespread disruption.
St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said China's economy was expected to ""slow noticeably"" in the first quarter and anyone pricing assets should for now consider the ""tail risk"" that the outbreak could get worse.
But Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said the financial spillover from the outbreak looked containable, though it was still early to judge the economic impact. 
CHINA STILL IN ""EMERGENCY"" - WHO
Tedros was less sanguine about the coronavirus, now officially named COVID-19.
""To be honest a virus is more powerful in creating political, social and economic upheaval than any terrorist attack,"" he said. ""It's the worst enemy you can imagine""
The impact of travel curbs, lockdowns and production suspensions is being felt increasingly on China's economy.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts downgraded forecasts for Chinese growth this quarter and Norwegian energy consultancy Rystad Energy predicted the outbreak would cut growth in global oil demand by a quarter this year.

Cisco Systems Inc (O:CSCO),  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), AT&T (N:T) and Sprint Corp (N:S) became the latest U.S. technology companies to pull out of an international telecoms conference in Barcelona because of the outbreak. The organizer of the event, the telecom industry's biggest annual gathering, will discuss whether to cancel it, an industry source said.[nL4N2AB3F1 
Inside China, more than 300 companies are seeking bank loans totaling 57.4 billion yuan ($8.2 billion) to help cope with the disruption, banking sources said.
Prospective borrowers include food delivery giant  Meituan Dianping  (HK:3690), smartphone maker  Xiaomi  Corp (HK:1810) and ride-hailing provider Didi Chuxing Technology Co.
WORKERS AFFECTED
Chinese firm Xinchao Media said on Monday it had laid off 500 people, or just over a tenth of its workforce, and restaurant chain Xibei said it was worried about how to pay its roughly 20,000 workers.
Authorities said they would roll out measures to stabilize jobs. 
The World Bank ruled out any new health loans to China, though technical assistance would be offered. 
Hubei, where the flu-like virus emerged from a wildlife market in the provincial capital of Wuhan, remains in virtual lockdown, its stations and airports shut and roads blocked. But its health authority reported 2,097 new cases and 103 new deaths on Feb. 10.
With public anger rising, Hubei's government dismissed the provincial health commission's Communist Party boss, Zhang Jin, and director Liu Yingzi, state media said.
Washington, whose travel measures have offended Beijing, authorized the voluntary departure of U.S. government employees and family members from Chinese-ruled Hong Kong ""out of an abundance of caution,"" the State Department said.
Dr Anne Schuchat, an official from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said she hoped the first group of Americans evacuated from Wuhan could be released from their quarantine on Tuesday.
Off Japan's port of Yokohama, the Diamond Princess cruise ship with 3,700 passengers and crew remained quarantined, with the number of confirmed cases at 135.
Thailand said it had barred passengers from getting off another ship, Holland America Line's MS Westerdam, though no confirmed infections have been found on board.

262,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2020 02:15PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Germany's Volkswagen and Daimler push for more 'sustainable' Chile lithium,"By Dave Sherwood 
SANTIAGO (Reuters) - German automakers Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) have launched a study to push for more ""sustainable"" lithium mining in Chile, according to lobbyist filings reviewed by Reuters, a sign of growing supply chain concerns ahead of an expected electric vehicle boom. 
Chile's Atacama salt flat is by far the biggest source of supply of the ultralight battery metal in South America's so-called ""lithium triangle."" The region, whose fragile ecosystem relies on a limited water supply, is home to the globe's top two producers, U.S.-based  Albemarle  Corp (N:ALB) and Chile's SQM (SN:SQMA). 
But concerns over sustainability have long plagued Atacama’s miners, which extract the metal from pools of brine beneath the world's driest desert. Residents and environmental groups worry about potential damage to a regional ecosystem home to an ancient indigenous culture, lagoons inhabited with rare flamingos and a booming tourism industry.
Lobbying records show a team from German development agency GIZ and the public-private Fundacion Chile met with Cristóbal De La Maza, chief of top Chilean environmental regulator SMA, early this year to formally present plans for the ""feasibility study.""
""This project is driven by the Volkswagen and Daimler companies,"" the filings read. ""The growing importance of batteries has made the sustainability of lithium a key priority for these companies.""
Volkswagen confirmed to Reuters in an email that it had contracted the study. Daimler declined to comment.
Pressure is mounting on German carmakers to fast-track production of electric vehicles to meet increasingly stringent European Union anti-pollution rules. Volkswagen alone has staked its future on a $91 billion plan to profitably mass-producing zero-emission vehicles.
That push has prompted beefed-up scrutiny of mining practices around key metals such as cobalt, copper and lithium, all of which are predicted to see a spike in demand in coming years.
Reuters reported exclusively on Monday that Volkswagen had visited Atacama in January, amid a broader push to encourage sustainable production of key links in the EV supply chain. 
The filings suggest work has already begun on the ""feasibility study,"" commissioned by Volkswagen and Daimler, including talks with local communities, regulators and miners.
The goal of the meetings, according to the filings, is to develop a ""joint action plan"" and in time, ""implement prioritized actions"" to address the growing concerns about lithium mining in the region.
Concerns about sustainability have emerged as a key vulnerability for Chile as a lithium mining hot spot. 
A Chilean environmental court in December called the Atacama ecosystem particularly fragile. It warned of a ""high level of scientific uncertainty"" around the behavior of its water table.
The water usage issue has also become a sticking point for the plans of both SQM and Albemarle to boost output from Chile to meet the anticipated spike in demand. 

Australia, the world's No. 1 producer of the white metal, mines its lithium from hard rock, not brine.

Airbnb posted a net loss of $322 million for the first nine months through September 2019, compared to a $200 million profit for the same period a year earlier, the report added.
In September last year, the company said it planned to list its shares in 2020 and is widely expected to take a direct-listing route for its market debut.
Airbnb was most recently valued at $31 billion, according to data provider PitchBook. However, the company's most recent internal valuation was sharply lower than that, according to WSJ.
The company's debut is the most awaited listing of 2020, but the timing could be affected by the coronavirus epidemic, according to the report.
Airbnb said on Monday it had suspended bookings in Beijing until Feb. 29, as the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak in China exceeded 900.
China is an important growth market for Airbnb, and the company may wait until the disruption caused by the virus subsides, before it goes ahead with the listing, WSJ said.
Any listing this year would likely be in the third quarter or later, the report added.

LONDON (Reuters) - Competition authorities may be better equipped than securities regulators to ensure that exchanges charge fair prices for data on stock prices, Europe's top asset managers and banks said on Tuesday.
It marks a racheting up of pressure on European Union authorities to bring down the fees that asset managers and banks pay exchanges for data.
EFAMA, which represents asset managers from across Europe, and EFSA, a forum for securities associations such as the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME), said the market power of exchanges has increased significantly in recent years, especially since bourses were privatized.
""Despite some attempts to solve the problems, market data costs have continued to increase,"" EFAMA and EFSA said in a joint statement.
They called on the EU to properly enforce its own securities rules, which require data to be charged for on a reasonable commercial basis.
""We propose that the fee schedules provided by the trading venues are harmonized and simplified,"" the two bodies said.
The role of data vendors - who take data from exchanges and pass it on to users - should be given a higher level of regulatory attention, they said.
""Concurrently, it should be assessed whether competition authorities rather than financial supervisory authorities would be better suited for ensuring that market data is charged on a 'reasonable commercial basis',"" they added.
Asset managers and banks are forced to buy market data to show customers they are getting the best deals when they want to buy or sell stocks on an exchange.
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) said in December that EU securities rules have failed to cut the cost of stock market data and proposed a mix of legislative changes and further guidance to national regulators.
Exchanges have said they are not overcharging customers.
The EU is reviewing its markets rules, known as MiFID II."

Investing.com – Wall Street retreated from session highs as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell expressed confidence in the central bank's current monetary policy measures in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, while mixed earnings from corporates did little to help sentiment.
The S&P 500 rose 0.53%, Nasdaq Composite added 0.73% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.14%.
Against rising investor hopes the Fed will contain the impact from any weakness on global growth caused by the coronavirus, named Covid-19 by the World Health Organization today. Powell appeared in no rush to hint that the Fed is mulling rate cuts and insisted it was yet too early to determine the impact from the virus on growth.
""We’ll be watching this (coronavirus impact) carefully,"" Powell told lawmakers on the House Financial Services Committee. ""'What will be the effects on the U.S. economy?' 'Will they be persistent?' 'Will they be material?' That’s really the question,"" Powell said.
Despite the rising death roll in China and infections, market participants continue to bet that the virus' impact on the U.S. economy will be limited.
""While economic fallout on China from the virus will matter to the U.S. economy, at this point, we expect most of the drag on U.S. growth to be in the first quarter, with a smaller hit in the second and a rebound in the latter half,"" S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) said in a note.
Despite the optimism over efforts to contain the Covid-19, which has killed more than 1,000 and infected more than 40,000, corporate earnings are reflecting the threat of the virus to the bottom line.
  Under Armour   (NYSE:UAA) slumped nearly 20% after reporting mixed earnings and warning that sales would come under pressure from Covid-19.
Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS), meanwhile, pared gains to trade roughly flat after the toymaker reported earnings that topped Wall Street estimates.
In tech, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) struggled to turn positive after Pivotal Research downgraded the stock to sell from hold and lowered its target price to $180 from $215.
""We think the Street is being way too complacent regarding the impact of the Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Chrome changes made on Feb 4...with its Chrome 80 release,"" Pivotal said.
Elsewhere, Boeing (NYSE:BA) gave up gains early-day gains after the aircraft maker said that it booked no new jetliner orders in January, as it continues efforts to restore its reputations following the 737 Max crisis.
Energy, meanwhile, rebounded from recent weakness amid an upswing in oil prices on rising hopes that Russia would support OPEC+ proposals for deeper production cuts to offset the impact of the coronavirus on Chinese oil demand."

(Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc (O:CSCO), Sprint Corp (N:S) and  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) on Tuesday became the latest U.S. technology companies to pull out of the Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona due to the coronavirus outbreak.
A number of companies ranging from Japan's NTT Docomo (T:9437) and Sony Corp (T:6758) to U.S. chipmakers  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) and Nvidia (O:NVDA) have already dropped out of the four-day international telecoms conference that draws in more than 100,000 visitors.
""While we are extremely disappointed that we cannot continue with this event as planned, we believe this is the right decision given the current circumstances,"" a Cisco spokeswoman said.
The virus, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has spread across the world, prompting many companies to restrict travel to and from the country. 
It has so far killed more than 1,000 people and infected more than 40,000 people on the Chinese mainland, while spreading to at least 24 countries.
MWC, set to kick off on Feb. 24, is the telecom industry's biggest annual gathering, with companies spending millions on stands and hospitality to fill their order books.
GSMA, the organizer of the event, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The organizer said on Sunday participants from China's Hubei province, where the coronavirus outbreak began, would not be allowed to attend the event and that visitors from China must prove they have been outside the country for at least two weeks prior to the event.
""We are more prepared than ever,"" said Catalan regional health councillor, Alba Verges, to local channel TV3. She added that, from a public health point of view, there is no ""objective cause"" for the companies to be afraid of attending. 
The event is important to Barcelona, whose economy got a boost of around 470 million euros ($515 million) last year from the conference, according to GSMA.
Chinese companies, including Huawei, ZTE (SZ:000063), Oppo and  Xiaomi  (HK:1810), are still attending the event.

Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), LG Electronics (KS:066570), Ericsson (ST:ERICb) and McAfee have also withdrawn from exhibiting and participating in the conference.

274,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2020 12:45PM ET</span>",Merkel's conservatives stop short of Huawei 5G ban in Germany,"By Andreas Rinke
BERLIN (Reuters) - Lawmakers from German Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling conservatives have backed a position paper on 5G mobile networks that recommends tougher rules on foreign vendors while stopping short of banning China's Huawei [HWT.UL], sources said.
The document was drafted by Christian Democrat leaders to address the concerns of party rebels who see Huawei as a threat to national security. It is intended to lay the ground for Merkel's coalition government to adopt a common position on 5G after months of divisive debate.
The move rebuffs U.S. President Donald Trump's calls on Washington's allies to bar the Chinese telecoms giant from next-generation networks after Britain stopped short of an outright ban and the European Union backed a rules-based approach.
Several party sources said on Tuesday that Christian Democrat lawmakers had supported the four-page paper that, instead of imposing any individual bans, sets out the principles of a risk-management approach.
""State actors with sufficient resources can infiltrate the network of any equipment maker,"" it said. ""Even with comprehensive technical checks, security risks cannot be eliminated completely - they can at best be minimised.
""At the same time, we are not defenceless against attempts to eavesdrop on 5G networks. The use of strong cryptography and end-to-end encryption can secure confidentiality in communication and the exchange of data.""
Ironing out differences with a bloc of pro-American lawmakers led by Norbert Roettgen, head of parliament's foreign affairs committee, marks an important step towards building a broader consensus in Merkel's ruling alliance with the Social Democrats and across party lines.
It will also be important for Germany to present a coherent position at a security conference in Munich this weekend that will be attended by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi.
HUAWEI DEPENDENCY
It would be costly and potentially risky for Germany, Europe's largest economy, to exclude Huawei. Its three network operators are all customers of the Chinese vendor and Berlin is concerned that such a move might provoke trade retaliation by Beijing.
With that in mind, the paper makes a clear distinction between access, transport and core networks that are especially sensitive, thus allowing different handling of Huawei components in the various parts of the 5G network.
The paper suggests using products from several companies to avoid a ""monoculture"", and calls for the concept of trustworthiness to be anchored in proposed tweaks to Germany's telecoms and IT security laws.
""Equipment makers can only be trusted if they verifiably fulfil a clearly defined security catalogue that rules out any influence from a foreign state on our 5G infrastructure,"" the document says.
The draft would also give operators until 2025 to swap out equipment from existing 4G networks that was supplied by vendors who fail certification checks, a position that would mitigate the cost to operators of ripping and replacing it.
The position paper also calls for Germany to push for a wider European industrial policy to ensure that its own companies can build all elements of internationally competitive and secure 5G networks.
It pushed back against hostile foreign takeovers, in an apparent reference to U.S. Attorney General William Barr's recent call to invest in Swedish equipment maker Ericsson (ST:ERICb) or Finland's Nokia (HE:NOKIA) to gain a 5G foothold.

Ericsson CEO Borje Ekholm and Nokia's Rajeev Suri are due to meet Merkel on Thursday, according to officials from the German government and the companies.

275,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 11, 2020 12:44PM ET</span>",All-American Rally Crushes Wall Street Global Catch-Up Calls,"(Bloomberg) -- Six weeks into the new year, a slew of Wall Street calls for 2020 are misfiring as American assets once again prove to be a port in the global storm.
Both haven and risk-on strategies are surging in the world’s largest economy, hurting traders who came into this year betting on foreign markets over U.S. exceptionalism.
A decent earnings season for the tech giants, fears over the coronavirus spreading across Asia and strong economic data have all combined to trigger outperformance.
The S&P 500 is posting multiple records as the mega caps soar. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index is trading near the highest since November while emerging markets crater. Treasuries are in huge demand as a global safety play.
It’s all reinforcing the relentless “America First” bull market -- and making life harder for money managers going overweight on bets overseas.
“Goldilocks continues,” Torsten Slok, chief economist for  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn), wrote in a note. “The U.S. economic outlook has never been more stable than it is at the moment.”
Coming into this year, a collection of Wall Street outlooks envisaged scenarios buttressing overseas assets from Europe to emerging markets, driven by a synchronized uptick in global growth and attractive relative valuations.
But the land of equities underscores the relentless vigor of Made-in-America strategies. While the MSCI All-Country World Index is flirting with a record, this is in large part driven by U.S. equities trading at all-time highs.
The S&P 500 had gained 4.2% this year as of 12:26 p.m. New York time, but the all-country index without American stocks was down 0.3%. Even the Stoxx Europe 600 index, notching records of its own, has lagged the S&P 500 by more than 1 percentage point this year.
In credit, the year started with plenty of talk about the need for caution after 2019’s rally left U.S. corporate bonds looking expensive.
Yet the premium to hold high-yield dollar bonds around the globe versus U.S.-listed corporate peers is back near record highs, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Put another way, U.S. debt markets are in rude health versus offshore peers thanks to low defaults, benign technicals and decent debt-servicing capacity.
For much of this, thank the continued strength of the business cycle. U.S. economic data continues to surprise to the upside according to a  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). index, while a measure of global indicators has been disappointing, laid bare by feeble industrial production in the euro zone.
Combined with a furious dash for havens amid the ongoing spread of the coronavirus, it has all contributed to renewed dollar strength, with a Bloomberg gauge up 1.8% this year alone. That bucks projections coming into 2020 of a softer currency, with nearly every contributor to a Bloomberg survey projecting a weaker U.S. Dollar Index this year.
That’s a big deal. The greenback is in effect acting as a risk-on, risk-off driver -- weakening in the fourth quarter to fire up developing markets and strengthening in 2020 to hurt them, according to a multi-asset team at  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA).
“In other words, for the risk-on rally to return in the coming months, we would have to see sustained USD weakness,” the team led by Max Kettner wrote last week. “We struggle to see that. In particular EM equities, EM local debt and cyclical commodities like oil and industrial metals look most vulnerable to further USD strength.”
The MSCI Emerging Markets Index of stocks has fallen 1.4% in the year, with analysts slashing earnings forecasts at an even faster rate as economic headwinds grow.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) turned neutral on EM currencies from bullish this week, citing growth risks from the coronavirus and ongoing dollar strength.
Still it’s early days for the global catch-up trade in 2020, while U.S. valuations look ever-more demanding.
Members of the S&P 500 are near their priciest versus shares in the rest of the world since 2008, based on expected earnings for the next 12 months. That’s a state of affairs which historically has not lasted long."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) driver killed in a March 2018 crash in California while using the Autopilot driver-assistance system had reported that on prior trips, the car had steered away from the highway, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) disclosed in documents made public Tuesday.
Walter Huang, a 38-year-old Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) software engineer, was driving his Tesla Model X in Mountain View in autopilot mode at about 70 mph when it crashed into a safety barrier. The NTSB said Huang had reported issues on prior trips with Autopilot steering the wheel toward an area between a highway ramp and the lane. It is a moving violation to cross into that section of the road, known as the ""gore area.""
Data from the vehicle showed that in prior trips Huang had taken corrective action after Autopilot had steered toward the area. The NTSB said in the fatal crash Huang's hands were not detected on the steering wheel in the final six seconds before the crash. There was no evidence of braking or evasive action.
The NTSB, which also found evidence that the driver was using a smartphone during the trip, plans a Feb. 25 hearing to determine the probable cause of the crash. Tesla did not immediately comment.
Tesla drivers say they are able to avoid holding the steering wheel for extended periods while using Autopilot, but the company advises drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and pay attention while using the system.
During the final 18-minute Autopilot segment of the trip, the system did not detect his hands on the wheel about one-third of the time and the system issued two visual alerts for hands-off driving operation and one auditory alert.
The NTSB said Huang had been using an Apple-owned iPhone during his trip and records show evidence of data transmissions.
Logs recovered with Apple's assistance show a word building game application ""Three Kingdoms"" was active during Huang's fatal trip.
The NTSB said ""most players have both hands on the phone to support the device and manipulate game actions"" but added the log data ""does not provide enough information to ascertain whether the Tesla driver was holding the phone or how interactive he was with the game at the time of the crash.""
The NTSB, which previously criticized Tesla’s driver assistance system Autopilot after a 2016 fatal crash in Florida, said in September the system’s design permitted a ""driver to disengage from the driving task” in an earlier California crash.
The NTSB also released documents in its probe into a third Tesla Autopilot fatal crash in March 2019 in Delray Beach, Florida that showed no evidence the driver's hands were the steering wheel in the final 8 seconds. The Tesla Model 3 driver failed to react before striking a semi truck, the NTSB said."

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Aerolineas Argentinas will add new flights to New York and Madrid as the government-controlled carrier seeks to ramp up sales outside its home country and boost income in an effort to beat back persistent operating losses.
In an exclusive interview with Reuters, the chairman of Argentina's namesake airline said he expects income to hit $1.7 billion in 2020, in line with the previous year, thanks to the sale of nearly 13 million tickets.
""If we can carry out our growth plan, the company's deficit will gradually be reduced,"" said Pablo Ceriani, who took over as chairman of the company's board in December under incoming Argentine president Alberto Fernandez.
Aerolineas [AERA.UL] has an operating deficit of $570 million.
The airline, which currently flies four times a week to New York, will add an additional flight there in May, and another in July. It will also boost flights to Madrid from seven to 10 in July. Increasing tourism within Argentina is also part of the company's growth strategy, along with strengthening its operations throughout the region, Ceriani said.
Improving its fleet is another objective, he added.
The company hopes that toward the middle of the year it will get its five Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX airplanes back online, Ceriani said. 
The U.S. planemaker's once best-selling jet, the 737 MAX, was grounded in March following two fatal crashes that killed 346 people.
""Boeing has already agreed to compensation with other airlines. We are asking for equal treatment,"" said Ceriani. ""There is a good predisposition to find a way out of this situation that is satisfactory to us.""
The Argentine company ordered another 12 737 MAX aircraft, which will be delivered in 2021 and 2022.
""The compensation (from Boeing) can take different forms. It can be a direct payment or come by way of some other benefit, such as future deliveries,"" Ceriani said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Key U.S. and European stock indexes surged to fresh records on Tuesday after China's senior medical adviser suggested the deadly coronavirus may be over in April, a rosy outlook that helped crude prices to rebound on renewed Chinese demand.
China's foremost medical adviser on the outbreak told Reuters the number of new cases were falling in parts and forecast the epidemic would peak this month, but the World Health Organization still feared a ""very grave"" global threat.
Gold edged lower and the dollar retreated from a four-month high against the euro as risk appetite improved, helping push bond yields higher. 
MSCI's all-world stock index (MIWD00000PUS) gained 0.64% to hit a record high, as did the pan-regional STOXX 600 index in Europe, the blue-chip DAX (GDAXI) in Germany and the S&P/TSX Composite (GSPTSE) in Canada.
The Dow industrials, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all set records.
Investors are not euphoric and the coronavirus has added a dose of healthy skepticism in the marketplace, said Rahul Shah, chief executive of Ideal Asset Management in New York.
""We are comfortable with stocks grinding higher, versus shooting higher. So we think the slow gradual rise is bullish,"" Shah said. While valuations are slightly rich, ""when you have a bull market people are going to pay more for quality names.""
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told Congress that the U.S. economy is in a good place, even as he cited the potential threat from the coronavirus in China and concerns about the economy's long-term health.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 37.72 points, or 0.13%, to 29,314.54. The S&P 500 (SPX) gained 16.46 points, or 0.49%, to 3,368.55 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 73.48 points, or 0.76%, to 9,701.87.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) rose 0.96% and emerging market stocks rose 1.21%.
Concerns about the economic impact of the coronavirus have recently added a safety bid for the dollar, while economic data has backed the view that the U.S. economic outlook is stronger than the euro zone's.

Investing.com - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stumbled Tuesday after a Wall Street analyst issues a pessimistic note on the stock, citing impact from Google’s restriction of cookies.
Shares of Facebook fell 1.3% in morning trading.
Pivotal Research Group downgraded the stock to sell from hold, with the price target ratcheted down to $180 per share from $215.
Google’s new browser Chrome Version 80 will clamp down on third-party cookies (code must now reflect how specifically cookies are to be handled) as part of its plan to eventually phase them out.
“We think the Street is being way too complacent regarding the impact of the Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Chrome changes,"" analyst Michael Levine said in a note. ""In effect, this will restrict some of the capabilities of third-party cookies, making it more challenging to utilize inputs from cross-site behavior.”
Of the 51 analysts covering Facebook, there are only two sell ratings, according to Investing.com. The average price target is about $246 a share.

(Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) booked no new orders for airplanes last month, the first time it has come up empty-handed in January since 1962, as the U.S. planemaker's once best-selling jet, the 737 MAX, remained grounded following two fatal crashes.
The airplane maker, struggling with a crisis that dates back to the second of the two crashes last March, also said it delivered just 13 planes to customers last month. A year ago, it sealed 45 orders after cancellations in January and delivered 46 planes.
Most airline customers are avoiding placing fresh orders for the 737 MAX until the aircraft is cleared by regulators to fly again, leaving Boeing trailing European rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR) and swallowing huge monthly financial losses.
The Paris-based planemaker last week posted its biggest January order haul in at least 15 years, as it booked gross orders for 296 aircraft, or 274 net orders after cancellations.
Boeing saw its worst year for orders in decades in 2019 as it struggled with the 737 MAX crisis, leading to its first halt in 737 production in 20 years in January and the departure of Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg in December.
The company has continued to push back its expectations for when the MAX will fly again, meaning it cannot deliver planes to customers and get paid for them.
That has resulted in billions of dollars in losses both for the company and its suppliers, who have had to lay off workers amid uncertainty over the return of the 737 MAX jets.
Airlines, on the other hand, have been forced to pull the 737 MAX out of their flying schedules until the middle of 2020, causing thousands of flight cancellations.
Boeing's own debt doubled to $27.3 billion in 2019, and it continues on a skyward trajectory, as the planemaker compensates both airline customers and suppliers, while fighting lawsuits and paying workers' salaries.
An estimate by Fitch Ratings has pegged Boeing's debt peaking at more than $32 billion to $34 billion after a continued rise in the first and second quarters of 2020.
In a fillip for the company, the Federal Aviation Administration earlier on Tuesday hinted that it was close to conducting a certification test flight on the grounded 737 MAX, although it still does not have a timetable for lifting the flight ban.

Last week, the FAA called senior U.S. airline officials and told them that the agency could approve the 737 MAX's return to service before mid-year - a faster time frame than the planemaker itself has assumed - Reuters reported citing people briefed on the calls.

The office sharing start-up, which has gone through a meltdown as its public offering imploded last year, also said it expects to record its first ever $1-billion revenue quarter this year.
The company aims to achieve free cash flow of over $1 billion by 2024.
As part of its overall plan, the company named real estate veteran Sandeep Mathrani as chief executive officer earlier this month to put the company on a profit-making trajectory.
The company is also reshuffling its board and said on Tuesday that three directors - Mark Schwartz, Steve Langman and Lew Frankfurt - stepped down.
Schwartz is a former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) executive and has been a board member at WeWork since August 2017. Langman is a co-founder of private equity Rhone Group, which backed a $2.9 billion real estate investment fund created in May 2019 with Canadian property investor Ivanhoe Cambridge.
WeWork's board also includes Bruce Dunlevie of Benchmark Capital and Claure, who was parachuted into WeWork from SoftBank last year.
WeWork said Kirthiga Reddy, who was named to the board last week, will replace Ron Fisher as a representative of SoftBank Vision Fund.
WeWork also said it expects to reach 1,000 locations worldwide by 2021 and 1 million memberships by 2023.

WeWork said https://reut.rs/2UIyLy8 it expects to have $2.5-$3.0 billion of additional liquidity for future growth, provided it successfully meets the target on cash-flow breakeven in 2022.
The company said in December that it arranged a $1.75 billion letter of credit with Goldman Sachs that was in the process of being syndicated and whose funds were expected to be available in January.
Under the new credit facility, WeWork is not required to post any cash collateral and will have access to $800 million in working capital, which was restricted under the previous credit facility.

The credit line is part of SoftBank Group Corp's $9.5 billion bailout that was announced in October when money-losing WeWork was on the brink of running out of cash.

Investing.com -- Wall Street opened at fresh highs on Tuesday on hopes that the coronavirus may peak soon, while shares in Sprint and T-Mobile soared after a court threw out a lawsuit seeking to block their merger.
By 10:40 AM ET (15:40 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 111 points, or 0.4%, while the S&P 500 was up 0.6% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.8%.
The market was also supported by comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell suggesting the Fed would backstop the economy to protect it against spillovers from the coronavirus, wihch was officially named Covid-19 by the World Health Organization today. Markets have been in risk-on mood across the world on Tuesday after the number of new cases confirmed by China fell 19% from Monday, raising hopes that the outbreak will peak soon.
Powell told Congress the Fed is “closely monitoring” the situation in China for “persistent” and “material” impacts on the U.S. economy.
For the moment, he added, it was “too early to say” whether there would be any.
In the meantime, “the current stance of monetary policy will likely remain appropriate,” Powell said, adding that he expected to continue using repos to stabilize the money market through April.
The biggest moves in early trading were by wireless carriers Sprint (NYSE:S) and T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS), which rose by 73% and 11% respectively after a New York judge threw out a lawsuit that aimed to stop their merger on antitrust grounds.
Rivals Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T), which may profit from the greater concentration in the sector, were mixed. Verizon stock fell 0.6%, while AT&T stock rose 0.7%.
Earnings season continued to throw out mixed results, with Under Armour (NYSE:UA) falling 15.4% after it warned of up to $425 million in restructuring costs this year, including from the possible suspension of plans for a flagship store in New York.
Mastercard (NYSE:MA) stock rose 1.1% after gaining a license to operate a bank card clearing network in China, another step in the gradual opening of the country's financial system.

China's Tencent Holdings (HK:0700) increased its stake in a consortium that controls Supercell to 51.2% from 50% in October. The consortium owns 88.1% of the game maker.
Supercell reported its earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) in 2019 were down 4% at 517 million euros, the company said.
The 10-year-old firm gave no more financial figures but Chief Executive Ilkka Paananen said its top-performing game Clash of Clans, released in 2012, was among the world's 10 top-grossing games.
""Short-term goals don't mean anything to us,"" Paananen said. ""On a monthly basis, a couple hundred million people play our games actively.""
He said Tencent President Martin Lau was patient as an owner, saying his idea of long-term was ""a decade or several decades.""
Research firm App Annie said in December that Supercell's Clash of Clans was the past decade's world top game in all-time consumer spend, beating Japanese Mixi's Monster Strike and U.S. based Activision Blizzard's Candy Crush Saga. 
Supercell's fifth and newest game, Brawl Stars, is about to join their four previous games in booking total sales worth more than 1 billion euros, the company said.
Paananen said Brawl Stars had become ""a huge success"", particularly in South Korea after its release in 2018.

LONDON (Reuters) - Japan's MUFG (T:8306) and Mizuho (T:8411) have hired a total of nearly 100 staff in London in the last 6 months, bolstering their trading and investment banking teams despite industry concerns over Brexit's impact on financial services in Britain.
Mizuho has hired more than 25 senior bankers and traders, while MUFG has hired seven senior investment bankers, an aviation finance team from Germany's DVB Bank and dozens of back office risk and compliance staff, information from sources and internal bank memos seen by Reuters show.
Wall Street and European rivals are moving staff from London to other European hubs, concerned about being able to keep serving clients with Britain outside the European Union.
The latest EY Financial Services Brexit Tracker showed 43 financial firms have announced plans to make local hires for more than 2,400 roles in the EU. The total number of jobs seen likely to relocate from London to the EU is around 7,000.
Financial lobby group TheCityUK said the financial services industry employs 1.1 million across Britain, mainly outside London.
The Japanese banks had cut back too far and are taking advantage of a relative lack of competition, headhunters said.
""They have been recruiting for the last four or five months, and towards the back end of last year, they have really come back out in force,"" Ben Harris, senior manager at recruitment firm Morgan McKinley, said.
""They have taken in some heavyweight individuals away from other big banks who have been very cautious about adding headcount,"" Harris added.
Mizuho has focused on fixed income products, where new head of global markets Asif Godall has hired bond and derivatives traders from rivals including  Barclays  (L:BARC),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), and HSBC (L:HSBA).
""We've been opportunistic in hiring, and have benefited from the fact the European banks have retrenched,"" Godall said.
The strategy is to grow the bank's ability to cross-sell financial products to its corporate clients, and make better use of its vast balance sheet as European lenders retreat, he said.
'CROSS-SELLING'
Morgan McKinley's Harris said Japanese banks historically tended to make deep cyclical cuts to their workforces and sometimes shed too much in leaner times, leading to quickfire hiring sprees when market conditions improved.
MUFG offered redundancy to 500 senior London bankers in May, but is now building back up under new chief for the region John Winter, with a similar focus on cross-selling.
""The past twelve months have been about bringing in some strategic hires to support these plans, as well as making some key internal appointments to ensure that we bring greater co-ordination and focus to our business,"" Winter said.
Neither MUFG or Mizuho feature prominently in global investment banking league tables, sitting outside the top 10 positions for fees, equities, initial public offerings, global debt and mergers and acquisitions, data from Refinitiv shows.
Mizuho is however ranked number three in global syndicated loans, while MUFG holds eighth position."

The company said it expects revenue in North America, its biggest, to decline at a mid- to high-single-digit percentage rate, while its international market is expected to rise.
Under Armour, known for its moisture-wicking fabric worn by star athletes, has been struggling to grow sales in its home market due to new launches by larger rivals  Nike  Inc (N:NKE) and Adidas (DE:ADSGn) and heavy promotions at department stores.

Both the S&P and Nasdaq closed at record highs Monday, and this positive tone is set to continue Tuesday. Wall Street has posted gains on five of the last six trading sessions, and the two indices are on course for their strongest months since June.
The U.S. earnings season enters its final stretch this week, but there are still some well-known names reporting. The quarter has generally been a positive one, with around 70% of companies beating expectations.
Shares in Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) climbed over 7% premarket after beating earnings expectations. The toymaker was boosted by sales of products associated with the blockbuster movie 'Frozen II'.
Shares in AutoNation (NYSE:AN) climbed over 2% after the nation's largest new-vehicle retailer posted stronger than expected earnings for the fourth quarter.
Shares in athletic apparel maker   Under Armour   (NYSE:UAA) slumped 15% premarket after disappointing quarterly results.
After the close of trading, ride-hailing company   Lyft   (NASDAQ:LYFT) is expected to report a loss of 53 cents per share, with revenue coming in at about $984 million.
Additionally, Sprint (NYSE:S) will be in the spotlight on a report that a U.S. judge is expected to rule in its favor in the lawsuit that attempted to stop the telecommunications company’s industry-changing merger with T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS). Sprint’s shares soared over 66% in premarket trading. Shares in Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn), the parent of T-Mobile US, gained over 4% in Germany.

The Fed chair is expected to reinforce the signal that the central bank’s interest rate policy is on hold at low levels despite the labor market continuing to tighten and private consumption growth remaining solid. He is also likely to be questioned on the potential impact on the U.S. economy of the coronavirus outbreak, particularly as the number of victims now tops 1,000, with over 42,000 people affected.

Lin Chan, 30, a beauty salon entrepreneur, told Reuters footfall in her eyebrow-shaping salon is down nearly 70%. 
""For us doing eyebrow trimming, the distance from the customers is very small,"" Chan said. 
""A lot of customers will cancel their bookings.""
In a bid to retain customers, Chan is offering a free face mask and packs of disinfectant hand wipes as a gift to customers when they finish their treatment - quite a treat in a city where panic buying for such items has left shop shelves empty. 
Wu Ji, 38, who runs the eponymous Wu Ji Workshop Co that specializes in carpets for automotive vehicles and employs more than 10 people in Hong Kong and mainland China, is also feeling the pain.
""All of our carpets get produced in the mainland and then shipped to Hong Kong for installation,"" he told Reuters. ""If the source of your products is closed off, the entire supply chain is already broken.""

Wu, who sells his carpets wholesale as well as directly to car owners, considers himself lucky that revenue is only down 30%, when some businesses nearby have already shut up shop.

While Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has said closing the entire border would be inappropriate, impractical and discriminatory, Wu is still in favor of such a move despite any further potential damage to his business. 
""Only if Hong Kong closes up (the border) entirely, the people of Hong Kong will be happy,"" Wu said. 

""We don't know for how long the neighborhoods will keep getting infected. We don't know when the communities may explode. This terror is what makes us the most scared.""

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Shops, restaurants and cinemas may be deserted in many parts of virus-plagued China, but online trading forums, internet roadshows and analyst calls are teeming with investors who have driven up stock trading volumes to nine-month highs.
Strategists are busy meeting anxious investors online to dispense tips on how to trade the coronavirus, while fund managers aggressively pitch products via live video streaming, with face-to-face conferences banned and many offices still closed. 
The virus has been a blow to China's already-slowing economy, prompting Beijing to boost financial support to avoid a deeper hit to economic growth. But with many cities still locked down and people staying home amid efforts to contain an epidemic that has killed more than 1,000, online activity is buzzing.
""The government is injecting liquidity to aid the virus-hit economy,"" said Shanghai-based hedge fund manager Li Zhen, who has been trading at home since the outbreak began around the start of the Lunar New Year in late January.
""Loose liquidity, plus a rising willingness to trade, help lift trading turnover."" 
Investor enthusiasm is highlighting a long-standing disconnect between China's stock market and its real economy. 
While analysts and government researchers forecast a sharp hit to the country's GDP growth this year, Chinese equities have risen for six consecutive sessions as investors piled in to hunt for bargains following the market's (SSEC) 8% plummet on Feb. 3, the first trading session after the new year.
The start-up board ChiNext (CNT) has recovered all its losses, hitting a more than three-year-high on Monday, while the Shanghai market last week witnessed its biggest weekly trading volume since April, 2019.
""Investors who missed last year's bull run are taking advantage of the correction to get onto the ride,"" said Huang Wei, a former Wall Street trader who has recently set up a trading forum on China's WeChat messaging platform that offers paid stock recommendation services to retail investors.
""The virus doesn't change long-term fundamentals of China's market, just as the Pearl Harbor incident didn't change U.S. economic strength,"" he said, adding Beijing will likely deliver more stimulus, including rate cuts, to cushion the economic fallout from the virus outbreak.
Membership in Huang's newly established trading forum has grown to more than 100 in just a few days as investors are lured into a market that saw the blue-chip CSI300 index (CSI300) jump 36% last year.
That trading enthusiasm has spurred local brokerage Huatai Securities into launching a series of conference calls to help investors pick stocks. Companies to be discussed this week include Anhui Honglu Steel Construction (Group) Co (SZ:002541) and China Railway Group (SS:601390). 
Robin Lu, an entrepreneur, said making money through stock investing is more promising than doing business under the current environment.
""The real economy is struggling. But in the stock market, there's a structural bull,"" said Lu, who favors technology stocks. His consultancy business has been affected by the virus, which hit many of his clients.
Meanwhile, mutual fund managers are promoting products for investors who don't want to pick stocks themselves. More than 30 new funds have been launched over the past week, with several snapped up by investors in just a few days.
China Asset Management Co (ChinaAMC) launched a week-long online roadshow in which 11 fund managers take turns to introduce fund products and share investment views via live video streaming.
""The impact from the virus is short term and won't affect long-term investment,"" ChinaAMC fund manager Zhou Keping told a live forum on Monday, advising investors to buy into tech-focused funds. 
The stock market will benefit from ""relatively loose liquidity conditions that will improve risk appetite,"" he said.

(Reuters) - Private equity firm KKR (N:KKR) on Tuesday said it does not intend to make an offer for troubled NMC Health (L:NMC) but Italian-backed GKSD Investment Holding confirmed it could bid.
Shares in the United Arab Emirates' largest private healthcare company extended losses to touch session lows after the KKR announcement.
By 1030 GMT, they were down 16% on the London Stock Exchange and set to lose half the gains made when NMC disclosed the approaches on Monday. NMC could not be immediately reached for comment on KKR's statement.
NMC has been in turmoil since short-seller Muddy Waters queried its financial statements two months ago, sending its shares spiraling two-thirds lower.
NMC disclosed preliminary buyout approaches from KKR & Co Inc and GK Investment on Monday.
It said separately on Monday that its co-chair and founder BR Shetty had stepped back from its board after he informed NMC of potentially inaccurate reporting of his holdings.
NMC, which listed in London in 2012 and was promoted to the blue chip FTSE 100 index in 2017, operates clinics and hospitals, specialized maternity and fertility clinics, and long-term care homes hospitals across 19 countries.
GKSD, an investment vehicle backed by sponsors of Italy's private hospital chain Gruppo San Donato (GSD), said it was in the preliminary stages of considering an offer for NMC.
GSD, founded https://www.gsdinternational.com/our-story.html in 1957, operates research hospitals, general hospitals and clinics in 44 locations across Italy and calls itself the country's largest private hospital group.
GKSD is being advised by GK Investment, which made the approach to NMC on its behalf, the firm said. Rothschild & Co and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) are also acting as advisers.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Inter IKEA Group has appointed Jon Abrahamsson Ring as CEO from September, as the owner of the world's biggest furniture brand battles to adapt to new shopping habits and the rise of online rivals.
Abrahamsson Ring, 45, is currently the head of Inter IKEA's franchising division. He had various positions at IKEA between 1998 and 2008, and rejoined the group in 2017. 
Torbjorn Loof, CEO of Inter IKEA Group since 2013 and with the group of companies and foundations that make up IKEA [IKEA.UL] for three decades, had decided to step down, the group said in a statement.
Inter IKEA Group Chairman Anders Dahlvig said Loof had led the company successfully.
""With a new IKEA direction and a solid franchise system in place, it's a good time for Torbjorn to hand over responsibility as CEO of Inter IKEA Group,"" he said in a statement.
IKEA, known for trusting customers to travel to its out-of-town warehouse stores and carry flat-pack furniture home themselves, has shifted strategy in recent years to adapt to the changing behavior of shoppers, who are opting to spend more of their money online.
It has increased its digital offering and other services and is opening more accessible smaller inner-city stores and showrooms across markets, and invested more delivery. 
Abrahamsson Ring, who has been working closely with Loof since his return, said in an interview there would be no shift in strategy as he takes on the new role.
Becoming more affordable, more accessible and more sustainable remained at the top of the agenda, he told Reuters.
Inter IKEA is a franchisor to store owners, of which Ingka Group is the main, and is also in charge of product development and supply. It generates the bulk of revenues from sales of goods to its retailers.
Loof, 55, told Reuters he would leave IKEA, starting by taking a six-month break, but did not rule out returning to the group in future in some capacity. 
Abrahamsson Ring will be deputy CEO between March and September to make for a smooth handover, Inter IKEA said.

302,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 11, 2020 05:39AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Two Cheers for Tui,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The travel sector got some relief from what’s been a miserable 2020 so far on Tuesday, as German-based Tui cashed in on the collapse of Thomas Cook to post a healthy 6.8% rise in sales in the three months through December.
Tui stock rose 11.4% by 5:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), its biggest intra-day gain since the day its venerable U.K.-based rival folded in October. The company reported it had its best quarter ever in bookings from the U.K., expanding its market share there as expected.
The news is evidence that the passing of Thomas Cook has made a decent dent in sector-wide overcapacity, and EasyJet stock and Ryanair stock both rose 2.5% in response. 
The news is the second big boost for the tour operator and airline group in a week: last Friday Tui had announced the acquisition of Hapag-Lloyd cruises, bolstering one of its more profitable divisions and releasing a “considerable book gain” in the equity value of its joint venture with Royal Caribbean (assuming the deal closes in the summer as expected).
Just as importantly, the company’s airlines division posted a 14% increase in underlying profit on what it called “improved booking trends” for its Winter program, suggesting that neither the slowdown in Germany nor the long shadow of Brexit have depressed big-ticket discretionary spending in either of its two biggest markets.
Extrapolating that trend, Tui raised its full-year revenue guidance to growth of just under 10% from around 5% previously.
Whether or not that transfers into higher earnings will depend on when the company’s 737 MAX aircraft return to service. Tui said it has now leased replacement capacity for the full fiscal year, after Boeing’s recent update indicated that the planes would not get clearance to fly until after the peak summer season. It also shaved 5% off its central estimate for what the grounding would cost it this year. But that is likely to be a win-win either way, given that Boeing (NYSE:BA) is likely to be on the hook for substantial compensation.
The figures suggest that as long as the coronavirus outbreak doesn’t become a pandemic, then Tui should be well set for the year, with pent-up demand in the U.K. a valuable insurance against a possible slowdown in Germany as the labor market there weakens.
In that context, the stock’s weakness in the last weeks may prove to have been a decent entry point. Even after today’s gains, it’s still not over the gain line for the year. At less than 15 times earnings and with a dividend yield of 5.33%, there are certainly more expensive stocks around.
Like its planes, Tui’s stock is still not quite clear for take-off. It warned again on Tuesday about the risks of disruption from the post-Brexit trade talks, and the coronavirus could still easily take a big toll on passenger numbers, given the recent publicity generated by ‘superspreader’ events outside of China. Shares in On the Beach, one of Tui’s biggest rivals in the package tour business, are still down over 10% for the year, having given up much of its gains after a less detailed trading update last week. 
Still, on a day when European stocks are back at record highs, those look like concerns for another day."

Adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) were at $184.3 million and revenue reached $655 million in the three months through December, the Austrian group which is about to take over Germany's Osram said on Tuesday. The adjusted EBIT margin was at 28%.
AMS, generating a large chunk of revenue with sensors for Apple's iPhones, had guided for $610-$650 million in revenues in the fourth quarter and an EBIT margin of at least 28%.
Shares in AMS were up 5.13% in JB premarket trade.
Assuming no meaningful negative impact from the coronavirus outbreak, AMS expects revenue in the first quarter to ease to$480-520 million due to usual weak demand at the start of the year. The EBIT margin is seen to fall to 19-21%.
AMS has no production facilities in China, but supply chain disruptions in the country due to the new virus could hit its business. Analysts estimate that China's smartphone sales may plunge by as much as 50% in the first quarter, as many retail shops have closed for an extended period.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) said last week it was extending its retail store closures in China and has yet to finalize opening dates, as Foxconn, which assembles iPhones, struggles to fully resume work.
AMS's fourth quarter operating cash flow was $273.5 million and net debt amounted to $1.75 billion per end-December, it said.
On the acquisition of Osram it said: ""Encouraged by the constructive relationship with Osram and overwhelming positive feedback on the strategic merits of the transaction, AMS expects to successfully close the transaction as envisaged."""
304,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2020 05:19AM ET</span>","U.S. judge expected to rule in favor of Sprint, T-Mobile merger: sources","By Diane Bartz and Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) - A U.S. district judge is expected to rule in favor of allowing Sprint and T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) to merge over the objections of a group of state attorneys general, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
Shares of Sprint surged 69% in Monday's after-hours trade and T-Mobile stock rose 8%. Shares in T-Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) were up 4.2% at 0917 GMT on Tuesday.
U.S. District Court Judge Victor Marrero is expected to make his decision public on Tuesday, one source said.
Deutsche Telekom confirmed Tuesday as the expected date. 
""We remain confident that the judge will decide in favor of the transaction,"" said Europe's largest telecoms company by revenue.
Approval of the deal would be a high profile defeat for state attorneys general, led by New York and California, who had argued that a merger of the No. 3 and No. 4 U.S. wireless carriers would lead to higher prices, especially for customers who use prepaid plans popular with people with poorer credit.
The deal has already been approved by federal regulators. 
The companies had said the deal was needed to help them build out next generation of wireless, called 5G, and better compete with sector leaders  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T Inc (NYSE:T).
Executives from the companies, including T-Mobile Chief Executive John Legere, testified during the trial that Sprint's business was deteriorating and would not survive if it did not merge with T-Mobile.
The two companies are expected to start talks on renegotiating the terms of their $26.5 billion merger in the next few days, two sources said. 
Deutsche Telekom is keen to cut the price of the deal, arguing that Sprint's fortunes have deteriorated since they inked their agreement, the sources added.
However, Sprint, in which Japan's Softbank Group has a major stake, is expected to argue that T-Mobile needs Sprint in order to grow its cashflow and to boost its capacity using its spectrum, according to the sources.
There is no certainty that there will be a renegotiated deal, the sources cautioned.
The court did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Sprint and T-Mobile both declined to comment.
One merger opponent, Gigi Sohn, a former telecoms regulator now at Georgetown Law, tweeted her displeasure with reports of the decision. ""If #antitrust law doesn't even block a 4-3 merger like this, we need to start from scratch,"" she tweeted, referring to the market shrinking to three from four competitors. ""I'll have more to say tomorrow after I read the judge's decision (through my tears).""
While a group of states decided to fight the deal in court, the federal government approved it with conditions, a decision which remain in effect.
The U.S. Justice Department approved the deal in July after the carriers agreed to sell some assets to satellite provider Dish Network Corp, which would create its own cellular network to ensure that there would still be four competitors in the market. The Federal Communications Commission signed off on the deal in October. Dish shares rose 2% after hours.
The states maintained that Dish was ill-equipped to become a competitive fourth wireless carrier.
The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that the court was expected to approve the deal on Tuesday.

""We are following a very diligent process and it is important that we stay focused on the process and not on the timeline,"" FAA Administrator Steve Dickson told reporters.
""Having said that we are approaching a milestone: the certification flight is the next major milestone and once that is completed I think we will have a good bit more clarity on where the process goes forward from there,"" he said during a visit to the Singapore Airshow.
The certification flight to be carried out by FAA pilots ""is not scheduled yet because we still have a few issues to resolve, but we continue to narrow the issues. We are waiting for proposals from Boeing on a few items,"" he added.
The 737 MAX was grounded last March following two fatal crashes in the space of five months. Boeing has adjusted cockpit software which has been blamed in part for overwhelming pilots and dropped objections to simulator training for pilots.

Dickson said he expected close technical alignment between global regulators over the criteria for reversing the grounding, when the time for that decision comes, but noted there could be differences in how the jet is put back to service worldwide.

(Reuters) - European shares hit a record high on Tuesday as the number of new coronavirus cases slowed in China and the country's factories slowly returned to work, easing some concerns of a long-drawn impact to the global economy. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) rose as much as 0.9% to a record high of 428.30. The index has seen several volatile weeks following the news of the virus outbreak. 
Markets have been weighing the economic impact even as China infused liquidity in an attempt to soften the blow on the world's second-largest economy. 
""Some aspects of the Chinese economy are beginning to return to work- Maybe China isn't going through the complete grind to halt that we were pricing in a week ago,"" said David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets in London. 
""Even with the health crisis getting worse, the economy in China is possibly in better shape than we initially thought.""
However, with the death toll from the virus now crossing 1000, markets remained worried that the extent of economic disruption could be greater than estimated.
Travel and leisure stocks (SXTP) were the best performing European sector, rising about 1.4%. Worries over travel disruptions caused by the virus had led to a heavy selloff in the sector over the past few weeks.
Travel company TUI (L:TUIT) led gains after it lifted the lower end of its annual earnings guidance, citing strong holiday demand. The stock was also the best performer on the STOXX 600.
Basic resources stocks (SXPP) rose about 0.8% on an uptick in iron ore and base metal prices.

Shares in the German automaker rose 2% after the earnings which had been flagged in preliminary figures on Jan. 22.
Mercedes retained its title as the world's top-selling premium automaker but net profit fell to 2.7 billion euros from 7.6 billion reflecting 4.2 billion euros in charges related to diesel probes and legal proceedings.
Mercedes scrapped its X-Class pick-up truck and restructured its mobility services unit last year, meaning further charges of 828 million and 405 million euros, respectively.
GETTING BACK ON TRACK
Kaellenius said restructuring at the vans division would deliver results this year but cautioned Daimler's passenger car operations face a tough could of years.
""We are going to restore the financial health of this company and take the measures we have to take to get back on track,"" Kaellenius said. ""Yes, it will take some time on some of the issues. There are no quick fixes."" 
The 50-year-old Swede is the company's former research and development chief and took over as CEO last May. 
He is tasked with safeguarding Daimler's success as the industry undergoes sweeping changes including tougher environmental rules and a costly shift to electric power. 
That challenge is seen in Daimler's share performance, with the stock down 12% year to date versus an 84% rise in electric car producer Tesla (O:TSLA), Refinitiv Eikon data shows.
Mercedes-Benz will launch an electric A-Class and an electric van this year.
The company said it aims to keep property, plants and equipment and R&D spending at roughly the same level as last year.
It will look for savings of more than 1.4 billion euros by the end of 2022 through cuts in administrative and personnel costs. 
""Our goal is to ensure solid net liquidity to protect the necessary investments, and at the same time to pay attractive dividends,"" Chief Financial Officer Harald Wilhelm said.

Alongside taking hefty charges to end 2019, the company slashed its dividend by 72% to 0.90 euros per share.

Investing.com - European stock markets pushed higher Tuesday, following Wall Street to a new record high, helped by gains in the recently battered travel and leisure sector on the back of strong numbers from Tui.
At 04:00 ET (0900 GMT), the U.K.'s FTSE index was trading 65 points, or 0.9%, higher, France's CAC 40 was up 28 points, or 0.5%, while the DAX gained 105 points, or 0.8%. The Stoxx 600 index, which represents a broad swathe of companies across 17 countries in Europe, traded 0.6% higher, having hit a new record high at 428.30. 
Overnight Monday, both the S&P and Nasdaq made a positive start to the week, closing at record highs as strong gains for mega-cap tech stocks overshadowed concerns about the coronavirus impact.
On Tuesday, shares in Tui (DE:TUIGn) soared over 10% after the European holiday company pointed to the ""best booking volumes month in the company's history"" during the three months to December. This strong holiday demand is expected to compensate for the grounding of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX aircraft.
These strong numbers have translated into hefty gains for some of the region’s airlines, a sector which has been hard hit by the repercussions of the outbreak of the coronavirus in China, with EasyJet (LON:EZJ) up 3.2%, Ryanair (LON:RYA) 3% higher and IAG (LON:ICAG), which owns British Airways and Iberia, up 3.2%.
Elsewhere, shares in Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) climbed over 4% on a report that a U.S. judge is expected to rule in favor of T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) in the lawsuit that attempted to stop their industry-changing merger. T-Mobile is the mobile communications subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom.
On the flip side, Shares in AMS (SIX:AMS)dropped almost 5% after the sensor specialist warned revenues in the first quarter would decrease despite fourth-quarter revenues above its own forecast amid strong demand for high-end smartphones.
Daimler, the maker of Mercedes-Benz, also fell 0.4% after the company said sales will fall for a second straight year as it re-gears its operations more to electric vehicles. The company also cut its dividend by more than two-thirds in an effort to save cash.
The economic calendar in Europe is dominated Tuesday by the release of the U.K. gross domestic product figures for the fourth quarter of 2019, at 04:30 AM ET (0930 GMT).
The U.K. economy probably narrowly avoided a contraction at the end of 2019, with the Investing.com poll forecasting no growth on the quarter, resulting in annual growth of 0.8%.
Also of interest will be a speech by European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde at 09:00 AM ET (1400 GMT). The central bank is in the middle of a major strategic review, and any comments from Lagarde over whether it changes its inflation goal will be of interest.
Elsewhere, the oil market has pushed higher Tuesday, rebounding a touch after recent losses. The market is still looking at potential cuts to supply from the club of major oil producers.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia plans to loosen rigid rules on mandatory severance compensation in a new bill aimed at improving the investment climate in Southeast Asia's biggest economy, an official and a source with knowledge of the issue said.
Labor laws are politically sensitive and in order to make the changes more palatable to unions the government will also make companies pay some benefits upfront, they said.
The proposals are included in so-called ""omnibus"" bills that President Joko Widodo has prioritized in his efforts to cut red tape and create jobs. The bills club together changes in unrelated legislation to allow parliament voting in a single swoop to speed reforms.
Foreign investors often cite regulatory uncertainty, bureaucratic hurdles and strict labor rules among their top concern for investing in Indonesia.
Officials have said the ""Job Creation"" bill will be filed to parliament this week, while a taxation bill was submitted to lawmakers recently.
Indonesia's current rules on severance pay are among the most generous in the world and business say they deter formal hiring due to the expense of sacking underperforming employees.
The new bill aims to cut maximum severance payments to 19 times monthly salary, down from 32 times now, said the source, who has been involved in drafting the bill.
To appease workers, the government will also make companies pay between one to five times monthly salary to staff with at least one year of employment, he said.
The payment, which will be capped at 100 million rupiah ($7,300), should be made within a year after the bill is passed, said the source, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue.
Susiwijono Moegiarso, secretary general of the coordinating ministry of economics, confirmed severance benefits would be trimmed and a cash ""sweetener"" provided, but declined to provide more detail.
""This is like a herbal drink, it's bitter to swallow but it's healthy,"" Moegiarso told Reuters.
Government officials have previously said state social security agency BPJS Ketenagakerjaan will also take over some responsibility to provide a safety net for workers out of jobs.
Under the proposed new bill, BPJS will provide six months of cash benefits, skills training and access to new jobs, they said.
Despite few details of the bill leaking out, unions have already held protests and threatened to stage strikes over concerns about losing job protection and benefits.
The final draft of the bill has more than 1,200 articles, revising 80 existing laws, Moegiarso said.
A proposal to remove nearly all limits on foreign investment in most business sectors is also included in the bill, said the source.
Indonesia's chief economics minister, Airlangga Hartarto, previously said the government planned to bar foreign ownership from only six sectors and remove a so-called ""Negative Investment List""."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore kicked off Asia's largest aerospace event under heightened scrutiny on Tuesday as thousands of visitors shunned the Singapore Airshow over coronavirus fears, while all eyes were on a sensitive fly-off between U.S. and Chinese fighters.
Organizers hailed a ""strong show of support"" as the city-state's defense and trade ministers inaugurated the Feb. 11-16 event, with official forecasts of attendance scaled down to 40,000 trade visitors from 45,000 on Sunday.
Officials said they had taken extra precautions including heat-screening of attendees for signs of fever.
But foreign reporters and delegates estimated well below 10,000 people were attending on opening day, usually the show's busiest, and another signature of air shows - big-spending military delegations - was less evident than in the past.
Some spaces where exhibitors including Chinese planemaker COMAC had pulled out were turned into ""rest areas"" or roped off.
Over 70 companies have pulled out of one of Southeast Asia's top economic events, citing fears over the outbreak. 
Those fears have spilled over to broader concerns over demand for aviation, one of the industries most exposed to the epidemic that has killed more than 1,000 people and infected over 40,000, mostly in mainland China.
UK-based consultancy Ascend by Cirium, which tracks schedule data worldwide, estimated over the weekend that flights involving China had halved compared to normal levels.
""The numbers are even worse this week, more like 60-70% down over pre-crisis schedule and changing daily,"" head consultant Rob Morris said in a post on Twitter on Tuesday.
Still, some companies announced deals at the show including European turboprop maker ATR (PA:AIR) (MI:LDOF).
It said Papua New Guinea airline PNG Air would become a launch customer for a short take-off and landing version of its ATR 42-600 with an order for three aircraft.
Boeing (N:BA) said lessor BBAM had commissioned the planemaker to convert three 737-800 passenger jets to freighters to serve the growing e-commerce market and express air cargo.
The deal is part of a push into the lucrative services sector as the planemaker looks to boost margins.
Korean Air Lines (KS:003490) ordered Pratt & Whitney engines for up to 50 Airbus (PA:AIR) A321neo jets. It is also due to enter talks to be part of Pratt's repair network for other airlines, matching Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) and Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) . 
U.S.-CHINA FIGHTERS
The visual highlight of the show, perhaps the most intriguing in terms of choreography, was the prospect of near-sequential displays by U.S. and Chinese fighters.
It marks a rare sight of an operational J-10 Chinese fighter unit display team sharing skies with U.S. top-line military jets, the F-22 and F-35 stealth fighters. 
China and the United States, which this year signed a Phase 1 deal aimed at easing trade tensions between them, have been jostling for influence in Asia as China seeks to lay claim over part of the South China Sea.
Singapore has a close military relationship with the United States, training regularly with U.S. forces and permanently basing squadrons of its aircraft in America. 
The United States brings F-35B to Singapore a month after it approved sale of 12 jets to the city-state.
""This is a furtherance of our relationship and our bilateral ties with Singapore,"" U.S. State Department Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs R. Clarke Cooper said.
Last year, Singapore also signed an agreement with China for joint exercises, defense dialogue and logistical cooperation.

""Singapore is walking a tightrope between its alliance with the United States reflected in decision to buy F35 and concerns about antagonizing China,"" one Western defense delegate said, noting the two displays were due to be separated by a gap.

HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Bankers in Asia are bracing for a deal drought as efforts to limit the spread of the coronavirus epidemic have put key meetings and roadshows on hold.
Several auctions of assets are facing delays or re-assessments and preparations for potential Chinese initial public offerings (IPOs) are also slowing, bankers said.
""All our deals are on hold now - capital markets or M&A. Nothing is happening,"" said a Hong Kong-based senior investment banker with a Wall Street bank.
Baring Private Equity Asia is expected to extend a bidding deadline for the sale of HCP, a Shanghai-based packaging business valued at around $1 billion, said four people with knowledge of the deal.
The Hong Kong-based investment firm sent out teasers before Chinese New Year and was initially expecting bids to come in as soon as this month, they said.
Baring declined to comment and HCP did not respond to a query for comment.
The launch of a sale process of Eu Yan Sang International, a Singapore-based healthcare company specializing in Chinese medicine, is likely to be postponed, said two people aware of the matter. They said the company had hoped to value itself at more than $500 million.
The sale of the company, partly owned by a unit of Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings (TEM.UL) and with a significant chunk of its business in Hong Kong, is being pushed back as most of its targeted buyers are Chinese, these people said.
Eu Yan Sang had no immediate comment and Temasek declined comment.
""Any China-related deals are off, so that means Q1 is probably washed out. European and U.S. buyers are also worried about traveling to Asia,"" said a Singapore-based banker.
Major banks in Hong Kong and Singapore have restricted travel to mainland China and are allowing staff to work from home while moving others to different office locations.
A number of countries have reduced or canceled flights in and out of China while Singapore and Hong Kong have demanded people returning from China quarantine themselves for up to 14 days.
The virus has claimed more than 1,000 lives and has spread to 24 other countries and territories.
The bankers declined to be identified because the transactions are confidential.
LESSONS FROM SARS
During the 2003 SARS epidemic, the volume of China-related IPOs fell 25% in the first half of the year compared with 2002, while M&A volumes halved, according to Refinitiv data. The epidemic ended in July 2003.
China has become a far bigger factor for both markets since then, accounting for 55% of M&A and 66% of IPO activity in Asia-Pacific over the past four years, compared with an average 16% and 50% in 2003.
Another factor that will concern investors in IPOs is the potential for a company's outlook to worsen because of the epidemic, bankers and lawyers said.
""The most significant adverse impacts, as of today, are the ability of IPO candidates and the reporting accountants to get their financials prepared and audited and for advisers to conduct on-site due diligence given the disruption to regional travel,"" said Michael Jacobs, a partner at law firm Allen & Overy.
Buyout firm  Carlyle Group  Inc (O:CG) has delayed the U.S. IPO of its German specialty chemicals group Atotech, concerned that the coronavirus outbreak would hurt its valuation, Reuters reported last week.
While video conferencing is making it easier to hold meetings than during the SARS outbreak, dealmakers expect the drought to last for weeks to come.
""Over the next few weeks, nothing much is expected to come to the markets in this environment - on both the M&A and IPO side. I'm trying to focus on other deals where there's hardly any China involvement,"" said a banker based in Hong Kong."

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it was concerned that the loss of High Street competition resulting from the merger could mean shoppers would see fewer discounts from clearance sales and promotions, a lower quality of customer service and less choice in stores and online.
JD, which valued Footasylum at up to 90 million pounds ($116.14 million), said it will continue to make its case to the CMA in the coming weeks as the deal will benefit both consumers and the UK High Street.
""We anticipate that Footasylum will contribute less than 2% of the Group's earnings in the year to January 2020,"" JD said, adding that earnings are expected to be at least equal to the top end of market expectations between 403 million pounds and 434 million pounds.

The CMA said it would ask for views on its provisional findings by March 3 and possible remedies by Feb. 25 and will assess all evidence before making a final decision. The deadline for its final report has been extended to May 11.

Investing.com - European stock markets are set open higher Tuesday, helped by Wall Street posting record highs overnight and news from China suggesting that much of the workforce will have returned to work within a week.
At 02:10 ET (0710 GMT), the DAX futures contract traded 63 points, or 0.5% higher. France's CAC 40 futures were up 25 points, or 0.4%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 31 points, or 0.4%. Futures on the pan-eurozone index, the Euro Stoxx 50, climbed 14 points, or 0.4%. 
Overnight Monday, both the S&P and Nasdaq made a positive start to the week, closing at record highs as strong gains for mega-cap tech stocks overshadowed concerns about the coronavirus impact.
The S&P 500 rose 0.7%, Nasdaq Composite added 1.1% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6%.
Earlier Tuesday, the Chinese Ministry of Transport said 160 million people would return to work by next Monday, according to the Global Times.
Still, the death toll from the virus has climbed over 1,000 in mainland China and infected over 40,000 people. And measures of returning workers and passenger traffic flows within China suggested the virus had ""a devastating impact on China's economy in January and February,"" said analysts at Nomura in a research note.
""We are concerned that global markets thus far appear to be significantly underestimating the extent of disruption inflicted by the virus,"" they wrote.
Chinese authorities are trying to lessen the damage, with President Xi Jinping saying the government would prevent large-scale layoffs caused by the virus outbreak. 
But companies are already feeling the pinch, and the market expects more stimulus from Beijing -- even though it’s debatable what can be done in the near term to reverse a sharp slump in demand.
Turning back to Europe,   Daimler   (DE:DAIGn) is likely to be in focus Tuesday after the luxury car manufacturer said its net profit fell to 2.7 billion euros in 2019, from 7.6 billion euros in the year earlier, while cutting its dividend to 0.90 euros ($0.9818) a share from 3.25 euros in an effort to conserve cash as it struggles with an expensive transition to electric vehicles.
European holiday company Tui (DE:TUIGn) said it was expecting the grounding of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX aircraft to cost it an additional 220 million euros to 245 million euros over its 2020 financial year, while reporting its first-quarter results on Tuesday.
Sensor specialist AMS (SIX:AMS) on Tuesday reported fourth-quarter revenues above its own forecast amid strong demand for high-end smartphones, but warned revenues in the first quarter would decrease, without blaming the impact of the coronavirus.
The economic calendar in Europe is dominated Tuesday by the release of the U.K. gross domestic product figures for the fourth quarter of 2019, at 04:30 AM ET (0930 GMT).
The U.K. economy probably narrowly avoided a contraction at the end of 2019, with the Investing.com poll forecasting no growth on the quarter, resulting in annual growth of 0.8%.
Also of interest will be a speech by European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde at 09:00 AM ET (1400 GMT). The central bank is in the middle of a major strategic review, and any comments from Lagarde over whether it changes its inflation goal will be of interest.
 Elsewhere, the oil market has pushed higher Tuesday, rebounding a touch after recent losses. The market is still looking at potential cuts to supply from the club of major oil producers.
AT 02:15 AM ET (0715 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 1.1% higher at $50.09 and the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.1% to $53.88."

Bank of China (Hong Kong) (HK:2388) and  Standard Chartered  (HK:2888) have said mortgage customers may apply to pay only interest, and not principal, for up to six months, subject to an extension of another six months.
""This is an effort to relieve the pressure of making monthly repayments for the individual and commercial customers who are more severely affected by the novel coronavirus outbreak, including but not limited to those in retail, food and beverage, logistics, tourism, hospitality and entertainment industries,"" Bank of China (Hong Kong) said in a statement.
Months of sometimes violent anti-government protests in Hong Kong last year plunged its economy into its first recession in a decade. Analysts predict a worse start to 2020 for the financial hub as travel curbs to fight the spread of the virus deal a further blow to tourism, retail and other business.
Hong Kong Airlines, the city's No.2 carrier, has already flagged plans to slash 400 jobs and cut operations given weak travel demand due to the outbreak.
The impact on Hong Kong's economy from the new epidemic could be worse than in 2003 when it was hit by another coronavirus, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), its financial secretary has warned, with unemployment set to rise.
The new coronavirus can be transmitted from person to person and has infected more than 40,000 and claimed over 1,000 lives in mainland China, exceeding the global toll of 800 during SARS. Hong Kong has confirmed 42 cases of coronavirus.
Against this backdrop, more banks are expected to follow suit with easing measures for mortgage borrowers to prevent 2003-like foreclosures, mReferral Mortgage Brokerage Services Senior Vice President Eric Tso said.
But property agents do not expect foreclosures in Hong Kong to exceed 2003 levels, when 5,700 were recorded, as the current loan ratio is much lower.
Data shows the mortgage delinquency ratio was 0.03% at end-December, with the estimated number of residential mortgage loans in negative equity at 128.
Private home prices in the city, one of the world's most expensive, eased again in December and property agents expect the trend to continue in the next few months."

In its first comments since the FAA downgrade, the Malaysian Aviation Commission (MAVCOM) said it was concerned its carriers would suffer the same fate as Thailand when it was downgraded by the FAA in 2015 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-thailand-aviation/china-japan-south-korea-halt-thai-air-route-expansion-on-safety-concerns-idUSKBN0MQ1ZM20150330.
China, South Korea and Japan all stopped Thailand-based airlines from flying charters and new routes because of safety concerns raised by the International Civil Aviation Organization, which was followed by the FAA downgrade.
MAVCOM Chief Operating Officer Azmir Zain said Malaysian carriers could lose as much as 4 billion ringgit ($966 million), or 24% of their revenue a year, if China, Japan and South Korea took the same restrictive steps against them.
Malaysia's airline industry is dominated by state-owned Malaysia Airlines, AirAsia Group Bhd (KL:AIRA) and its long-haul arm  AirAsia X Bhd  (KL:AIRX).
Azmir said that MAVCOM had yet to hear from the three countries about any action they might take.
Azmir also cast doubt over claims by the Malaysian government that it would be able to regain the top FAA category in 12 months, noting that Thailand had yet to restore its rating and the Philippines took six years to return to Category 1 following its own downgrade.
The FAA's safety ratings do not affect existing flights."
324,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2020 12:59AM ET</span>",Airbus unveils 'blended wing body' plane design after secret flight tests,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) on Tuesday unveiled a curvaceous aircraft design that blends wing and body, designed to slash carbon emissions by some 20%. 
The European planemaker has been carrying out flight tests of a 3.2-metre-wide (10.5 feet) technology demonstrator, code-named Maveric, at a secret location in central France since last year. It lifted the veil on the design at the Singapore Airshow.
The concept of a ""blended wing body"" design has been around since the 1940s and led to the U.S. B-2 bomber, as well as the X-48 research project between Boeing (NYSE:BA) and NASA a decade ago. 
Such aircraft are complex to control but produce less aerodynamic drag, making them more efficient to fly.
Planemakers are revisiting such designs as the passenger jet industry tries to commit to more environmentally friendly aircraft.
""We believe it is high time now to push this technology further and study what it brings to us,"" Jean-Brice Dumont, executive vice-president of engineering at Airbus, told reporters. ""We need these disruptive technologies to meet our environmental challenge. It is the next generation of aircraft; we are studying an option."" 
He said it was too early to say whether such shapes could contribute to the next generation of medium-haul planes, expected in the 2030s.
Since the previous generation of tests, aerospace has seen improvements in materials that make such aircraft lighter, and computing power has increased, improving flight controls, Dumont said.
Airbus is now studying how the cabin would work and how the aircraft would be integrated into airports. One unresolved question is whether such a plane would have windows or use video screens to give passengers a sense of their surroundings.
Another issue that has dogged such experiments in the past is how to handle sensations of movement.
Because passengers would be sitting further out from the center of the aircraft, compared to the classic 'tube and wings' model, they would move further when the aircraft turns. Rival Boeing has put more weight on a potential cargo role.

(NYSE:CVX) has ramped up output at a key Venezuela oil project to levels not seen in almost a year, offering a thorny reminder of how U.S. sanctions are failing to deliver a knockout of Nicolas Maduro’s regime.
The U.S. is eyeing tougher sanctions that could target Russian producer Rosneft PJSC and potentially affect Chevron’s waiver at a time when tensions between the two countries are escalating anew. Maduro, meanwhile, is considering giving foreign producers operational control at some fields to bring in added cash and, perhaps, to nudge other U.S. oil companies to lobby for their own access to Venezuela’s huge oil reserves.
“The likely goal is to make it so attractive, companies start to lobby harder in the U.S.,” said Raul Gallegos, a Bogota, Colombia-based director at Control Risks, an international consulting firm.
Chevron’s waiver, which expires in April, has benefited both countries, mitigating the collapse in Venezuela’s production and hindering further expansion by Russia and China. At the same time, it allows Chevron to remain the lone U.S. player in a country with an estimated 302.8 billion barrels of oil reserves and a dysfunctional state oil company that’s seen output fall by 74% since 2009 to about 792,000 barrels a day, according to the latest OPEC report.
Other U.S. oil companies, meanwhile, say they’re locked out. “This is an America Last policy,” said Ali Rahman, director of Delaware-registered Erepla Services LLC, in an interview. “The sanctions hurt American business interests -- other than the select few granted licenses -- more than anyone else.”
In 2018, Erepla entered into a potentially lucrative contract with state-controlled Petroleos de Venezuela SA to provide oilfield and marketing services to three fields. Soon after, the Trump administration tightened its sanctions, putting operations on hold. It sought a waiver similar to Chevron’s, Rahman said, but never got a sign-off.
The debate comes as Chevron has helped restore production at the Petropiar upgrader it runs as a joint project with PDVSA, according to people familiar with the operation. The upgrader turns the area’s tar-like oil into refinery-ready Hamaca crude for export.
After being closed for parts of 2019, the site is now producing about 130,000 barrels a day of crude, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. On paper, PDVSA controls Petropiar as majority owner, but Chevron has kept the oil flowing and helped repair the industrial facilities needed to refine the tar into marketable crude, the people said.
Ray Fohr, a Chevron spokesman, said the San Ramon, California-based oil major is focused on its “base business” in Venezuela and is in full compliance with the law. He said PDVSA directs work processes in the area where the upgrader is located, “including decisions made regarding the use of light oil and plant stops and restarts.”
Overall, Chevron had a production decline in 2019 compared with 2018, he said. “If Chevron is forced to leave Venezuela,” he wrote, “non-U.S. companies will fill the void and oil production will continue.” He declined to address specifics on the upgrader.
The waiver debate is complex, according to Control Risks’ Gallegos, the author of a book on Venezuela’s oil industry. “If you do away with waivers, it doesn’t immediately mean oil production goes down and Maduro is out,” he said in an interview. “The primary concern of the U.S. is the interests of oil companies, and access to the resource.”"

The two companies are in preliminary discussions regarding “a possible restructuring through a combination of the businesses of the two companies into a strong global group,” Geely said in the statement.
Volvo was seeking a valuation of up to $30 billion during its IPO preparation two years ago, but abandoned the plan against a backdrop of growing consolidation in the car industry. 
Li Shufu, chairman of both Geely and Volvo, said on Monday that any deal would “accelerate financial and technological synergies” between the companies.
“A combination of the two companies would result in a strong global group,” said Li.
The combined company would be listed in Hong Kong and could seek a secondary listing in Stockholm, Volvo said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian investigator who helped bring criminal cartel charges against  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) said he first heard concerns about a stock issue they worked on from a rival regulator, but the agencies acted independently.
The disclosure on Tuesday in a pre-trial court hearing relates to a central part of the defense against the country's biggest white collar criminal case: the investment banks want to show the evidence used to charge them was tainted by outside influences and departure from due process.
The banks, their client Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ) and several current and former executives are charged with colluding during a 2015 stock issue for ANZ to withold unsold shares and keep the stock from falling. A third investment bank which worked on the share sale, JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), cooperated with authorities in exchange for immunity.
In a second day of testimony, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) enforcement director Michael Taylor said corporate regulator the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) was first to tell him about concerns to do with the capital raising.
""The investment banks may not have been entirely truthful with ANZ bank, I recall that coming up,"" Taylor told a packed Sydney courtroom, referring to conversations with ASIC.
""I became aware that there was some suggestion that bids for shares had been placed by the investment banks to fill the book,"" Taylor added.
The ASIC investigation focused on suspected insider trading and suspected failure to fulfill obligations for the investment banks to act in clients' best interests, while ACCC pursued inquiries into suspected antitrust breaches, and the two were ""quite separate"", he said.
More than a year and a half since the charges were brought, the matter is yet to go to trial and none of the accused has entered a formal plea, but all have said they will plead not guilty.
The case is being closely watched by investment bankers around the world because it could have implications about the way they are allowed to run share sales. If found guilty, the banks face hefty fines while their staff and former staff face prison time.
JPMorgan's local head of compliance, Oliver Bainbridge, meanwhile told the court he began making internal inquiries about the capital raising less than a week after it took place after being instructed to by a regional compliance boss.
""We listened to some audio recordings in the days after the capital raising,"" said Bainbridge.
Bainbridge did not elaborate on the recordings. He told the court he gave a witness statement after lengthy sessions at the ACCC offices in Sydney, but said he was not involved in discussions between his employer and the regulator about cooperating in exchange for immunity.
The hearing continues on Wednesday."

The Shanghai Composite gained 0.3% by 10:30 PM ET (02:30 GMT), while the Shenzhen Component lost 0.2%.
Worries about the virus remained as work at factories began to resume in China following the extended Lunar New Year holidays. The death toll reached at least 1,011 on Tuesday, according to data released by the Chinese government.
“The risk of a larger downgrade in Chinese GDP growth over Q1 20 and 2020 as a whole is gaining momentum,” Richard Grace, senior currency strategist and head of international economics at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, wrote in a note.
The World Health Organization’s Dr. Sylvia Briand told reporters the coronavirus produces mild cold symptoms in about 80% of the cases seen so far, with just 15% of those infected ending up with pneumonia and 3% to 5% of patients needing intensive care.
The world health watchdog did expressed concerns, however, about new cases of the virus emerging outside mainland China, which it warned could be a ""spark that becomes a bigger fire.""

Monday's move to merge the two units come as global automakers pursue alliances to respond better to the cost of switching to electric cars, tougher emission rules and autonomous driving.
Shares in Geely jumped as much as 11.5% to HK$15.28 on Tuesday.
Zhejiang Geely Holding Group [GEELY.UL], Geely Automobile's parent, bought Volvo Cars from  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) in 2010.
Together with electric premium brand Polestar and Geely's new energy brand Geometry, the new company will have five brands, with products ranging from affordable sedans to luxury sports cars, marking the emergence of China's first global carmaker, analysts said.
""Strategically, the deal feels like – after years of deal-making – a first move by Chairman Li Shufu to consolidate his sprawling automotive empire, and to pay off some of the debt that had built up,"" analysts at Bernstein said in a note.
It remains unclear how much valuation would be added to Geely, a Hong Kong-listed, $16 billion company, by injecting Volvo assets. Geely's sales started to surge from 2015 as its products began incorporating Volvo technology.
Geely Automobile sold 1.36 million cars in 2019 and aims to sell 1.4 million cars this year. Volvo sold just over 700,000 cars last year. 
Volvo and its parent group had been discussing an IPO to value the carmaker at between $16 billion and $30 billion before they dropped the listing plan in 2018, sources said. 
Compared to Volvo's IPO plan, this proposal could better align Geely and Volvo's interests, Shi Ji, an analyst at Haitong International wrote in a note. Such a merger would help Volvo cross sell Geely cars worldwide as well as those made by sister brand Lynk & Co.
CAR COMBINATIONS
Volvo Cars and Geely will create a joint working group to prepare a proposal for their respective boards, the companies said in a statement on Monday.
The parent group, led by billionaire Li, has a number of other investments including a 9.7% stake in  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) acquired in 2018, a 49.9% stake in Malaysia's Proton bought in 2017, and a majority stake in British sport car brand Lotus.
In October, Volvo Cars said it would merge its engine development and manufacturing assets with those of Geely, creating a division to supply Lotus, LEVC, Lynk and Proton, and also potential rivals with next-generation combustion and hybrid engines.

Among other car companies that are collaborating are Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Ford, which said last year they would spend billions of dollars to jointly develop electric and self-driving vehicles, while FCA (MI:FCHA) and PSA (PA:PEUP) agreed a $50 billion merger to create the world's fourth-biggest automaker.

A report filed by a mediation team said exiting bankruptcy prior to the end of 2020 is in ""the best interests of all parties"" and that it supports the board's schedule, which calls for a federal court confirmation hearing to begin Oct. 13 on a newly revised plan to restructure the Caribbean island's core government debt.
Puerto Rico commenced a form of municipal bankruptcy in May 2017 to restructure about $120 billion of debt and liabilities.
Mediators acknowledged that confirmation of the so-called plan of adjustment for $35 billion of bonds and claims and more than $50 billion of pension obligations will be contested by certain creditors.
Meanwhile, oversight board executive director Natalie Jaresko defended the deal announced on Sunday with an expanded group of investors who own about $8 billion of bonds as a ""significant win"" that would reduce the $35 billion to less than $11 billion.
""We are doing a great deal in this agreement to protect the people of Puerto Rico and bring us out of bankruptcy,"" she told reporters.
Approval of the deal by the board was not unanimous, with board member David Skeel tweeting on Monday that he ""concluded there still are too many loose ends and I needed to vote no."" 
Municipal Market Analytics said the agreement ""represents a doubling-down on aggressive bets on future growth, forcing future lenders to think of (Puerto Rico) as a permanently speculative credit profile.""
Puerto Rico Governor Wanda Vazquez remains opposed. The island's fiscal agency released a statement on Monday reiterating her position that if bondholders get better treatment so should retired government workers. 
Under the agreement, general obligation (GO) bondholders would face average value reductions of 29%, which is lower than haircuts of 36% to 65% that were included in a prior plan of adjustment announced in September. Some GO bonds issued in 2012 and 2014 traded at higher prices on Monday.
Jaresko said the treatment of pensions, which includes a maximum 8.5% cut for retirees who receive more than $1,200 in monthly benefits, would not be revisited.

(Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Monday rejected a request by Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc and courier services provider Postmates Inc to block a California labor law from taking effect, saying the bill's public benefits outweighed the companies' concerns.
U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee in Los Angeles said that while the companies had proven they could suffer a degree of irreparable harm as a result of the law, the potential risks to them were less important than the public interest in setting a living wage and regulating employment.
The 24-page decision is a blow to the employers of the so-called gig economy which had hoped to stop a bill that will make it harder for them to classify their workers as independent contractors rather than employees.
Gee did not rule on the merits of the case and her decision does not stop the lawsuit.
Postmates said in a statement that Gee's decision was merely procedural and that the company looked forward to pursuing the case on its merits. It added it was considering all legal options, including an appeal.
Uber said it was reviewing the judge's opinion and considering whether to pursue an appeal. The company in a statement called the California law ""biased and overtly political"" by granting preferential treatment to an arbitrary group of industries.
In their lawsuit against the State of California at the end of 2019, the companies argued that the bill violates the U.S. Constitution and unfairly singles out app-based technology platforms.
Under the law, which took effect on Jan. 1, companies in violation face potential criminal penalties, but to date no enforcement action has taken place.
The bill strikes at the heart of the ""gig economy"" business model of technology platforms like Uber, Postmates,  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) , DoorDash and others that rely heavily on the state's 450,000 contract workers, not full-time employees, to drive passengers or deliver food via app-based services.
Investors are watching the California dispute closely, as companies subject to the law would be required to provide higher pay and other benefits such as medical insurance - likely upending the gig-economy business model.
The app-based companies argue the legislation compromises the flexibility prized by their workforce, and that fewer workers would be hired were they considered employees.
Uber, Lyft and food delivery company DoorDash have earmarked $90 million for a planned November 2020 ballot initiative that would exempt them from the law.

(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Monday denied a request by Apple Inc (O:AAPL) that it reconsider a decision upholding a finding Apple iPhones infringed VirnetX Holding Corp patents relating to secure communications technology.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit declined to reconsider a split decision it issued on Nov. 22 in the long-running litigation.
In the November ruling, a three-judge panel of the court voided a jury’s calculation that Apple should pay $503 million for infringing VirnetX patents. 
But in a partial victory for VirnetX, the Federal Circuit left in place a Texas jury’s finding that some versions of the iPhone infringed two VirnetX patents, setting the stage for another trial.

Apple had urged all of the judges sitting on the court to reconsider that part of the three-judge panel's decision.

336,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2020 08:10PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Hundreds of Chinese businesses seek billions in loans to contend with coronavirus - sources,"By Cheng Leng, Yingzhi Yang and Ryan Woo
BEIJING (Reuters) - More than 300 Chinese companies are seeking bank loans totaling at least 57.4 billion yuan ($8.2 billion) to help to soften the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, two banking sources said.
Authorities have cordoned off cities, suspended transport links and shuttered facilities where crowds gather, hammering economic growth that one senior economist said could slow to 5% or less in the first quarter. 
Extended factory closures, meanwhile, will slow manufacturing and weigh on global supply chains.
Among the prospective borrowers are food delivery giant  Meituan Dianping  (HK:3690), smartphone maker  Xiaomi  Corp (HK:1810), ride-hailing provider Didi Chuxing Technology Co, facial recognition start-up Megvii Technology Inc and internet security business Qihoo 360 Technology Co, the sources said, adding that the companies seeking loans were either involved in the control of the epidemic or had been hardest hit.
China is fighting to contain the epidemic, which has killed more than 900 people in the country and infected more than 40,000.
The companies seeking loans in the Chinese capital are likely to get fast-track approvals and preferential interest rates, said the sources, who received copies of two lists of company names sent to Beijing banks by the city government's finance bureau.
The two lists also contained the size of loans sought. 
There is no official data showing the total loans Chinese companies are seeking nationwide to weather the outbreak.
""Banks will have the final say on lending decisions,"" one of the sources said. ""The interest rates are likely to be on par with those offered to banks' top clients.""
Xiaomi, the world's fourth-biggest smartphone maker, is seeking 5 billion yuan ($716 million) in loans to produce and sell medical equipment including masks and thermometers, according to the lists.
Meituan Dianping is seeking 4 billion yuan, partly to help finance free food and deliveries to medical staff in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak in central Hubei province.
Privately held Didi Chuxing, ""severely impacted by the virus outbreak"", is seeking 50 million yuan.
FACIAL RECOGNITION
Exchange disclosures showed that Xiaomi's third-quarter revenue growth slowed, but gross profit surged 25.2% year on year to 8.2 billion yuan. Meituan Dianping has been profitable for the past two quarters. 
Beijing-based Qihoo 360 is seeking 1 billion yuan ($143.3 million) to buy medical-related products and finance work on apps to track and contain the virus. 
Facial recognition start-up Megvii applied for 100 million yuan to develop technology including means to improve the accuracy of identifying masked individuals in crowds, according to one of the lists. 
Megvii declined to confirm the loan or the loan application.
Megvii said it is working to optimize the artificial intelligence-enabled body temperature screening product it launched last week to help fight the virus, by spotting and locating people in a crowd who have elevated temperatures, even if they are wearing masks. Megvii does not verify the personal identities of people wearing masks.
Beijing-based Megvii has sought to raise funds through an initial public offering in Hong Kong, but its efforts were initially delayed after its inclusion on a U.S. trade blacklist over alleged involvement in human rights violations related to Beijing's clampdown on Uighurs in China's Xinjiang region. The company has said it ""strongly objected"" to the U.S. move.
Meituan Dianping, Didi and Xiaomi declined to comment. Qihoo 360 did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
The financial bureau of the Beijing city government did not respond to an emailed request for comment.
The finance bureau previously said that businesses seeking financial support could ask for its help. 
Companies on the bureau's lists also include vegetable market operators, ambulance manufacturers, environmental protection firms and other businesses key to maintaining food supplies and supporting efforts to contain the outbreak. But it was not immediately clear if all of them are creditworthy. 
""The banks won't lend to all because they need to evaluate whether those companies are really able to pay back,"" one of the sources said.
China's central bank has injected cash into the banking system to shore up market confidence, while the banking and insurance watchdog has also urged lenders to lower interest rates. 
The local bureaus of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the top economic planner, and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) are also compiling lists of affected companies and offering them support.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Saks Fifth Avenue owner Hudson's Bay Co (TO:HBC) on Monday named a president to lead its off-price business, known as Saks Off 5th, the latest example of a department store chain trying to bolster its outlet stores.
Until now, the discount apparel unit Off 5th was run by the president of the main Saks Fifth Avenue chain. ""We've had mostly department store people running the business,"" Hudson's Bay Co (HBC) Chief Executive Officer Helena Foulkes told Reuters. ""So now it's a chance for people to come in who have real expertise as off-price folks and allow them to take it to the next level.""
Under the watch of Saks Fifth Avenue President Marc Metrick, the Saks Off 5th team has been evolving its buying strategy to be more nimble in terms of its merchandise, according to Foulkes. Going forward though, Off 5th will be led by Paige Thomas, who most recently served as executive vice president and general merchandise manager of Nordstrom's men's and kid's departments. Prior to that, Thomas spent more than five years as executive vice president and general merchandise manager of Nordstrom's off-price ""Rack"" business.
In recent years, several of America's legacy retailers including Saks,  Nordstrom Inc  (N:JWN) and Macy's Inc (N:M), have grown their off-price outlets, once seen as a bargain bin for unsold merchandise, into standalone retail operations to compete with discounters such as  Ross Stores Inc  (O:ROST) and TJX Companies Inc (N:TJX).
But this strategy has come with new risks.
""The department stores are fighting with their feet tied together and one hand tied behind their back as they struggle to deal with the problems of their current business model,"" said Joshua Varghese, a portfolio manager at Signature Global Asset Management, a division of CI Investments, HBC's twelfth-largest shareholder. ""Creating and growing an entire new business while dealing with such large internal challenges will be difficult and costly.""
Hudson's Bay currently operates 114 Saks Off 5th and 41 Saks Fifth Avenue stores. Saks closed 15 Saks Off 5th stores in 2019. ""The company conducted a fleet review to optimize our store footprint and identified the 15 closures,"" an HBC spokeswoman said.
And just last week, Macy's announced it would close 125 of its least productive stores over the next three years and cut more than 2,000 corporate jobs as a part of its cost savings effort.
The Cincinnati, Ohio-based retailer also said that with Backstage and its Bloomingdale's outlets being the ""highlight of the company's performance,"" it would continue to expand Backstage over the next three years. In 2020, the company said it would open an additional 50 Backstage store-within-store locations and seven additional freestanding, off-mall Backstage stores.
Seattle, Washington-based Nordstrom operates 116 full-price stores and 248 off-price shops. In 2018, it opened a total of 12 off-price stores and one full-price store. It closed two full-price stores and no off-price stores.
""I have to say I worry that [off-price retail] becomes the silver bullet at times if your full-price business isn't good,"" said Ron Frasch, the former president at retailer Saks Fifth Avenue as well as its rival Bergdorf Goodman. ""You can see that with the dramatic increase with many of the major players in outlet"" retailing, said Frasch, an operating partner at private equity firm Castanea Partners."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House budget released on Monday proposed cutting funding for the U.S. government-owned passenger rail carrier Amtrak while calling for a significant hike in infrastructure spending and killing a clean energy auto loan program.
The proposal would cut Amtrak funds in fiscal 2021 by more than 50% over 2020 levels. It could cut funds to the congested northeast corridor from $700 million to $325 million and cut long-distance train funds from $1.3 billion to $611 million, then phase out support for Amtrak's long-distance trains.
Democrats are not likely to go along with the proposal, which is similar to cuts that have been rebuffed in prior budgets proposed by the administration of President Donald Trump.
Trump has also sparred with Democratic lawmakers over a $13 billion infrastructure project to build and repair tunnels and bridges in the New York City area known as ""Gateway"" that is critical to Amtrak ridership in the northeast.
In November, Amtrak said it had set records for ridership, revenue, and financial performance for the year ended Sept. 30, 2019, including 32.5 million customer trips, a year-over-year increase of 800,000 passengers.
Amtrak reported a loss of $29.8 million in the year compared with a loss of $170.6 million in the prior fiscal year.
The Trump budget calls for $810 billion in highway, transit, safety and other surface transportation funds and an additional $190 billion for other projects. It does not specify how to pay for the repairs or for funding the projected $261 billion shortfall in the highway trust fund over the next 10 years.
Joel Szabat, a deputy assistant secretary at the Department of Transportation, told reporters on a call the administration was ""committed to working with Congress on a bipartisan basis to find a responsible way of funding"" the shortfall.
Monday's budget again also calls for eliminating an Energy Department clean vehicle loan program that boosted Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, Nissan Motor Co and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co during the last industry downturn, but has not funded a new project in almost a decade.
Start-up Lordstown Motors Chief Executive Steve Burns told Reuters last month the company wanted to apply for a $200 million loan from the program to retool a former General Motors (NYSE:GM) factory in Lordstown, Ohio.
Burns met with Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette for an hour to discuss the proposal last month. Lordstown, which is partially owned by start-up Workhorse Group Inc, said Monday it has not decided whether to apply.
Representative Tim Ryan, an Ohio Democrat, criticized the proposal to kill the Energy Department program.
""This isn’t a hand-out, this is a loan,"" Ryan said.
The budget also again proposes killing the $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit that phases out for each automaker after they sell 200,000 EVs.
The White House blocked an effort in December by congressional Democrats to expand the credit."

341,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2020 05:56PM ET</span>",How Brazil's JBS became collateral damage in war between billionaires,"By Tatiana Bautzer
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - A business dispute between the disgraced billionaire Batista brothers in Brazil and the heir to an Indonesian pulp and paper fortune is throwing a wrench in meatpacker JBS SA’s plans to list its international operations in the United States.
The dispute stems from a 15 billion-real ($3.5 billion) deal in 2017 for Jackson Widjaja, a member of the second-richest family in Indonesia, which Forbes estimates is worth $9.6 billion, to take over Brazilian pulp maker Eldorado Brasil Celulose SA.
Widjaja’s pulp business Paper Excellence agreed to buy Eldorado from J&F Investimentos, the Batistas holding company which also controls JBS. The deal in now in arbitration in Brazil after the two groups could not complete the second stage of the acquisition.
On Monday, J&F accused Paper Excellence of unleashing a lobbying campaign in the United States against the interests of JBS and its large operations there, according to a Brazilian court filing.
J&F said in the filing in a separate civil case in Brazil that Paper Excellence hired lobbyists to argue against JBS getting U.S. subsidies meant for farmers suffering from the fallout of the trade war with China, and successfully persuaded some members of Congress to send letters to the Department of Agriculture to withhold payments to JBS.
The lobbyists also urged investigations into JBS, given the Batista brothers’ confession to bribing almost 2,000 politicians in a Brazilian corruption case, and sought to prevent a U.S. listing by the meatpacker, according to the filing.
In a statement to Reuters, Paper Excellence denied the accusations, and said these are bad faith allegations to ""attack the company, its shareholders and workers.""
The company said it is focused on completing the Eldorado deal.
Even so, court documents, lobbying records and interviews with people on both sides of the dispute show Widjaja’s Paper Excellence lobbied against JBS in the United States following their dispute over the Eldorado deal.
The lobbying has raised pressure on the Batista brothers, who are still waiting for a final decision of Brazil's Supreme Court expected in June on whether their plea deal and immunity from prosecution should be annulled or maintained.
Over the past few months, some lawmakers have written letters to the Trump administration asking for an investigation into JBS and subsidy payments to it. Reuters could not determine whether those letters were a result of lobbying by Paper Excellence.
A JBS executive told Reuters the company is proceeding with its plans to list its international operations in the United States, but without raising new money from investors. The initial IPO plans, drafted four years ago, have failed because of a veto from Brazil's development bank BNDES, and difficult market conditions. BNDES is a shareholder in JBS.
The executive denied that the changes in the listing plans were a result of the lobbying pressure, and said the company expects the transaction in the first half of the year.
JBS declined to comment on the IPO and the U.S. lobbying.
DEAL TURNS SOUTH AT THE RITZ
A turning point in the relationship between Widjaja and the Batistas was an August 2018 meeting. By then, Widjaja had bought 49% of Eldorado and the two sides were meeting at the urging of a Brazilian judge to negotiate terms for the remainder of the business.
At the meeting at the Ritz Carlton hotel in Los Angeles, the Batistas’ representatives said the company's value had changed since they first signed the deal and the price should be higher, if six more months were required to close the deal, according to an audio recording of the meeting reviewed by Reuters. Widjaja can be heard saying the new valuation numbers were ""shocking.""
After the meeting Widjaja told Claudio Cotrim, his top Brazil executive, he would rather ""spend millions on lawyers than give them (Batistas) another cent,"" Cotrim said.
In a statement to Reuters, J&F said it did not ask for additional money within the original contract.
Paper Excellence designed a strategy with three pillars to counter the Batistas once it was clear that there would be litigation, Cotrim said. The first was the arbitration, which should have a decision by August. The second was appointing executives to the board of Eldorado during the arbitration period. The third involved a public relations campaign, with the hiring of PR firms.
Last year, Paper Excellence hired Jeff Miller, a former Republican Florida Congressman, as a lobbyist, according to lobbying reports to Congress filed in 2019.
Although Paper Excellence has no farming activities in the United States, Miller’s firm worked in ""efforts related to subsidies in 2018 farm bill benefiting foreign companies"" and ""USDA trade mitigation benefiting foreign companies,"" according to lobbying records.
Paper Excellence declined to comment on why it hired Miller.
Last month, Miller joined another Washington lobbying firm, Mercury Public Affairs, known for lobbying for companies such as China's ZTE (HK:0763) and firms owned by Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. Mercury said Miller did not bring his contract with Paper Excellence to his new employer.
But since last December, Mercury's co-chairman and former Louisiana senator David Vitter, has been lobbying House congressional aides asking for an investigation of the JBS listing in the United States, alleging potential risk to investors, according to emails reviewed by Reuters and confirmed by Mercury.
In Monday’s court filing, J&F alleged that Mercury was hired indirectly by Paper Excellence but did not offer proof.
Paper Excellence and Mercury deny the allegation."

Investing.com - Slack Technologies (NYSE:WORK) sank in after-hours trading Monday after a company statement soured earlier exuberance about   IBM   (NYSE:IBM) using its work communications and messaging software.
Shares of Slack fell nearly 8% postmarket.
The stock had surged more than 15% in today’s session following a report about  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) switching all its employees to Slack.
Business Insider reported that Dow component IBM will have 350,000 employees using Slack, becoming the company’s biggest customer.
But Slack stock was halted with about 10 minutes to go in trading.
The company then issued an SEC filing after the bell.
“On February 10, 2020, a Business Insider article was published about Slack Technologies,” the company wrote in an 8K filing. The article stated that International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) Corporation (“  IBM  ”) purchased Slack for all of its employees worldwide and further that IBM is Slack’s largest customer to date.”
“IBM has been Slack's largest customer for several years and has expanded its usage of Slack over that time,” the company said. “Slack is not updating its financial guidance for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 or for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020.”
That was enough to temper the enthusiasm about the report as investors tried to lock in earlier profits from the day, sending shares sharply into the red."

The S&P 500 Index rose to a new high Monday, with most sectors advancing. Energy company shares proved the exception, declining as West Texas crude fell below $50 a barrel. Treasuries and European bonds edged higher, and the dollar held steady versus a basket of its major peers.
Asia’s main equity gauges fell everywhere apart from Shanghai. Traders monitored the restart of Chinese factories and the possible chaos that may ensue as several hundred thousand people begin returning to work at companies like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). supplier Foxconn. General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). will restart production in China beginning Feb. 15.
With cases of the coronavirus outside of China on the rise and various companies pulling back from international meetings, investors are trying to figure out whether the rate of contagion is stabilizing. In the meantime, monetary authorities across emerging markets have stepped in to help shore up the financial system. The People’s Bank of China moved to keep liquidity ample Monday through reverse-repurchase agreements.
“As disconcerting as the spread of the coronavirus has been to date, the global focus on the illness is likely to produce a solution to stem its spread before long,” John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer Asset Management, wrote in a note. “Economic data released last week underscored strength and resilience in the U.S. labor market and pointed toward the sustainability of the U.S. economic expansion.”
The euro declined after the region was buffeted by political headlines. German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s succession plan collapsed, and polls put Sinn Fein in place for a possible role in Ireland’s government, depressing the country’s banking stocks. European equities closed higher.

346,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2020 04:37PM ET</span>","Brookfield a potential suitor for Trans Mountain, analyst says","(Reuters) - Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LP could be a potential buyer of the Canadian government-owned Trans Mountain oil pipeline, a Stifel FirstEnergy (NYSE:FE) analyst said, as the project expansion struggles with increasing costs arising from regulatory delays.
In 2018, Ottawa bought the 67-year-old pipeline for C$4.5 billion to ensure expansion proceeded, but has faced opposition by environmental and some indigenous groups.
Brookfield could be a potential ""dark horse"", as it recently completed a $20 billion capital raise, and continues to have excellent access to capital markets, analyst Ian Gillies said in a research note on Monday.
""We would also expect various indigenous groups to pursue acquiring the pipeline"", Gillies wrote, adding that any further cost overruns would make Trans Mountain an unattractive M&A candidate for existing Canadian infrastructure companies.
Trans Mountain and Brookfield were not immediately available for comment.
The expansion of the Trans Mountain oil pipeline is expected to cost C$12.6 billion ($9.46 billion), a sharp increase from a previous estimate, due to court and regulatory delays, rising costs of land, labor and accommodations for indigenous groups who had raised concerns.
Last week Canada's Federal Court of Appeal dismissed a challenge to government approval of the pipeline expansion, clearing some uncertainty from the project.
Toronto-Canada based Brookfield Infrastructure Partners, which engages in the acquisition and management of infrastructure assets, last year bought a number of federally-regulated natural gas gathering and processing assets from pipeline operator Enbridge.
Bloomberg earlier reported that Canada's government will start a new round of consultations aimed at hashing out an agreement between indigenous groups that are competing for a stake in the Trans Mountain pipeline."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closed at record highs on Monday as Chinese workers and factories slowly returned to business following a Lunar New Year holiday that was protracted by the deadly coronavirus outbreak.
All three major U.S. stock averages advanced in a broad-based rally, boosted by index leaders Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.
Worries over the coronavirus kept market participants on edge, with the death toll rising to 908 and the World Health Organization (WHO) warning that new cases outside of China could be ""the spark that becomes a bigger fire.""
But generally upbeat earnings, positive economic data and China's recent stimulus have attracted buyers to the U.S. equities market. 
""The money that China injected into its economy is finding its way around the world and you have a ""buy anything and everything' mentality,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. ""It's an index buy and it's growth verses value.""

348,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2020 04:19PM ET</span>",Transportation Department IG to audit FAA pilot training requirements after Boeing 737 MAX crashes,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Transportation Department's Office of Inspector General said on Monday it will audit Federal Aviation Administration pilot training requirements for U.S. and foreign air carriers after two deadly crashes of Boeing's (N:BA) 737 MAX.
The audit will also review international civil aviation authorities’ requirements for carriers' pilot training regarding the use of flight deck automation.
Pilots have been harshly critical of Boeing's decision not to disclose details of a new automation system - known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS - that has been linked to both fatal crashes.
The Inspector General cited a report by Indonesia's Lion Air that ""responses to erroneous activations of MCAS contributed to the crash, raising international concerns about the role of pilot training.""
The report said Boeing’s safety assessment assumed pilots would respond within three seconds of a system malfunction. But on the fatal flight and one that experienced the same problem the previous evening, it took both crews about eight seconds to respond.
Boeing declined to comment on the new review.
Boeing has proposed new simulator training for pilots on a series of scenarios before they are allowed to resume 737 MAX flights.
The MAX is not expected to be freed to fly until late April at the earliest. In March, the department's IG said it would audit the FAA's certification of the Boeing 737 MAX.
The Trump administration on Monday proposed an additional $30 million in it 2021 budget ""to improve aviation oversight, following recommendations from the Boeing 737 MAX investigations.""
The funding would support 13 new full-time positions for the creation of an office mandated by Congress to oversee the FAA's delegation of some certification tasks to Boeing and other planemakers. The FAA would also use some of the funds for data collection and for ""technological advances that we use to assess safety data,"" Deputy FAA Administrator Dan Elwell said."

Investing.com – The S&P and Nasdaq made a positive start to the week on Monday, closing at record highs as strong gains for mega-cap tech stocks overshadowed concerns about the coronavirus impact.
The S&P 500 rose 0.7%, Nasdaq Composite added 1.1% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.55%.
The World Health Organization’s Dr. Sylvia Briand told reporters the coronavirus produces mild cold symptoms in about 80% of the cases seen so far, with just 15% of those infected ending up with pneumonia and 3% to 5% of patients needing intensive care.
The world health watchdog did expressed concerns, however, about new cases of the virus emerging outside mainland China, which it warned could be a ""spark that becomes a bigger fire.""
Recent economic data, including the better-than-expected U.S. jobs report last week, has underpinned investor hopes that the economy would be able to withstand the fallout from the virus, with some betting that central banks will act in the event of a prolonged outbreak.
""We expect the novel coronavirus to have a negative impact on the overall Chinese economy, and, potentially slowing China's GDP growth by 100-to-200 basis points in the first quarter of the year,"" DA Davidson said.
But ""based on the SARS impact in 2003, we believe that economic growth will rebound rapidly, after the nCoV outbreak is contained,"" the firm added.
The virus outbreak aside, tech stocks reigned on Wall Street, with Nvidia, in particular, rallying ahead of its earnings due Thursday. 
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) jumped 4.5%, buoyed by a price upgrade from RBC to $301 From $258.
""We raise our estimates on NVDA as we think the January quarter will come in a bit ahead of the high-end of guide due to better than expected gaming and data center demand,"" RBC said in a note.
A rise in consumer discretionary, led by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and L Brands (NYSE:LB), also played a role in a broad-based move higher.
L Brands closed more than 2% higher as the company is reportedly nearing a deal to sell Victoria's Secret to private equity company Sycamore Partners.
Elsewhere, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) pared some gains, but ended the day 3% higher after the electric automaker restarted production at its China factory after operations were disrupted by the coronavirus outbreak.
Slack Technologies (NYSE:WORK) jumped 15.6% on a report that  IBM  is switching to its workplace messaging and communications software. The stock gave back some gains post-market after the company downplayed the report, leaving its guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter unchanged.
Slack also clarified that  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) has been its largest customer for several years and has expanded its usage of the messaging platform over that time. 
 
 
Energy stocks proved an exception to the rally not least because oil prices continued to decline on concerns about the impact of the coronavirus on Chinese oil demand."

“We made the difficult but necessary decision to reduce staff working in unprofitable areas of the firm,” Tom Becker, an outside spokesman for the firm, said in an emailed statement. He declined to discuss the number of jobs cut or teams affected, but said the company has about 100 employees. As many as 25 workers were cut, a mix of traders and support staff, said a person with knowledge of the matter.
The reduction follows the decision by another Chicago-based high-speed firm, XR Trading, to let about 10% of its staff go late last year. Low volatility has made for a tough environment for many high-frequency traders, as they rely on price movements to allow them to buy and sell futures and other assets throughout the day.
Allston, founded by futures traders Bob Jordan, Elrick Williams (NYSE:WMB) and John Harada, uses its own money rather than customer funds, and is active in futures, cash currencies, commodities and fixed-income assets, according to records maintained by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
While closely held Allston keeps a low profile, it has made headlines in recent years. Chopper Trading sued Allston last year, saying it engaged in spoofing in U.S. Treasury futures markets, a type of manipulation that involves entering fake orders to move prices. Chopper alleged that Allston engaged in spoofing from 2012 to 2015. In May, Allston filed a motion asking the court to compel arbitration and, should that not be granted, to dismiss the suit because it said Chopper had missed the window of opportunity to file a claim. The case is ongoing.
The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, in 2015, began an investigation into Allston for alleged market manipulation, a person familiar with the matter said at the time. The regulator subpoenaed CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) for information related to Allston, the person said. Through an arbitration process at CME, Allston was accused by a rival the year before of misleading competitors through spoofing. Allston said then it had done nothing wrong.
Becker declined to comment on the CFTC investigation.
“Our decision to focus the firm’s technology resources in more promising areas of our business is unrelated to any regulatory or compliance considerations,” Becker said in the statement."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian regulators plan to introduce mandatory stress tests soon that will look at the impact of climate change on banks, insurers and the A$3 trillion ($2 trillion) pension fund industry, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
The tests, to be based on measures being developed in England, have been in the works for some time but their introduction has been hastened after a devastating bushfire season, one of the sources said.
Economists expect recent bushfires to drag on gross domestic product growth by 0.1-0.4 percentage points through March 2020, with agriculture, retail, tourism and construction the hardest hit.
As part of the stress test, banks will be required to run risk assessments for their loan books and business models under various climate scenarios, the people said, declining to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to media.
The Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulatory Authority (APRA) said that the development of a climate-change stress test was a key measure as it boosts scrutiny of how financial institutions manage their climate risks.
""We intend to release a letter to the industry outlining the next phase of our regulatory response to climate risk in a few weeks,"" an APRA spokesman told Reuters on Monday.
Australian banks have already started taking steps to combat the effects of climate change on their business models.
Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA), the nation's No.1 lender, and Westpac (AX:WBC) are performing climate change scenario analyses on their portfolios.
ANZ has said its focus area for the coming financial year would include climate-related risk governance and stress testing of selected portfolios. The banks have also pledged to reduce exposure to high carbon sectors such as coal.
It is not clear if banks will be required to publicly disclose results of the stress tests mandated by APRA.
In December, the Bank of England (BoE) said Britain's top banks and insurers should be tested together for the first time in 2021 to quantify the potential financial damage from climate change.
The BoE chairs an international group of regulators that is developing a global climate stress test. It is expected Australia's test will be based on this."

Investing.com - Nvidia surged Monday after receiving a vote of confidence from Wall Street ahead of its earnings due later this week.
RBC raised its price target on Nvidia to a Street-high $301 from $251, representing about a 15% upside from current prices. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) rose 4%.
""We raise our estimates on Nvidia as we think the Jan-quarter will come in a bit ahead of the high-end of guide due to better than expected gaming and data center demand. That said, we do not see a change to seasonal patterns for April due to macro concerns,"" RBC said.
The bank, citing recent checks, is betting that both gaming and data center demand came in better than expected when compared consensus estimates and believes that operating margins will improve to more than 40% by mid-year 2020.
RBC raised its revenue estimate on Nvidia's gaming business, which drives the bulk of growth, to $1.56 billion, above current consensus of $1.51 billion and forecasts the data center business to generate $880 million, above the Street's $830 million consensus estimate.
""Overall, our checks suggest the holiday season for Nvidia was better than expected and data center demand is improving,"" RBC said.
The upbeat note comes amid increasing confidence that the headwinds for the company over the past year (including weaker demand for graphic card sales, following a glut in inventory, and data center products) have faded somewhat.
Both Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) reported strong quarters for their respective data-center businesses, suggesting recent optimism over data sales is not without merit.

Having secured nearly 60% of Osram's shares in December, taking on debt of 4.4 billion euros ($4.8 billion) to finance the deal, AMS gained shareholder approval for a 1.7 billion euro capital increase to help to fund the acquisition of the much bigger German group.
A domination and profit and loss transfer agreement (DPLTA) would give AMS full say over Osram's finances and allow it to consolidate the company's cash flow.
To clinch the agreement AMS Chief Executive Alexander Everke needs approval from 75% of Osram investors at an extraordinary shareholder meeting.
""We intend to implement a DPLTA to enable both companies to work together and realize our joint strategic vision of creating a global leader in sensor solutions and photonics in an efficient manner,"" AMS Chief Executive Alexander Everke said in a statement on Monday.
Until now AMS has told investors there might be a way to pay back debt and achieve targeted integration benefits of 300 million euros ($327 million), though analysts have been skeptical.
The Austrian company would have to offer the remaining minority investors two alternatives: either pay them an annual guaranteed dividend or a cash settlement.
AMS reports fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday."

According to company files released on Monday, de Meo, a former Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) Seat brand executive, will this year receive a fixed compensation of 1.3 million euros, an annual variable remuneration that can amount up to 150 percent of the fixed compensation and 75,000 Renault shares.
His predecessor, Thierry Bollore, was granted, respectively, 900,000 euros, a maximum variable compensation of 125 percent and 50,000 shares.
Renault named Luca de Meo, who will start on July 1, at the end of last month, as the car maker looks to draw a line under a year of turmoil by finalizing a long-awaited management shake-up."

Henan Governor Yin Hong inspected the site on Monday to assess the company’s virus-prevention measures as workers went back to work after an extended holiday, according to the Chinese Communist Party city committee in Zhengzhou.
Yet just the day before, Foxconn told some workers that it was postponing the resumption of production and wouldn’t be able to decide on a back-to-work date for the site “until further notice,” according to a version of an internal message reviewed by Bloomberg News. The site is one of many run by the iDPBG business unit, which makes gadgets for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). at a factory in Zhengzhou in central China and two other plants in Shenzhen. It’s not clear how many employees received the message and whether other workers were summoned back.
Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., declined to comment on the message and said on Monday its factories will comply with government requirements and resume output in an “orderly manner” by staggering the return of workers.
The rapid change in developments highlights the fluidity in responses by local governments and companies as they seek to contain the coronavirus while minimizing economic impact. Foxconn has told employees at its southern Shenzhen headquarters not to return to work after the extended Lunar New Year break ended Feb. 10, according to a memo obtained by Bloomberg.
Not all of its employees returned to their hometowns for the holiday break so there are still some available workers on production sites, according to people familiar with the plant operations, though it’s unclear how many.
The unit could also struggle to hire back workers after the holiday period. A recruitment app for iDPBG shows that two of its plants in Shenzhen had received only 800 applications from former workers as of Monday morning. The facilities are seeking as many as 3,000 ex-workers.
Apple and Foxconn were among the first corporations to try and quantify the epidemic’s impact. Hon Hai slashed its 2020 outlook last week, anticipating disruptions to Apple’s carefully calibrated production chain as well as weaker consumer demand and overall economic growth. As China’s largest private employer and a key partner to many of the world’s most recognizable consumer brands, Foxconn has become a high-profile symbol of how the outbreak is disrupting Chinese manufacturing and the world’s supply of electronics.

Investing.com – Slack Technologies (NYSE:WORK) jumped sharply Monday on a report that   IBM   (NYSE:IBM) is switching to its workplace messaging and communications software.
The stock popped 14% in afternoon trading.
Dow component IBM will have 350,000 employees using Slack, becoming the company’s biggest customer, Business Insider reported.
The stock has been getting votes of confidence from Wall Street of late.
Last week RBC capital markets initiated coverage of the stock with an outperform rating and a price target of $25.
“While the simplistic take on Slack is that it is ‘just another workplace chat tool,’ we believe that the vision around becoming the primary system of engagement for all employees inside (and increasingly outside) an organization creates a positive data feedback loop (more engagement - more data - more insights to drive better results - more engagement) and significant long-term value,” RBC analyst Alex Zukin wrote in an note, according to Briefing.com.
Also last week, Robert W. Baird put the stock on its Fresh Pick list."

The decision was made by the management board and approved by a committee of the supervisory board, the German bank said.
Deutsche Bank's decision to issue AT1 securities will soothe investor worries over an existing U.S. dollar contingent convertible (CoCo) instrument that is redeemable in April this year.
AT1 securities are a type of CoCo instrument, which were designed in the wake of the financial crisis to try to ensure investors, rather than taxpayers, would be on the hook if a bank runs into financial difficulties.
While CoCo debt is perpetual by nature, banks almost always redeem them when the first ""call"" date comes due, or risk stoking speculation over their cash and solvency position.
Speculation was rife over whether or not Deutsche Bank would redeem the CoCo bond given its recent travails.
The German bank's decision comes at a time when the market for CoCo bonds has arguably never been better, with several Italian banks tapping that market more expected."

The company last week raised 15 million reais ($3.48 million) to finance solar power projects. A small amount of the proceeds, 100,000 reais, will be used to finance a course aimed at teaching emotional intelligence to 600 students in the city of Pirapora, in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais.
The 10-year bond will pay investors inflation plus 5.45% annually.
Moody's expects green, social and sustainable bond issuance to jump 24% worldwide this year, to $400 billion, as a growing number of investors start to integrate environmental, social and governance metrics to their portfolios.
""Faro could have issued a traditional bond, but we wanted it to bring impact to the region where our solar plants are,"" Faro's Brazilian unit Chief Executive Officer Pedro Mateus said. Projects developed by Faro in Brazil are able to produce 222,000 MWh/year.

Investing.com – Wall Street rebounded from early weakness on Monday, led by a surge in tech stocks, though concerns about the risk to global growth from the coronavirus kept a lid on gains.
The S&P 500 rose 0.30%, Nasdaq Composite added 0.64% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.20%.
With the death toll from the coronavirus rising to 909, and new cases of the virus emerging in France and the U.K., the World Health Organization warned that a rise in cases outside of China could be the ""spark that becomes a bigger fire"".
But U.S stocks turned positive as investors continued to bet the economy will remain resilient in the wake of the last week's better-than-expected jobs report.
""We expect the novel coronavirus to have a negative impact on the overall Chinese economy, and, potentially slowing China's GDP growth by 100-to-200 basis points in the first quarter of the year,"" DA Davidson said.
But ""based on the SARS impact in 2003, we believe that economic growth will rebound rapidly, after the nCoV outbreak is contained,"" the firm added.
The rebound on Wall Street was led by tech stocks, with chip stocks, in particular, racking up sharp gains for the day.
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) surged 4% ahead of its earnings due Thursday, buoyed by a price target boost from RBC to $301 From $258.
""We raise our estimates on NVDA as we think the January quarter will come in a bit ahead of the high-end of guide due to better-than-expected gaming and data center demand,"" RBC said in a note.
A rise in consumer discretionary, led by Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), also supported sentiment on stocks.
Energy stocks, however, kept the broader-market advance in check as oil prices continued to fall on concerns about the impact of the coronavirus on oil demand.
Elsewhere, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) pared some gains, but was up 1% after the electric automaker reportedly restarted production at its China factory."
364,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2020 01:19PM ET</span>",Amazon wants Trump to testify on ‘order to screw Amazon’ in Pentagon deal,"By David Shepardson and Nandita Bose
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Amazon Web Services said on Monday it was seeking to depose President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Mark Esper in its lawsuit over whether the president was trying ""to screw Amazon"" when the Pentagon awarded a contract for cloud computing to rival  Microsoft Corp . (O:MSFT)
The Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) unit alleged that Trump, who has publicly derided Amazon head Jeff Bezos and repeatedly criticized the company, exerted undue influence on the decision to deny it the $10 billion contract.
Known as the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud, or JEDI, the contract is intended to give the military better access to data and technology from remote locations.
In the lawsuit, Amazon said it seeks discovery ""demonstrating exactly how President Trump's order to 'screw Amazon' was carried out during the decision making process.""
Without this, ""the Court cannot objectively and fully evaluate AWS's credible and well-grounded allegations about bias and bad faith,"" the lawsuit said.
Bezos also owns the Washington Post, whose coverage has been critical of Trump.
Along with Trump and Esper, Amazon seeks to depose former Defense Secretary James Mattis, Pentagon chief information officer Dana Deasy and four other procurement officials, court records show. 
An Amazon spokesperson said that ""President Trump has repeatedly demonstrated his willingness to use his position as President and Commander in Chief to interfere with government functions – including federal procurements – to advance his personal agenda. 
""The question is whether the President of the United States should be allowed to use the budget of the DoD to pursue his own personal and political ends,"" the spokesperson added.
The lawsuit also says Amazon's protest against the decision occurs against the background of impeachment, ""which is grounded in the President's repeated refusal to separate his personal interests from the national interest."" President Trump has been acquitted on impeachment charges by the Republican-controlled Senate.
The lawsuit also mentions other instances of alleged interference from Trump.
For example, his alleged interference in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' award of a $400 million border wall contract to Fisher Industries in December 2019 and a report that Trump intervened in the General Services Administration’s solicitation of bids to move the FBI's headquarters to a new campus in the suburbs.
The current FBI offices are near a Washington hotel owned by Trump's company.
The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The White House declined to comment.
Last month, Amazon filed a motion in court to delay the Department of Defense deal with Microsoft until a court rules on its protest of the contract award.

The procurement process has been delayed by legal complaints and conflict of interest allegations. Esper has denied there was bias and said the Pentagon made its choice fairly and freely without external influence.

367,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2020 12:36PM ET</span>","UniCredit confirms 6,000 Italy job cuts as union talks begin","By Gianluca Semeraro
MILAN (Reuters) - UniCredit confirmed plans to cut 6,000 jobs in Italy over the next four years as the country's biggest bank began the negotiation process with unions on Monday over layoffs and branch closures.
In December UniCredit (MI:CRDI) unveiled a new plan to 2023, under which it would cut 8,000 jobs and close 500 branches, angering Italian unions, which said then that they expected 5,500 layoffs in Italy and up to 450 branch closures.
In a letter to unions, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, the bank said that there would be 5,500 cuts in Italy under the new plan, plus a further 500 that it has yet to deliver under its previous plan to 2019.
The Milan-based lender, which also confirmed the 450 planned branch closures in the letter, declined to comment.
""UniCredit continues to have an unacceptable attitude,"" Lando Maria Sileoni, head of Italy's biggest banking union FABI, said in statement that also called for fresh recruitment to offset some of the layoffs.
The UniCredit letter said that the bank wanted to find ""shared solutions"" and pointed to early retirement for staff close to pension age - the solution favored by Italian banks.
The government has also been following the situation and Labour Minister Nunzia Catalfo on Monday said that UniCredit's top managers have been summoned for talks on Feb. 21.
UniCredit has undergone a major restructuring under French Chief Executive Jean Pierre Mustier, who was hired 2016 to turn it around and tackle concerns about its weak capital base.
To strengthen the balance sheet, Mustier has cut costs, dumped bad debts and shed assets. He also raised 13 billion euros ($14 billion) by selling new shares to investors.
Mustier's first business plan, dubbed Transform 2019, envisaged a total of 14,000 job cuts.
In a sign his strategy is on track, UniCredit in December said it would improve shareholder returns through dividends and a share buyback.
Last week the bank said it was considering lifting the capital distribution further after meeting its profit goal.
UniCredit's letter also said that revenue trends would never return to levels reached before the global financial crisis, pointing to the challenge posed by negative interest rates and competition from non-banking players.
UniCredit said it had to bring down costs to be able to provide services at a competitive price to customers who were increasingly switching to digital channels.
It said it had recorded more than 300 million transactions on non-traditional channels in the past 12 months, while those carried out in a branch were down 55% on 2016 levels."

Investing.com – Delivery giant FedEx (NYSE:FDX) rose Monday as Wall Street applauded its decision to further integrate its Express and Ground units announced last week.
Shares of FedEx rose 1.8% in midday trading.
FedEx said its subsidiary Express would use fellow subsidiary FedEx (NYSE:FDX) Ground to help deliver time-sensitive e-commerce packages.
Following this decision, which helped shared jump Friday, UBS upgraded the stock to buy from neutral today.
Analyst Thomas Wadewitz raised his price target on the stock to $181 from $167 per share, estimating cost savings could reach $600 million a year.
“FedEx’s move to hand off delivery of a significant portion -- we estimate 60% --of its residential Express packages to the Ground network for delivery is likely to drive significant cost savings,” Wadewitz wrote in a note, according to Barron’s.
Of 28 analysts covering the stock, 13 have a buy rating on the stock, 14 are neutral and there is one sell rating, according to Investing.com.

MILAN (Reuters) - Investment group Exor (MI:EXOR) will have around $13 billion in cash provided it closes a deal to sell its reinsurance unit PartnerRe and it would spend most of that on acquisitions, a source close to the matter told Reuters.
The holding group of Italy's Agnelli family, which also controls  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA), said on Sunday it was in exclusive talks to sell PartnerRe to France's Covea.
The deal could be worth around $9 billion in cash and drove shares in Exor up by more than 5% on Monday to an all-time high.
Exor, led by Agnelli scion John Elkann, bought the Bermuda-based reinsurer in 2016 for $6.9 billion after a hostile takeover battle with  Axis Capital . (N:AXS)
Analysts at Mediobanca calculated PartnerRe represents about 28% of Exor's total assets.
The source, who declined to be named, said Exor would use the cash from any ParnerRe sale mainly for acquisitions.
The cash would be in addition to the 3.6 billion euros ($3.9 billion) Elkann said last November the group would have by 2022 to spend on acquisitions.
That sum includes a planned special dividend of around 1.6 billion euros from the merger between Fiat Chrysler (FCA) and French rival  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP).
An analyst at  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) said on Monday the ParnerRe deal could also pave the way for a potential extraordinary pay-out to Exor shareholders, but the source said Exor planned to focus on acquisitions.
Money from a completed PartnerRe deal would only be received around the end of this year, the source said, adding the group would consider carefully before spending it.
""Exor is not a fund that needs to give a yield to subscribers every year. It wants to take time to pick the best investment options,"" the source said.
""It wants to avoid being offered over-priced assets simply because people know they're sitting on loads of cash"".
In November, Elkann said Exor had not yet decided which sectors might interest the company, but said he saw the group ""buying new companies in the future"".
Besides FCA, Exor's assets include controlling stakes in luxury carmaker  Ferrari  (MI:RACE), industrial vehicle manufacturer  CNH Industrial  (MI:CNHI) and Italian Serie A soccer team Juventus (MI:JUVE).
It also has a 43% stake in publishing group The Economist."

(Reuters) - Xerox (NYSE:XRX) Holdings Corp raised its offer to buy HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) by $2 to $24 per share on Monday, following several rejections of its previous buyout offer by the PC maker.
Xerox said its latest offer comprises $18.40 in cash and 0.149 Xerox shares for each HP share — valuing the company at about $35 billion — and that it plans to launch a tender offer on or around March 2. 
HP shares rose nearly 3% to $22.31, while Xerox was up about 1%.
The U.S. printer maker first made a $33.5 billion cash-and-stock offer for HP, a company more than three times its size, in November. HP's board had then rejected the offer, saying it significantly undervalued the company.
""This bid increase puts more pressure on Xerox to extract costs as a combined entity. I'd look for HP to question the economics of the synergies after Xerox raising their bid,"" Morningstar analyst Mark Cash said. 
Xerox said last month it planned to nominate 11 independent candidates to HP's board and that it had secured $24 billion in financing for the offer.
The company also expects its proposed acquisition to result in sales growth of as much as $1.5 billion for the combined company, according to a presentation by Xerox in December.
Some Wall Street analysts have said a merger would help the companies in a declining printing market, while others have cited challenges to integration, given their different offerings and pricing models.
""While we believe the printing market is ripe for consolidation, we question why Xerox would want to acquire one of the largest players in a slowing computer market,"" Cash said. 
In December, activist investor Carl Icahn, who has a 4.2% stake in HP and a 10.9% stake in Xerox, urged HP shareholders who had agreed to the merger to reach out to the PC maker's directors for immediate action.

HP did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Green activists from the campaign groups Extinction Rebellion and Fridays for Future managed to enter the building and to reach the fourth floor, where they graffitied walls.
""This company has a lot of influence in many sectors and we are trying to convey what we are asking for, we want to change this capitalistic system"", Emilia, a 15-year-old Fridays for Future group member, said.
Activists wrote tags such as ""I want to live"" or ""Murderers"" on the walls and blocked the entrance with ropes and rolling office cabinets before riot police arrived.
""We condemn in the strongest possible terms the violent intrusion and acts of vandalism in our offices,"" BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), the world's biggest asset manager, said in a statement.
BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink warned company boards in January to step up efforts to tackle climate change or face increased wrath from investors concerned about the impact of unsustainable business practices on their future wealth.
In his annual letter to CEOs, Fink said his firm would exit investments that presented high sustainability-related risk, including thermal coal producers, as it participated in what he described as a ""fundamental reshaping of finance"".
Extinction Rebellion last month targeted energy group Royal Dutch Shell's (L:RDSa) headquarters in The Hague and McKinsey & Co's London office, and staged a demonstration at a Brussels car show at which 185 protesters were detained.

375,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 10, 2020 11:09AM ET</span>",Muddy Waters's FTSE 100 Target Has a Credibility Problem,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- When short-sellers such as Muddy Waters Capital LLC accuse listed companies of balance sheet manipulation, the target typically responds with their own lengthy rebuttal. Other investors caught in the middle often don’t know what to think and so a lot depends on the board’s credibility and transparency.
NMC Health Plc, the subject of Muddy Waters’s latest attack, is now a little short of both.
On Monday, the United Arab Emirates’ hospital operator and member of the FTSE 100, admitted that it doesn’t know how much of the company its major shareholders actually own. (This is separate to the Muddy Waters allegations, which focused on  the asset values, debt and cash balances that NMC reports, as well as governance issues).
Founder and chairman Bavaguthu Raghuram Shetty is conducting a legal review to verify the size of his stake and that of two other Emirati controlling shareholders. These may have been “incorrectly reported historically to the company and the market,” NMC said in a statement.
The details are complicated, but the upshot is that Shetty and vice chairman Khaleefa Butti Omair Yousif Ahmed Al Muhairi must absent themselves from board discussions until their holdings and any “security arrangements” are clarified, and until the board decides whether they should remain directors.  
The concern is that some of the shares may have been pledged as collateral and could be sold by financial institutions without prior approval from the shareholder, whoever that turns out to be.
Such worries may have merit. The stock has plunged 70% since Muddy Waters published its report in December. Share sales by major holders who’ve needed to settle margin calls on loans might have contributed to the rout.
Needless to say this is pretty embarrassing for NMC who accused Muddy Waters in December of issuing “false and misleading” research. Now, in one respect, the company has had to admit that its own disclosures to the market were false and misleading, albeit for reasons beyond its direct control.
The best hope now for long-suffering minority shareholders is that someone comes along and makes an offer for the healthcare operator. In a separate and rather fortuitously timed statement, NMC confirmed on Monday that it had received “highly preliminary” approaches from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co LP and GK Investment Holding Group SA.
NMC was worth about 8.5 billion pounds ($11 billion) at the share price peak in 2018 so it’s not surprising the company has drawn takeover interest now that it’s capitalized at just 1.6 billion pounds. NMC’s valuation — less than 7 times estimated earnings — is pretty undemanding for a healthcare stock; even one that’s subject to those Muddy Waters claims of balance sheet manipulation, which it denies. The shares rose 7% on Monday, a surprisingly decent outcome given the embarrassing share ownership revelations.
However, potential bidders will still have concerns about how to conduct due diligence on a company that’s accused of being less than candid. The findings of an independent review of those Muddy Waters allegations by former Federal Bureau of Investigations director Louis Freeh aren’t yet known.
The boilerplate caveat accompanying NMC’s regulatory announcement that “there can no certainty that any offer will be made for the company”, or at what price, seems more pertinent than usual."
376,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2020 10:47AM ET</span>",YOUR MONEY: Family offices lead the way on impact investing,"By Beth Pinsker
NEW YORK (Reuters) - When former investment manager Ron Cordes started a charitable foundation in 2007, he got frustrated because he could only ""do good"" when he was actively giving the money away to needy causes. 
Then Cordes discovered impact investing. ""We became passionate about sustainability,"" he told Reuters. 
At first, the Cordes Foundation allocated 20% of its $10 million endowment to private equity investments aimed to make a beneficial social or environmental impact. Today, all of the foundation's assets are invested in projects that promote the family's values, including ethical fashion brands and sustainable supply chains. 
""There are real investing opportunities with impact. It's not about disguised philanthropy,"" said Cordes, who made his fortune primarily after he sold his firm AssetMark (N:AMK) in 2006. 
For impact investors like Cordes, whose foundation is based in Maryland, financial gains are critical, but social returns are equally important.
More than a quarter of family foundations are now engaged in impact investing in some form, according to a 2019 Global Family Office report from UBS and Campden Research. The average wealth of the families UBS surveyed was $1.2 billion. 
Climate change was the top cause supported by family offices, according to UBS, with health and clean water ranking high. 
With so much capital involved, family offices - which can be managed privately or within a brokerage firm - rank with pension funds and institutional investors in the impact world. They might even be more important because they have the funds as well as the flexibility to make innovative investing decisions. 
""If some family is into renewable energy, they don’t have to ask 15 people where they can invest,"" said Shawn Lesser, co-founder and managing partner of Big Path Capital, an impact investing firm. 
The push to make investment decisions with an impact is driven by a younger generation, but that does not mean it is exclusively a millennial pursuit. 
Jennifer Kenning, co-founder and CEO of Align (NASDAQ:ALGN) Impact, an investment management firm, said her oldest investor is 99 and she has other clients driving investments who are in their 80s. ""We have investors across four generations,"" Kenning said. 
The key for baby boomers and the generation that precedes them is to make sure everyone is speaking the same language. 
""If you show them they can make money, they start to see we're talking about the same thing,"" Kenning said. 
For younger family members like Cordes (who technically is a baby boomer at 60), what is key is aligning investing with the values of the family. For Cordes, that has involved the Grassroots Business Fund and Women's World Banking, non-profits that focus on developing economies. 
""A lot of foundations have a grant side where they give to environmental causes, but on the asset side, they are invested in big oil. Families are saying that doesn’t make any sense,"" said Michael Whelchel, the other co-founder and managing partner of Big Path Capital. ""So they say, 'Let’s have a double bang for our buck.' ""
PROOF IN PERFORMANCE 
Want proof that impact investing can pay off? Ask the folks who put money into  Beyond Meat Inc  (O:BYND) through ImpactAssets, a fund that aggregates charitable investment accounts, known as donor advised funds. Beyond Meat's initial public offering in May 2019 sizzled (https://reut.rs/2O7QkDC). 
""We got a lot of attention from that, because we were an early investor, and it was such a high-flying and attention-getting IPO,"" said Tim Freundlich, CEO of ImpactAssets. ""But it's just one piece of the evolving narrative here.""
ImpactAssets participates in 675 private debt and equity investments, making three new deals a week, Freundlich said. In contrast, most venture funds only do about 20 deals in a year. 
The fund's minimum investment is only $5,000, but most family offices are putting in $100,000 or more at a time.
With financial powerhouses like Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) jumping big into sustainable investing (https://reut.rs/38QWC26), Align Impact's Kenning thinks the next step is for more families to come together to push a broad agenda for societal good.
""Our climate issues are pretty substantial. What we do over the next decade matters,"" Kenning said.

377,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 10, 2020 10:23AM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Drifts Lower at Open; Virus Delays China Restart,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Wall Street edged higher at the opening on Monday, reversing earlier losses on continued fears about the impact of the coronavirus on the world economy, amidst reports that China’s factories were slow to return to work after a lengthy and enforce New Year holiday.
By 10:20 AM ET (1520 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 80 points or 0.3%, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were both up 0.4%, all seemingly content to await congressional testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday and Wednesday before committing to any bigger moves.
Uncertainty was the watchword on Monday, owing to the difficulty of forming a coherent picture of how quickly China’s factories and shops can return to anything like their pre-holiday level of activity.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, for example, fell 0.6% amid conflicting reports about the reopening of factories belonging to Hon Hai Precision – also known as Foxconn – where the bulk of iPhones are made.
Reuters reported that Foxconn had reopened factories with staffing levels at around 10% of normal, while Bloomberg reported that the company had sent a message to staff on its internal app saying that it couldn’t give a date for the resumption of production.
Market research firm Trendforce said on Monday it had cut its forecast for iPhone production by about 10% to 41 million handsets for the three months through March. The only bright spot for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is that the first quarter of the calendar year is in any case normally the slowest.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock leaped 4.9% but was off intraday highs after a highly speculative analysis in Forbes touting a possible takeover by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Additionally, initial enthusiasm about the partial reopening of its Shanghai plant gave way to the realization that production – and cash flow – may take weeks if not months to ramp up fully. Reports suggested that the ramp up at Tesla and elsewhere will be delayed by the quarantining of laborers who return from holidays from other parts of the country.
Chinese state media on Monday ran an interview with a leading local virologist suggesting that the incubation period for the coronavirus could be as much as 24 days, rather than the 14 reported hitherto.
Elswhere among individual stocks on Monday, struggling mall operator Taubman Centers stock rose 53% after rival Simon Property (NYSE:SPG) offered to buy one-third of the Taubman family stake in a deal that values the group at $3.6 billion including debt. The deal still needs approval from Taubman’s free shareholders.
  Exxon Mobil   (NYSE:XOM) stock dipped back towards a new 10-year low again as U.S. crude futures tumbled below $50 a barrel again on growing fears that OPEC and its ally Russia aren’t acting to stop a new glut forming on world markets as Chinese demand collapses.
Stocks also came under pressure from the strengthening dollar, which hit its highest level since October against developed-market peers, including a four-month high against the euro.
A stronger dollar not only reduces the value of U.S. companies’ export earnings, it also tends to tighten financing conditions for the world economy, as dollar-denominated debt becomes more difficult for foreign companies and governments to service."

Claure said no members and employees have been infected in the recent outbreak. 
The death toll from the epidemic rose to 908, all but two in mainland China, on Sunday, with total infections at 40,171. 
Claure also disputed reports that WeWork founder Adam Neumann walked away with a $1.7-billion payout to relinquish control of the company he founded in 2010.
""There's a tender going on right now in which Adam will have the right to participate with shareholders,"" Claure, a top SoftBank executive, said. 
SoftBank Group Corp said in October it would launch a $9.5-billion bailout of WeWork following the cancellation of the startup's initial public offering due to investor concerns over its corporate governance.
The bailout included a $3-billion tender offer of WeWork shares, including up to $970 million owned by Neumann. The tender offer is expected to be completed soon. 
""He's (Neumann) a large shareholder of the company, he was a founder, and as we do a tender to buy shares from other shareholders, he's going to have the same opportunity as any other shareholder,"" said Claure.

He reiterated that WeWork aims to be profitable in 2021.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Carlos Ghosn, the fugitive former auto executive, used a joint venture between Nissan and Mitsubishi to inflate his pay, effectively clawing back a cut to his declared wages, and to cover a personal tax debt, lawyers for the firms said on Monday. 
Ghosn, former chairman of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance, was arrested in Japan in 2018 on financial misconduct charges but fled to Lebanon last December.
He has denied any wrong-doing, including concerning the way he was compensated, and has since launched court cases against the companies, arguing he was fired unlawfully. One of the cases is in the Netherlands, where the Japanese companies made new submissions on Monday.
Ghosn granted himself a salary and bonus worth 7.3 million euros ($8 million) in total without the knowledge of the boards of Nissan (T:7201) and Mitsubishi (T:7211), the lawyers said. 
The companies had previously challenged these payments. 
The lawyers alleged in the arguments submitted to the Dutch court that Ghosn had awarded himself that compensation through the Nissan-Mitsubishi joint venture to offset a cut in his publicly-declared earnings, to which he had agreed when stepping down as Nissan CEO in April 2017. 
Representatives of Ghosn's legal team said the allegations of unknown or unjust payments were unfounded. They attended the hearing at the Amsterdam District Court, which was linked to Ghosn's unlawful dismissal lawsuit. 
""We don't dispute that Mr Ghosn received a good salary"", attorney Roeland de Mol said. ""But he had the heavy task of getting French and Japanese companies to cooperate. He didn't retire to go play golf after he stepped down as Nissan CEO.""
Nissan-Mitsubishi lawyer Eelco Meerdink said there was also evidence that Ghosn made the alliance pay a personal French tax debt of 498,000 euros in 2018, and that he had arranged a ""pre-payment"" of his 2019 salary in 2018 to avoid a scheduled increase in Dutch income tax rates.
'READY FOR A FIGHT'
The allegations came as Ghosn's legal team challenged his dismissal by Nissan and Mitsubishi during the court hearing in Amsterdam, the first public session on the case after the former executive launched a suit against the companies last July. 
Ghosn is seeking 15 million euros in damages from the Japanese carmakers, who, he alleges, violated Dutch labor laws. 
Ghosn's lawyers argued for the release of internal documents relating to his dismissal following an Nissan-Mitsubishi inquiry, which the carmakers used to substantiate his dismissal on allegations of financial misconduct.
Ghosn's legal team claims he was unfairly dismissed as chairman of Nissan-Mitsubishi BV, a Dutch-registered entity, because the details of the allegations were not shared with him. His lawyers say the documents will show the companies were aware of his activities.
""Nissan and Mitsubishi publicly shamed Ghosn,"" de Mol told the court. ""Their reports and accusations were never put to Ghosn. There was no due process."" 
De Mol said he was pushing for ""a full debate on the reasons of Ghosn's dismissal. We need the information in his file to be able to do that. Mr. Ghosn is ready for a fight.""
Nissan-Mitsubishi lawyer Meerdink dismissed the demands by Ghosn's legal team, saying the reasons for the executive's dismissal were clear, and that his lawyers were ""going on a fishing expedition"".

The Amsterdam court said it would postpone any decision on documents until Nissan and Mitsubishi file their case on the reasons for Ghosn's dismissal, which is expected on March 26.

In a statement, Nissan, the first automaker to halt production at a plant in Japan because of the outbreak, said that output would be affected on Friday and Feb. 17, due to supply shortages of parts from China.
The stoppage could impact production of around 3,000 vehicles, the Nikkei newspaper reported said, underlining the extent to which manufacturers in the world's third-largest economy are reliant on China for supplies.
Nissan's Kyushu plant produces models including the Serena minivan for the Japanese market and the Rogue SUV crossover, Nissan's top-selling car in the United States. It has an annual capacity of 530,000 vehicles.
Two production lines at the Kyushu plant would be halted on Feb. 14, the Nikkei said, adding that another line which mainly cars for export, would be stopped on Feb.17.
Nissan said it was preparing to restart production in China at the earliest from Feb. 17 at its plants in Huadu, Guangdong Province and Dalian, Liaoning Province, while restart dates for other plants had yet to be confirmed. 
The coronavirus outbreak - declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organization - has disrupted Chinese manufacturing and that is having an effect on plants abroad.

In South Korea,  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380), Kia Motors (KS:000270) and  Renault  (PA:RENA) subsidiary RSM have all announced closures citing disruption to supply of parts from China.

Taiwan's Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker, got the green light to restart production in the eastern central Chinese city of Zhengzhou, said the person with direct knowledge of the matter. The company, however, has not yet been allowed to restart production in Shenzhen, a southern manufacturing hub, the source said.
The two factories together make up the bulk of Foxconn's assembly lines for Apple's (O:AAPL) iPhones, and the delays are likely to impact global shipments.
Market research firm Trendforce on Monday cut its March-quarter forecast for iPhone production by about 10% to 41 million handsets.
Apple itself gave a wider-than-usual revenue outlook range for the March quarter last month to factor in uncertainty due to the virus that has claimed more than 900 lives and infected over 40,000 people.
An Apple spokeswoman in Shanghai was not immediately available for comment.
Apple rival and China's biggest smartphone maker, Huawei, said last week it had resumed production of consumer devices and carrier equipment, and operations were running normally.
About 16,000 people, or under 10% of Foxconn's workforce in Zhengzhou have returned to the plant, the source said, adding that company executives were trying very hard to negotiate with authorities to resume production in other parts of China, including Kunshan, in southeastern Jiangsu province.
""Our request to resume production (in Shenzhen) was disapproved. We need to improve our virus control measures for another check,"" said the person who declined to be identified because they are not authorised to speak publicly on the matter.
Shenzhen authorities will conduct checks at the plant again later this week, the person said.
Employees in Shenzhen were told not to return to work on Tuesday, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.
The coronavirus outbreak - declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organization - has disrupted Chinese manufacturing and forced companies such as  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380) to halt production of cars in some factories.
Some companies including Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) limped back to work on Monday but hundreds of factories and stores remain shut across China.
Foxconn, formally  Hon Hai  Precision Industry Co Ltd, said in a statement that employee safety was top priority and that it was working with authorities to meet requirements to resume production across China ""in a staggered and orderly manner"".
Foxconn employees who returned to work on Monday following an extended Lunar New Year holiday have been told to wear masks, undergo temperature checks and adhere to a specified dining system, according to internal memos seen by Reuters.
Most senior Taiwanese officials have been told to refrain from returning to China and those who needed to do so required approval from Chairman Liu Young-Way, the person said.
Foxconn, which makes devices for global electronics firms, has built its own production lines in the southern province of Guangdong to make masks for its hundreds of thousands of employees, targeting two million masks a day by late February, the memos showed.
The company reported an 11.96% drop in its January revenue from a year ago to T$364.6 billion ($12.12 billion), according to a Foxconn filing to the Taiwan stock exchange. It did not give further details.
Foxconn shares fell as much as 2.4% in Monday trade, lagging a 0.3% decline in the broader market (TWII). They have fallen more than 11% since the market reopened following the Lunar New Year break."

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair (I:RYA) Chief Marketing Officer Kenny Jacobs, who spearheaded the airline's drive to improve customer service, is to leave his position after six years at the end of April to pursue other challenges, he told Reuters on Monday.
Jacobs, who joined Ryanair at the start of 2014, was the architect of the airline's 'Always Getting Better' drive to improve customer service and was charged with overhauling the company's web site to adapt to individual customer preferences. 
""I will enjoy a summer off with family and then look for my next challenge,"" Jacobs said. 
Chief executive Michael O'Leary said in an emailed statement that Ryanair's digital presence and customer service had been transformed under Jacobs over the past six years. 
Over the period, Ryanair has boosted the proportion of its revenue earned from optional extras such as assigned seating and additional baggage from just over 20% to just over 30%. 
""Kenny was the author of the successful 'Always Getting Better' brand six years ago when he first joined, and he has championed many of the successful customer service improvements we have launched in recent years, which has underpinned our successful growth and evolution,"" O'Leary said. 
The move comes as Ryanair shifts to a group structure, appointing chief executives to lead several smaller subsidiaries, with each reporting to O'Leary as group chief executive. 

His exit comes a month after Ryanair's chief operating officer Peter Bellew joined rival easyJet (L:EZJ) after a court case that found his 12-month non-compete clause was unenforceable.

Hon Hai, known also as Foxconn, sent a message via its internal app on Sunday that it wouldn’t be able to decide on a back-to-work date “until further notice” for its iDPBG business unit, according to a version reviewed by Bloomberg News. That division makes gadgets for Apple at a factory in the so-called iPhone city of Zhengzhou in central China and two other plants in Shenzhen. It’s not clear how many employees received the message and whether other workers were summoned back.
Foxconn declined to comment on the message and said on Monday its factories will comply with government requirements, and resume output in an “orderly manner” by staggering the return of workers.
The internal directive is bound to fuel more confusion over when the assembler of electronics to most of the world’s largest tech brands will fire up its factories. Foxconn has told employees at its southern Shenzhen headquarters not to return to work when the extended Lunar New Year break ended Feb. 10, according to a memo obtained by Bloomberg.
Not all of its employees returned to their hometowns for the holiday break so there’s still some available workers on production sites, according to people familiar with the plant operations. But it’s unclear as to how many such workers are on hand.
The unit could also struggle to hire back workers after the holiday period. A recruitment app for iDPBG shows that two of its plants in Shenzhen had received only 800 applications from former workers as of Monday morning. The facilities are seeking as many as 3,000 ex-workers.
Apple and Foxconn were among the first corporations to try and quantify the epidemic’s impact. Hon Hai slashed its 2020 outlook last week, anticipating disruptions to Apple’s carefully calibrated production chain as well as weaker consumer demand and overall economic growth. As China’s largest private employer and a key partner to many of the world’s most recognizable consumer brands, Foxconn has become a high-profile symbol of how the outbreak could disrupt Chinese manufacturing and hence the world’s supply of electronics."

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open marginally higher Monday, rebounding after Friday’s losses which bucked an otherwise strong week. But these gains are likely to be limited as China’s coronavirus outbreak continues to claim victims and cause economic damage.
At 7:00 AM ET (1200 GMT), futures for the S&P 500 Futures traded 2 points, or 0.1%, higher, futures for the Nasdaq 100 up 16 points, or 0.2%, while the Dow Jones 30 Futures contract rose 8 points, or 0.1%. 
On Friday, both the S&P 500 cash index and the Nasdaq closed down 0.5%, while the Dow Jones dropped 0.9%. However, despite these losses, the Dow posted its best weekly gain since August last year, the S&P since June, and the Nasdaq had its strongest week since November 2018.
This provides some room for investors to take profits, particularly as the earnings season starts to draw to a close. There are just 68 S&P 500 companies reporting results in the week ahead, with numbers from Restaurant Brands International, Allergan (NYSE:AGN) and Loews (NYSE:L) set to capture the market's attention on Monday.
Additionally, shares in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) soared 9% premarket, continuing the stock’s recent volatile run, after the electric car maker reopened its $2 billion Shanghai production facility Monday. Factory restarts across China have been in doubt after the Lunar New Year holiday was extended to combat the coronavirus outbreak.
A large number of China’s workers travelled back to offices and factories around the country, but many workplaces still remained closed, including key Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Foxconn that had sought official permission to open, while many white-collar workers continued to work from home. 
The death toll from the disease has officially overtaken that of the SARS outbreak almost two decades ago, as China reported the total number of deaths at 910, with over 40,000 people affected.
The death of a whistleblower doctor last week and the disappearance of citizen journalists in Wuhan who were reporting on the outbreak have also raised suspicions that the scale of the outbreak may be being understated.
The toll on China's already-slowing economy has been heavy, with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) cutting its first quarter GDP target to 4% from 5.6% previously and saying an even deeper hit is possible.
U.S. economic releases are thin on the ground Monday, so focus could be on speeches from Federal Reserve members Michelle Bowman and Patrick Harker. These come ahead of Fed Chair Jerome Powell delivering his semi-annual monetary policy testimony on the economy before Senate and House committees in Washington DC on Tuesday and Wednesday.
The Fed chair is expected to reinforce the signal that policy is on hold given that the labor market continues to tighten and private consumption growth remains solid.
Elsewhere, oil headed lower Monday, continuing last week’s losses when the complex posted its fifth weekly loss in a row. Doubts remain over the extent of production cuts from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known as OPEC+. 
AT 07:00 AM ET (1200 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% lower at $50.31 and the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.1% to $54.45."

Alibaba made the announcement in a statement posted on its official Weibo account.
It said 10 billion yuan will be made available for firms in Hubei, the central Chinese province that is the epicentre of the outbreak. They will be offered one-year loans on a zero interest rate basis for the first three months and a 20% discount on rates for the remaining nine months.
Firms across China can also get access to another 10 billion yuan of one-year loans, on which interest rates will be discounted by 20%, it added.
Other moves it announced included waiving platform fees for merchants on its Tmall marketplace for the first half of 2020 and the setting up of two 1 billion yuan funds to support restaurants, logistics and supply chain firms.
Workers were returning to offices and factories around China on Monday as the government eased some restrictions on working during a coronavirus epidemic that has killed more than 900 people, most of them on the mainland.
Chinese regulators have urged banks to lower the interest rates and extend loans to targeted companies that have been affected by the outbreak."
389,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 10, 2020 05:49AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Credit Suisse Extends Rebound After Shedding Thiam Baggage,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- For a bank that has supposedly lost one of the best CEOs in Europe,   Credit Suisse   (SIX:CSGN) stock is holding up remarkably well.
Switzerland’s second-largest bank was the biggest gainer among European banks on Monday, a down day for European markets overall, as market participants processed the shock of losing Tidjane Thiam to a boardroom power struggle.
By 5:45 AM ET,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) stock was up 1.4%, just off a two-week high, while the Stoxx 600 Banks index was flat and all of Europe’s main bourses were in the red – the benchmark Stoxx 600 losing 0.1% to 423.54.
Thiam’s failure to distance himself from a series of tawdry revelations about surveillance of former bank executives has had a disastrous effect on the bank’s reputation for discretion and integrity - so much so that Swiss regulator Finma had to parachute an investigator into the bank in December. When your chief business is managing the fortunes of the ultra-rich, discretion is not an essential part of the job – it IS the job.
Given the noise that some of the bank’s largest shareholders have made about Thiam’s effective dismissal (his ‘resignation’ was accepted unanimously after a marathon board meeting that ran into the early hours of Friday), this may seem surprising.
Harris Associates, the bank's largest active shareholder with over 8% of its stock, is furious at how Thiam has been forced out by a supervisory board chairman who – it believes - should bear the ultimate responsibility for the spying scandal.
Harris’ chief investment officer David Herro told Bloomberg last week that chairman Urs Rohner had overseen the creation of the mess that Thiam was hired to clean up. Rohner, not Thiam, should be the one to go, he argued - preferably at this year’s annual meeting.
However, any such move seems destined to fail. For one thing, the bank’s biggest shareholders – including Qatar and Norway’s sovereign wealth fund – are traditionally sensitive to the kind of local sensitivities that have flared up in this case, and tend not to throw their weight around too much (especially when Rohner is due to leave in a year’s time anyway).
Secondly,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) has a broad base of domestic retail shareholders, whose views are likely reflected in the broadly anti-Thiam tone of local media in recent months. They can hardly be expected to hang Rohner out to dry.
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the bank has signaled that it intends to carry on with Thiam’s strategy (less risky trading and investment banking, more stable fees from wealth management, and crossed fingers that the Swiss National Bank one day raises interest rates). Given the consensus among investors over that, there seems to be little to be gained from upsetting the applecart any further.
The new CEO Thomas Gottstein - the first all-Swiss CEO at the bank in over 20 years - has in any case already proved himself a safe pair of hands at the rudder of CS’s domestic ‘universal’ bank. 
It may be coincidence, but  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) has gone back to its Swiss roots just as Christian Sewing’s   Deutsche Bank   (DE:DBKGn) appears to have turned a corner after shedding some of its globalist ambitions and becoming more German, both in regional focus and in culture. 
After a period in which both tried - and ultimately failed at great financial and reputational expense - to break into the elite circle of Wall Street’s investment banking giants, a little more focus on core DNA may be what both banks need."

391,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 10, 2020 04:35AM ET</span>",‘Nightmare’ for Global Tech: Virus Fallout is Just Beginning,"(Bloomberg) -- As Chinese-based manufacturers begin to restart factories Monday, no one knows for sure when they’ll be back at full-speed -- or what sort of chaos may ensue.
Tech producers led by Foxconn (TW:2354), which makes the majority of the world’s iPhones from Zhengzhou a few hundred miles from the coronavirus outbreak’s epicenter, had begun preparing investors for the potential bedlam when hundreds of thousands make their way back to factories.
Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) most important partner warned investors of the daunting task of securing enough workers despite widespread transport blockades, quarantining thousands, and the “nightmare” scenario of an on-campus epidemic that could shut down production altogether. Last week, it took the unprecedented step of warning workers to stay away from its Shenzhen headquarters till further notice as government inspectors vet its containment procedures, Bloomberg News reported.
“How we can make sure there will be no infection within our campuses will be the first priority, because if you put a lot of people together and one of them gets infected, that will be a nightmare,” Foxconn investor relations chief Alex Yang told investors on a Thursday call, according to a recording obtained by Bloomberg News. “We try very hard to make sure the possibility of any on-site infection will be as low as zero, although it will be challenging.”
The deadly virus has illustrated the increasingly central role China plays in global manufacturing, from clothing and chemicals to automobiles and especially technology. Just about every major piece of consumer electronics is made in China, from iPhones and gaming consoles to half the world’s liquid crystal display or LCD screens. The contagion has already shuttered plants across China for a week longer than anticipated after the Lunar New Year break -- a disruption that could get much worse if rolling quarantines and suspended rail and air links prevent the return of the millions of blue-collar laborers at the heart of electronics assembly.
When they do make it back, untold numbers will get funneled into a quarantine of up to two weeks -- a sequester of unknown scale. Any disruptions at Chinese plants can, in a worst-case scenario, freeze parts of the supply chain by triggering cascading shortages. Influential supply chain analyst Kuo Ming-chi of TF International estimates Foxconn’s main iPhone-making base will properly resume work only next week -- and then at 40% to 60% capacity.  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) estimates just 30% of the entire Chinese semiconductor workforce is estimated to return to their workplaces as of Feb 11.
Foxconn said in a statement Saturday it’s working with local governments to prepare for the return of employees, without specifics. Shenzhen’s Longhua district said in a WeChat post it was helping the Taiwanese company fine-tune its plans. “To safeguard everyone’s health and safety and comply with government virus prevention measures, we urge you not to return to Shenzhen,” Foxconn wrote in a Feb. 5 text message to employees based in the southern city. “As for the happy reunion date in Shenzhen, please wait for further notice.”
On last week’s call, Yang spoke in depth about Foxconn’s virus-prevention measures and the need to comply with various regulations in the so-called “iPhone city” of Zhengzhou -- just 300 miles from Wuhan, the origin of the outbreak -- covering infection-fighting measures from quarantines to face mask and hand sanitizer inventories. “If you are talking about tens of thousands of people in a line, in a building, in a campus and we try to prevent a virus -- and in the meantime you are asking for them to do their normal job -- that’s very challenging.”
Apple and Foxconn, known also as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., were among the first corporations to try and quantify the viral epidemic’s impact. Hon Hai slashed its 2020 outlook last week, anticipating disruptions to Apple’s carefully calibrated production chain centered on China, as well as dampening consumer demand and overall economic growth. As China’s largest private employer and a key partner to many of the world’s most recognizable consumer brands, the Taiwanese company has become a high-profile symbol of how the outbreak could disrupt Chinese manufacturing and hence the world’s supply of electronics.
The disruptions extend well beyond electronics or technology. Many auto plants in the world’s largest market remain idled. Toyota Motor Corp., which initially halted its Chinese plants until Feb. 9, said Friday it now plans to resume production as soon as Feb. 17. Honda Motor Co. said it will reopen its factory in Hubei on Feb. 14 with an eye toward restarting output the week of Feb. 17. And Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG also delayed the resumption of production at some of its Chinese businesses until Feb. 17.
Expect the “supply chain situation to get worse before getting better,” wrote Jeff Pu of GF Securities.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:
Hon Hai, ZTE (HK:0763) and Quanta may not recover as quickly as electronics makers did after the SARS outbreak. China’s growth may slow further and 5G phone sales could disappoint as they don’t seem to have the features that drive widespread consumer upgrades.
- Charles Shum, BI technology analyst
One thing in the industry’s favor is that the first half of the year is often a lull period for a consumer electronics sphere driven by holiday sales and new iPhones in the fall. Yang stressed that the disruption was “manageable” and that Hon Hai would scramble to make up for any early 2020 production shortfall.
Several of the biggest names in tech including   Sony Corp.   (T:6758) and   Samsung Electronics Co Ltd   (KS:005930) have said they’ll restart production in China as scheduled. Production at Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.’s new Shanghai factory -- its first outside the U.S. -- resumed on Feb. 10., it said. And Apple-assembler   Pegatron   Corp (TW:4938) on Monday said it’s gradually restarting operations.
But much depends on the extent and severity of the outbreak. Even if it peaks soon, the interconnectedness of just-in-time global supply means the entire system will go through an unprecedented upheaval. The shortage of just one component exerts a ripple effect on the entire chain by holding up production further down the line, rippling through the carefully choreographed networks that companies from Apple to Huawei Technologies Co. and display-maker BOE Technology Group Co. rely on.
“There will certainly be risks of on-site infections. Companies also do not have control over neighborhoods near their factories,” said Eric Tseng, chief executive officer of Taipei-based Isaiah Research. “Manpower levels for most manufacturers will still be low during the first two to three weeks of February due to the length of quarantines and the possibility that not many workers will return.”
If Supply Chain Must Face a Pandemic, Now’s the Time: Tim Culpan
Unlike in previous years, Foxconn hasn’t even begun the recruitment of the hundreds of thousands it employs annually to piece together gadgets like the Sony Corp. PlayStation and HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ). computers, according to people familiar with the matter. Local executives were awaiting clarity and trying to reconcile rapid-fire and sometimes conflicting virus-prevention measures announced by local governments.
As such, its main iPhone-making plant in Zhengzhou may start the week of Feb. 10 with just a small number of workers who didn’t decamp for their hometowns before the extended break, one of the people said. The majority of the plant’s workforce are expected to encounter immense travel obstacles, the person added, asking not to be identified talking about internal matters. Foxconn’s two biggest campuses in Shenzhen now also face a similar predicament given the warning to employees to stay away.
To make matters worse, the virus has shrunk the available labor pool. Foxconn will temporarily halt recruiting workers from Hubei, site of the outbreak’s epicenter in Wuhan, and other heavily affected areas in neighboring provinces, a second person said. It’s ordered workers currently in Hubei as well as from seven other cities in adjacent Henan, Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces not to return to work, according to an internal document dated Feb. 4. obtained by Bloomberg. The company offered a 200 yuan ($28) reward to employees who report on co-workers violating that ban. While the picture remains murky, Foxconn is the most visible proxy for the confusion that now grips the broader supply chain.
More broadly, economists are still struggling to tote up the economic fallout of the outbreak. While SARS was bad economic news for China and its neighbors, which suffered from weaker exports and falling tourism, China’s small weight capped the global impact back then, when China’s GDP was 4% of the global total. That share now stands at 17%. That means, even if the outbreak peaks soon and producers impose double overtime to make up for lost production, the final end-demand in 2020 for gadgets of all stripes could take a severe beating.
At Huawei, China’s largest tech company and a global leader in smartphones and networking gear, executives are debating when to resume production for fear of angering Beijing by forcing large numbers of people into cramped dorms and factories, according to another person familiar with the matter. Then there’s the LCD makers from BOE to Tianma Microelectronics Co. that now crank out 50% or more of the screens for all TVs, phones and even car dashboards -- much of that from Wuhan.
The city is an important base for FiberHome and other optical fiber makers as well, that Huawei and networking firms rely on. “These will get directly hit,” said Kevin Chen, an analyst at China Merchants Securities. “ Near-term, their production will be impacted even if they resume working they might have a problem getting enough workers resulting in lower utilization.”"

The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) fell 0.3% by 0905 GMT, having marked its best week in three months as part of a broader rebound from an earlier virus-driven selloff.
""In essence, (stocks) are giving themselves room again to lose - they have just created a band for themselves after that rebound last week,"" said Connor Campbell, analyst at British financial spread better Spreadex.
Stocks in Ireland (ISEQ) dropped more than 1% after Irish nationalists Sinn Fein secured almost a quarter of first-preference votes in a general election. Bank stocks were the biggest weight on the Irish index.
While Chinese businesses resumed work after an extended holiday, with authorities lifting some virus-related restrictions, a spike in the death toll to more than 900 kept overall sentiment jittery.
""Markets would've been after something more positive this morning, and they haven't been presented with that, they've been presented with more uncertainty,"" Spreadex's Campbell added. 
The European travel and leisure sector (SXTP) was the biggest decliner among the regional sectors. Hotel operator  Whitbread  (L:WTB) fell the most in the sector as the virus outbreak threatened to erode demand from Chinese tourists.
European oil and gas stocks (SXEP) dropped as worries over Chinese demand continued to chip away at oil prices. 
Stocks in Germany (GDAXI), Europe's largest economy, fell 0.2% on weakness in information technology stocks.

A reading of business morale in the euro zone, due later in the day, is expected to have fallen drastically in January from the previous month.

Investing.com - European stock markets edged lower Monday, as the partial reopening of factories across China was offset by signs of greater concern about the disease in Europe. 
At 03:40 ET (0840 GMT), the U.K.'s FTSE index was trading 30 points, or 0.4%, lower, France's CAC 40 was down 34 points, or 0.6%, while the DAX lost 55 points, or 0.4%. The Euro Stoxx 50 index, which measures the movement of blue chip stocks in the eurozone, fell 17 points, or 0.5%. 
The U.K. on Monday declared the virus a ""serious and imminent"" threat to public health, a measure that allows for the forcible quarantining of people suspected of carrying the disease. That follows growing fears of 'superspreader' events, illustrated by the confirmation of five cases in a French ski resort at the end of last week. The disease's symptoms can remain undetected for 14 days, and the cases in the resort were traced back to a single British business traveller to Singapore, who had apparently re-entered the U.K. while showing no symptoms.
Workers in China travelled back to offices and factories around the country after the extended Lunar New Year holiday, A report that Apple’s main manufacturer, Foxconn, got the green light to resume some production has helped the overall tone, but a large number of workplaces still remain closed and many white-collar workers will continue to work from home. Elsewhere though, Kia Motors said it would stop production at all three of its sites in South Korea due to shortages of components, while over the weekend, Bloomberg reported that major copper producers were in talks with Chinese customers to let them defer purchases due to the collapse in near-term demand.
The Chinese government pledged $10 billion to help fight the virus while the People’s Bank of China moved to keep liquidity ample Monday through reverse-repurchase agreements.
Even so, the death toll from the disease has officially overtaken that of the SARS outbreak almost two decades ago. China reported an additional 89 deaths on Sunday, bringing the total number of deaths in the mainland to 908, with over 40,000 people affected.
The death of a whistleblower doctor last week and the disappearance of citizen journalists in Wuhan who were reporting on the outbreak have also raised suspicions that the scale of the outbreak may be being understated.
Turning back to Europe, in corporate news, shares in   Daimler   (DE:DAIGn), the maker of Mercedes-Benz cars and trucks, rose 0.4% following a report that the German luxury carmaker plans to cut up to 15,000 jobs to cut costs in the face of a global demand slowdown.
The group had said in November that it would cut at least 10,000 jobs and reduce staff costs by around 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) by the end of 2022, but the newspaper Handelsblatt reported that these numbers would be significantly exceeded.
Shares in Air France KLM (PA:AIRF) rose just 0.4% after announcing strong traffic numbers for January, rising 2.7% year-over-year. The group, which owns the French and Dutch flag carriers, also noted that its January traffic figures were barely affected by the coronavirus outbreak.
Also, shares in Exor (MI:EXOR) climbed 4.1% after Reuters reported the investment group, which controls carmaker Fiat Chrysler, is in exclusive talks to sell reinsurer PartnerRe to France’s Covea in a deal which could be worth around $9 billion.
Elsewhere, the oil market has edged lower Monday, after posting a fifth straight weekly loss last week. Combined losses over five weeks stood at more than 22% for both benchmarks, leaving them in bear market territory.
AT 03:45 AM ET (0845 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% lower at $50.00 a barrel and the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.6% to $54.15."

397,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2020 02:46AM ET</span>",China's return to work lifts local stocks while rest of Asia trails,"By Swati Pandey
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian shares fell on Monday as the death toll from a coronavirus outbreak exceeded the SARS epidemic of two decades ago, though Chinese shares gained as authorities lifted some work and travel restrictions, helping businesses to resume operations.
In early European trades, the pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures, German DAX futures and FTSE futures all slipped 0.1% while U.S. stock futures were more upbeat with e-minis for S&P 500 adding 0.2%.
More than 900 people have so far died mainly in China's central Hubei province as of Sunday with most of the new deaths in the provincial capital of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak.
To contain the spread, China's government had ordered lockdowns, canceled flights and shut schools in many cities. But on Monday, workers began trickling back to offices and factories though a large number of workplaces remain closed and many white-collar workers will continue to work from home.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan reversed some of its early losses but was still down 0.4%. Japan's Nikkei was off 0.6%, South Korea's KOSPI was 0.5% weaker while Australia's benchmark index eased a shade.
China's indexes were the only ones in the black in Asia with the blue-chip index adding 0.5% and Shanghai's SSE (LON:SSE) Composite up 0.3%.
""Markets have turned around a bit reflecting the news that Chinese businesses were returning to work,"" said James McGlew, analyst at stockbroker Argonaut.
""Overall, I think, there is still a concern out there that the impact from the coronavirus hasn't been fully quantified,"" he added.
""Today's (easing of restrictions) seems to be more of a symbolic gesture rather than the government actually being on top of the situation with this virus.""
The outbreak has killed more people than the SARS epidemic did globally in 2002/2003. The virus has also spread to at least 27 countries and territories, infecting more than 330 people overseas.
Over the weekend, an American hospitalized in the central city of Wuhan became the first confirmed non-Chinese victim of the virus. A Japanese man who also died there was another suspected victim.
Monday's losses in Asia extended from Wall Street on Friday where the Dow fell 0.9%, the S&P 500 declined 0.5% while the Nasdaq lost 0.5%.
""Expect markets to be sensitive to virus headlines. In this environment, we favor defensive positioning,"" ANZ economists wrote in a note.
China's central bank has taken a raft of measures to support the economy, including reducing interest rates and flushing the market with liquidity. From Monday, it will provide special funds for banks to re-lend to businesses working to combat the virus.
Despite the measures, analysts expect the world economy to take a hit from an expected slowdown in China.
""For now, our best guess is that the economic disruption related to the coronavirus will cost the world economy over $280 billion in the first quarter of this year,"" Capital Economics said in a note on Friday.
""If we're right, then this will mean that global (economic output) will not grow in q/q terms for the first time since 2009.""
The virus has overshadowed other market news with better-than-expected U.S. jobs data on Friday failing to lift sentiment.
Non-farm payrolls increased by 225,000 jobs in January, with employment at construction sites increasing by the most in a year amid milder-than-normal temperatures, the Labor Department said.
Euro zone bond yields fell after German industrial output tumbled in December to notch its biggest fall since January 2009, fanning concerns about the bloc's biggest economy.
The euro staged a half-hearted bounce from four-month lows to be last at $1.0949.
The dollar reversed losses against the yen to be up 0.1% at 109.79.
The Australian dollar, considered a liquid proxy for China plays, also jumped 0.4% to $0.66975 after briefly hitting an 11-year low of $0.6679. It fell 0.2% last week to clock its sixth consecutive weekly loss.
That left the dollar index flat at 98.651.
In commodities, Brent crude futures eased 3 cents to $54.44 a barrel while U.S. crude futures was flat $50.3 a barrel.
Since Jan. 17, oil prices have fallen by 14% while copper is down around 10%.
U.S. gold futures inched up slightly to $1,574 an ounce."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asian airlines face ""drastic"" cuts in their planned growth because of the coronavirus crisis, an industry group warned, adding gloom to an already depleted Singapore Airshow as more companies scaled back plans on Monday.
The Singapore Airshow from Feb. 11 to 16 is proceeding, but the exhibition center is pockmarked with empty spaces that would have held displays from Chinese companies and others skipping the show because of the epidemic, which has killed more than 900 people.
More than 70 exhibitors, including major U.S. defense firms  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) and Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) Co have pulled out over concerns related to the new coronavirus.
Few deals are expected at the biennial event, where the epidemic has triggered new safety measures and cast a shadow over airline profits and demand for airplanes.
Before the coronavirus hit, the International Air Transport Association had expected passenger numbers to rise by 4% in 2020 and cargo traffic to be 2% higher.
""All bets are off in terms of traffic forecasts for this year,"" Andrew Herdman, the director general of the Association for Asia Pacific Airlines, said in an interview.
""If you look at the schedule cuts and the actual operations they have been cut by 50%, 60%, 70% within China. It is pretty drastic,"" he said.
The Pentagon reduced the size of its delegation to the air show, which had been set to include its chief weapons buyer, U.S. Undersecretary of Defense Ellen Lord, Reuters reported on Friday.
Singapore on Friday raised its alert level for the coronavirus outbreak to orange, the same level reached during the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory System (SARS) pandemic, sparking panic buying at supermarkets across the island.
There are 43 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Singapore. The orange alert level advises organizers to cancel or defer non-essential large-scale events and recommends precautions such as temperature screening and more frequent cleaning of common areas for those that do proceed.
Health experts, however, said they were concerned that temperature screening might not be effective, given reports the coronavirus could be spread by people without symptoms.
""Temperature screening is okay to pick up people already sick - and those people should not be coming to the show anyway - but doesn't pick up people incubating the virus,"" said John McBride, an infectious disease physician and professor at Australia's James Cook University.
SIA Engineering Company Ltd and GE Aviation on Monday said they had postponed plans to hold a groundbreaking ceremony for a new engine overhaul facility in Singapore on Tuesday until further notice because of the raised alert level.
Saudi Arabia's General Authority for Military Industries withdrew from the show late Sunday, citing concerns associated with the coronavirus.
The air show's organizers said on Sunday they were expecting more than 930 companies from 45 countries and 45,000 trade attendees - down from the 54,000 at the last show in 2018. They also plan to limit public attendance.
The lobbies of major hotels, usually bustling with attendees, were noticeably quiet.
A spokeswoman for the organizers on Monday declined to provide an update on numbers and why the air show was going ahead when many smaller associated events and briefings were being canceled over coronavirus concerns.
Cancelling the show would lead to refunds running into the tens of millions of dollars, a source at one of the exhibitors told Reuters on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.
Organiser Experia Events, partly owned by ST Engineering and government agencies, charges at least S$1,550 per square meter for space in the show's exhibition hall, according to its website.
That would equate to more than S$3 million ($2.16 million) for ST Engineering's booth, the show's largest at more than 2,000 square meters. ST Engineering is majority owned by Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings.
Experia Events managing director Leck Chet Lam on Sunday said he could not comment on the financial terms of a cancellation.
""That is between us and the exhibitor,"" he told reporters."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Britain takes U.S. concerns about its use of Huawei equipment seriously but is confident a trade deal with the United States will be among its first after leaving the European Union, its foreign secretary said on Monday. 
U.S. officials have hinted future trade talks could be affected by Britain's decision last month to grant Huawei a limited role in its 5G mobile network, frustrating a global bid by the United States to exclude the firm from the West's next-generation communications systems.
""We listened and take the concerns of our American friends very seriously,"" Dominic Raab said in response to a question about the issue.
""We are reasonably confident that we can do a free trade agreement (with America) in that first wave of post-Brexit trade deals,"" Raab added, during a visit to Singapore. 
""We have had a good conversation about Huawei and the one thing we all recognize is there has been market failure in terms of high-trust vendors being able to provide telecoms infrastructure.""
Last month, Britain said it would cap at 35% the involvement of ""high-risk vendors"", such as Huawei, in the non-sensitive parts of its 5G mobile network. Excluding Huawei altogether would have delayed 5G and cost consumers more, it added. 
Yet some senior members of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives have demanded that Huawei must not have a role, a position described on Sunday as a ""kind of witch-hunt"" by China's ambassador to Britain.
Britain is in talks with America, Australia, Canada, and others on future technological innovations that could challenge Huawei's dominance in the field, Raab said.
""For 5G, the sooner we can build up our pool of high-trust vendors the less reliant we will be on high-risk vendors,"" he added.
Raab, who is visiting Asia to seek free trade deals after Brexit, said he also expected Singapore to be in the first wave of post-Brexit trade deals.
He will travel to Malaysia on Tuesday, wrapping up a tour that included Australia and Japan.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian antitrust investigator who helped bring criminal cartel charges against  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) denied acting with ""impropriety"" when presented with communications between the regulator and informants' lawyers.
The court testimony from Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) enforcement director Michael Taylor on Monday points to a defense strategy questioning the integrity of an investigation that ended in charges of collusion during a A$2.5 billion ($1.67 billion) share sale in 2015.
In pre-trial hearings, lawyers for the investment banks and their client, retail lender Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ) (AX:ANZ), have been trying to show witness statements by a third investment bank which worked on the deal, JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), were tainted by coordination between JPMorgan's lawyers and the authorities.
JPMorgan and its staff and ex-staff agreed to act as informants with the ACCC in exchange for immunity from prosecution, the court has previously heard.
On Monday, Taylor, the first ACCC employee to testify, was handed a note, and Deutsche lawyer Murugan Thangaraj told the packed courtroom it showed a JPMorgan lawyer notifying the ACCC about a discrepancy between statements from JPMorgan witnesses.
""That's what the file note records,"" Taylor said.
""That's an example of the JPMorgan lawyers attempting to give advice to the ACCC about how to build a case,"" said Thangaraj.
""That's your proposition,"" replied Taylor. ""If there are inconsistencies, I want to bring them out. I want to know.""
The JPMorgan witnesses had seemed to be ""full, frank and truthful"" throughout their ACCC interviews, Taylor added.
Taylor said he had taken charge of investigations for 30 years and that in this instance, the interviews demanded ""more governance than I have ever been involved in"".
More than a year and a half since the charges were brought against Citi, Deutsche, ANZ and several of their executives, the matter is yet to go to trial. None of the accused has entered a formal plea, but all have said they will plead not guilty.
The case hinges on allegations the banks colluded to keep hold of ANZ stock to prop up its price. It is being closely watched by investment bankers around the world because it could have implications about the way they are allowed to run share sales.
During a sometimes tense local court hearing, Taylor was presented with another email which Thangaraj said showed him arranging to meet JPMorgan lawyers without obtaining the necessary clearance.
When Taylor said he was unclear of the email's significance, Thangaraj said, ""You are perfectly clear what this is about.""
""I am absolutely not,"" said Taylor. ""I don't know if the meeting occurred. I've read the email. I honestly don't know. I would not ever act with impropriety. I would never ever act inappropriately.""
When Taylor said again that he was confused by the significance of the email, Thangaraj told the court, ""that's rubbish.""
The hearing continues."

The previously unreported move is an indication of how important it has become for miners to prove their supplies of the so-called ""white gold"" battery metal are sustainable as they court automakers preparing for the coming electric vehicle revolution.
Car companies have ratcheted up scrutiny in the Atacama, by far the biggest source of supply in South America's so-called ""lithium triangle,"" where one lithium producer is locked in a court battle over pumping of brine and a copper miner has opted for pricey desalination over drawing water from local aquifers.
""What we're seeing is a scrutiny of how lithium is being produced, and particularly, in the Salar de Atacama,"" Ellen Lenny-Pessagno, Albemarle's Chile manager, told Reuters in an interview in capital city Santiago. ""They want data.""
She said a team from Germany's biggest car maker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) - which expects to produce 1.5 million electric autos by 2025 - visited the Atacama last month to scope out the social and environmental impact of mining operations there.
A source at Volkswagen, who asked not to be named, confirmed a recent trip had been made to Chile to check on local conditions. The carmaker declined to comment.
That came after a Chilean judge sided with local indigenous communities and knocked back an environmental remediation plan from top rival SQM (SN:SQMA) in December, warning of ""fragility"" in the Atacama's ecosystem.
""Developing a greener world can't come at the cost of an entire territory... and culture,"" said Juan Carlos Cayo, an attorney for communities in Atacama, following that decision.
The battle for water in Chile's salt flats has intensified. Residents and environmental groups worry that mining of lithium and copper is damaging a regional ecosystem home to an ancient indigenous culture and turquoise lagoons inhabited with rare pink Chilean flamingos.
For Albemarle, the world's largest producer of lithium, resolving the water issue is a ""business decision"", Lenny-Pessagno said, adding the firm was open to working with other miners on the matter including rival SQM.
""Whatever happens in the salar will ultimately impact our business,"" she said, confirming the plan for a two-decade monitoring network to get a fuller picture of the issue.
A government study intended to provide similar information has been repeatedly delayed since 2018, leaving a void. A spokeswoman for Chile development agency Corfo, which is managing that process, said the report was nearing completion.
HIDDEN IN THE BRINE
Salt-rich brine holds in suspension the lithium that automakers covet. Miners use freshwater beneath the flats for industrial processes. Both water and brine are scarce commodities in the world´s driest desert.
Last week miner BHP (AX:BHP) scrapped plans to continue pumping water from the Atacama basin to feed its massive Escondida copper mine, the world's largest. It said it would use desalinated water instead.
Albemarle, too, shelved longer-term plans to expand its operations at Atacama following questions from regulators in 2018 about technologies that would allow the company to produce more lithium without pumping more brine.
Rival SQM's operations are also in limbo after a plan to lessen its environmental impact was thrown out by judges who said a green light from regulators had relied on junk science and warned about a ""high level of scientific uncertainty"" about the behavior of the Atacama's water table. 
SQM has criticized the court's ruling and appealed to the Supreme Court. A decision is pending. 
Lenny-Pessagno said Albemarle's near-term focus would be developing technologies to extract more lithium from the brine it already had permits for. She said the company had ""no intention of asking to increase our pumping rate."" 
She confirmed plans to open the La Negra III and IV lithium processing plants in Chile by next year, boosting the firm's production capacity in the country to 85,000 tonnes. 
Last May, Albemarle announced a project to boost its Atacama lithium production by 30% without extracting more brine. 
When asked if that technology, or others, might help revive plans to produce over 85,000 tonnes, she said both the market and technology would dictate timing. 

""These technological improvements take time, it's still a work in progress. We want to be rational in terms of what our goals are,"" she said.

Investing.com - China’s consumer prices jumped at their highest pace in more than eight years, according to official data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Monday. 
 
The consumer price index (CPI), a key gauge of retail inflation, came in at 5.4% last month on-year, up from the expected 4.9% increase and the 4.5% in December.
 
The latest inflation figure is the highest since October 2011. 
 
The rise in CPI was mainly due to the Lunar New Year and the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, the NBS said in a statement.
 
""The year-on-year increase has been affected not only by Spring Festival-related factors but... by the new coronavirus as well,"" said the NBS on Monday.

In an ad, the new foldable phone was shown sitting on a table at a 90-degree angle on its own.The ad showed the screen can do caller ID and also has sliders for accepting or rejecting a call.
Samsung (KS:005930) debuted the Galaxy Fold, its first foldable phone, during its “unpacked” event in February 2019. The phone was initially given an April 26 launch date, but its debut was then delayed as reviewers complained about the fragile nature of the phone’s screen and gaps in the phone's hinges.
""Initial findings from the inspection of reported issues on the display showed that they could be associated with impact on the top and bottom exposed areas of the hinge. There was also an instance where substances found inside the device affected the display performance,” Samsung (KS:005930) said in a statement last year.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's SoftBank Group (T:9984) is expected to post a slide in profits for the past quarter, deepening concern about its ability to secure funding for a second Vision Fund and giving activist fund Elliott Management more fodder for a shake-up.
Elliott, the New York-based fund founded by billionaire Paul Singer, has amassed a stake of almost $3 billion in SoftBank and is pushing for changes including $20 billion in stock buybacks, sources said last week.
The emergence of Elliott, one of the world's most powerful activist investors, as a prominent SoftBank shareholder is likely to highlight the Japanese conglomerate's difficulties following its soured bet on office-sharing startup WeWork.
SoftBank, which reported its first quarterly loss in 14 years in July-September, has come under increasing pressure for its lack of transparency, especially around its $100 billion Vision Fund of largely unlisted start-ups.
""I'm not sure investors will have confidence in the private valuations that drive the reported performance of the Vision Fund, particularly after the performance of WeWork and others,"" said Morningstar analyst Dan Baker.
The tech conglomerate, which reports on Wednesday, is expected to post a 20% fall in operating profit to 345 billion yen ($3.1 billion) in the October-December quarter, according to the average forecast of three analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv.
That would follow a quarterly operating loss of 704 billion yen when the firm was whiplashed by an $8.9 billion hit at the Vision Fund as the value of WeWork and other bets like Uber (N:UBER) plunged. The loss prompted founder Masayoshi Son to acknowledge his ""investment judgment was poor in many ways"".
A second quarter of dismal results would only reinforce doubts about the viability of a second, massive fund, given that it would be reliant on profits from the current Vision Fund for some of its funding.
TOUGH CALL
Analysts have long highlighted the challenge of forecasting SoftBank's earnings, given the limited visibility on Vision Fund valuations. In the six months to September, the fund said it had gains on 25 companies and losses on another 25, but identified only a handful of names.
What is clear, though, is that since the WeWork bailout, a slew of portfolio companies - from hotel-booking platform Oyo to cloud robotics firm CloudMinds - have cut jobs and come under pressure to show their business models are viable.
That's a marked shift from Son's previous strategy of prioritizing growth over profitability.
SoftBank Corp, the telecommunications firm that is two-thirds owned by SoftBank Group, and one of the parent's biggest listed assets, on Friday reported a 15% rise in quarterly profit.
The Vision Fund has stakes in nearly 90 start-ups. Only five were listed prior to the October-December quarter. During that period, three of those fell although  ZhongAn Online  P&C Insurance Co Ltd (HK:6060) rose almost 60%.

Chip designer Arm, which will also provide an update on Wednesday, has turned money losing.
SoftBank's shares, which have been propped by positive sentiment toward China's  Alibaba  (N:BABA), have been boosted by the news of Elliott's stake and are up around 8% year to date.

(Reuters) - Australia's Boral Ltd (AX:BLD) said on Monday delays to building projects due to bushfires will likely cause a plunge in its second-half results, while revealing an investigation had found inflated earnings at its North American window-making business.
In a flurry of news, the building materials maker also said Chief Executive Mike Kane, at the helm for more than seven years, will retire after it reports full-year earnings in August.
Shares plunged more than 12% - their biggest one-day drop since the last major profit warning in August - wiping out nearly $500 million from the firm's market valuation.
""Kane took the company to the U.S. and really threw the dice on major acquisitions there, which has actually failed on a lot of fronts,"" said Henry Jennings, senior analyst and portfolio manager at Marcustoday Financial Newsletter.
""Now these accounting irregularities have come to light as well and that really has put the final nail in his coffin from a corporate perspective. I think it is time for a fresh set of eyes to look at this company.""
Boral said the real impact of the bushfires will be seen in the second-half of its financial year as infrastructure works suffer disruptions and as activity in the building sector slows.
It reported a A$1 million ($670,300.00) hit for its first six months from bushfires that have scorched huge swathes of land across Australia, destroying homes and killing people and animals.
Core earnings in fiscal 2020 is likely to be lower across its three divisions. It sees net profit after tax around A$320 million to A$340 million, a decline of as much as 38% from an adjusted A$440 million last year, factoring in the overstatement at the windows business.
Pre-tax earnings at the North American division were overstated by $24.4 million between March 2018 and October 2019, Boral said, adding the figures were within its previously advised range.
Boral is now overhauling the division, firing the vice president of finance and financial controller. It said the accounting overstatement was limited to the windows business.
The investigation found no evidence that the overstatement was to hide the theft, the company said.
""The board and management are deeply disappointed at the breach of trust that led to the accounts of the Windows business being misreported to inflate profitability,"" Kane said in a statement.
In Monday's earlier-than-expected announcement, Boral also said net profit after tax before significant items was A$156 million for the half year ended Dec. 31. It will give further details on the originally scheduled results date of Feb. 20 along with further outlook.
It also announced an interim dividend of 9.5 cents per share."

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Brad Pitt and Laura Dern won their first acting Oscars on Sunday, and South Korean movie ""Parasite"" got off to what could be a historic night at the Academy Awards ceremony.
Dern took home the Oscar for best supporting actress for her role as a ruthless divorce lawyer in ""Marriage Story,"" and dedicated it to her celebrity parents Diane Ladd and Bruce Dern.
""This is the best birthday present ever,"" said Dern, who will turn 53 on Monday.
Pitt was named best supporting actor for playing a charming stunt double in ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"" after having collected an armful of trophies earlier this year for the role. It was his first acting Oscar.
""I'm a bit gobsmacked to tell you the truth,"" said Pitt, who recalled his early days starting out as an unknown actor.
""'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' - ain't that the truth?,"" he said, dedicating the Academy Award to his six children with former wife Angelina Jolie.
""Parasite"" got off to strong start by winning the original screenplay Oscar for a delighted Bong Joon Ho - the first of six potential Academy Awards for the film on Sunday. 
The social satire about the wealth gap in South Korea is also seen as a front-runner for the coveted best picture prize, as well as international feature and best director for Bong. No film in a foreign language has ever won best picture at the Oscars.
""American Factory,"" about the decline of jobs in the industrial Midwest from former U.S. President Barack and first lady Michelle Obama's new production company, won for best documentary.
Nazi satire ""Jojo Rabbit"" brought a best adapted screenplay Oscar for director, star and writer Taika Waititi. 
Despite again having no formal host, the Oscars ceremony started with a surprise appearance by former hosts Steve Martin and Chris Rock, who delivered a string of barbed jokes about the lack of female directors and people of color among this year's nominees.
""I thought there was something missing this year,"" said Martin. 
""Vaginas?"" quipped Rock, to loud applause.
Rock pointed out Cynthia Erivo, who played slavery-era freedom fighter Harriet Tubman in ""Harriet"" and who was the only actor of color nominated this year.
""Cynthia did such a great job hiding black people that the academy got her to hide all the black nominees,"" said Rock.
In another surprise, rapper Eminem took the Oscars stage to perform ""Lose Yourself,"" his 2003 Oscar-winning song from the movie ""8 Mile."" 
The nominees and winners are chosen by the 8,000 members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
The coveted best picture prize, to be announced at the end of the three-hour show, is thought to be a three-way race between ""Parasite,"" British director Sam Mendes' immersive World War One movie ""1917"" from Universal Pictures , and ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,"" Quentin Tarantino's love letter to show business, from Sony Pictures (T:6758).
Dark comic book movie ""Joker"" from Warner Bros (N:T), which has a leading 11 nominations, Netflix (O:NFLX) divorce drama ""Marriage Story"" and the streaming service's mob epic ""The Irishman,"" race-car drama ""Ford v Ferrari"" from 20th Century Studios (N:DIS), and novel adaptation ""Little Women"" from Sony Pictures, round out the competition for the top prize.
Netflix boosted its Hollywood credentials by getting a leading 24 nominations this year. But the coveted best picture Oscar may elude it yet again on Sunday, awards watchers say.

The deal would cut $35 billion of bonds and claims to about $11 billion as it increases the ranks of general obligation (GO) and Public Buildings Authority (PBA) bondholders that signed onto a plan to restructure core government debt and more than $50 billion in pension obligations that the board filed in U.S. District Court in September.
The Caribbean island commenced a form of municipal bankruptcy in May 2017 to restructure about $120 billion of debt and liabilities. Just months later, residents had to endure devastating hurricanes and more recently the strongest earthquake in more than a century.
In a statement, Oversight Board Chairman José Carrión said the deal ""lowers total debt payments relative to the agreement we reached last year, pays off commonwealth debt sooner, and has significantly more support from bondholders, further facilitating Puerto Rico's exit from the bankruptcy that has stretched over three years.""
However, the deal faces opposition from Puerto Rico Governor Wanda Vazquez because it does not roll back proposed pension cuts.
Under the agreement, bondholders would face average value reductions of 29% for GO bonds and 23% for PBA bonds, which is lower than haircuts of 36% to 65% that were included in the September plan of adjustment. The board had targeted more than $6 billion of GO bonds sold in 2012 and 2014 for low recoveries, contending they were issued in violation of Puerto Rico's constitutional debt limit. 
The deal would end the board's pursuit to void those bonds in court and the risk that hold-out bondholders would recover none of their investment if the debt were invalidated.
Creditors would receive $10.7 billion in new debt, split between GO bonds and sales tax-backed junior lien bonds, along with $3.8 billion in cash, the board said. It also shortens the timeframe to pay off the island's legacy debt to 20 years from 30 years. 
Pensions remain an issue for the governor and others as the board has been seeking a maximum 8.5% cut for retirees who receive more than $1,200 in monthly benefits.

""My position during this process has been that if bondholders receive better treatment in a new deal, pensioners must also receive better treatment,"" Vazquez said in a statement.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi has been in talks with banks for potential debt sales in the international markets this year as the oil-rich emirate plans to engage global fixed income investors on a more regular basis amid low oil prices, sources said.
Abu Dhabi, which has one of the best credit ratings in the region, issued its latest international bonds in September last year, raising $10 billion for budgetary purposes and garnering almost $20 billion in demand.
After a reshuffling at its finance department last year, the government has been in talks with banks on several fundraising options, taking a more proactive approach to debt financing, said the sources.
""They want to issue more regularly and in smaller sizes, rather than huge $10 billion deals like last year,"" one of them said.
""As part of its mandate, the Abu Dhabi Department of Finance constantly evaluates options under the existing bond issuance program,"" it told Reuters in an emailed statement.
""However, as a matter of policy, the Department does not respond to market rumors,"" it added.
Rated AA by S&P and Fitch and Aa2 by Moody's, Abu Dhabi's finances are backed by one of the world's largest sovereign net foreign asset positions and low levels of debt.
But its ratings are also constrained ""by dependence on volatile oil and gas revenue, an underdeveloped economic policy framework and weak governance indicators relative to 'AA' peers,"" said Cedric Berry, associate director at Fitch Ratings.
In its talks with banks, Abu Dhabi has said it plans to modernize its approach to raising financing and to improve transparency when it engages with fixed income investors, said one of the sources.
""They want to pay less for their borrowing. They're rated double A but they pay some 10-15 basis points more than their peers and they want to fix that.""
Abu Dhabi's fiscal balance depends almost entirely on revenue from hydrocarbon royalties and taxes and dividends received from ADNOC, its national oil company.
After oil prices collapsed in 2014 and 2015, it reduced public spending and increased dividends from state-owned entities. Still, it had forecast a deficit of 27.2 billion dirhams ($7.41 billion) for 2019, according to its latest bond prospectus.
Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, is also the largest contributor to the federal government budget, with contributions expected to account for 40% of the emirate's expenditure last year.
The UAE government - which passed a law in 2018 allowing it to issue debt at federal level - plans to sell federal bonds for the first time in 2020, an official said last year.
Last year, Emirates Development Bank, owned by the UAE federal government, sold $750 million in bonds, becoming the first federal entity to tap the international capital markets under the new debt law.

The rescue specialists said on Thursday that SAA would cease flights to Durban, East London and Port Elizabeth from Feb. 29, as well as cutting some international routes, as part of efforts to conserve cash and make the airline more attractive to potential equity partners.
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Friday his government did not agree with plans to cut some of SAA's domestic routes, plunging rescue efforts for the cash-strapped carrier into uncertainty.
“We recognize the concerns raised, especially around the domestic routes. We will continue to engage with stakeholders, with a commitment to include inputs into the final business rescue plan, which is due to be published by the end of this month, ”SAA business rescue practitioners Les Matuson and Siviwe Dongwana said in a statement.
Under South African company law, the business rescue team is entitled to take decisions that are deemed necessary to turn a distressed company around, independently of government. In theory it could ignore the government's objections.
SAA is among several South African state entities including power company Eskom that are mired in financial crisis after nearly a decade of mismanagement."

NAKHON RATCHASIMA, Thailand (Reuters) - Thai security forces on Sunday shot and killed a rogue soldier who went on a rampage in a shopping mall in a northeastern city, ending an overnight siege after a series of attacks that left at least 20 people dead.
Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul confirmed the soldier had been shot dead at the Terminal 21 mall in the city of Nakhon Ratchasima.
""Thank you police and army for ending the situation. Shooter shot dead!!!"" Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said in a post on Facebook. Police and the army also said he had been killed.
Police have identified the suspected shooter as 32-year-old soldier Jakrapanth Thomma.
The killings began at around 3 p.m. (0800 GMT) on Saturday when the soldier opened fire in a house before moving to an army camp and then to the mall, posting messages on Facebook as he went.
Thai media said the suspected shooter had worked at an army base close to Nakhon Ratchasima, which is about 250 km (155 miles) from the capital Bangkok. Before the attack, Jakrapanth had posted on his Facebook account that he was out for vengeance -- but he did not say for what.
A provincial health official told a news conference that a total of 20 people had been killed and 42 wounded, revising down an earlier figure of 21 dead given by other officials.
'IT APPEARS HE WENT MAD'
""We don't know why he did this. It appears he went mad,"" Defense Ministry spokesman Kongcheep Tantrawanit told Reuters.
Overnight, soldiers and police stormed into the mall and escorted hundreds of trapped people to safety.
""It was frightening because I could hear the occasional gunshot...we waited a long time for the police to come and help us, many hours,"" said Suvanarat Jirattanasakul, 27, her voice trembling after she emerged.
The mall was busy with shoppers on a long weekend for the Buddhist Makha Bucha holiday.
CCTV footage from inside the mall posted on social media showed the gunman dressed in black and wearing a mask, his gun slung over his shoulder with no sign of other people around. 
Facebook (O:FB) said it had removed the suspect's account.
""There is no place on Facebook for people who commit this kind of atrocity, nor do we allow people to praise or support this attack,"" a Facebook representative said in a statement.

Major shootings are rare in the Southeast Asian country other than in the far south, where a decades-old insurgency persists.

""In my conversations with (Tesla CEO) Elon Musk I have always made clear that there are no privileges but also no discrimination,"" Peter Altmaier told Welt am Sonntag in an interview.
The German government has earmarked financial support for making electric car battery cells locally as a way to secure manufacturing jobs as tougher emissions rules threaten demand for older technologies, like diesel engines.
Altmaier said in order to qualify for state subsidies companies needed to fulfill certain requirements in the areas of sustainability and battery efficiency.
""Also, Germany has to be more than an extended workbench. There needs to be research and development, too. All companies that fulfill these criteria have a chance to be supported - including Tesla.""
Tesla in November announced it would build its first European factory and design center near Berlin, adding the new plant would make batteries, powertrains and cars - starting with the Model Y sports utility vehicle."
425,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2020 10:28AM ET</span>","Exclusive: South Africa seeks to unlock stalled arms sales to Saudi, UAE","By Joe Bavier and Alexander Winning
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa aims to free up over a billion dollars in stalled weapons sales, including to Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates, by amending a document at the heart of an export row, a senior arms control official told Reuters.
Local defense firms have lobbied the government for months to change a clause in the export document requiring foreign customers to allow South African officials to inspect their facilities to verify that weapons aren't being transferred to third parties.
Saudi Arabia and the UAE buy at least a third of South Africa's arms exports and have been engaged in a war in Yemen. They refused to agree to the inspections because they considered them a violation of their sovereignty, industry officials told Reuters in November.
""I can confirm that the amendment of the end-user certificate was approved by the NCACC recently,"" Ezra Jele, the head of the secretariat of South Africa's National Conventional Arms Control Committee (NCACC), told Reuters.
A draft letter from Jele to a defense industry association obtained by Reuters and authenticated by two industry sources said the NCACC planned to replace a clause allowing for ""on-site verification ... performed by an inspector designated by the (defense) minister.""
The new clause would state ""on-site verification of the controlled items may be performed, through diplomatic process"".
Defense sources said the changes were aimed at assuaging the concerns of importing nations that objected to the original wording, in the hope that exports could resume.
Before it takes effect, the amendment must be published in the government gazette. But the letter stated that permission was being sought from the defense minister for companies to use the new language in the interim.
Jele declined to comment on the letter, as did the head of the industry association to whom it was addressed.
South Africa has sought to reform its defense industry – once a pillar of the racist apartheid regime – by making export approvals subject to human rights considerations.
It has long included a clause in its end-user certificates requiring on-site inspections, though it was rarely acted upon. But in 2017, arms control officials moved the clause to the front page of the certificates, and countries including Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Oman and Algeria refused to sign them.
Exports to the Gulf and North Africa are a key source of revenue for local defense companies including state-owned Denel, Paramount Group and  Rheinmetall  Denel Munition, a joint venture between Denel and German industrial giant Rheinmetall (DE:RHMG).
Defense firms threatened hundreds of job cuts if the wording of the clause wasn't changed to resolve the row.

427,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2020 09:23AM ET</span>","On eve of Brexit, Britain faces critical test to defend drug trial crown","By Kate Holton and Paul Sandle
LONDON (Reuters) - It's 2023. Britain's brightest and best drug researchers are packing their bags as clinical trials start to dwindle, leaving a nation renowned as a global leader in pharmaceutical development to face a future in the slow lane.
This is a worst-case scenario outlined by some scientists and industry experts in the wake of Brexit, which they say could deprive the country of its role as Europe's leader in early-stage drug research, designing and hosting pan-EU trials.
Pamela Kearns, professor of pediatric oncology at the University of Birmingham, worries that over time Britain will in particular lose out in the field of medicines that treat rare diseases and childhood cancers, where trials often need to collaborate and recruit across Europe to find enough patients.
""It would be a real disadvantage to children in this country if we were not part of those networks,"" she told Reuters. ""It will disadvantage us massively.""
Kearns's university sponsored the BEACON Neuroblastoma trial, held up as a model of cooperation, and the type of project that could be in jeopardy after Britain's EU exit on Friday and a transition period that runs until the end of 2020.
The British designed clinical trial is testing a combination of drugs to tackle a rare aggressive cancer that affects children. It is partly funded by European groups, and is being trialled on patients across the continent.
Kearns said her team, among their Brexit contingency plans, had selected a legal representative within the EU - in Dublin - that could enable them to continue playing a key role in trials, as well as an EU distributor to supply drugs for patients. 
It has also added new legal provisions to contracts should Britain no longer be covered by the bloc's GDPR laws for exchanging data. Yet all these steps may only help in the long term if the UK stays closely aligned to EU research regulations.
Brussels is launching a new portal and database that will help co-ordinate the design, data collection and oversight of pan-EU trials, a system that Britain is likely to be excluded from after it fully leaves the bloc at the end of 2020. 
Some company executives argue that fears of Britain losing ground are overly pessimistic though, and the country could in fact thrive under a nimbler drug development and approval system unshackled from 27 EU states.
""If you're a single approver versus one with 28 people sitting around the table you can probably do things a little bit faster,"" said Hugo Fry, UK boss of French drugmaker Sanofi (PA:SASY). 
Whether to diverge or align encapsulates the fundamental tension underlying Brexit: can Britain differentiate itself enough to make a success of the historic break, and does the freedom to innovate trump being part of a larger group? 
CASTING A WIDE NET
Kearns' concerns are echoed by UK pharmaceutical industry body the ABPI, which warns of a brain drain from a sector that contributes about 2.7 billion pounds ($3.55 billion) to the economy and around 47,500 jobs.
""Without the ability to influence the design of research programs, leading researchers are likely to move out of, or not move into, the UK and this loss of globally recognized and highly skilled researchers will drastically undermine the UK's research base,"" it said. 
It is not only the United Kingdom that faces risks though; the European Union stands to lose the expertise of a country that has accounted for an average of 28% of EU clinical trial applications over the past 10 years.
Britain leads Europe in early-stage - phase I and II - trials, with particular strength in cancer research.
Industry experts, from academics to executives, say the best way to limit potential damage on both sides is for Britain to remain closely aligned to EU rules so researchers can maintain collaborations and prevent the duplication of costs and paperwork from having two separate regulatory systems. 
But the nation's decision to leave the bloc was driven by a desire to forge its own path, set its own rules and strike its own deals. Britain has previously said it will seek to align with the EU on clinical trials ""where possible"". 
""After Brexit, clinical trials will continue to be approved at a national level, working to international standards and we are determined to maintain the UK's position as one of the best locations globally to run clinical trials,"" the government said.
Britain's leading role in developing drugs is underpinned by its research clusters that bring together publicly funded hospitals, top universities like Oxford and Cambridge and companies such as AstraZeneca and GSK. 
However domestic expertise is often not enough.
A look at the work of leading charity Cancer Research UK illustrates how closely Britain is entwined with the continent; nearly a third of the roughly 200 trials currently being funded by the organization involves European collaboration. 
Emlyn Samuel, its head of policy development, said the emergence of drugs that target tumors according to their genetic make-up rather than cancer type meant more trials would need to cast a wide net to find suitable patients.
""If we're outside we might be able to move more quickly in some areas but I don't think that outweighs the benefits of being part of a broader regulatory system,"" he said. 
'IS THIS THE PLACE TO COME?'
Denmark's  Novo Nordisk  (CSE:NOVOb), a leader in diabetes drugs, has opened a research center in Britain. While fully committed to the country, it has concerns about the broad impact of Brexit. 
""If there are processes that mean it becomes more complex then companies will look twice at, 'Is this the first place to come and do clinical trials, or is it easier to recruit patients elsewhere?'"" its UK boss Pinder Sahota told Reuters.
Britain's Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is however looking at how being independent of the EU could give it a freer hand to improve its systems, company sources say. 
It could, for example, cut the time it takes to approve a trial design or complete the early phases. But some are wary in a testing industry with little room for divergence and risk.
By the time Britain has fully left the EU after the transition period, researchers on the BEACON trial will hope to be embarking on phase III testing. 
Kearns has already had to reassure European partners it can continue to lead such trials. But she does fear for the future.
""We've got fantastic investigators in the UK ... we've got a brilliant set of statisticians and trial methodologists and the expertise, so we're very much the trusted partner to lead,"" she said.
    ""We could find ourselves in the position of going back to just following.""

428,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2020 09:21AM ET</span>",Shanghai to help Tesla resume production amid coronavirus spread,"By Brenda Goh and Samuel Shen
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - U.S. electric carmaker Tesla's (O:TSLA) factory in China's financial hub of Shanghai will resume production on Feb. 10 with assistance to help it cope with a spreading epidemic of coronavirus, a Shanghai government official said on Saturday. 
Many factories across China shut in late January for the Lunar New Year holiday that was originally due to end on Jan. 30 but which was extended in a bid to contain the spread of the new flu-like virus that has killed more than 700 people.
Tesla warned on Jan. 30 that it would see a 1-1.5 week delay in the ramp-up of Shanghai-built Model 3 cars as a result of the epidemic, which has severely disrupted communications and supply chains across China.
Tesla Vice President Tao Lin said this week that production would restart on Feb. 10 and that car deliveries from the plant would be temporarily delayed.
""In view of the practical difficulties key manufacturing firms including Tesla have faced in resuming production, we will coordinate to make all efforts to help companies resume production as soon as possible,"" Shanghai municipal government spokesman Xu Wei said. 
The $2 billion Shanghai factory is Tesla's first outside the United States and was built with support from local authorities. It started production in October and began deliveries last month.
The Shanghai government also said on Saturday it would ask banks to extend loans with preferential rates to small companies and exempt firms in hard-hit sectors like hospitality from value-added tax, among other measures to prop up businesses during the epidemic. 

Such assistance would also apply to foreign companies.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and the European Union could team up to counter the dominance of China's Huawei Technologies in next-generation 5G telecoms technology, but not if Washington continues to threaten tariffs against Brussels, a senior German conservative lawmaker said late on Friday.
Norbert Roettgen, a member of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats, said he told U.S. officials during a visit to Washington that he saw opportunities for greater transatlantic cooperation on 5G that would benefit both sides.
""But ... it must be clear that cannot happen if there is simultaneously the threat of trade war on the table,"" said Roettgen, who heads the foreign affairs committee of Germany's lower house of parliament, speaking after meetings with State Department and White House officials. 
After reaching a Phase 1 trade deal with China, and securing the passage of a new North American trade pact in Congress, U.S. President Donald Trump has set his sights on Europe and what he views as its unfair barriers for U.S. companies.
Trump has threatened to slap 25% tariffs on European car imports, a move Brussels says it would counter with tariffs of its own. The two blocs are also at odds over digital services taxes, aircraft subsidies, and Huawei .
The United States says gear provided by Huawei, the leading telecoms equipment vendor with a global market share of 28%, contains ""back doors"" that would enable China to spy on other countries, a claim Huawei vigorously denies.
Roettgen told reporters he did not expect Trump to follow through on the car tariff threat until after the November presidential election, but said the situation was unpredictable.
He said Trump's rhetoric had become increasingly polarizing, but the historic allies shared security concerns about China and could work together to expand Europe's alternatives to Huawei's dominance of the 5G market.
U.S. Attorney General William Barr on Thursday suggested the United States consider taking a ""controlling stake"" in two major foreign rivals of Huawei, Finland's Nokia (HE:NOKIA) and Sweden's Ericsson (ST:ERICb), but the White House dismissed that proposal on Friday.
The EU last week said members should decide for themselves what part Huawei can play in their 5G networks, resisting pressure from Washington for an outright ban.
Merkel favors strict security requirements for Germany's 5G network, but opposes excluding individual companies. 

Roettgen sees growing support for taking a tougher line by requiring firms that roll out a 5G network to be free of political influence in their home country, a move clearly aimed at Huawei.

SHENZHEN, China/BEIJING (Reuters) - The Chinese economy will sputter towards normal on Monday after the coronavirus outbreak forced an extended holiday, although numerous stores and factories will remain shut and many white collar employees will continue working from home.
The usually week-long Lunar New Year holiday was extended by 10 days in much of China amid mounting alarm over an epidemic that as of Saturday morning had killed 722 people.
Huge cities including Beijing and Shanghai seem like ghost towns, with shops and restaurants closed or empty, and as containment measures including transportation curbs are enforced in many parts of the country. Some cities are keeping schools closed and restrictions on movements remain.
Many employers in the southern technology hub of Shenzhen are taking precautions to prevent workers from returning in large crowds, asking those who have traveled from elsewhere to self-quarantine for up to 14 days.
Calls to the hotlines of an NGO serving migrant workers in nearby city of Guangzhou have multiplied in recent days.
""People are asking, 'what if my factory hasn't put enough safety measures in place? Will there be a notice suspending work again? How do I get in to work if roads are sealed off?'"" said Ice Huang, a spokeswoman for the Inno Community Development Organization.
Apple Inc (O:AAPL) said on Friday its retail stores in China would stay closed, even as it worked toward opening its corporate offices and contact centers.
Apple supplier Foxconn (TW:2317) plans only to ""gradually"" restart its factories with a view to resuming full production in late February, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
While in Shanghai, the city government said Tesla's (O:TSLA) factory would reopen on Monday.
The toll on China's already-slowing economy has been heavy, with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) cutting its first quarter GDP target to 4% from 5.6% previously and saying an even deeper hit is possible.
""It's certainly not going to be a return to normal next week,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics in Singapore. ""The longer this disruption continues the higher the risk it affects employment and the higher the risk of a much bigger hit on the economy,"" he said.
TEMPERATURE CHECKS, HOME QUARANTINE
In Shenzhen, businesses looking to reopen were required to check the recent travel history of all staff and implement temperature checks and prevention measures such as providing masks. Similar guidelines were in place elsewhere.
Some businesses told Reuters that they were not sure when they would reopen.
""We're still not sure we'll be open on Monday,"" Suki, who works in human resources for a Belgian-owned manufacturing company in Shenzhen and declined to give her surname.
""We applied online to open five days ago but inspectors only visited today,"" she said on Friday.
Still, Sunday is set to be the peak travel day of the Lunar New Year period, an official from the Transport Ministry said this week, as millions of Chinese return from their holidays.
U.S. confectionary and pet food maker Mars said it was advising its China staff to continue working from home until at least Feb. 14 and providing masks, while apparel brand Agnes B said it had bought disinfectant to clean its offices. Major tech companies such as Hangzhou-headquartered e-commerce giant  Alibaba  Group (N:BABA) have told staff to continue working from home beyond Feb. 10 until further notice, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Alibaba did not respond to a request for comment. One engineer who works for a mobile phone manufacturer company in Shenzhen said she was told to return to work on Monday but was unsure whether to go. ""It's choosing between earning enough to live and living,"" she said."

""We expect Boeing to open that market - it would surprise me if they didn't. If we were to get access to the market for the 737's successor it would double our market share in this key segment,"" Winkler said.
Winkler also said he saw no risk of a takeover given MTU Aero's high share price, which pushed it into Germany's blue-chip benchmark DAX index (GDAXI) last year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A raft of earnings reports from consumer discretionary companies and U.S. retail sales data set for the coming week could help investors determine to what extent the coronavirus is hitting consumer demand.
The S&P consumer discretionary sector (SPLRCD) has been among the index’s best performers this year, gaining about 3.4% and trailing only the technology (SPLRCT), utilities (SPLRCU) and communications services (SPLRCL) sectors.
But discretionary stocks could be in for a bumpy ride if companies warn that the coronavirus outbreak is weighing on their earnings outlook. Coronavirus concerns could also show up in the U.S. retail sales report for January, due on Friday.
""It could have an impact on the year, not just the quarter,"" said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh. ""People are going to freak out a little bit - you are going to have your retail investor that is going to say they don’t want to be in (the sector) anymore because it’s not growing.""
Analysts expect retail sales to show an increase of 0.3% in January from the previous month, matching the increase seen for December.
Companies expected to report include  Hilton Worldwide  (N:HLT),  Under Armour  (N:UAA), MGM Resorts (N:MGM) and  Expedia  Group (O:EXPE). Coronavirus concerns have already weighed on some of these stocks - MGM shares tumbled around 10% in late January after the spreading outbreak shuttered casinos in Macau. But they rebounded more than 2% in the latest week.
In recent weeks KFC licensee Yum China (N:YUMC) said it could report an operating loss in the first quarter and take a significant hit to sales and productivity due to the coronavirus outbreak after it was forced to shut nearly a third of its stores in China.
The announcement came on the heels of a similar warning from U.S. cafe chain Starbucks (O:SBUX), which said it would delay a planned upward revision to its outlook for the year and expected a material but temporary financial hit.
Disruptions to the global supply chain caused by the coronavirus could also pressure consumer names. China accounts for over 10% of global trade in goods excluding energy and intermediate foods, Oxford Economics said in a report.
Some areas, such as capital goods - which are used to produce other goods or services - are likely to be at greater risk, the firm said.
Historically high valuations may also make some stocks in the sector more vulnerable to a pullback. The forward price-to-earnings ratio for the sector is over 22, approaching levels not seen since June 2009. That compares with its 20-year average of 18.3 and the current 18.5 for the broad S&P 500 (SPX).
Companies that have expanded their online sales may be better able to weather disruptions, analysts said.
""It may put the leaders in a big lead and the laggards in a bigger lag,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago. ""We are going to continue to see the gap grow."""

""I am not afraid of being voted out of office,"" Rohner was quoted as saying by newspaper Schweiz am Wochenende on Saturday, adding that the supervisory board had acted unanimously in deciding with Thiam that he should step down. 
Rohner also said he had received ""clear responses"" from shareholders supporting the decision.
Credit Suisse, which is Switzerland's second-largest bank and among the biggest in Europe's largest, hopes Thiam's exit will draw a line under the scandal that hit its reputation and shocked the Swiss financial community.
But the move also runs the risk of irking international shareholders who had backed Thiam, not Rohner. Credit Suisse and Thiam, CEO for almost five years, say he was not aware it was spying on former executives including wealth manager Iqbal Khan, who defected to rival UBS.
Thomas Gottstein, who heads the Swiss business at Credit Suisse, will take over from Thiam, the Zurich-based lender said on Friday, ending a conflict between Thiam and Rohner over the surveillance scandal.
Credit Suisse's board said Rohner had its backing to complete his term until April 2021. Whether shareholders will support him at this year's annual meeting remains to be seen. 
""You can never be certain. But I have no indication that my re-election could be in danger,"" Rohner said.
Choosing Gottstein, the first Swiss citizen to run Credit Suisse in almost 20 years, to replace French-Ivorian Thiam was not a knee-jerk reaction, he added.

""We assessed various candidates. We do that regularly, twice a year, in fact ... That enabled us now to reach a decision quickly,"" Rohner was quoted as saying.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Friday told four automakers it had closed an antitrust investigation into a voluntary agreement the companies reached with California on emissions without taking any action, three automakers and a source told Reuters.
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, BMW AG and Honda Motor Co confirmed the probe had been ended. A source confirmed it had also been closed in connection with Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) as well. Volkswagen did not immediately comment.
The Trump administration in September issued a determination that California cannot set its own vehicle emission standards and had been investigating if the companies engaged in anti-competitive conduct in striking the deal. The Justice Department did not immediately comment.
California Governor Gavin Newsom said ""these trumped up charges were always a sham – a blatant attempt by the Trump administration to prevent more automakers from joining California and agreeing to stronger emissions standards. This is a big loss for the president and his weaponization of federal agencies – and a victory for anyone who cares about the rule of law and clean air.""
The deal with the California Air Resources Board announced in July bypassed a White House effort to strip the state of the right to fight climate change by setting its own standards and drew anger from President Donald Trump.
After the probe became public, at least one automaker that had been seriously considering joining the voluntary agreement opted not to do so.
California and other states had vowed to enforce stricter Obama-era emissions standards after Trump proposed rolling back the federal rules in August 2018. Automakers had worried that court battles between state and federal governments could create years of uncertainty for manufacturers.
The plan is more stringent than Trump's proposal but looser than the Obama-era rule.
The Environmental Protection Agency last year derided the agreement as ""a PR stunt that does nothing to ... provide certainty and relief for American consumers.""
Democrats in Congress suggested the probe was politically motivated and demanded the Justice Department point to similar probes of voluntary agreements.
The White House still must finalize the rollback of the Obama-era standards. Last month, Reuters reported the White House is reviewing a draft final proposal that would boost the stringency of U.S. vehicle emission standards by 1.5% annually from the 2021 through 2026 model years, which will still be considerably lower than planned Obama-era standards that hiked yearly requirements by about 5% annually.

The Trump administration initially proposed freezing fuel economy standards at 2020 levels through 2026.

Luminus' Adam Weitzman, an expert in offshore oil drilling who has experience in debt and equity capital markets and risk management, will join Valaris' 11-member board as a 12th director, the company said.
The New York-based hedge fund, which owns roughly 18.7% of Valaris' shares, promised to hold on to a certain number of shares in order to keep the board seat and to support Valaris' slate at this year's annual meeting.
""Luminus applauds Valaris' recent moves to augment the Board, and we are pleased to have reached a comprehensive agreement with Valaris,"" Weitzman said in a statement.
The announcement comes roughly two months after tensions appeared to mount between the two sides. In late November Luminus, which had increased its ownership stake from 4.5%, said it planned to call a special shareholder meeting and push for more changes. The company had earlier promised an additional $100 million in costs and to add two new board members.
Luminus oversees more than $2.5 billion for clients in energy and power investments.

BOSTON (Reuters) - New York state's top pension fund official said it was reviewing whether to divest from 27 coal companies and could make decisions on $98 million in holdings within two months.
The reviews by the third-largest U.S. state pension system, with $211 billion under management, could set the tone for other retirement plans facing public concerns about climate change. 
New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli in an interview on Tuesday said his office began reaching out several weeks ago to companies with at least 10% of revenue from thermal coal, or coal burned to produce electricity.
The pension fund sent letters asking how much they are spending to move away from coal burned to produce electricity, how much of their revenue stems from low-emission technologies, among other factors. He declined to estimate how many companies might be excluded.
""We want to stay broadly invested, and a lot of our investment is through passive vehicles. But we want to be sure companies are positioned for the long term,"" he told Reuters.
Under review are Arch Coal Inc, Consol Energy Inc, and Peabody Energy Corp among others. 
Representatives for Arch, Consol and Peabody did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Coal mining stocks have been under pressure as utilities have turned to other fuel sources such as natural gas and renewables, cutting total U.S. carbon emissions in four of the past five years.
The shares make up just a fraction of the $211 billion in total assets of the state public pension system, making any decision somewhat symbolic, DiNapoli acknowledged. 
Other pension systems have taken similar steps including the largest, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, which said in 2017 it had sold stock in 14 companies including Arch and Peabody, following a state law requiring it to study and potentially divest from the sector.
But at the time it identified three other thermal coal companies not subject to divestment ""because they had indicated plans to transition their business models to adapt to clean energy generation.""
DiNapoli intends to begin reviews of other energy holdings, such as for investments related to oil sands projects, as soon as this year, he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. securities regulator is on a collision course with powerful hedge funds executives, including former White House advisor Carl Icahn and Republican mega-donor Paul Singer, over a proposal they say could reduce shareholder voting rights.
Monday marked the deadline for investors to submit feedback on a Securities and Exchange Commission proposal to impose checks on ""proxy advisors,"" who counsel investors on how to vote in company elections. The rule would require proxy advisors to allow companies to vet their voting advice before publication. [L2N27L0X4]
Companies, supported by many Republican lawmakers, have lobbied hard for the November proposal, public records show. They contend proxy advisors have too much power over corporate votes, tip the scale in favor of activists, and are error-prone.
But the SEC's draft rule has outraged many influential activist hedge fund managers, some of whom have donated to Republicans and supported President Donald Trump's business agenda. 
The changes ""would hamper the firms' ability to offer efficient and impartial advice...amplifying the views of issuers and chilling valid criticisms,"" Elliott Management wrote in its comment letter published Tuesday. 
""By distorting the information available to investors, the proposal threatens the integrity of the markets,"" said Elliott, whose founder Singer has given tens of millions of dollars to Republican groups, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
Third Point LLC's Daniel Loeb last week told clients in a letter seen by Reuters that the aggressive lobbying for the rules marked Washington's ""'swamp' at its worst."" The rules would allow ""an end run around shareholder rights,"" wrote Loeb, who donated at least a million dollars to conservatives in 2018. 
Aneliya Crawford, a partner at law firm Schulte Roth & Zabel, said her activist hedge fund clients were ""united"" against the proposal and ""universally feel that they have been given no preferred treatment"" by proxy advisors. 
At meetings in New York and Washington over recent months, investors have forcefully pressed their concerns with SEC Chairman Jay Clayton, four people with knowledge of the talks said. They added that Clayton appeared taken-aback by the strong reaction. 
Sandwiched between competing powerful Republican interests, the former Wall Street lawyer must craft a tricky compromise, they said.
A spokeswoman for Clayton did not immediately provide comment. Last week, Republican Commissioner Elad Roisman said it was a ""myth"" that the agency acted at the behest of lobbyists and that the proposal would not hurt shareholders. [L1N29Z22Y] 
The brewing pushback first spilled into public view in November when Icahn slammed the proposal in an op-ed, saying it would have ""disastrous repercussions for the U.S. economy."" 
The rebuke was especially striking because Icahn advised Trump on regulatory matters from late 2016 to mid-2017 and had a hand in Clayton's appointment, according to one of the sources.

Three of the sources said Clayton has privately agreed that the proposal should be revamped before it goes to a final vote, expected in March or April.

(Reuters) -  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) pulled in $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time on Thursday, beating expectations as efforts to make its platform more user-friendly brought in more people, and sending its shares up 14% in early trading.
Twitter recorded most of its revenue growth in the United States, a major market where the company will face scrutiny this year over how it tackles misinformation ahead of the presidential election in November.
The company has continued efforts to boost sign-ups through measures such as allowing people to follow topics, and by trying to clean up abusive content. Late last year, it launched a feature for users to hide certain replies on their tweets.
Twitter has also focused on relevant content and notifications, which has boosted average monetisable daily active users (mDAU), or users who see ads when logged in through twitter.com or Twitter applications.
That metric rose to 152 million in the fourth quarter through Dec. 31 from 126 million a year earlier, beating the average analyst expectation of 147.5 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Shares were up 14% at $38.03 in early trading.
Quarterly revenue https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/TWITTER-RESULTS/0H001R89JBSE/index.html?eikon=true grew 11% from a year earlier to $1.01 billion, also beating the expectation of $996.7 million. Total advertising revenue was $885 million, an increase of 12% year-over-year.
The company, however, forecast first-quarter revenue between $825 million and $885 million, largely below the Wall Street estimate of $872.6 million.
Rolling out new features at a faster pace is one of Twitter's top priorities for the year, Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey said during an earnings call with analysts.
""The time it takes to go from an idea to shipping something remarkable to customers simply takes too long,"" he said.
Twitter also posted fourth-quarter net income lower than expectations, at $119 million, or 15 cents per share, down from $255 million a year earlier. Excluding items, it earned 25 cents a share, below the expectation of 29 cents.
Twitter's total U.S. revenue rose 17% to $591 million, compared with a 3% uptick in international revenue.
In November, Twitter banned political ads amid growing pressure on social media companies to stop accepting commercials containing misleading or false information.
But this week's Iowa caucuses showed the platform was still being used to spread false allegations of voter fraud.
On Tuesday, Twitter said it would apply ""false"" warning labels to tweets containing synthetic or deceptively edited forms of media and remove such media if it is likely to cause harm.
Quarterly total operating expenses, including cost of revenue, rose by 22% year-over-year to $854 million, partly due to a planned increase in headcount.
Twitter said its total costs and expenses would increase 20% this year as it also plans to build a new data server, which executives said would help the company test new products and release them faster.
""Their guidance for an increase in operating expense means they won’t grow profits as fast as they have in the past,"" said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, adding he believes investors are currently more interested in the company's user growth.

The company expects first-quarter operating income of between breakeven and $30 million.

(Reuters) -  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) on Thursday moved forward by a year its target to achieve a measure of profitability to the fourth quarter of 2020, but the ride-hailing company still expects to lose a total of more than $1 billion this year. 
Uber shares were up 5% in after-hours trading on the news, with Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi saying the company would cut costs, aim to generate more repeat-customer business and try to increase use of premium ride services. 
He also said Uber would accelerate growth at the company's loss-making food delivery business, Uber Eats, to become the top player in most of its worldwide markets, eventually increasing the segment's margins, currently a drag on Uber earnings.
Khosrowshahi revealed the new profitability target on a conference call with investors after the company reported results for the fourth quarter of last year, in which it continued to lose money, but increased its customer base. 
Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell said the onus was now on management to deliver on that promise.
Uber in November promised to be profitable on an adjusted basis by the end of 2021, excluding expenses for stock-based compensation and other items.
The company on Thursday said it still expected an adjusted EBITDA loss of $1.25 billion to $1.45 billion for the full year of 2020.
In the fourth quarter of 2019, Uber boosted its revenue on an increase in global monthly active users to more than 111 million, but high costs at Uber Eats meant it continued to lose money as it tries to outspend competitors.
Some analysts remained skeptical about Uber's continued investment in the highly competitive food delivery market. Eric Ross, an analyst at Cascend Securities, said he preferred the stock of Uber's smaller ride-hailing competitor,  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT), because it does not invest in expensive side projects.
Uber has vastly diversified its business over the past five years. Besides expanding its food delivery segment, Uber is also developing self-driving cars, working on long-haul trucking operations and even planning commercial passenger drone shuttles.
Lyft is expected to report quarterly results on Feb. 11.
CASH BURNING
In the fourth quarter, Uber's total revenue rose 37% to $4.07 billion on a yearly basis, roughly in line with analyst estimates. 
But its net loss widened to $1.1 billion from a loss of $887 million a year earlier.
Three-quarters of Uber's revenue came from its ride-hailing service and the segment had its best quarter yet, boosted by strong growth in its premium rides segment, including Uber Comfort, which transports passengers in larger cars. On its own, Uber's ride-hailing business would be profitable, but Uber's total costs rose 25.2% to $5.04 billion in the quarter.
While revenue at Uber Eats grew nearly 14% on a quarterly basis, spending on promotional incentives outpaced the segment's revenue growth. Promotional costs as a share of revenue at Uber's Eats business grew 4% from the third quarter.
In reaching its profitability goal, Uber has vowed to exit markets where it could not become the dominant food delivery player. 
The company in January sold its food-ordering business in India to local competitor Zomato, in exchange taking a stake in the startup. The Indian business contributed only 3% of gross bookings in the first nine months of last year, but accounted for a quarter of the company's adjusted operating losses.
Investors welcomed the news as a sign of Uber prioritizing profit over growth, sending the company's shares up on Jan. 21, the day after the announcement.
Uber's business model, which depends on contractors transporting passengers and delivering food, also is under threat from regulators around the world as states and cities try to increase driver pay, lower congestion and increase safety.
Khosrowshahi on Thursday said Uber was engaged in dialogue with regulators around the world and was hopeful the regulatory environment would improve.

441,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2020 07:23PM ET</span>",Airbus likely to acquire Bombardier's remaining stake in A220 passenger jet: sources,"By Allison Lampert and Tim Hepher
MONTREAL/PARIS (Reuters) - Europe's Airbus SE (PA:AIR) is likely to acquire Canadian plane and train maker Bombardier Inc's (TO:BBDb) remaining stake in the A220 passenger jet program, two industry sources said.
A deal for Airbus to buy the 33.58% share in the program was widely expected after Bombardier said in January it was reviewing the stake in the joint venture. Barring surprises, a deal is expected next week ahead of both companies' earnings reports on Feb. 13, the sources added.
Airbus and Bombardier both declined to comment. The terms of a potential deal that would mark Bombardier's exit from commercial aviation were unclear. 
Bombardier, which is weighing additional asset sales, faced a cash crunch in 2015 due to its high-stakes bet on the technologically advanced narrowbody.
Bombardier shares closed up 2.8%.
Montreal-based Bombardier ceded control of the program to Airbus in 2018 for a token C$1 as part of broader efforts to improve its finances. It retained a minority stake alongside the Canadian province of Quebec.
Bombardier had warned the program would require additional cash to ramp up production, and could be subject to a writedown, as it faces higher-than-expected costs in its rail division and more than $9 billion of debt.
Since Airbus took over the program, the A220 has seen a sharp pickup in sales to 658 orders as of Jan. 31. But it has not seen the cost declines expected from Airbus applying its greater purchasing power with suppliers, one of the sources said.
A deal would leave Airbus to shoulder additional investments required by the plane program.
""Airbus did not particularly want to do this at this time, but is presented with little choice if Bombardier is pulling back,"" the second source said. 
Airbus, with a 50.6% stake in the program, delivered 48 A220 jets in 2019 and is ramping up production toward its maximum monthly capacity of 10 jets in Mirabel, Quebec, and four planes at a second line in Alabama by mid-decade.
Airbus Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer told Reuters in January the company was progressing toward its target of a double-digit percentage reduction in the A220's production costs.
Quebec, with a 16.36% stake in the A220 program, would not invest further. Rather, it is trying to protect the program's estimated 2,700 jobs, along with the province's $1 billion investment in the program, Economy Minister Pierre Fitzgibbon said on Monday.
""We put $1 billion in it and that's enough.""

(Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) narrowly missed a ""catastrophic failure"" during its December flight test of an unmanned space taxi that was cut short by an unrelated problem, a NASA safety review panel said Thursday, recommending that the agency examine Boeing's software verification process before letting it fly humans to space.
The newly revealed software bug, which Boeing said was fixed while the CST-100 Starliner was still in orbit, could have ""led to erroneous thruster firings"" that could have resulted in ""a catastrophic spacecraft failure,"" panel member Paul Hill said.
Boeing and NASA officials had zeroed in on an unrelated glitch, with the spacecraft's automated timer, hours after the spacecraft failed to reach its intended orbit 30 minutes into flight. The timer malfunction forced the craft to scrub its rendezvous with the International Space Station, and the Starliner returned to Earth a week early. 
NASA still must decide whether to make Boeing repeat the unmanned docking test before spacecraft can carry astronauts. Boeing recorded a $410 million charge last month to cover that possibility.
""The panel has a larger concern with the rigor of Boeing’s verification processes,” said Hill, a former NASA flight director who now serves on the panel that advises NASA on safety issues. Speaking during the panel's quarterly meeting on Thursday, Hill said the agency should go beyond merely correcting the cause of the anomalies and scrutinize Boeing's entire software testing processes. 
""We are already working on many of the recommended fixes including re-verifying flight software code,"" Boeing said in a statement, adding that it believes its engineers have found the cause of one of the software issues and have recommended to NASA corrective actions.
Boeing and Elon Musk's rival SpaceX company are building separate space taxis to ferry astronauts to the space station under NASA's effort to revive its human spaceflight program.

DETROIT (Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) on Friday shook up its top management, naming strategy chief Jim Farley as chief operating officer of the No. 2 U.S. automaker and promising skeptical investors the company will kick a slow-moving turnaround into a higher gear. 
Ford's move positions Farley, 57, as potential heir to Chief Executive Jim Hackett, who took over in May 2017. Farley is currently president of new businesses, technology and strategy but will now be responsible for all global operations as well as future technology such as self-driving cars. 
News of Farley's promotion and the retirement of automotive president Joe Hinrichs, another potential CEO candidate, effective on March 1, came three days after Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford saw its shares slide following a disappointing forecast. On Friday, Ford shares were off as much as 2.8% to their lowest price since January 2019 and finished the day down about 1.7 percent. 
Farley told Reuters that Ford needs to move more quickly, especially around taking advantage of the software, data and connectivity in its vehicles including commercial vehicles. Farley added that Ford was ""deep"" in partnership talks with digital companies to improve its customer experience. 
""We put a lot of new cost and capability in these new vehicles,"" Farley said in a telephone interview. ""We have to get a lot quicker in taking advantage of them. We do not have two or three years to figure out how we use connectivity in the F-150 and our new electric architecture that we launch later this year.""
Ford is in the midst of a global restructuring and faces slumping demand in China, its second-largest market. Hackett said on a conference call with reporters that the company needs to move with greater speed, echoing what some investors have said. 
""It's my judgment the time is to move with urgency now to fully integrate and accelerate Ford's transformation,"" Hackett said.
""We're now in execution mode and what the company needs is to come together,"" Hackett added, saying he had no plans to leave the company after almost three years on the job and it was the board's role to manage succession.
Analysts and investors have speculated how long Hackett, 64, will remain as CEO and whether an internal executive or an outsider will succeed him. Ford's struggles, including a poor launch of its new Ford Explorer SUV and rising warranty costs, have only heightened speculation.
Ford restructuring is far from complete. It said on Tuesday it has booked $3.7 billion of the projected $11 billion in charges it previously said it would take, and expects to book another $900 million to $1.4 billion this year.
In China, Ford lost $771 million last year, about half the 2018 loss, and its market share there has shrunk. Ford has been struggling to revive sales there since its business began slumping in late 2017, and now the world's largest market has been hit by a fast-spreading coronavirus that has killed more than 630 people.
Another key element for 2020 is Ford's planned introduction of a fully redesigned F-150 full-sized pickup truck, its top profit generator, as well as the Mustang Mach-E electric SUV and the Ford Bronco utility vehicle.
Farley joined Ford in 2007 as global head of marketing and sales and went on to lead Lincoln, South America, Ford of Europe and all of Ford's global markets in successive roles. He previously worked at Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203).

Farley is credited, along with Hackett, in forcing the redesign before its introduction of the Mach-E and the decision to make it a Mustang vehicle, leveraging that iconic brand. Farley has owned seven of the cars starting with a 1965 model he restored when he was 14 years old.

445,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2020 07:22PM ET</span>",Uber and Lyft take different roads in search of profit,"By Tina Bellon
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) and  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT), the two leading U.S. ride-hailing companies, are on divergent paths as Uber pours money into money-losing side businesses while smaller rival Lyft focuses on moving people around.
Uber shares shot up 9% on Friday after the company said on Thursday it could achieve a measure of company-wide profitability in the fourth quarter of 2020, a year ahead of a previous target. That measure excludes expenses for stock-based compensation and other items. Uber still expects to lose more than $1 billion for all of 2020.
Uber and Lyft, both based in San Francisco, are ride hailing's odd couple. Uber is much larger, with $3.8 billion in revenues for the first nine months of 2019 compared to $956 million for Lyft. At almost $69 billion, Uber's market valuation is nearly five times that of Lyft's - and well ahead of automaker General Motors Co (N:GM).
Uber operates in more markets around the world, although it has clashed with regulators in London and Germany and struggled in some Asian markets. Lyft focuses on North America.
Lyft has more quickly developed ways to retain high-paying repeat riders across its entire operation via a single subscription model it launched in October. Uber on Thursday told investors 2020 would be the ""year of subscriptions"" when it plans to combine its loyalty programs across rides and food delivery into a single plan. 
Uber currently offers a cross-platform points rewards program and in 2018 launched a monthly subscription that protects riders against surge pricing because of traffic or weather, available in 40 U.S. cities.
Uber's ride-hailing business, which generates around three quarters of its revenue, is profitable right now. Uber's other operations are dragging down the company's bottom line. Over the past five years, Uber has built out its food-delivery business Eats, developed self-driving cars, worked on long-haul trucking operations and even on commercial passenger drone shuttles.
All of those businesses are money losers. Uber Eats recorded an adjusted EBITDA loss of $777 million in the last two quarters of 2019, the two quarters for which it broke out that metric.
Most major analysts still prefer shares of Uber. Its size, the profitability of its ride-hailing segment and its ability to withstand regional downturns or regulatory pressure in a single market made it a safer long-term investment, said Angelo Zino, analyst at CFRA. 
But some analysts said Lyft is a less-risky bet.
""We prefer Lyft because it focuses on the most profitable business in North America, the largest rides market,"" Cascend Securities analyst Eric Ross said.
Uber and Lyft declined to comment. 
Lyft is reporting fourth quarter earnings on Feb. 11. In October it told investors it would be adjusted EBITDA profitable by the end of 2021. Analysts said they did not expect Lyft to move its profit target.
Lyft has integrated public transit information into its app for seven U.S. cities in the hopes of turning its app into a single transportation platform. Uber has integrated transit information of eight U.S. cities and allows customers in Las Vegas and Denver to purchase public transit tickets through its app.
Dan Morgan, portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, said Uber should focus on what it does best - connecting customers through its app - and ditch efforts to develop its own self-driving cars or passenger drone technology.

""If you're losing as much money as Uber, it makes sense to leave those businesses to other companies who have the competency,"" Morgan said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of Kraft Heinz Co (O:KHC) spiked more than 4% on Friday after a Twitter account closely resembling that of financial publication Barron's said the food company had been approached for a buyout. 
The company's stock rose to a session high of $30.30 at around noon ET (1700 GMT), minutes after the tweet from ""@barronsfinance,"" an account with more than 5,000 followers on Twitter. The account uses a similar logo to the official Barron's account, which goes under the handle ""@barronsonline."" 
The tweet was later deleted.
Trading volume in Kraft Heinz options was also heavier than usual. 
Activity in call options, used to position for a rise in shares, first spiked around 10 am ET (1500 GMT), shortly before the @barronsfinance account initially tweeted about ""takeover chatter"" regarding Kraft Heinz, according to data from options analytics platform Trade Alert.
Options activity picked up again around the time of the second tweet.
Two of the biggest trades in Kraft Heinz options were for calls expiring on Friday at a strike price of $29.50, near the shares' closing price, the data showed.
Kraft Heinz shares ended Friday's session 1.7% higher at $29.54. Volume on the session was over 13 million shares, 1.9 times its 10-day average of 7.04 million shares.
A spokesman for Kraft Heinz declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Dow Jones & Company, the publisher of Barron's, said @barronsfinance was not affiliated with the publication.

450,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 07, 2020 04:19PM ET</span>","Stocks - S&P Falls, but Posts Best Week in 8 Months","By Yasin Ebrahim 
Investing.com – Wall Street capped a strong week with a loss on Friday as lingering concerns about the coronavirus offset U.S. employment data showing the economy created more jobs than expected last month.
The S&P 500 fell 0.54%, Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.54% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 0.94%. The Dow and S&P had their best weeks in eight months.
The U.S. created 225,000 jobs last month, well above economists' consensus forecast of 160,000, pointing to underlying strength in the economy.
The surprise uptick in the unemployment rate and slowing wage growth were largely shrugged off, with analysts suggested the labor market strength will continue thanks to reduced U.S.-China trade uncertainty.
""Job markets still leave the current domestic economic backdrop in the U.S. looking solid, and that largely before any effects of reduced trade uncertainty tied to the U.S.-China trade truce of early 2020 has really had a chance to have a significant impact,"" RBC said.
But the jobs report did little to help stocks amid lingering fears over the coronavirus, which has infected more than 31,000 individuals and killed at least 636.
Since the outbreak, Wall Street has fretted that the virus' impact on global growth would spill over into the global market. Those fears, however, have been eased somewhat by expectations that central banks will act to stem any economic wobble.
But some on Wall Street appear less optimistic.
""The new coronavirus outbreak abroad has created some new risks to the near-term external growth backdrop, but there is little apparent reason for monetary policymakers to consider rate cuts at the moment, and we continue to expect the Fed to sit on the sidelines through 2020,"" RBC said in a note.
With global growth expected to take a hit,   Caterpillar   (NYSE:CAT), a bellwether of global economic activity, fell more than 2.8%, pushing materials deeper into the red. 
Technology also weighed on the broader market, paced by a broader decline in chip stocks amid worries a prolonged lockdown could weigh on supply chain operations and industrial production throughout mainland China.
Energy also proved a big drag on the broader market as oil prices turned negative as traders weighed up the potential impact on global demand from the virus against a possible decision by OPEC and Russia to make additional production cuts.
Elsewhere, bedding company Casper Sleep (NYSE:CSPR), which made a strong trading debut on Thursday, fell 16%.
On the earnings front, Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) surged on better-than-expected earnings.
Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) surged 10% as the company said it would turn out a profit earlier than expected. The positive outlook came just after the company reported quarterly results that topped Wall Street estimates.
And Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) ended the day up 9.5%."
451,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 07, 2020 04:15PM ET</span>",Stock Slide Deepens After Torrid Run; Bonds Rise: Markets Wrap,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. equities extended losses in afternoon trading as renewed concern the coronavirus will slow global growth overshadowed fresh signs of a strong labor market. Treasuries jumped.
The S&P 500 Index halted a four-day rally, but remained on track for its best week since June, as automakers and other industrial companies led losses. The latest jobs report showed hiring stayed robust last month, bolstering optimism growth can persist. But stocks remained lower after reports of further infections, an increase in deaths and more quarantines.
The Federal Reserve warned the outbreak posed a “new risk” to the economy. The fallout for companies is starting to come into focus, with corporations such as Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. temporarily halting operations in China. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).’s iPhone maker Foxconn told employees not to return to work when China’s extended break ends Monday.
The 10-year Treasury yield slumped below 1.6% and crude lost its grip on $51 a barrel.
“The market moved up so quickly over the last few days and I think papered over the continued risk associated with the coronavirus,” said Robin Anderson, senior global economist at Principal Global Investors. “There’s still a lot of unknowns out there.”
Australia’s dollar dropped to its lowest level in a decade with the fallout from the coronavirus hurting riskier assets. Equities pushed lower across most of Asia as news of further infections on a cruise ship off Japan offered another reminder that cases remain on the rise. Singapore boosted its disease response to the second-highest level, the same one for the SARS epidemic. Confirmed cases worldwide now total 31,432, having risen more than 3,000 in one day, while the death toll reached 638.

(Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) kept Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan's 2019 compensation flat at $26.5 million, according a filing on Friday.
The decision was the latest sign of restraint from bank boards after a year of robust revenue growth.
For instance, Morgan Stanley's board made the rare move of cutting CEO James Gorman's pay 7% to $27 million for 2019 in an effort to reduce expenses. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Chase's board gave Chief Executive Jamie Dimon just a half-million-dollar raise.
In 2018, Moynihan was awarded a 15% increase in total compensation after Bank of America posted record profit of $28.1 billion. Total 2019 income was declined slightly due the impact of ending a joint venture during the year. Excluding that impact, profit rose to $29.1 billion, a performance that would typically prompt the board to give the CEO a raise.

In all for 2019, Moynihan earned a base salary of $1.5 million and equity incentive award of $25 million, the bank said in a filing https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/70858/000007085820000007/bac-2720208xk.htm.

453,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2020 04:02PM ET</span>","More pain in store for Canadian marijuana companies after Aurora Cannabis, Tilray cut jobs","By Nichola Saminather
TORONTO (Reuters) - Investors are bracing for more job cuts and writedowns at Canadian cannabis producers before the industry stabilizes and becomes profitable, after two of the biggest weed companies,  Aurora Cannabis  (TO:ACB) and Tilray (O:TLRY) announced cost reductions this week.
Canada legalized recreational cannabis in October 2018 but profits have proven elusive for most marijuana companies as fewer-than-expected retail stores, higher prices than on the black market and slow overseas growth resulted in oversupply.
""The Aurora story will be much more common in 2020,"" said Hap Sneddon, founder and chief portfolio manager at Castlemoore. ""I don't see rationalization. I see companies leaving the business.""
Many producers, including  Canopy Growth  (TO:WEED) (N:CGC), Aurora, Tilray and Aphria (TO:APHA) rapidly expanded at home and overseas as capital flooded into the industry before legalization.
Aurora announced a writedown on Thursday of as much as C$1 billion, 500 job cuts and the departure of its chief executive. Tilray said on Tuesday it cut 10% of its workforce, or about 140 jobs.
Lack of profitability is common in new industries, but a prolonged period of higher cash burn unnerves investors.
Aurora must almost quadruple quarterly sales to meet expenses and Tilray nearly double them, according to Reuters and Infor Financial calculations, based on their latest quarterly results, before they announced the cuts.
An Aurora spokeswoman said the company was making ""aggressive changes"" because its previous cost structure was ""misaligned with the current market conditions"". The cuts and existing financing will cover costs until it sees profits, she said.
Tilray, which says it expects profits by the end of fiscal 2020, will bridge the gap with debt until then, a spokeswoman for that company said.
Short sellers made more than $60 million in paper profits on Friday from a fall in Aurora's Canadian and U.S. shares, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm. Aurora is the third most shorted pot stock tracked by S3 Partners, trailing Canopy and GW Pharma (O:GWPH).
The Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences ETF (TO:HMMJ) has lost 68% since its Oct. 16, 2018 peak.
While the sector could see some consolidation, the shareholder dilution from issuing new stock to fund deals could upset investors, said Bryden Teich, portfolio manager at Avenue Investment Management, which avoids cannabis stocks due to the challenges facing the industry.
Companies that have grown more slowly, such as Organigram Holdings (TO:OGI), can better control costs, and those with big investors, like Canopy, have a cash cushion, said Neil Selfe, chief executive of investment bank Infor Financial.
Oversupply causing a lack of demand for production and processing facilities would weigh on sales, making shutdowns and writedowns more likely, said Alan Brochstein, founder of cannabis-sector information provider 420 Investor.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pretty much everyone on Wall Street has an opinion about Tesla (O:TSLA).
The electric vehicle maker's stupendous rally in recent months has given shareholders something to cheer about, cost short sellers billions of dollars and vindicated legions of retail investors who have long adored Elon Musk's company. 
Tesla shares have soared by nearly 320% since early June, helped by the company's better-than-expected financial results and ramped-up production at its new car factory in Shanghai.
After surging 36% over Monday and Tuesday, the stock by Friday had settled back to a gain of about 15% for the week. On Friday afternoon, it was down marginally at $747.11. 
Another factor driving this week's surge may be fund managers hurrying to raise their allocation of the stock, analysts said.
""A lot of advisors and institutions, they jump in the bandwagon because they don't want to trail,"" said vocal Tesla bull Ross Gerber, president and chief executive of Gerber Kawasaki in Santa Monica, California. ""If Tesla goes to $1,000 and they don't own it, what are they going to tell their clients?""
Gerber trimmed his fund's position in the stock as the company's valuation soared. He hopes to buy more if the stock falls and said a fair valuation would be around $550.
THE BULLS 
Retail investors have driven part of the surge. 
Among Fidelity Investments customers, Tesla has been by far the most actively traded stock in recent sessions, with nearly 16,000 buy orders for the electric carmaker's shares. Twitter, ranked second overall in trading activity on Fidelity, had just over 2,000 buy orders.
On Monday, when Tesla shot up 20% in its biggest one day rally since 2013, clients at TD Ameritrade - millennials in particular - overwhelmingly took profits after having bought the stock for months, said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at the online brokerage. 
Tesla's biggest institutional shareholders are Baillie Gifford, Capital World and Vanguard, according to Refinitiv data.
It also has an international following. Retail investors in South Korea have been trading Tesla shares at a furious pace in recent weeks, buying and selling $200 million worth of stock in January, according to the Korea Securities Depository. Volume in November stood at $43 million.
Tesla options positioning is also bullish. According to data from options analytics provider Trade Alert, skew turned deeply negative this week, meaning that demand for calls, used to position for further share gains, has surpassed demand for puts, used to guard against a fall in shares. 
That's a departure from the usual dynamic in most stocks, in which options used for downside protection generally command prices higher than those for upside participation.
(Graphic: Investors rev up Tesla volatility bets - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/TESLA-INVESTORS/0H001R89MBSR/eikon.png)
Tesla's biggest winner is Musk, who stands to earn more than $1 billion thanks to Tesla's recent rally. The company's market capitalization briefly exceeded $150 billion this week, the second target in his record-breaking compensation package that opens the way to options awarded to him vesting.
(Graphic: Elon's big payout - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1841/1810/Elons%20payout.jpg) 
THE BEARS 
Many investors remain skeptical that Tesla can consistently deliver profit, cash flow and growth. More Wall Street analysts rate Tesla ""sell"" than ""buy,"" and the company's stock is the most shorted on Wall Street, with nearly $18 billion sold short. 
Those bearish investors plan to profit by selling borrowed shares and buying them back later at a lower price. Yet while short investors in Tesla have suffered paper losses of over $11 billion so far in 2020, they have mostly held their ground, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm. 
One seller in the December quarter was Saudi Arabia's public investment fund, according to a filing on Tuesday.
Some funds that reportedly hold short positions are London-based Crispin Odey, according to the Financial Times. Odey was not immediately available for comment.
The Financial Times also reported that Greenlight Capital, run by David Einhorn, had told investors last month it held a put option against Tesla, which would be a bet against the stock. A spokesman for Greenlight declined to comment.

(Reuters) - U.S. oilfield equipment supplier National Oilwell Varco (N:NOV) on Friday called the coronavirus a ""wildcard"" in the oil industry's outlook, with an extended outbreak potentially hurting access to Chinese-make materials and foreign sales.
The Houston-based company said further shutdowns at its Chinese suppliers could limit its production of certain products such as fiberglass resins and drilling pipe.
For now, National Oilwell has the latitude to make up lost ground, executives added, noting it has a diversified supply chain.
""[There is] still a lot of uncertainty related to the extent to which this will impact operations,"" Jose Bayardo, chief finance officer, said on an earnings call with investors.
China also is a growing market for its products, he said.
Chief Executive Clay Williams (NYSE:WMB) added that he was equally concerned about the virus' impact on global oil demand, which could affect its oil and gas customers. National Oilwell is one of the largest suppliers of oil drilling equipment.
An outbreak of the coronavirus in China has roiled commodity markets in recent weeks. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies are weighing additional output cuts as demand for crude oil falls.
U.S. crude futures were trading around $50.46 a barrel on Friday, on track for their fifth consecutive weekly decline.
Shares of National Oilwell were up 11% on Friday afternoon after it beat analysts forecasts for quarterly earnings.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian lawyers, who previously successfully sued Iran, are seeking class action status in a lawsuit on behalf of victims aboard a Ukrainian plane shot down over Tehran last month, looking for at least C$1.5 billion ($1.1 billion) in compensation.
The suit names Iran, its supreme leader, the elite Revolutionary Guards and others as defendants.
Iran admitted its missiles downed the Ukrainian airliner by mistake on Jan. 8, killing all 176 people aboard, including 57 Canadians.
The lead plaintiff in the case is anonymous, preliminarily identified as John Doe, and described as immediate family to a victim identified as Jack Doe. 
The filing says John Doe's identity must be protected because of the risk that ""his Iranian family would be put at risk of harm or death by the Iranian regime.""
The suit alleges that the downing of the plane was ""an intentional and deliberate act of terrorism.""
Iranian authorities did not immediately comment on Friday, when government offices are closed.
Jonah Arnold is co-lead counsel with his father Mark Arnold, who has represented clients in several suits against Iran, including a 2017 appeal decision that led to seizure of some Iranian assets in Canada.
The 2017 ruling was in a case brought by U.S. victims of bombings, killings and kidnappings that U.S. courts ruled Iran was responsible for. But the plaintiffs could not claim the $1.7 billion in judgments in the United States.
It was not clear whether Iran has any assets remaining in Canada. Arnold said the case would likely unfold over years, and any judgment could be renewed and enforced in the future.
""Providing a voice for the families and seeking compensation for them in the courts is the primary objective,"" Jonah Arnold said. ""When we get there, and we need to look for those assets, that's what we'll do.""
Besides Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, others named in the lawsuit are top commanders of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, including the head of the unit responsible for shooting down the plane, Amirali Hajizadeh.
Foreign states are not typically within the jurisdiction of Canadian courts. A 2012 Canadian law limited that immunity for countries Ottawa lists as ""foreign state supporters of terrorism,"" currently Iran and Syria.
The suit was filed Jan. 24 in Toronto, but it is not clear whether it has been served on defendants in Iran.
Arnold said the Canadian government is required to ensure that happens, and that he has received confirmation that the suit is ""en route.""

""Based on his racketeering and embezzlement conspiracy conviction, Pearson faces a maximum of five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000,"" the U.S. Attorney's Office said in a statement.
Pearson is the 12th defendant to plead guilty in connection with the ongoing criminal investigation, according to the statement.
""Vance Pearson blatantly violated his oath of office and betrayed the trust of all our hard-working members ... While our union is moving forward, we will never forget the costly lessons from our past,"" the UAW said in a statement.
Pearson was the head of the union's Region 5, which covers 17 U.S. states - a role he took over from Gary Jones after serving as his second in command."

Shares of Take-Two (NASDAQ:TTWO) plunged 10% in midday trading.
Take-Two (NASDAQ:TTWO) said after the bell Thursday it earned $1.63 per share in its fiscal third quarter, the all-important holiday period. Sales came in at $930.1 million.
Both missed expectations, with analysts predicting a profit of $1.73 per share and sales of $921.1 million, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Looking ahead, Take-Two (NASDAQ:TTWO) predicted fiscal fourth-quarter earnings of 92 cents per share to $1.12 per share on sales of $635 million to $685 million. The earnings forecast was below the S&P Capital IQ consensus of $1.13 per share.
Just two day ago the company announced that Dan Houser, one of the founder of Rockstar Games, which created the best-selling game franchises “Grand Theft Auto” and “Red Dead Redemption”, was leaving Take-Two (NASDAQ:TTWO).
That brought investor angst “to a fever pitch,” according to Bernstein analyst Todd Juenger, who took his price target on the stock down to $137 from $151 per share.

465,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2020 11:31AM ET</span>","Mediaset set to win more time to complete merger of Italy, Spain units: sources","MILAN (Reuters) -  Mediaset  (MI:MS) will submit revised plans to merge its Italian and Spanish broadcasting units (MC:TL5) under a Dutch entity to authorities in the Netherlands, securing a six-month extension to complete the project, two sources familiar with the matter said.
The extension could help the group deal with any potential delay triggered by shareholder Vivendi's (PA:VIV) legal challenges to the merger.
Mediaset, controlled by the family of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, wants to merge the units under a Dutch holding company, called MediaforEurope (MFE), to pursue a European growth strategy.
But its major shareholder  Vivendi , led by French billionaire Vincent Bollore, is fighting the project in courts across Europe, saying the governance structure of the new entity would strengthen the Berlusconis' grip on the company.
In a bid to smooth the path of its plan through the courts, Mediaset and its Spanish units recently approved amendments to MFE's bylaws.
Vivendi said the changes did not address its concerns and it is set take further legal action.
The Italian broadcaster faces a March deadline to see its Dutch holding company plan through, otherwise the decisions of a September shareholder meeting that approved the project will no longer be valid based on existing Dutch laws. The sources said that Mediaset will register the amended merger plan with the Dutch Chamber of Commerce, gaining a new six-month period to complete the merger.
One of the sources said that Mediaset was obligated to resubmit the plan after the bylaws changes but still aimed to complete the merger by the current March 19 deadline.
Earlier this week an Italian judge rejected Vivendi's request to suspend the plan. Vivendi said it would appeal against the decision.
The reorganization remains however on hold because a Spanish judge last year ruled in favor of Vivendi's request to halt the plan. A court in Spain on Thursday upheld the suspension and set a new hearing on Feb. 18.
A separate court hearing in the Netherlands on Vivendi's request to block Mediaset's overhaul is scheduled on Feb. 10."

467,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2020 10:33AM ET</span>",Tightrope Thiam: comeback CEO stung by a spying scandal,"By Carolyn Cohn and Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi
LONDON/ZURICH (Reuters) - Tidjane Thiam is unlikely to quietly retire after his abrupt exit as chief executive of  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), some of those who have worked with him predict. 
The 57-year-old Ivorian rebounded from military detention following a government coup in his home country and then from a disastrous takeover attempt of AIA whilst running insurer  Prudential  (LON:PRU) to ascend ever higher in the corporate world. 
""A bit like walking on a tightrope"", is how Thiam described leadership in 2012. ""It's rarely comfortable.....once you start looking down you risk falling, but you get on that rope again and again,"" he said in the BBC interview.
Born to a Senegalese father and mother from a prominent Ivory Coast family, the avid Arsenal soccer fan was running a government department of 4,000 people by the age of 30. 
Leaving the country after the 1999 coup, he became a partner at consultancy McKinsey, before entering insurance at  Aviva  (LON:AV) and then moving on to Prudential, becoming the FTSE 100's first black CEO in 2009.
His appointment at Credit Suisse in 2015 was a surprise move by Chairman Urs Rohner - bringing in someone who had never worked in a bank to turn around a franchise still ailing from the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.
It took three years of cost cuts, job losses and more than $10 billion of capital hikes until the lender posted its first annual profit under him. 
But Thiam won plaudits for putting the bank back on an even keel, earning more recurring fee income from wealthy clients and relying less on volatile trading revenue.
MESSY CLASH
Winning round the Swiss establishment was harder. He clashed with Rohner, and a perception that he was happier on the global conference circuit mixing with world leaders than he was talking to bankers and local politicians in Zurich and Bern irked some. 
Inside the bank, some senior staff said they felt cut off from the CEO who, even in his earliest days, could appear insulated from internal criticism by loyalists.
""The financial strategy was working, but the takeaway is soft skills are also needed in this position,"" said Filippo Alloatti, a senior analyst at Federated Hermes, who holds Credit Suisse bonds.
A messy clash with Iqbal Khan, a rising star Thiam had drafted in to turn around the bank's wealth management business, ultimately led to his demise. 
Revelations surfaced in Swiss newspapers last year that the pair noisily argued at a drinks party at Thiam's house after Khan had moved next door and began a construction project. 
Khan quit the bank in July, saying in August that he was to join rival UBS. A month later he confronted a private detective who he suspected was following him and his wife through Zurich.
A Credit Suisse investigation concluded it was an isolated incident orchestrated by Pierre-Olivier Bouee, one of Thiam's closest aides, to ensure Khan wasn't poaching staff. 
But the case widened in December after details emerged of other instances of staff surveillance. Thiam denies any knowledge of them, but it went down badly in Zurich.
And an ensuing regulatory investigation ultimately emboldened Rohner to end Thiam's reign.
Those who worked with him previously say he's unlikely to be in the wilderness for long. 
""He is as tough as nails, as tough as they get,"" said a former colleague from Prudential. 
""It's more a question of what he wants to do next"". 
Thiam's name has regularly cropped up in speculation about potential future heads of the IMF.
That job is likely to be closed following the appointment of Kristalina Georgieva in October, although the former colleague said other government work could be an option.
His successor, Swiss national Thomas Gottstein, will likely have an easier time of it in Zurich from the establishment, though living up to Thiam's strategic nous will be tougher. 
""He will be a hard act to follow,"" said Martin Gilbert, vice chairman at asset manager  Standard Life  (LON:SLA) Aberdeen.

Carla DiBello, an entrepreneur who’s close to the reality television star, is advising on the Public Investment Fund’s proposed acquisition of Premier League soccer team Newcastle United, people with knowledge of the matter said.
DiBello is working on the deal alongside British financier Amanda Staveley, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. She may also keep an ongoing advisory role if the Newcastle United acquisition goes through, one of the people said.
A consortium backed by PIF is in talks to buy Newcastle United from British billionaire Mike Ashley for about 340 million pounds ($440 million), people with knowledge of the matter have said. Ashley has been struggling to offload the team in recent years, and it’s unclear whether he will accept the offer.
Desert Polo
PIF, led by Governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan, is a key part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s efforts to diversify the Saudi economy away from its dependence on oil. It manages about $320 billion of assets, according to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute.
A spokeswoman for PIF didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. DiBello didn’t respond to emails and an Instagram message seeking comment.
DiBello has set up a boutique consulting firm called CDB Advisory, which specializes in making connections between the Middle East and North America, its website shows. She has been personally involved in more than $250 million of deals, according to her website, which doesn’t name any specific transactions.
She also writes a style column for Harper’s Bazaar Arabia and helps connect filmmakers to Middle Eastern projects. DiBello has been close friends with Kardashian for years and attended her wedding to rapper Kanye West in 2014.
More recently, DiBello has made frequent visits to Saudi Arabia. Her Instagram page shows photos of her attending the Desert Polo in January and the kingdom’s annual investment jamboree, dubbed Davos in the Desert, in October."

Uber shares, which were down almost 50% percent at the end of last year from its public launch, jumped 7% in trade before the bell as investors were also smitten by the company's aggressive plan to cut costs.
Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi is also aiming to bring in more repeat-customer business and try to increase use of premium ride services.
""We give Uber (and its board) major credit for finally listening to investors and putting the brakes on its 1980's Rock Star-like spending habits,"" brokerage Wedbush Securities said.
Khosrowshahi has been trying to change the company's image since replacing co-founder Travis Kalanick in 2017 after a series of complaints over his behavior.
""(We) believe the focus on quality bookings shows discipline as Uber emphasized the era of growth at all costs is over,"" analysts at JP Morgan said.
At least 10 brokerages raised price targets after Uber posted quarterly results that beat estimates.
Shares are up at $39.51 in pre-market trading.
Still, some analysts remained skeptical about Uber's investments in the highly competitive food delivery market, which it moved into just a few years ago.
Eric Ross, an analyst at Cascend Securities, said he preferred the stock of Uber's smaller ride-hailing competitor,  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT) because it does not invest in expensive side projects.
Uber has vastly diversified its business over the past five years.
While the company has pulled out of food delivery in some major emerging markets to cut costs, it is also developing self-driving cars, working on long-haul trucking operations and even planning commercial passenger drone shuttles.
Uber is also facing regulatory probes over the classification of its drivers for its Rides business as freelancers when they are effectively working full-time for the company and still expects a loss of more than $1 billion this year."

LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) - France is looking at ways to lure clearing in euro derivatives away from London to the European Union to lessen the risk of any forced ""relocation"" backfiring by driving business instead to the U.S., financial industry officials said.
Britain left the EU last month and no longer has a seat at the table when it comes to discussions over financial regulation, giving France an opportunity to ratchet up the pressure to win more clearing business for itself.
The London Stock Exchange's (L:LSE) LCH unit clears more than $200 billion in euro denominated derivatives daily for customers in the EU.
Globally, it clears more than 90% of euro interest rate swaps, a financial contract heavily used by companies on the continent to shield themselves against unexpected moves in borrowing costs.
Clearing is a crucial part of any transaction, ensuring deals are honored even if one side goes bust. Loss of clearing responsibilities could mean other elements, such as trading itself, moving.
Success by rival clearing house Eurex, part of Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) in Frankfurt, to win market share from LCH have been modest despite sweeteners being offered.
French finance ministry and Bank of France officials have told financial sector representatives that moving euro clearing from London to the single currency area is now a ""priority"", people with knowledge of the discussions said.
French officials told industry representatives that the EU needed to build up its own capital market.
The European Central Bank should have a ""final say"" over clearing houses dealing in large volumes of euro-denominated securities to safeguard financial stability, the people said.
The French finance ministry told industry representatives that it was looking at what sort of incentives could be provided for banks and others to move clearing voluntarily.
LCH has built up its dominance by offering efficiencies such as netting positions across different currencies to reduce the amount of margin or cash needed to back the trades.
""They are thinking how to deliver benefits similar to cross-product margining and netting across currencies if euro-denominated clearing is separated from other products,"" an industry official said.
A source at the French finance ministry said it considers clearing houses as systemic market infrastructure for the euro zone.
""We are willing to open a discussion on how to move them back to the euro zone,"" the ministry source said.
""We believe that France has all the right assets to carry out the tasks of clearing houses in the euro zone,"" the source added.
The Bank of France had no immediate comment.
After December, LCH will need permission from the EU to continue clearing swaps for customers inside the bloc under an EU market access system known as equivalence, which will feature in trade deal negotiations between Britain and the EU due to begin next month.
Access can be granted if Brussels decides that LCH's UK rules are equivalent or as strict as those in force in the EU to protect customers and financial stability.
Industry officials expect LCH to be granted equivalence at least for the medium term given the risk to financial stability if positions worth billions of euros have to be shifted at short notice.
If granted, and as a last resort, the EU can hit the ""relocation"" button, forcing LCH to move clearing to the EU to avoid losing EU clients.
LCH has a subsidiary in Paris but adapting it to clear interest rate swaps would be costly. LCH has already moved clearing in euro-denominated repurchase agreements or repo from London to Paris in the hope of easing pressure for more relocation of clearing, but it is not enough to satisfy the French authorities.
Britain has warned that forced relocation could backfire with euro clearing moving instead to the United States, which already has an equivalence agreement with the EU."

The fund, Khazanah Nasional Berhad, said in a statement that it had asked Focus Malaysia to stop releasing confidential information about the sale, saying the reports were damaging the process. A spokesman later confirmed that a legal notice had also been sent to the website.
Focus Malaysia last month published a series of reports about the sale of Malaysia Airlines, owned by the sovereign fund.
On Friday, it said it had received an email from Khazanah's lawyers asking it not to publish articles on the airline based on confidential material.
The lawyers said Khazanah reserves the right ""to commence proceedings against you for breach of confidence and to seek any other remedies as may be appropriate,"" Focus Malaysia said in a statement on its website. 
The editor in chief said the portal had published the reports in the public interest.
The government has been seeking a strategic partner for Malaysia Airlines, which has struggled to recover from two tragedies in 2014 - the disappearance of flight MH370 and the shooting down of flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine.
The Focus Malaysia reports, citing internal Khazanah documents, identified bidders for the struggling airline and detailed its finances. It also said Khazanah had been pushing for AirAsia (KL:AIRA) to merge with Malaysia Airlines.
In a statement on Friday, Khazanah said Focus Malaysia's articles have ""negatively impacted the corporate exercise"" involving the airline.
""This has affected the potential for Malaysia Airlines to achieve sustainable growth and profitability,"" it said.
The articles have also harmed the fund's reputation.
""Accordingly, we have requested for Focus Malaysia to stop publishing any information regarding the corporate exercise that would typically be considered confidential that comes into its possession,"" the fund said.
Press freedom and independence ""must be upheld together with some sense of responsibility and restraint by the press when it comes to a corporate entity conducting an on-going corporate exercise that is genuinely commercial in nature,"" Khazanah said.
Khazanah has filed a police report about Focus Malaysia's news reports, The Edge Financial Daily reported on Jan. 24.
Khazanah did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters on whether it had filed a police report. 

Reuters reported last month about the bids for Malaysia Airlines, citing sources with knowledge of the matter.

(Reuters) -  AbbVie Inc  (N:ABBV) on Friday forecast 2020 earnings above Wall Street estimates as the drugmaker expects growth to be powered by its new treatments for psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis at a time when sales of its blockbuster drug Humira slow. 
Shares of Illinois-based AbbVie rose 3.2% to $90 before the bell. 
The drugmaker expects the two treatments, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, to bring in a combined revenue of about $1.70 billion in 2020. 
The profit forecast excludes any impact from its $63 billion deal for Botox-maker Allergan Plc (N:AGN), which it expects to close in the first quarter.
""The launches of Skyrizi and Rinvoq are going extremely well,"" Chief Executive Officer Richard Gonzalez said in a statement.
In the fourth quarter, Skyrizi brought in sales of $216 million, topping estimates of $142 million, according to five analysts polled by Refinitiv. Rinvoq, which was approved in August, brought in sales of $33 million.
AbbVie is betting on new treatments and the addition of Botox to its portfolio as it braces for a revenue hit when it loses patent protection for Humira, the world's best-selling medicine, in its biggest market, the United States, in 2023. 
""While AbbVie is seeking to shine light on its early stage pipeline, we anticipate the performance of the stock will be heavily tied to ongoing Skyrizi and Rinvoq rollouts,"" said Citi analyst Andrew Baum. 
He expects investors to focus on the delivery of promised savings from the Allergan deal. 
Humira has been boosting the company's revenue ever since it was approved to treat psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. However, the drug's sales have suffered since new competition entered Europe.
Quarterly sales of the blockbuster drug were largely unchanged compared with a year earlier at $4.92 billion. But it beat expectations of $4.85 billion.
The company forecast 2020 adjusted earnings of between $9.61 and $9.71 per share, ahead of the average analysts' estimate of $9.48.
AbbVie reported net profit of $2.80 billion, or $1.88 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of $1.83 billion, or $1.23 per share, a year earlier when it recorded $4.12 billion in impairment charges.
Excluding items, the drugmaker earned $2.21 per share in the fourth quarter and beat expectations of $2.19.
Net revenue rose 4.8% to $8.70 billion, marginally higher than average analysts' estimate of $8.69 billion.

However, the company has now exited the food delivery business in key cash-sinks such as India.
AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) stock rose 3.1% after the company gave an upbeat forecast for profit this year, citing the successful launch of two new drugs that should ease concerns about the future revenue stream from its blockbuster drug Humira.
""The launches of Skyrizi and Rinvoq are going extremely well,"" Chief Executive Officer Richard Gonzalez said in a statement, adding that the new treatments for psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis should generate $1.7 billion in revenue this year.

The lawsuit was filed by three state-controlled Chinese banks which argue that they provided a loan of $925 million to Ambani’s Reliance Communications Ltd (BO:RLCM) in 2012 with the condition that he personally guarantee the debt. The comments were disclosed Friday as Ambani sought to avoid depositing funds with the court ahead of a trial.
The embattled Indian tycoon says that while he agreed to give a non-binding “personal comfort letter,” he never gave a guarantee tied to his personal assets -- an “extraordinary potential personal liability.”
The 60-year-old is the brother of Mukesh Ambani, who’s worth $56.5 billion and is the wealthiest man in Asia. Anil, on the other hand, has seen his personal fortune dwindle over recent years, losing his billionaire status. His Reliance Communications filed for bankruptcy last year.
The banks asked the judge to force Ambani to put up the full amount of the debt “or such other sum as the court consider appropriate” while the litigation continues, according to their court filings in the case.
Representatives for Ambani’s Reliance Group said Friday they couldn’t immediately comment. They said the group will issue a statement once the court issues the final order.
Ambani’s lawyer, Robert Howe, said the court shouldn’t order his client to make a payment he can’t make.
According to the banks, Ambani argued that he is unable to make any payments and that an order requiring him to do so would hinder his ability to defend himself in the case.
Bankim Thanki, an attorney representing Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China, said in a filing that Ambani’s statements are “plainly a yet further opportunistic attempt to evade his financial obligations to the lenders.”
Ambani was caught up in another legal wrangle last year year, when India’s Supreme Court threatened him with prison after Reliance Communications failed to pay to pay 5.5 billion rupees ($77 million) to Ericsson (ST:ERICb)AB’s Indian unit. The judges gave him a month to find the funds, and his brother, Mukesh, stepped in just in time to make the payment.
The brothers’ relationship has been fraught since their father’s death left behind a vast empire that was split between them. While Mukesh’s oil and petrochemicals businesses have flourished, Anil’s assets dwindled.
Anil said in a filing that he recognized that the judge would want to know if he could satisfy any order to put up funds from outside resources including his family.
“I can confirm that I have made enquiries but I am unable to raise any finance from external sources,” he said."

MILAN (Reuters) - The luxury goods industry normally relishes the spotlight, but in the case of China's coronavirus it is ruing being one of the most globally exposed sectors to an epidemic that risks all-but wiping out its sales growth this year.
Brands from  Burberry  (L:BRBY) to  Estee Lauder  (N:EL) are shutting stores and cutting profit forecasts as business in the industry's biggest market has virtually ground to a halt.
""Shopping malls are closed, the few stores that are still open are working on reduced hours and above all there is no (customer) traffic,"" said Stefano Sassi, CEO of Italy's Valentino.
Burberry was the latest big brand to warn of a hit to demand on Friday, withdrawing its financial guidance for 2020 and saying it had closed more than a third of its stores in mainland China.
It said spending by Chinese tourists in Europe and elsewhere had not been hit as much, but given widening travel restrictions, it forecast this would worsen in the coming weeks.
With entire cities in the world's second biggest economy shut off, flights canceled and several countries, including the United States, banning entry to visitors who have been in China recently, the luxury industry is now facing a major sales hit.
Jefferies analyst Flavio Cereda cut his full-year growth estimates for the sector to 1% from 5% at constant currencies.
""The shortfall is around 12 billion euros and the risks is to de facto 'skip' a year,"" he said, forecasting a 35% decline in Chinese luxury spending in the first quarter.
DOUBLE WHAMMY
The epidemic has hit luxury brands while they are still reeling from a plunge in sales in the shopping hub of Hong Kong following months of often violent protest.
Some offset that thanks to growth in mainland China last year, but the coronavirus epidemic has put paid to that.
American Airlines (O:AAL) and United Airlines (O:UAL) among others have suspended flights from U.S. hubs not just to mainland China but also to Hong Kong, one of the world's top five luxury destinations, due to low demand.
The outbreak also coincided with China's Lunar New Year holiday, which last year saw shoppers rack up about $150 billion in spending, including on travel and restaurants.
Chinese consumers account for more than a third of global spending on luxury goods, with most purchases made abroad. On average, Chinese buyers in Europe spend 790 euros ($865) per purchase, but that can rise to 2,800 euros if they splurge on jewelry, according to tax-free shopping specialist Planet.
They have fueled the sector's breakneck growth of the past decade and accounted for 90% of last year's increase in revenues to 281 billion euros, consultancy Bain & Company estimates.
""Because the Chinese represent a third of the luxury audience, any percentage point that you lose in sales ends up equating to quite a sizeable impact in terms of bottom line,"" David Perrotta, Planet's UK country manager, told Reuters.
This week, Estee Lauder, which makes Clinique skincare products,  Coach  handbag maker Tapestry (N:TPR) and Capri, the owner of Michael Kors, Versace and Jimmy Choo, all cut their profit forecasts for the year due to the virus outbreak.
Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL) has shut about half of its 110 stores in China, while jewelry maker  Pandora  (CO:PNDORA) said business in the country was at a standstill.
Make-up specialist L'Oreal (PA:OREP) said e-commerce, which accounts for almost 50% of its sales in China, would help it weather the crisis, but still expected an impact on demand.
Louis Vuitton owner LVMH (PA:LVMH), the world's biggest luxury group, has said that if the virus spread is contained by the end of March its impact wouldn't be too bad. Yet it reported a 40% drop in Hong Kong revenues in the fourth quarter and the health scare is likely to hit its duty-free business.
The French conglomerate, which recently bought U.S. jeweler Tiffany, is better placed to cope than others thanks to a strong U.S. business, said Bernstein analyst Luca Solca, who also favors Moncler (MI:MONC) and EssilorLuxottica (PA:ESLX).
Firms like  Richemont  (S:CFR), Swatch (S:UHR) and  Kering  (PA:PRTP) are more exposed, as they make between 45% and 59% of their revenues from Chinese nationals, according to Bernstein."

ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam has quit after a power struggle with Chairman Urs Rohner at Switzerland's second-biggest bank, triggered by a damaging spying scandal.
Thiam will be replaced by Thomas Gottstein, who is head of the Swiss business at Credit Suisse, the Zurich-based lender said on Friday. His departure ends a conflict with Rohner following revelations that the bank had snooped on former executives raised questions over its culture and management.
Credit Suisse's spying surfaced in September when former star wealth manager Iqbal Khan, after defecting to rival UBS, confronted a private detective who was following him and his wife through Zurich.
Thiam's exit appears unlikely to draw a line under the affair, potentially irking some international investors who had spoken out in favor of the CEO in his battle with Rohner, while Switzerland’s market supervisor is investigating the board’s oversight of Thiam and his top lieutenants.
""A period of instability will ensue as Mr Gottstein attempts to lay the foundations for further growth. We would assume investor discontent following the change, with any fall-out unknown at this stage,"" KBW analysts said. 
This was reflected in the immediate market reaction, with the bank’s shares down 2.8% by 1115 GMT.
Credit Suisse's board said that Rohner had its backing to complete his term until April 2021. 
Thiam, 57, was appointed as CEO in 2015, having never previously worked for a bank. At Credit Suisse, the ex-Prudential boss focused on cutting costs, reducing risk, scaling back investment banking to focus more on wealth management, and strengthening its balance sheet. 
Engineering that turnaround led to three years of consecutive losses, but the bank returned to profit in 2018, leading to plaudits for the former Ivory Coast government minister and McKinsey management consultant.
However, what the bank initially described as a rogue spying case run by then-Chief Operating Officer Pierre-Olivier Bouee widened as details emerged of other instances of surveillance. 
Swiss financial supervisor FINMA is investigating after the bank subsequently acknowledged that it had tailed former human resources head Peter Goerke.
Thiam again said he knew nothing of these activities.
""I had no knowledge of the observation of two former colleagues. It undoubtedly disturbed Credit Suisse and caused anxiety and hurt. I regret that this happened and it should never have taken place,"" Thiam said in the statement. 
(Graphic: Credit Suisse stock under Tidjane Thiam, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1856/1825/cs.png) 
'SAFE PAIR OF HANDS' 
Gottstein, a prominent investment banker and wealth manager before taking over Credit Suisse's domestic operation, had been flagged by analysts as a potential successor to Thiam.
""Based on his deep and comprehensive experience in our business and in view of his impressive performance as head of our Swiss bank and his respect amongst our clients and employees, Thomas Gottstein is excellently positioned to lead Credit Suisse into the future,"" Rohner said in a statement.
Gottstein will be the first Swiss citizen to run Credit Suisse in almost 20 years. The 55-year-old has been at the bank since 1999, joining from rival UBS. He has spent most of his career working in equity capital markets before taking over as chief of Credit Suisse's Swiss bank in 2015.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analysts described Gottstein in a note as a ""safe pair of hands"".
Thiam's resignation, effective from Feb. 14 after the presentation of fourth-quarter and full-year 2019 results, came at a board meeting on Thursday.
During the meeting in Zurich directors backed Rohner despite calls from Swiss investment adviser Ethos Foundation for him to quit.
""Urs Rohner has led the board of directors commendably during this turbulent time,"" said board member Severin Schwan in the bank's statement.
""After careful deliberations, the board has been unanimous in its actions, as well as in reaffirming its full support for the chairman to complete his term until April 2021.""
In Switzerland, Credit Suisse and UBS typically have a Swiss national as either chairman or chief executive. 
Gottstein's appointment could therefore pave the way for a non-Swiss chairman. One person familiar with the matter said Richard Meddings, a British banker set to join the board, could take over from Rohner.

Andre Helfenstein, now responsible for Credit Suisse's institutional clients in Switzerland, will succeed Gottstein as CEO of the Swiss business and join the executive board.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open a touch lower Friday, with investors set to pause for breath after record closing levels as China’s coronavirus outbreak continues to claim victims and cause economic damage. Eyes will also be on the continuing earnings season and the key employment report.
At 6:55 AM ET (1155 GMT), futures for theS&P 500 traded 12 points, or 0.4%, lower, futures for the Nasdaqdown 38 points, or 0.4%, while the Dow futures contract fell 116 points, or 0.4%. 
Earlier Friday, the death toll from the coronavirus in China reached 636, including the death of a Chinese doctor who tried to warn about the coronavirus outbreak, while the number of recorded cases rose above 31,000. And the World Health Organization warned that it was ""too early"" to declare a peak in the spread of the new disease.
S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings cut its Chinese 2020 growth forecast to 5%, from 5.7%, saying the impact of the coronavirus outbreak could take a heavy short-term toll.
This has prompted caution on Wall Street Friday, after the three major U.S. averages closed Thursday in record territory. The S&P 500 ended up 0.3%, the Nasdaq Composite up 0.7% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.3% higher. 
The earnings season will continue Friday, and it has generally been a positive one. Around 60% of the S&P 500 companies have so far reported, with over 70% of these beating expectations.
Ride-hailing company Uber (NYSE:UBER) will be in focus after it reported a loss of $1.1 billion in the last three months of 2019. However, revenue jumped 37% to $4 billion and the number of trips made on its platform rose by 28%, with the company showing signs of moving toward profitability. Uber stock traded around 7% higher premarket.
Pinterest stock (NYSE:PINS) climbed over 16% premarket after the social networking company beat on both the top and bottom lines for the fourth quarter and gave upbeat guidance for the full year.
AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) will also report its latest quarterly numbers, with the biopharmaceutical company expected to report earnings of $2.19 per share on revenue of $8.70 billion.
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) will be eyed after a New Jersey state jury ordered the corporation to pay $750 million in punitive damages to four people who said they had been hit by a rare form of cancer through the use of the company’s talcum powders.
 Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) will also be of interest after Reuters reported that the investment banking giant plans to raise $8 billion in only its second buyout fund since the 2008 financial crisis. 
The key data release Friday will be the U.S. Labor Department's closely watched monthly employment report, at 08:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), which is expected to show nonfarm payrolls increased by 160,000 jobs in January.
The risk is for a surprise to the upside, as this estimate predates ADP's release on Wednesday, which showed private payrolls increased by 291,000 jobs in January, the most since May 2015.
Elsewhere, oil headed for a fifth weekly loss as doubts remain over the extent of production cuts from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a group known as OPEC+. 
A committee of technical experts from the group Thursday recommended a production cut of 600,000 barrels a day to offset the demand impact from the coronavirus outbreak, but Russia asked for more time to assess the impact of the outbreak.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has since said his country supports a recommendation to deepen OPEC+ global oil supply curbs, but didn’t mention by how much.
AT 06:55 AM ET (1155 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% lower at $50.61 and the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.5% to $54.66."

The world's biggest steelmaker had tried to walk away from a 2018 deal after parliament scrapped a guarantee of legal immunity from prosecution over environmental risks during a clean-up of the heavily polluting factory.
But the steelmaker has since returned to discussions.
""Negotiations between the two parties have made a significant step forward and set a new deadline to Feb. 28,"" ArcelorMittal lawyer Ferdinando Emanuele told reporters.
The future of the plant has been a headache to successive Italian governments, which have faced the challenge of balancing the need to clean up years of environmental damage with protecting thousands of jobs in the economically struggling south.
A Milan court was scheduled to discuss on Friday a government bid to stop ArcelorMittal's withdrawal from the plant, but the hearing has been postponed to March 6 in order to let the two parties reach a final deal, the lawyer added.
Asked if ArcelorMittal could still walk away from Europe's biggest steel plant, the lawyer said: ""I'm not aware. We're here to negotiate"".
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte's government and ArcelorMittal agreed last year to develop a new industrial plan for the site that employs about 8.200 workers in the city of Taranto."

(Reuters) - The former head of asset management firm Pimco faces two years in prison if prosecutors get their way when he is sentenced on Friday for his part in a scheme in which privileged parents paid bribes to get their children into U.S. colleges.
Douglas Hodge, who prosecutors called among ""the most culpable"" of 35 parents charged, would become the 15th person to be sentenced since the nationwide cheating scandal came to light last March.
While the other 14 defendants received prison terms ranging from one day to six months, prosecutors said Hodge and three others who entered guilty pleas in October deserve stiffer sentences.
""They are repeat players, who engaged in the conspiracy again and again, over years,"" Boston U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling said in a sentencing memo this week.
Hodge, who retired as chief executive of Allianz SE's (DE:ALVG) California-based Pimco in 2016, paid bribes totaling $850,000 over nearly 11 years to get two of his children into Georgetown University and two others into the University of Southern (NYSE:SO) California, prosecutors said.
He tried and failed to offer bribes to get a fifth child into Loyola Marymount University, they said.
Prosecutors asked U.S. District Court Judge Nathaniel Gorton to impose a sentence of 24 months, which they called the low end of range that runs up to 30 months under sentencing guidelines.
In all, 53 people have been charged in the college admissions scandal, including ""Desperate Housewives"" star Felicity Huffman and ""Full House"" actress Lori Loughlin. Huffman pleaded guilty and served less than two weeks in prison, while Loughlin pleaded not guilty.
The case revolves around consultant William ""Rick"" Singer, who admitted in March that he facilitated cheating on college entrance exams and bribed sports coaches to present his clients' children as fake athletic recruits.
Singer, who has yet to be sentenced, is cooperating with prosecutors.
Hodge's lawyers sought leniency, citing his philanthropy, devotion to his children and Singer's deception in telling him that his money would go toward university programs and underprivileged student athletes.
Hodge insisted, contrary to a prosecution claim, that he never involved his children in the scheme. He admitted that he did not pull out of the scheme once he learned of Singer's deception.
""For that, I am deeply ashamed and remorseful,"" he wrote in a letter to the judge.
Hodge's lawyers asked the judge to consider splitting incarceration with home detention, along with supervised release, a fine and a ""robust community service program."""

484,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 07, 2020 05:26AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Burberry Warns of Major Sales Impact from Virus,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Slowly but surely, the coronavirus is coming to European companies.
Fashion group Burberry fell 1.8% on Friday after giving its first detailed update on the impact of the virus on sales in China. The news isn’t pretty. Nearly half of its stores on the mainland are closed, and the rest are operating reduced hours. Overall footfall is down as much as 80%, according to chief financial officer Julie Brown, who told the Financial Times that the impact on Hong Kong sales is worse than that of the prolonged civil unrest in the former British colony.
Given that 40% of Burberry’s sales are generated in Asia-Pacific (the region that captures not only China itself but most Chinese tourist spending), the consequences are unavoidable.
CEO Marco Gobbetti said in a statement that the outbreak is having “a material negative effect on luxury demand” – an assessment shared on Thursday by Tapestry (NYSE:TPR), the owner of the Kate Spade and   Coach   brands. The company wasn’t able to be any more specific, but it seems clear that prior consensus of 4% organic sales growth for the 12 months through March now seems unreachable. Burberry shares fell as much as 4.5% in early trading before rebounding to be down 1.8% by 5:30 AM ET (1030 GMT). The benchmark Stoxx 600 was down 0.3% while the FTSE 100 was down 0.6%
Luxury stocks, with their comparatively high direct exposure to Asian consumption, were among the first sector to be hit by the virus. Burberry, for example is down 15% in the last three weeks. Airlines and tourism-related companies were also hit in the first wave.
But there are increasing signs that the much-predicted disruptions to global supply chains are now starting to bite. Fiat Chrysler warned on Thursday that it may have to suspend production at one of its European plants due to the lack of components from one critical supplier in China. Volvo and PSA Group have also warned about such threats.
To be sure, the news is not all negative. The overall rate of new cases continues to slow, according to the official data, while the growth rate of fatal incidences also slowing down, even though the absolute death toll is now fast closing in on the SARS epidemic. Honda Motor said earlier Friday that it will restart production at its plant in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, on Feb. 17.
Moreover, not all companies - even those present in China - are affected equally. L'Oreal shares opened at a record high on Friday, before retreating later, after the cosmetics group said it expects only a temporary hit to Asian sales. The fact that L'Oreal sells more of its stuff online, rather than depending on footfall at boutiques in specific locations, is a big help in that regard.
However, the emergence of reports out of China about its treatment of whistleblowers – including Li Wenliang, a Wuhan doctor whose warnings were ignored and who has now died of the virus – have revived deep-seated mistrust of China’s official record-keeping. The potential for unpleasant surprises hasn’t passed yet."
485,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2020 05:23AM ET</span>",Lifeblood of Amazon merchants threatened as coronavirus infects Chinese workers,"By Lisa Baertlein
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) sellers are bracing for product shortages as Chinese workers - worried about the fast-spreading coronavirus - may be unable or unwilling to return to idled factories.
Brandon Young, who pulls in more than $10 million in annual revenue from the online marketplace, has a 30-45 day supply of portable Apple Inc (O:AAPL) watch chargers that could be difficult to replenish because they are built from genuine Apple components that are exclusively made in China. 
Plugable Technologies founder Bernie Thompson says he could run out of his top-selling triple display laptop docking station by the end of this month, even if factories open as planned next week. 
The entrepreneurs are among the 1 million-plus Amazon sellers whose livelihoods depend on factory workers in China, where the coronavirus has sickened more than 30,000 and killed more than 600 people. Their predicament foreshadows the risk Amazon sellers face if China's fast-moving epidemic results in worker shortages or prolonged factory closures.
Running out of product on Amazon can wipe out a small business. Amazon's algorithm gives top billing to sellers with the briskest and most recent sales. That prominent placement helps drive even more sales. 
""Going out of stock is the best way to kill that,"" Plugable's Thompson said. 
Amazon's revenue from services to third-party sellers accounted for just over 19% of Amazon's net sales in 2019. That figure did not include proceeds from Amazon's lucrative advertising business. In a letter to shareholders, Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said those independent merchants accounted for 58% of physical goods sold on Amazon in 2018. 
""Currently, there is no interruption to our operations,"" Amazon said in a statement. 
Young says many Amazon sellers stocked up before the Lunar New Year holiday, when millions of workers travel hundreds of miles to visit family and manufacturing virtually shuts down for two to three weeks.
""People do have extra inventory, but that will quickly run out"" if factories remain shuttered or workers do not return, said Young, who is ""self-quarantined"" at his Miami home after visiting factories and family in China during the holiday period. He did not visit the epicenter of the outbreak.
Thompson ordered more of his popular docking stations, which connect a laptop to three monitors, in October. 
He built in extra time for setbacks and was still OK when the factory missed its January delivery date. China's decision to extend Lunar New Year factory closures by a week wiped out what was left of his safety buffer. 
""We would have been fine if coronavirus hadn't happened - but with that extra delay, we won't get stock in time,"" said Thompson, who founded his Redmond, Washington-based company in 2009. 
He has been unable to reach many of his Chinese suppliers, but those he has spoken with said they plan to restart operations around Feb. 10, when they will face an even larger-than-normal crush of post-holiday work. The finished product will take another two to three weeks to reach the U.S. West Coast via ocean container ship. 
One provider of a tool that tracks third-party listings on Amazon told Reuters they have seen a rise in ""out of stock"" products. 
In a post published https://gs.amazon.cn/news/news-brand-200201.html?ref=as_cn_ags_news_brand_13 on its Chinese website on Saturday, Amazon advised Chinese sellers to avoid low inventory and shipping delays due to the coronavirus. Tips included delisting products and putting stores into inactive mode. 
That is just the latest challenge for U.S. sellers. Many saw their profitability hit by a prolonged U.S.-China tariff spat last year.
""This is insult to injury,"" Michael Smerling, president of Chicago-area LCI Brands, said of the coronavirus. He estimates tariffs reduced profits by 75% last year.
The seller of money belts and travel pillows knew how to manage through the trade war, Smerling said. ""The coronavirus is completely different - we don't know the impact of this.""
Some merchants are searching for ways to switch sourcing out of China. 
Young, who sells toys, travel bags and other products on Amazon, is looking for factories in Mexico, South American, India, Pakistan and Vietnam.
Jayme Smaldone, CEO of New Jersey-based Mighty Mug, will increase his order of plastic mugs from Taiwan if his 90-day supply of stainless steel mugs from China dwindles.
Many companies listing on Amazon do not have contingency plans for dealing with a lengthy shutdown in China, said Chris McCabe, founder of Amazon seller consultancy ecommerceChris.com. 

""There are going to be a lot of headaches and heartache,"" McCabe said.

LONDON (Reuters) - BP's (L:BP) head of downstream Tufan Erginbilgic will step down next month after six years in the job, the energy company said in a statement, becoming the latest top executive to leave as CEO Bernard Looney takes over.
Erginbilgic, who joined  BP  in 1997, oversaw the expansion of the downstream business, which includes refining, retail and petrochemicals, into electric vehicle charging and added thousands of petrol stations in developing economies such as India and Mexico.
The announcement on his departure comes two days after Looney took the helm from Bob Dudley. 
It follows Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary's decision to leave the company in June. Looney's successor as head of upstream has yet to be announced.
Erginbilgic's successor will be announced separately, BP said.
""Under Tufan's leadership, BP's Downstream has been at the heart of our return to growth; what he has achieved in this time is extraordinary,"" Looney said in a statement.
Downstream helped boost BP's profit after the 2014 oil price collapse, offsetting weaker revenue from the larger oil and gas production division.

The expansion in retail and petrochemicals are seen as key for BP as the world shifts away from fossil fuels, focusing on low-carbon fuels and plastics whose demand BP expects to continue growing sharply in the coming decades.

LONDON (Reuters) - Energy bills are set to fall for around 15 million households in Britain after energy regulator Ofgem told suppliers to cut average standard bills and pre-pay bills by 1.4% from April 1.
A cap on electricity and gas bills came into effect in January 2019 and was a flagship policy of former British Prime Minister Theresa May to end what she called ""rip-off"" prices.
The regulator, Ofgem, said the price cap for average annual consumption for standard bills will fall by 17 pounds ($22) to 1,162 pounds a year from April 1 for around 11 million homes.
Some 4 million households on pre-pay energy meters will also see average bills fall by 17 pounds to 1,200 pounds a year, it said.
Ofgem, which calculates the cap using a formula including wholesale energy prices, network expenses and costs of government policies, such as renewable subsidies, said the reduction was due to a fall in energy prices over August 2019 to January 2020.
(GRAPHIC: What costs make up a British duel fuel energy bill? - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/2985/2978/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
""A strong supply of gas, such as record amounts of liquefied natural gas and healthy gas stock inventories, has been the main factor pushing down wholesale prices,"" Ofgem said.
The price cap is intended to be a temporary measure and Ofgem said it would carry out a review for the government on whether market conditions meant it should be lifted or extended past 2020.
Ofgem estimates the cap saved households around 1 billion pounds in 2019.
But it said switching suppliers is still likely to save people more money.
""Households can reduce their energy bills further by shopping around for a better deal,"" said Jonathan Brearley, chief executive at Ofgem.
Britain's energy market is dominated by six big suppliers - Centrica's (L:CNA) British Gas, new entrant Ovo Energy that took over SSE's (L:SSE) retail arm, Iberdrola's (MC:IBE) Scottish Power, Innogy's npower, E.ON (DE:EONGn) and EDF (PA:EDF) Energy"

Zhima Credit, or Sesame Credit, said in a statement posted on the Alipay app that the decision was made to ""better fight the situation and serve its clients.""
The scoring service will resume after the virus is under control and social functions return to normal, it said, without giving a specific time frame. Any missed payments will still be recorded in the system, it added, and the platform will later assess the each client to see whether to lower their scores.
Zhima Credit is one of China's most popular private credit-rating platforms, scoring people and small businesses based on their use of other Ant-linked services - in effect, their shopping and borrowing habits.
Alipay, the third-party payment app that Zhima draws most of its data from, had 1.2 billion users globally as of June 2019.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Industrial goods from jet fuel and iron ore to rubber and sulphuric acid are sliding toward their lowest prices in weeks, months or even years as China's coronavirus epidemic hobbles movement and eats away demand in the world's no.2 economy.
China's iron ore futures  are headed for their biggest weekly loss in six months, oil prices (LCOc1) (CLc1) hit their lowest since January, and Tokyo rubber futures have shed 15% since mid-January.
The economic impact of the coronavirus lockdown in China is being felt across the globe, with exporters, miners and manufacturers of everything from coal to fruit facing trade disruption. The Baltic Dry Index of freight rates has hit its weakest since 2016.
""The adverse impacts of the coronavirus on China's economy look set to spill over significantly to the rest of the world,"" Oxford Economics said in a note.
""In addition to weaker Chinese import demand, a sharp drop in the country's industrial activity may cause substantial supply-side disruptions elsewhere.""

Dubbed the factory of the world, China is normally the largest and most voracious consumer of a slew of global raw materials, fuels and foods.
The country, the largest crude oil importer, also accounts for around half of global copper and iron ore imports.
Short-term sales of crude oil and liquefied natural gas into China almost ground to a halt this week as the virus spread, leaving buyers to ponder legal action to avoid having to honor purchase agreements, trade sources said.

Many steel mills and ports are shut while construction projects are on hold, curbing metal demand.
Shanghai Futures Exchange steel rebar and hot-rolled coil are on course for their biggest weekly declines since November 2018.
The collapse in downstream industrial activity spurred China's biggest liquefied gas importer to suspend some import contracts.
China's copper smelters will reduce output by more than 15% in February from last month due to the virus, according to the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association.
""Chinese buyers are largely continuing to honor supply contracts and importing normal levels of raw materials while travel restrictions are in place,"" ANZ said in a note.

The South China Morning Post first reported about the airline's plans to cut about 10% of its workforce.

Hong Kong Airlines, part owned by cash-strapped Chinese conglomerate HNA Group [HNAIRC.UL], said it will reduce its daily operations to 30 from 82 sectors over Feb. 11 to March. 
It also said its Hong Kong-based ground staff will be asked to take a minimum of two weeks unpaid leave per month, or switch to working three days a week between Feb. 17 and June 30.
Larger rival Cathay Pacific Airways (HK:0293) has already asked employees to take three weeks of unpaid leave, saying preserving cash was key and conditions were as grave as during the 2009 financial crisis due to the virus outbreak.
Both Cathay and Hong Kong Airlines have been grappling with a sharp fall in demand since the middle of 2019 due to widespread, sometimes violent, anti-government protests in the Chinese-controlled territory.

Hong Kong Airlines has also been battling other financial woes. In December, it was forced to draw up plans to raise money as it faced the possibility of a license suspension by the city's air transport regulator.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) plans to raise $8 billion in only its second buyout fund since the 2008 financial crisis, bolstering its ability to secure deals worldwide, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter.
Undeterred by a coronovirus epidemic in China that has cast a shadow over the global economy, the Wall Street heavyweight will kick off the fundraising next week via its private equity arm West Street Capital Partners, said the people. 
The fast-spreading virus is not seen as a hurdle to the fundraising as the bank is mainly targeting offshore, non-Chinese prospective investors, said one of the people.
It is aiming for a first close by the end of March - an important milestone indicating the fund has crossed a minimum threshold and can begin making investments, said the other person.
The new fund, substantially smaller than Goldman's biggest fund of $20 billion in 2007, underscored its commitment to the private equity business. Many banks, including  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), have spun out or divested their private equity arms in recent years following the adoption of the Volcker Rule, which limited banks from investing their own balance sheets in funds. 
Private equity firms have also been raising record amounts of capital globally, with Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group, the world largest alternative asset manager, last year raising a record $26 billion for its latest buyout fund. 
Goldman's new fund will focus on deals where it gets majority control, with the goal of deploying 60% of the capital in America, said the first person. It also plans to make about 25 investments in various sectors, with the deal size ranging between $150 and $600 million. 
Like its last fund - West Street Capital Partners VII that raised about $7 billion in 2017 - the new fund will seek capital from both intuitional investors and the bank's own employees, said the person. 
Goldman declined to comment. The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak to the media. 
Goldman's private equity arm, established in 1986, has been managed by its merchant banking division. It has raised about $47 billion since inception across eight funds, according to industry data provider Preqin. 
In 2016, the arm was named West Street Capital Partners, after Goldman's New York City address, to comply with a post-crisis rule that does not allow private equity funds to bear the parent bank's name. 
It has generated a net internal rate of return (IRR), which deducts management fees, fund expenses and carried interest, of 19%, since 2000, according to the first person. 

Its last fund has made investments including the $2.7 billion buyout https://www.reuters.com/article/us-capital-vision-services-m-a-goldman-s/goldman-sachs-to-buy-capital-vision-services-in-27-billion-deal-wsj-idUSKCN1T40HA of eye-care manager Capital Vision Services in 2019 and joined energy-focused peer Riverstone Holdings in the $1.6 billion acquisition of Lucid Energy Group's Delaware Basin unit https://uk.reuters.com/article/brief-lucid-energy-group-agrees-to-sell/brief-lucid-energy-group-agrees-to-sell-delaware-basin-subsidiary-to-riverstone-holdings-goldman-sachs-merchant-banking-division-for-16-billion-idUKASB0C03T, showed Preqin data.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asian share markets fell on Friday and oil price gains stalled, as the growing death toll and economic damage from the coronavirus outbreak snuffed out a late-week rally.
U.S. stock futures (ESc1) and European futures (STXEc1) point to soft openings in Friday.
The death toll in mainland China from the new virus has more than doubled in just under a week.
It rose to 636 on Friday, with the number of infections at 31,161. And in the early hours of the morning one of the first Chinese doctors to raise the alarm about the virus died from it at a hospital in Wuhan, the outbreak's epicenter. He was 34.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) fell 0.9%. Japan's Nikkei (N225) edged lower, while Korea's Kospi (KS11), Hong Kong's Hang Seng (HSI) and the Shanghai Composite (SSEC) fell by between 0.5% and 1.2%.
Thanks to a $400 billion wipeout on Monday, Shanghai is poised for its worst week in eight months. But the other Asian indexes are ahead, amid a broad global rally.
It has been underpinned by China's sweeping efforts to contain the spread of the virus. But with deaths rising, cities shut off, flights canceled and factories closed, global supply chains are in disarray and fears of a pandemic remain high.
""The rate of infection is not slowing,"" said Michael McCarthy, chief markets strategist at brokerage CMC Markets in Sydney.
""I'm a little surprised at the way European and U.S. investors have shrugged this off. I think the reaction in the Asia-Pacific region is much more reasonable. There is real uncertainty,"" he said.
U.S. stocks gained for a fourth straight session on Thursday and Wall Street's main indexes hit record highs, while Asian assets - particularly currencies - remain under pressure.
In Asian trade, the yen halted a slide that has it set for its worst week in 18 months, leaving the currency sitting just above a two-week low at 109.89 per dollar.
Gains in the Australian dollar , a liquid proxy for China because of the heavy exposure of Australian exports, were likewise halted.
While the Aussie is on track for its first weekly gain this year, elsewhere in Asia the Singapore dollar and Thai baht have been trampled in a rush from emerging market currencies into majors.
Several Chinese politicians from President Xi Jinping down made reassuring comments on Friday. But Chinese trade figures due on Friday that are set to offer an early glimpse of the effects of the virus on the flow of goods are yet to be published.
Investors will also turn later to U.S. jobs figures due at 1330 GMT for an update on the United States' economic health.
COMMODS CAUTIOUS
Much is unknown about the coronavirus, including its lethality and transmission routes. The World Health Organization has said it is too early to call a peak in the outbreak.
China's aggressive response, dubbed a ""people's war for epidemic prevention"" by President Xi, appears to have inspired confidence.
Beijing has pumped billions of dollars into the money market to stabilize confidence and the central bank said on Friday it expects the virus impact to be temporary.
Yet, owing to much greater exposure to Chinese demand and less access to the benefits of monetary stimulus, commodity prices have been more sensitive to conditions on the ground.
Oil and metal prices fell hard as the coronavirus outbreak gained pace and have been slow to recover.
U.S. crude (CLc1) was firm on Friday at $51.02 per barrel, but is flat for the week and remains 14% below its Jan. 21 level. Brent prices were last at $55.14 per barrel.
A rally in copper - often seen as a barometer of global economic health because of its wide industrial use - ran out of steam on Friday, softening 0.1% to $5,728 per tonne.
""We think that demand could come back strongly as opposed to gradually in Q2 2020,"" said Commonwealth Bank commodities analyst Vivek Dhar.
""But the risk in the near term is that provinces take longer to return to work in order to contain the spread of the virus."""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - When worries over the coronavirus shook U.S. stocks out of a period of quiet trading last week, investors wondered if the outbreak was the “Black Swan” event that would trigger a sharp decline. Less than a week later, talk has turned instead to a market melt-up.
After that brief swoon, the market made a roaring recovery, and there were also rallies in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, bitcoin and other assets often seen as barometers for risk appetite.
The sharp snapback has revived concerns among some investors that market participants are growing overly confident that easy money policies from central banks will underpin prices, despite serious risks to global growth from the coronavirus. 
""There could be more downside if the (outbreak) spreads, but for now the trend is still up. The bigger risk is arguably that we end up in a mini-bubble,"" said Troy Gayeski - Co-CIO of SkyBridge, an alternative investments firm.
Gayeski said that coming into the year SkyBridge had positioned its portfolio to take advantage of gains by using equity call options.
“We did put some equity call exposure in the portfolio coming into the year, because if one of the risks is a bubble developing then why not try to participate?""
The S&P 500 stands near a record high after rallying nearly 4% from its lows of last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite have also hit highs while the CBOE Volatility Index, a gauge of investor anxiety, has drifted lower after spiking last week to its highest in nearly four months. 
Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at brokerage firm JonesTrading, noted markets have shot higher despite uncertainty over how long travel restrictions and shutdowns will weigh on large portions of China’s economy. Easy monetary policy from the U.S. Federal Reserve has made investors bolder about taking risks, he said. 
“Every time there’s been a downturn in the market, the Fed has stepped in to ease,” he said. “Investors have been trained in a Pavlovian manner to not assess risk and buy every dip you get.”
The World Health Organization said Wednesday was the first day the overall number of new coronavirus cases in China dropped, although the outbreak continues to rage in Hubei province. 
It’s still unclear, however, how long the shutdowns that have paralyzed Hubei and other areas will remain in place, or the effects they will have on growth in China and abroad. 
“My client conversations are all about, ‘is this the black swan? Is this what can derail the global expansion?” said Torsten Slok, chief economist at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Securities. A “black swan” event refers to an unforeseen occurrence that typically has extreme consequences.
Right now, “we don’t think this is a Black Swan.”
Investors will worry if China extends shutdowns or expands them to other areas, said Jens Nordvig, founder of analytics firm Exante Data. 
“Most people expect things will normalize by next week,” he said. “If there was an announcement of another extension...that will freak people out.”
Trying to time the market’s declines and betting against more gains has been a losing strategy over the more than decade-long bull run in stocks, despite repeated worries about rich valuations and overexuberance. 
Still, some investors are taking a cautious view of the recent advance. George Schultze, founder of Schultze Asset Management in New York, said now may be a good time to lock in gains on the rally.
“For investors that have had big gains and are mostly in passive ETF strategies, now may be a good time to put some cash on the side and realize some gains,"" said Schultze."

Investing.com - Japan’s Softbank Group Corp. (T:9984) saw its shares jumping more than 6% on Friday in Asia after reports that hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. has built up a more than $2.5 billion stake in the company. 
 
Elliott said in a statement that it “has engaged privately with SoftBank’s leadership and is working constructively on solutions to help SoftBank materially and sustainably reduce its discount to intrinsic value.”
 
The hedge fund is also pressing Softbank to liquidate some of its holdings to fund a $20 billion share buyback and governance change at the company, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. 
 
Elliott believes Softbank’s current share price is being unfairly discounted because of the recent negative attention. 
 
Softbank’s shares have fallen about 20% since last April since the implosion of office-sharing company WeWork’s public offering last year, which forced the company to write down the value of its and the Vision Fund’s stakes by $4.7 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively."

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - A number of Chinese manufacturers including a subsidiary of Apple Inc (O:AAPL) partner Foxconn (TW:2317) have refitted production lines to make masks and medical clothing, as a deadly coronavirus spreads across China.
The move highlights how private companies are pitching in to alleviate a nationwide shortage of medical gear amid the health crisis, at times expanding beyond their core lines of business.
In a social media post on Thursday, Foxconn - formally  Hon Hai  Precision Industry Co Ltd - said it has begun trial production of surgical masks at its Longhua Park plant in Shenzhen, and expects to produce 2 million masks daily by the end of the month.
The Taiwanese company said the masks would initially be produced for internal use by its hundreds of thousands of employees, the majority of whom work in factories in mainland China.
SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile Co Ltd, a joint venture automaker formed by General Motors Co (N:GM) and two Chinese partners, also announced on Thursday via social media that it will set up 14 production lines with the goal of making 1.7 million masks daily.
On Tuesday, Hongdou Group Co Ltd [HONGD.UL], a clothing manufacturer founded in the 1950s, wrote on social media it had refitted a factory to make disposable medical suits.
The company said it intends to produce about 60,000 protective suits a month and will send them to the government for allocation and distribution. Hongdou employs 30,000 people, its website showed.
Apparel peers Zhejiang Giuseppe Garment Co Ltd (SZ:002687) and  Jihua Group  Corp Ltd (SS:601718) have launched similar initiatives, state media outlets reported this week.
Factories inside and outside of China have worked around the clock to keep up with demand since the outbreak of the virus at the end of last year in the eastern Chinese city of Wuhan in Hubei province. High street pharmacies have posted signs telling customers masks are not in stock.
One Czech mask manufacturer told Reuters in late January that orders had increased 57,000% with in four days.
To cope with the shortage, localities in China have set up rationing systems.
In Shanghai, individuals wanting to obtain masks must provide a neighborhood committee with their ID and phone number, after which they are contacted when they can retrieve a set of masks."
507,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2020 12:16AM ET</span>",Boeing's fraying 737 MAX suppliers see capacity crunch,"By Eric M. Johnson
LYNNWOOD, Wash. (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co suppliers are shedding jobs and capacity to cope with a halt in 737 MAX output, but while that staves off chaos, aerospace executives worry the industry might be unable to ramp factories quickly enough when the plane wins approval to fly again.
Boeing, struggling to restore public confidence and recover from the biggest crisis since its founding in 1916, has halted production of the once fast-selling 737 MAX, which was grounded in March following two deadly crashes.
As a result, industrial heavyweights like fuselage maker Spirit Aerosystems have already laid off workers.
Now a cluster of other crucial companies small and big that forge metal, assemble and paint 737 MAX winglets, and build data systems have followed suit with no indication that Boeing will offer a lifeline, people familiar with the matter said.
Losing payments and workers in a tight labor market heaps pressure on Boeing's U.S.-dominated 737 MAX supply chain, which involves hundreds of suppliers of more than half of the roughly 400,000 parts for each 737 built in the Seattle-area.
""One of the main questions is how much capacity will be lost in the supply chain by the time production resumes at significant rates,"" said an industry executive with knowledge of Boeing's industrial network.
Such concerns dominated the Pacific Northwest Aerospace Alliance conference north of Seattle this week, where some executives vented frustration over what they called Boeing's lack of financial support.
One executive from a supplier that derives a quarter of its business from the MAX said Boeing has treated his company like ""a commodity"" in a ""transactional"" relationship. He predicted Boeing would let some suppliers fail.
The executives spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity.
Relations had already been strained following a longstanding tug of war over profits. Boeing is pushing suppliers to cut prices or give up part of the lucrative after-sales market for parts and repairs, the focus of its own competing services unit.
""We are working closely with (suppliers) to manage risk, address hardships, and ensure their ability to support a resumption of production,"" Boeing spokesman Bernard Choi said.
Much depends on how quickly Boeing resumes output. Haunted by the experience of McDonnell Douglas, which it absorbed in 1997, Boeing would not want to wait too long before biting European rival Airbus SE's heels and regaining a roughly equal share of deliveries.
But it must avoid swamping airlines and overstretching suppliers by raising output too far, too soon.
Mooted scenarios include a gradual return to the pre-grounding rate of 52 single-aisles monthly in 2022, with plans to boost production higher in 2023 - a four-year delay.
Boeing declined to comment on production forecasts.
""We need a strong supply chain - we need great partners,"" Boeing supply chain director Simone Berger told the conference.
Worries extend beyond the 737 MAX.
A cash drain from the 787 production rate drop forced Marlborough, Massachusetts-based Web Industries to consider delaying by at least a year a new 75,000-square-foot carbon-fiber processing plant to serve the 777X, one industry source said.
A representative for Web Industries declined to comment.
Damage to Boeing's supply chain gives Airbus little to celebrate. Not only does it share some suppliers with Boeing, it would also feel the ripple effect of any significant industry damage, especially if exacerbated by the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, experts say.
Joe Marcheschi, Airbus' head of procurement for North America, said the biggest worries were less diversified companies lower down the supply chain, such as castings and forgings.
""That's where it's going to hurt,"" Marcheschi said. ""It just takes one. They are building one critical product and unfortunately they are the single point of failure in the whole supply chain."""
508,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 06, 2020 11:08PM ET</span>",How Can the Coronavirus Possibly Be Good for Stocks?,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It seems inconceivable that the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed more than 600 people and shut down two-thirds of China’s economy, could be bullish for stocks. Yet Shenzhen’s private sector-heavy ChiNext Index not only brushed away a selloff earlier this week, but also hit a three-year high Thursday.
The most obvious explanation? This epidemic is giving policymakers the opportunity to correct past mistakes without looking silly.
Recall 2018, when China staged one of the world’s worst routs. The selloff began well before the trade war as investors braced for record corporate defaults, even in the new-economy electronics-manufacturing and technology sectors. Later in the year, stocks slid further as companies struggled to meet their margin calls. More than 20% of listed companies had pledged roughly a third or more of their shares to meet financing needs.
This all happened because in late 2017 China declared war on shadow banking, the main channel of credit for private businesses. The following April, Beijing unveiled far-reaching rules for its banks, requiring them to stick to traditional loan books and ditch creative wealth-management products that had aided the cash-starved private sector in the past.
Last year, murmurs were growing louder that Beijing’s war on shadow banking can’t last. After all, China Inc. was suffering from two years of record defaults, pinched both by an unanticipated trade war and new, draconian credit policies. 
But thus far, Beijing’s top policymakers have resisted bankers’ intensive lobbying efforts. Lenders already have a grace period until the end of this year to comply fully; another extension would be a tacit admission that the new rules were ill-designed in the first place and the experiment is a failure. The one thing China’s bureaucrats dislike most is losing face.
The coronavirus has changed the narrative. Last weekend, regulators said that they would agree to another extension for banks struggling to meet the new rules. Caixin, a Chinese media outlet, recently reported that the grace period could be pushed back by one more year to 2021.
Over the past week, various arms of China’s sprawling bureaucracy have come out to stabilize its financial markets, with the People’s Bank of China on Monday making the biggest single-day cash injection since 2004. Of all the new policies that sprang up, however, a complete halt to the war on shadow banking would be the most helpful.
Private businesses never had much access to traditional bank loans anyhow, so the PBOC cutting the loan prime rate – interest rates that banks offer to their best corporate clients – won’t do the trick. Meanwhile, in the past two years, plenty of good companies have gone bad because they couldn’t refinance their working capital needs. This also explains why this week Shenzhen’s ChiNext Index has outperformed the blue-chip Shanghai Composite Index, which is filled with state-owned enterprises.
By nature, we Chinese are an optimistic and forgiving bunch. Rather than lamenting how an initial health cover-up in the incompetent Wuhan government caused a nationwide crisis, investors are looking at the glass half-full. At long last, Beijing can toss away its misguided war on shadow banking and design a smarter one that gives the private sector some room to breathe."

Borrowing costs for India’s top-rated shadow financiers declined last month, indicating that the nation’s prolonged credit crisis may be seeing some improvement.
Premiums that investors seek to buy AAA rated five-year bonds of non-bank lenders over government notes with similar maturities narrowed to a 16-month low in January, helping a gauge measuring bond spreads to strengthen. Three other indicators compiled by Bloomberg, covering areas including liquidity and share performance, were stuck in the same position as the previous month, with two at levels indicating strength.
A recovery in the health of the nation’s shadow banks, which lend to everyone from small merchants to business titans, indicates that steps taken by policy makers to soothe the sector are bearing fruit. Supporting these financiers is essential to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s efforts to jump-start credit flow and revive an economy that’s set to expand at the weakest in more than a decade this fiscal year.
Banking-system liquidity remained buoyant, and the total outstanding debt at 50 firms impacted by the crisis stayed high. But a custom gauge measuring the share performance of 20 such companies was stagnant.
“The worst seems to be over for shadow banks that have survived one of the longest credit crises in India,” said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Care Ratings Ltd. “They have started to access funds at pre-crisis levels.”
Even for some companies that were less affected by the credit-market freeze, India’s slowing economy is eroding their financial health. With the fallout from the deadly coronavirus likely to hurt global expansion, it will be harder for many of these firms to bolster credit profiles.
The scores attached to each of the indicators have been calculated by Bloomberg by normalizing the deviation of the latest value of the indicator from its yearly average and have been assigned on a scale of 1 to 7, with 1 implying weakness and 7 showing strength."

China is no longer on track to dethrone the U.S. as the world’s No. 1 movie market this year.
The coronavirus has clobbered the burgeoning Hollywood rival, virtually wiping out ticket sales during the recent seven-day Lunar New Year holiday -- a week that’s been historically the busiest for box-office collections. Theaters across the country have remained shut since Jan. 24, while the fear of infection has prompted people to avoid crowded places.
Losses from the collapse of ticket sales mounted to $1 billion during the festive period, according to estimates by Rance Pow, chief executive officer of cinema industry consulting firm Artisan Gateway. That number is about 10% of the anticipated revenue in 2020, and is set to rise as uncertainty over the outbreak persists.
The impact of a virus that’s killed more than 600 people and slammed the local movie market is likely to spread to Hollywood, which is increasingly relying on Chinese audiences for growth as domestic ticket sales decline. Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co. said this week that the epidemic is a headwind for its studio.
“The loss will do significant financial damage to both theaters and production companies in China, and if theaters remain closed for several more weeks, the financial harm will expand,” said Lindsay Conner, partner and leader of the entertainment consultancy of Los Angeles-based Manatt, Phelps & Phillips. “With Chinese theaters closed due to the outbreak, Hollywood’s plans for distributing new films in China are also uncertain.”
Shares of Wanda Film Holding Co., a cinema operator controlled by billionaire Wang Jianlin, have plunged 27% since Jan. 17. Imax China Holding Inc., which operates giant screens, has tumbled 22%, while Beijing Enlight Media Co., Ltd., one of China’s largest studios, slid 18%.
China has already overtaken the U.S. in terms of numbers of cinema screens following a building boom that helped box-office sales climb sixfold since 2010. Analysts were predicting the market to surpass the U.S. in terms of revenue this year.
Movie ticket sales in the country, excluding booking fees, rose 4.1% last year to 58.9 billion yuan ($8.5 billion), compared with 9.7 billion yuan in 2010. Imported films accounted for about 36% of box office sales last year in China, the largest overseas market for U.S. films.
Exhibitors have said they have set no date for re-opening cinemas. That means potential delays in China for big-ticket films from Hollywood such as Disney’s “Mulan” -- based on a legendary Chinese female warrior -- and Pixar’s “Onward,” which are set for March debuts in the U.S., according to Pow.
For companies such as Disney, the hit is not just on the movie business. Its theme park in Shanghai has closed as well, along with Disneyland in Hong Kong, which had already been hit by the city’s political unrest. Executives at the Burbank, California-based entertainment giant said Tuesday the theme park shutdowns would pare about $175 million off revenue in the current quarter.
Local language movies set to open during the Lunar New Year holiday then canceled included “Detective Chinatown 3,” the third installment of one of China’s most commercially successful comedies, “Leap,” based on the true story of the Chinese women’s volleyball team, and “Jiang Ziya: Legend of Deification.”
“Even if the virus ended today, the backlog of films to release -- all Chinese -- is pretty large,” said Chris Fenton, a film producer and U.S.-Asia Institute trustee. A delay in the China release of “Mulan,” would also raise the question of whether Disney would postpone the U.S. release, he said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) on Friday said production at all of its China plants would remain suspended through Feb. 16, joining a growing number of automakers facing stoppages due to supply chain issues as the coronavirus spreads.
The Japanese automaker, which operates 12 vehicle and components factories in China, said it would extend its production stoppage ""after considering various factors, including guidelines from local and region governments, parts supply, and logistics.
""For the week of Feb. 10, we will be preparing for the return to normal operation from Feb. 17 and beyond,"" it said in a statement. 
The decision extends Toyota's initial plans to suspend operations through Sunday, and comes as the threat from the coronavirus crisis closes in on the global auto industry.
A growing number of car makers are flagging the possibility that their global operations could take a hit if they cannot access parts supplies from China, where there are transportation bans to stop the virus spreading.
 Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) on Thursday said one of its European plants could close within two to four weeks if Chinese parts suppliers cannot get back to work soon, while  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) earlier this week suspended production at its South Korean plants due to a shortage of China-made parts.
Parts made in China are used in millions of vehicles assembled elsewhere, and China's Hubei province - the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak - is a major hub for vehicle parts production and shipments.
To limit the spread of the virus, Chinese authorities have announced an extended holiday period in Hubei and 10 other provinces, which account for more than two-thirds of the country's vehicle production.
IHS Automotive projects plant closures through Feb. 10 would result in a 7% cut in vehicle production in China for the first quarter.
In a note, its analysts said extended closures into March may result in lost production of over 1.7 million vehicles for the period, a decline of roughly one-third of pre-virus output expectations.
""If the situation lingers into mid-March, and plants in adjacent provinces are also idled, the China-wide supply chain disruption caused by parts shortages from Hubei, a major component hub, could have a wide-reaching impact,"" they said.
Other industry experts said suppliers had built up a cushion of parts in inventory and in-transit ahead of the long Lunar New Year holiday in late January. Those will start to run out if factories cannot get back to work next week, or if flights to and from China remain limited.
Toyota said its plants outside China were operating as normal for the moment.

On Thursday, a company official told reporters the automaker was considering the possibility of manufacturing parts commonly made in China in other regions, to minimize the impact of China plant stoppages on its global production network.

About an hour downstream, in the laid-back tourist center of Luang Prabang, the dam's developers heard this week from citizens groups arguing for a delay to the 1,400-megawatt (MW) hydropower project.
Sceptics say the Lao government and its Vietnamese and Thai partners should wait to assess any impact on downstream fishing and farming from the recently completed Xayaburi dam, Laos' first mainstream Mekong hydropower project.
Faced with growing pressure from dams, pollution and sand mining, concerns are mounting about the health of Southeast Asia's greatest river and those whose livelihoods depend on it.
Construction on the Luang Prabang project is slated to begin later this year, but some nearby villagers said they still don't know when or if they will be relocated. ""We have not heard anything, but if it happens there is no choice for us,” said a farmer interviewed near the dam site, who gave his name only as Somphorn.
The past year has been fraught for the 2,390-km (1,485 mile) Lower Mekong, which supports 60 million people as it flows from China into Laos, past Myanmar and Thailand and through Cambodia and Vietnam.
Water levels hit lows not seen for 50 years, as residents worried about the effects of climate change and 11 dams that China has built in its territory, which many believe are holding back waters.
China's embassy in Bangkok says a severe drought has impacted the region since early 2019 and it has increased the outflow of water from upstream at Thailand's request.
In the past four months, Laos has also opened the first two dams on the Lower Mekong – the 1,200 MW Xayaburi and the smaller Don Sahong - after years of opposition from environmentalists.
Laos' unprecedented dam-building boom has seen around 50 dams built in the last 15 years, with at least 50 more under construction and a further 288 planned for its hundreds of rivers and streams.
If all the projects are built, they would bring the landlocked country’s hydropower capacity to 27,000 MW, from just 700 MW in 2005, according to data compiled by the Stimson Center in Washington.
FULL STREAM AHEAD
This week’s forum in Laos was to report on the Luang Prabang project’s consultation process, and the hosts assured doubters their concerns would be heard.
""Your participation is not just a hoop we have to jump through. It is not a rubber stamp of the process,"" said An Pich Hatda, CEO of the Mekong River Commission (MRC). Others are not so sure. ""It's like they half-heartedly listen to our concerns,"" said Pittipat Puangpan, a 56-year-old Thai farmer who attended another consultation last month in Thailand. Chief among those concerns is the effectiveness of the sediment gates and complicated sets of locks called fish elevators or lifts at Xayaburi, which the Luang Prabang project uses as a model. Efforts to reassure skeptics have sometimes fallen flat.
Showing animated designs for the proposed dam in Luang Prabang this week, an official paused at a complicated depiction of fish navigating one of the fish elevators. ""Maybe sometimes we should be training the fish how to use the lift,"" quipped Vithounlabandish Thommabout, deputy director of Laos’ Ministry of Energy and Mines, drawing only scattered chuckles. UNTESTED TECHNOLOGY Xayaburi's operator is a joint venture between the Communist Lao government and a subsidiary of Thai construction giant  Ch Karnchang  PCL (BK:CK). The Thai company, which is also slated to build the Luang Prabang dam, says it has spent $200 million on the measures to protect the ecosystem.
But the technology had not been tested in the region.
Thai hydrologist Pongsak Suttinon wants more data before the Luang Prabang project goes forward.
""We've never had dams in the mainstream of the Lower Mekong before Xayaburi, so a lot of the engineering information was theoretical,"" said Pongsak, who lectures at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University.
Since Xayaburi opened, the dam operator has not released data on how the pass-throughs are working, according to the MRC and others, and declined to answer questions from Reuters. The company did agree to a trip to the dam on Friday but did not allow photos or interviews with workers.
NO VETO
Despite unanswered questions about Xayaburi, groundbreaking at Luang Prabang is likely to go forward after the consultation period ends in April, many observers say.
That is because no country can veto another nation’s project under the 1995 Mekong treaty signed by Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.
Plus, in recent years, state-owned and private companies in all of the Mekong region have invested in Laos dams. One partner in Luang Prabang is a subsidiary of Vietnam’s state-owned Petrovietnam.
With money to be made on investment and many fast-growing countries eager to buy electricity, no Mekong country seems inclined to oppose the new project.
Chanthanet Boualapha, secretary general of the Lao National Mekong Committee, said Laos will try to address all concerns about the Luang Prabang dam, but pulling the country out of poverty is the first priority.
""We have the potential for hydropower … so we have to do the dams. That is our choice.”

The Nikkei newspaper reported on Thursday that Japan's third-biggest automaker would extend the factory suspensions until at least late February. Wuhan is the epicenter of a new virus outbreak that has spread across China.
Domestic rival Toyota Motor Corp said Friday its Chinese plants would remain suspended through Feb. 16."

SEOUL (Reuters) - The South Korean government said on Friday it has asked Chinese regional governments for help in resuming production at South Korean auto parts suppliers' factories in China.
 Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380) has suspended most production in South Korea as of Friday because the coronavirus outbreak in China has disrupted the supply of parts, becoming the first major car maker outside of China to do so.
Due to the production disruption, lines at parts suppliers in South Korea including  Hyundai Mobis  (KS:012330) and  Kumho Tire  (KS:073240) have also stopped, with concerns that the disruption will adversely affect smaller second- and third-tier subcontractors if the disruption is prolonged, the government said.
South Korean ministries also said in a joint statement that, if needed, they will allow affected South Korean suppliers to work extended hours in South Korea to make up for shortfalls.
Even if Chinese regional governments in coming days lift the ban on factory production aimed at stopping the spread of the coronavirus, another difficulty is workers refusing to come to work in fear of the virus, the government said.
Of the roughly 10,000 workers at a South Korean supplier's Qingdao factory, only about 15% can come to work, the South Korean government said.
Hyundai Motor will offer workshop disinfection, installation of thermal cameras, thermometers and cleaning agents for South Korean suppliers' China factories that make wiring harnesses, the component that has run out and caused Hyundai factories to stop operations this week, the government added."

WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The U.S. International Trade Commission said on Thursday it was launching a patent investigation into certain audio players and controllers sold by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google based on a complaint by rival smart speaker maker Sonos Inc.
The ITC received a complaint from Sonos last month alleging that the import of certain audio players and controllers and their components infringe on its patents. 
Sonos at the time also filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Google in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles and testified to a House of Representatives antitrust subcommittee about its frustrations with Google. 
""Sonos has made misleading statements about our history of working together. Our technology and devices were designed independently. We deny their claims vigorously, and will be defending against them,"" Google spokesman Jose Castaneda said in a statement on Thursday.
The ITC has in some cases issued orders banning products from U.S. entry on the grounds they infringe U.S. patents. The threat of such bans, known as exclusion orders, can be leverage in settlement discussions. 
But companies subject to the bans are often able to keep importing products by redesigning them to avoid using patented technology.
Sonos spokeswoman Erin Pategas said the company was pleased that the ITC will investigate ""all of our claims asserting Google blatantly infringed our intellectual property. We’ll fully cooperate throughout the duration of the investigation and feel confident about the merits of our case.""
The maker of premium home speaker devices has said Google copied its technology for connecting together multiple speakers during partnership discussions. Some Sonos speakers include voice assistant technology from Google and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Google separately sells its own Nest smart speakers, many of which are more affordable than Sonos speakers and also include Google Assistant technology and multi-device connection capabilities.
The search giant has disputed Sonos' infringement claims.
Sonos on Wednesday reported fourth-quarter revenue that beat expectations.

Google on Monday said its hardware sales declined in the fourth quarter from a year ago.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hedge fund Elliott Management Corp, one of the world's most powerful activist investors, has amassed a nearly $3 billion stake in SoftBank Group Corp and is pushing for changes to boost the Japanese conglomerate's value, sources said. 
Elliott's involvement is likely to cast new light on SoftBank's financial track record, which has been scrutinized heavily by investors after several of its expensive bets on startups around the world, including office space-sharing firm WeWork, soured.
The New York-headquartered hedge fund has owned SoftBank shares for years but late last year grew its stake into one of its largest-ever positions in a company, the sources said. Elliott now owns roughly 3% of SoftBank, the sources added.
SoftBank has been vulnerable to investor criticism that its stock trades at a deep discount to the value of its holdings.
Its shares jumped 8% on Friday morning in Tokyo, giving the conglomerate a market capitalization of roughly $95 billion.
The value of its stakes in  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), Sprint and its Japanese telecom business is roughly $210 billion.
Elliott, which oversees $40 billion in assets, has held discussions with SoftBank's management and is calling on the company to buy back some $20 billion of its stock, improve its governance by increasing the independence and diversity of its board and improving transparency, the sources said.
""Elliott's substantial investment in SoftBank Group reflects its strong conviction that the market significantly undervalues SoftBank's portfolio of assets,"" an Elliott spokeswoman said.
""Elliott has engaged privately with SoftBank's leadership and is working constructively on solutions to help SoftBank materially and sustainably reduce its discount to intrinsic value,"" the Elliott spokeswoman added.
SoftBank said it welcomes investors' feedback. ""We are in complete agreement that our shares are deeply undervalued by public investors,"" a SoftBank spokeswoman said. 
The Wall Street Journal first reported Elliott's stake on Thursday.
Elliott believes SoftBank could raise money for share buybacks by selling a small share of its publicly listed holdings and make its purchases at a sharp discount, the sources said.
The hedge fund is also calling for changes in how decisions are made at SoftBank, where its founder, Masayoshi Son, owns 25%. Major corporate decisions at the company require support from two-thirds of its shareholders, but Elliott has no plans to challenge Son's position.
Some of the discussions with Elliott have centered around improving the way investment decisions are made at SoftBank's $100 billion Vision Fund. Its mixed track record has weighed on SoftBank's effort to raise a second fund of similar size. 
Japan has become a fertile hunting ground for activist investors in recent months with Daniel Loeb's Third Point calling on Sony to spin off its semiconductor unit and Olympus Corp inviting ValueAct Capital to become a director on its board early last year.
Office-sharing company WeWork was last year's most high-profile IPO casualty, revising down its potential IPO valuation by tens of billions of dollars before eventually shelving plans to go public. It was bailed out by SoftBank for close to $10 billion. 
WeWork was not the first setback for the stock market debuts of SoftBank investments.

Shares in ride-hailing app Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) have fallen by more than a third since its listing. Shares of Slack Technologies, which develops productivity software, have tumbled by almost half.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Aurora Cannabis said Chief Executive Terry Booth will retire and Executive Chairman Michael Singer become interim CEO as the beleaguered marijuana producer announced C$1 billion ($752.79 million) in impairment charges on Thursday.
The company also cut about 500 jobs, including about 25% of corporate positions.
Aurora's U.S.-listed stock fell 13% in after-hours trading. The shares were halted earlier on Thursday.
Aurora expects impairment charges of as much as C$225 million on assets and as much as C$775 million on goodwill in the second quarter, it said. Net revenue will be between C$50 million and C$54 million, compared with C$54.2 million a year ago.
Aurora also said on Thursday it had made amendments to its secured credit facilities, including removal of some covenants, giving it options to refinance at maturity. Analysts have warned the company may not be able to meet the covenants of a C$360 million loan due in August 2021.
Aurora's expenses in the most recent quarter were almost four times its sales, and it holds less than two quarters' worth of cash and short-term investments.
Singer takes the helm as Aurora faces criticism for its aggressive global expansion amid uncertain demand. Aurora has stopped estimating when it will become profitable after missing its own guidance.
The executive change makes Aurora the latest in a string of Canadian cannabis companies, including Canopy Growth, Aphria, Supreme Cannabis and Sundial Growers to change leadership as soaring costs and disappointing sales prompt concern from investors sitting on billions of dollars in losses.
Singer has been on the board of the Alberta-based company since May 2016 and was named executive chairman nearly a year ago.
Booth, a co-founder of the company, will remain on Aurora's board and will become a strategic adviser to the company, Aurora said, confirming an earlier Reuters story.
""I don’t think we're going to see some sort of major strategic change, because Singer has been involved with the company and they're keeping Booth on as an adviser,"" said Andrew Kessner, an analyst at William O'Neill in New York. ""This is to signal to the market that they are making changes.""
Aurora has begun a formal search for a permanent CEO, Booth said in the memo without providing a time frame, adding that details would be shared once the process is complete.
Booth's departure follows the abrupt exit of Chief Commercial Officer Cam Battley in December."

The 120 megawatt (MW) solar farm at Wandoan in the state of Queensland is expected to be completed in early 2021. Shell will be the anchor customer for power from the project, partly for its nearby QGC coal-seam gas operation that feeds its QCLNG plant on Curtis Island.
""We believe solar will play an increasing role in the global energy system, especially when partnered with a reliable energy source such as gas,"" Shell Australia Chairman Tony Nunan said in a statement.
The company declined to comment on how much the solar project would cost.
The move follows Shell's acquisition last year of Australian industrial electricity retailer ERM Power and a stake in Australian solar developer ESCO Pacific. It has said it plans to boost annual spending on its power strategy to between $2 billion and $3 billion by 2025."

The company also beat estimates for average revenue per user and provided a bullish 2020 sales forecast as measures like adding augmented reality features to its platform and expanding into markets like Denmark, Norway and Switzerland attracted more users.
""We've seen great success in monetizing in English-speaking countries outside of the U.S. and the investments we've made in Western Europe are paying off nicely,"" Chief Financial Officer Todd Morgenfeld said on a post-earnings call.
Total revenue jumped 46% to $400 million in the fourth quarter, while monthly active users climbed 26% to 335 million globally.
Financial analysts tracked by Refinitiv had expected revenue of $371.2 million, while user additions were projected at 331.3 million by market research firm FactSet.
""The impressive revenue upside shows Pinterest is back on track following the air pocket the company hit in Q3,"" said Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell.
Pinterest missed Wall Street estimates for quarterly revenue in the third quarter on lower-than-expected average revenue per user. Shares tumbled 19% on Oct. 31 after the release.
The company on Thursday also beat estimates for average revenue per user, reporting $1.22 per user globally compared with expectation of $1.14, according to FactSet. Average revenue per user was $1.06 a year earlier.
Pinterest generates revenue by placing ads next to pins or posts in the feed that users, or ""Pinners"", upload to its platform.
The company overtook Snap Inc's Snapchat as the third-biggest social media platform in the United States in 2019, according to market researcher eMarketer and its worldwide digital ad market share grew slightly to 0.3%.
""This year, we plan to focus on improving the experience from mid-sized and international advertisers,"" said Chief Executive Officer Benjamin Silbermann.
Pinterest is one of the exceptions among the so-called unicorns, or startups valued at more than $1 billion, that went public last year.
The company's shares are up 22% since the listing in April, while Uber (NYSE:UBER) Technologies Inc's stock is down 17% and its rival  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) 34% since their IPOs.
Pinterest forecast 2020 revenue of up to $1.52 billion, while analysts were expecting $1.50 billion.
Excluding certain items, the company earned 12 cents per share in the latest quarter, beating estimates of 8 cents."
521,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 06, 2020 06:39PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch for Feb. 7,"Investing.com - Here are three things that could rock the markets tomorrow.
1. Payrolls Seen Rising 160K, but Watch Annual Revisions
The market will move past the earnings numbers tomorrow and concentrate on the payroll numbers as the latest government employment report arrives.
The Labor Department will report on the January jobs situation at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).
Nonfarm payrolls for the month are expected to have risen by 160,000, compared with a rise of 145,000 in December, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
The jobless rate is seen remaining at 3.5%.
Average hourly earnings, a measure of wage inflation, are forecast to have risen 0.3% for January, up 3% year on year.
Health care, leisure and hospitality are expected to drive the month’s payroll gains, according to Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.
But the “big news will come in revisions affecting April 2018 to March 2019, from which we could see about 500,000 jobs disappear, along with other revisions through 2019,” Swonk said in a note this week. “Many of the losses appear to have fallen during the latter part of 2018 and the early part of 2019 but revisions are expected to suppress the annual totals for both 2018 and 2019.”
2. Canada Goose Earnings Fly Into View
Winter clothing company Canada Goose (NYSE:GOOS) will release earnings before the bell tomorrow and should get some interest given the uncertainty around the stock.
The company is expected to report a profit of 81 cents per share on sales of about $340 million, according to analysts’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
The stock was under pressure given questions about impact on its Asia business due to the coronavirus and protests in Hong Kong.
But it’s been volatile enough to see a sharp jump when the company named Kate Upton a “Goose Person.”
Sports fans will be keeping an eye on Madison Square (NYSE:SQ) Garden (NYSE:MSG) earnings with the New York Knicks still in disarray.
As the basketball team searches for a new president, owner James Dolan felt the need to issues a statement today saying he was not selling the team.
3. Pot Stocks Take a Hit Again
Cannabis stocks could be under pressure again tomorrow after another shakeup at the top for public company.
Shares of Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) plunged 13% in after-hours trading after it announced CEO Terry Booth will be stepping down and it would be cutting 500 jobs.
The company also warned on second-quarter revenue.
It expects to report between $50 million and $54 million in net revenue for the three-month period, the company said Thursday. That's well below the $61 million analysts polled by Investing.com were expecting."

(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) was ordered on Thursday by a New Jersey state jury to pay punitive damages of $750 million to four plaintiffs who allege that the company's Baby Powder caused their cancer, a ruling that will be reduced to around $185 million because of state laws, according to a lawyer for the plaintiffs and the company.
During an earlier phase of the trial, a different jury held J&J liable for the plaintiffs' cancers and awarded them $37.2 million in compensation. 
Under New Jersey law, punitive damages are capped at 5 times the amount of compensatory damages, according to plaintiffs lawyer Chris Placitella. 
J&J said in a statement it would quickly appeal both phases of the trial, citing ""numerous legal errors that subjected the jury to irrelevant information and prevented them from hearing meaningful evidence.""
The verdict came after J&J Chief Executive Alex Gorsky testified last month for the first time in a jury trial over allegations that the company's Baby Powder causes cancer. 
""We believe the jury was speaking directly to Alex Gorsky,"" plaintiffs lawyer Placitella said. 
J&J faces more than 16,000 lawsuits alleging it sold powders contaminated with asbestos and failed to warn users. It also faces a federal criminal investigation into how forthright it has been about the products' safety.
J&J denies that its talc causes cancer, saying numerous studies and tests by regulators worldwide have shown its talc to be safe and asbestos-free.
On Dec. 14, 2018, Reuters published a story that showed J&J had failed to disclose that small amounts of asbestos, a known carcinogen, had sometimes been found in its talc over several decades. After the report was published, a selloff wiped more than $40 billion off the company's market value.

At the time, J&J dismissed the Reuters' report as ""an absurd conspiracy theory.""

Investing.com – Shares of Canadian marijuana grower   Aurora Cannabis   Inc (TSX:ACB)(NYSE:ACB) plunged postmarket Thursday after the company announced CEO Terry Booth is stepping down and staff layoffs would be announced.
Shares lost 13% in after-hours trading.
About 500 jobs are expected to be cut, including about 25% of its head office positions. In addition, in a release on Thursday, Aurora said it plans to make close to about $1 billion in writedowns – between $190 million to $225 million on property, plant and equipment and $740 million to $775 million in goodwill. 
The stock fell more than 5% in both Canada and the U.S. in the regular session.
The cannabis company is the latest in a growing string of companies in the sector to see top executives leave since the beginning of 2020. Aurora’s plan to cut staff also follows on the heels of another pot grower this week, which trimmed its workforce to lower costs. On Tuesday,   Tilray Inc   (NASDAQ:TLRY) announced it had cut its workforce by 10%.
Tilray’s job cuts, which affected a little more than 140 workers, is part of a global restructuring, the company said in a statement earlier this week.
Booth is the second big name to leave Aurora in the past few months. In December, Chief Commercial Officer Cam Battley, a prominent company spokesman, resigned. Earlier today, the company announced executive chairman Michael Singer would take over interim CEO.
In the past year Aurora stock has dropped more than 72% on the S&P/TSX and slightly more than 73% on the New York Stock Exchange. It closed yesterday at US$2.00 (C$2.665).
Aurora will release its second-quarter results on Feb. 12. It expects to report between $50 million and $54 million in net revenue for the three-month period, the company said Thursday. That's well below the $61 million analysts polled by Investing.com were expecting.
In the previous quarter it reported $75.2 million in revenue.
In addition to the staff cuts, Aurora plans to trim spending on everything from tech projects to marketing.
“These are necessary steps that reflect a fundamental change in how we will operate the business going forward,” Singer said in a statement."

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's government should fund initiatives like a proposed C$1.6 billion ($1.2 billion) project that would provide power and fiber optics to the country's remote north and spur new business, said a gold mining executive on Thursday.
Canada's Infrastructure Bank on Wednesday signed a memorandum of understanding to assess the project, which needs federal investment to get built and would run to Nunavut from Manitoba.
""This has to be looked at as nation building,"" said Agnico Eagle CEO Sean Boyd in an interview. Agnico, Canada's largest gold producer, runs three gold mines in the Kivalliq region and is Nunavut's largest private employer.
""A big part of that funding has to come from the federal government to not only build the power line to benefit the current communities, but to look at it as a way to finally open up an area which has tremendous potential,"" he said.
Nunavut is a vast Arctic region - the size of Mexico - with a population of 36,000 mostly Inuit that separated officially from the Northwest Territories 20 years ago. Though rich with mineral deposits, it suffers from a dire lack of infrastructure and all electricity is produced by diesel generators.
Electricity production for the territory consumes 55 million liters (15 million gallons) of diesel each year, and Agnico Eagle's Nunavut sites require 80 million liters (21 million gallons).
""As we're considering major projects and as we make new discoveries in the north, which we believe will be there, we need a cost structure that allows you to build those into meaningful businesses,"" Boyd said.
The proposed hydroelectric and fiber optic cables would supply five communities and two Agnico mines, Northern Affairs Minister Daniel Vandal said on Wednesday, saying the government ""is proud to support"" collaboration in the project.
With little political clout, Canada's far northern territories have struggled to attract the federal infrastructure investment needed to make them more economically productive."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Large banks with significant trading operations will have their finances tested in 2020 against a scenario that includes ""heightened stress"" in leveraged loans, the Federal Reserve announced on Thursday.
The Fed also plans to test banks with substantial trading or processing operations against a hypothetical counterparty default as part of its 2020 round of stress tests.
The Fed's focus on leveraged lending in the upcoming round of stress tests comes after regulators and some in the industry have aired concern for years over the rapid growth in the corporate debt market, particularly in loans to already heavily-indebted firms.
“This year’s stress test will help us evaluate how large banks perform during a severe recession, and give us increased information on how leveraged loans and collateralized loan obligations may respond to a recession,"" said Fed Vice Chairman Randal Quarles in a statement.
The annual health check of big bank finances will continue to include a hypothetical severe economic downturn, where the unemployment rate nearly triples to 10% and economies worldwide contract significantly.
Eleven of the largest U.S. banks, including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), will have to face the leveraged lending component, and those firms will also face the specific test on counterparty default alongside custody banks Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) and  State Street  Corporation (NYSE:STT).

All told, 34 banks with more than $100 billion in assets will face this year's stress test. The Fed approved capital plans for all tested banks after the 2019 cycle.

528,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 06, 2020 04:59PM ET</span>",Musk Needs Apple’s Margins and VW’s Sales to Justify Tesla Value,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. has always had one foot in the automotive world and the other in technology. But when it comes to the company’s valuation, neither truly fits.
The stock’s stunning ascent -- doubling in just the first 23 sessions of the year on record vehicle deliveries, the opening of a China plant and an earlier-than-expected profit at a jointly operated battery factory -- has cooled off as exuberance gives way to caution. But the still-meteoric advance of the last five weeks has prompted more comparisons with high-growth technology names, and even has tech-focused market watchers looking more closely at the stock’s fundamentals.
“With Tesla’s extraordinary rise from $180 last year to nearly $1,000 this past Tuesday, we are receiving an increasing volume of calls from tech PMs and analysts who have begun to pick up coverage of Tesla from the traditional industrials/autos cohort,”  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a report, referring to portfolio managers.
The stock was volatile again Thursday, reversing early declines after two Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives introduced legislation to create a nationwide network of electric-vehicle charging stations. The measure is unlikely to pass in an election year with Republicans controlling the Senate.
Auto Comparisons
Tesla’s valuation, which hovered around $132 billion after Wednesday’s plunge, reflects a price-to-sales multiple around 5, compared with 0.4 for General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). and 0.2 for Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. Toyota Motor Corp. and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG also trade at a multiple of less than 1. Tesla bulls, however, say it’s unfair to compare it with legacy automakers, pointing instead to technology companies as its true peers.
“It appears Tesla, in the market’s view, has gone far past the point of comparison vs traditional auto companies,” Jonas said. While Tesla’s valuation is an order of magnitude higher than autos peers, he said, “we think this is largely deserved -- Tesla is a significantly faster-growing auto company, and it is also more than an auto company.”
Yet the current share price doesn’t stand up to scrutiny when comparing Tesla with the more diversified Nasdaq 100 Index. Members of the gauge trade at an average of 6.28 times their sales and 36.5 times their earnings, which implies that Tesla would need an annual profit of $4.6 billion to justify its market value. Members of the technology-focused NYSE FANG+ Index trade at 50 times their earnings.
Tesla can’t yet be measured on a comparable price-to-earnings basis since it hasn’t had four straight profitable quarters on a GAAP basis. It was in the black in the past two periods on an adjusted basis.
“Tesla could be at $900, but it would need revenues like Volkswagen, margins like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and reinvest like no other manufacturing company in history has ever done,” said Aswath Damodaran, a professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business who specializes in valuation. It’s possible Tesla succeeds in doing one of those things, but “connect them together and that’s when the story implodes. This is a Grimm fairy tale with manic swings.”
Little Sense
Tesla reported an annual loss on a GAAP basis of about $862 million for 2019. Wall Street analysts, on average, expect it to reach $4.9 billion in net income in 2023.
“Tesla is trading at well over two times the enterprise value of Daimler, and three times of BMW,” Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin, said in an interview. “That doesn’t seem to make so much sense to me.”
The debate comes down to whether Tesla has a years- or some day even a decade-long lead over other automakers in the electric-car race. It “seems the market has decided it’s a much longer lead than a one or two years,” Irwin said.
“Not to sound like an ‘OK, boomer’ to the younger investors rushing into Tesla shares, but the recent price action brings to mind Nasdaq circa 1999,”  Barclays  (LON:BARC) auto analyst Brian Johnson said. The recent price surge opened up the possibility of raising capital cheaply, reducing any chance of a stalled business, yet Tesla remains fundamentally overvalued, he said.
Tesla’s volatile swings over the past few days called to mind a similar performance from Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc. almost exactly 20 years ago, when the stock soared 360% over five months. After touching a high of $100 in early January 2000, the stock started paring the gains. Only now, roughly two decades later, has it re-approached those levels. Qualcomm traded around $88 Thursday after issuing a disappointing forecast for second-quarter chip shipments.
“The whole thing seems preposterous, it is the craziest thing since 1999,” said Williams (NYSE:WMB) Trading’s Brad Meikle, who is one of the most bearish Tesla analysts on Wall Street. “It is absolutely a bubble.”"

In Uber's earnings call, Khosrowshahi said the company was moving its earnings (EBITDA) profitability target to the fourth quarter of 2020, ahead of its original pledge of profitability in 2021.
Shares rose more than 5% in after-hours trading.
Uber reported a fourth-quarter loss of $0.64 a share on revenue of $4.07 billion, beating Wall Street estimates for a loss of $0.68 a share on revenue of $4.06 billion.
Gross bookings grew 28% to $4 billion for the quarter, year over year. But bookings in its rides business rose 18% to $13.51 billion, short of Wall Street estimates of $13.60 billion, raising some concern over rising competition.
Monthly active platform consumers, a tally of each consumer who completed a ride or ordered a meal, rose 22% to 111 million in the quarter. 
The narrower-than-expected loss comes as the company has set its sights on profitability, agreesing to sell its Uber Eats business in India earlier this year.
Costs, however, continue to swell, rising 59% to $22.7 billion in 2019 from a year earlier.
""There are some early signs in this report that Uber is positioning itself for profitable growth,"" Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar said.

The plan comes as Jeff Bezos' e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) prepares to build its own internet network of over 3,000 satellites in low-Earth orbit through its Project Kuiper. 
SpaceX has been launching Starlink satellites in batches of 60 since May and currently has 240 orbiting Earth. The company aims to make the broadband internet service operational by the end of 2020. 
Earlier in the day, Bloomberg reported the possibility of Starlink going public, citing Chief Operating Officer Gwynne Shotwell.
""Right now, we are a private company, but Starlink is the right kind of business that we can go ahead and take public,"" the report quoted Shotwell saying at a private investor event in Miami. 
Shotwell's remarks came on the day of a key launch from Starlink's main competitor OneWeb Satellites, a SoftBank-backed venture that aims to send 34 of its planned 648 satellites to space on Thursday. 
Musk said last year Starlink was an important new revenue stream for his California-based Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX.
The company's so-called Starlink constellation is a planned network of up to 30,000 satellites in low-Earth orbit intended to beam broadband internet globally.

In May, SpaceX launched the first batch of 60 small satellites for Starlink internet service.

(Reuters) -  Fidelity National Financial  Inc (N:FNF) is nearing a deal to acquire U.S. annuities and life insurance company FGL Holdings Inc (N:FG), as it seeks to expand beyond its core title insurance business, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
If the negotiations are concluded successfully, a deal for FGL, which has a market value of $2.7 billion, could be announced in the next few days, the sources said, cautioning that an agreement is not certain. The exact price being negotiated could not be learned. 
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. FGL and Fidelity National Financial did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
FGL shares ended trading up 19% at $12.13 following the news on Thursday. Fidelity National shares rose 0.1% to $49.06 giving the company a market capitalization of $13.6 billion. 
Based in Des Moines, Iowa, FGL is a provider of annuity and life insurance products. It generated $1.55 billion in revenue in the first nine months of 2019, up 68% year on year.
FGL was acquired in 2017 in an $1.84 billion deal by an investor group led by a so-called special purpose acquisition company founded by veteran dealmaker Chinh Chu, as well as funds affiliated with private equity firm Blackstone Group Inc (N:BX) and Fidelity National Financial. 
Fidelity National Financial had a 7.6% stake in FGL as of the end of September. Blackstone is expected to keep a stake in the combined company, two of the sources said. 
Based in Jacksonville, Florida, Fidelity National Financial provides title insurance and transaction services to the real estate and mortgage industries. It reported revenues of $6.1 billion in the first nine months of 2019, up 3.5% on the prior year period.

541,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2020 03:52PM ET</span>","New 737 MAX software flaw found during tests, Boeing sticks to return timeline","By Alistair Smout and David Shepardson
LONDON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Flight testers discovered another flaw in the software of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's grounded 737 MAX, the plane that suffered two fatal crashes, though the company and the top U.S. aviation regulator said on Thursday the issue most likely could be fixed without extending the target date for the plane's return to service.
U.S. Federal Aviation Administrator Steve Dickson mentioned the new flaw at an airline industry event in London, but said he did not think it ""will be a significant delay"" in the aircraft's return.
The 737 MAX was grounded in March after two crashes killed 346 people. Boeing has had several setbacks in its efforts to update software that played a role in both crashes and win approval for the jets to fly again.
In January, the FAA and Boeing said they were reviewing a wiring issue that could potentially cause a short circuit on the grounded 737 MAX. The new issue involves an indicator light associated with the stabilizer trim system that incorrectly illuminated in the flight deck during testing.
Boeing said in a statement it was working on an update to ensure that the light ""only illuminate as intended."" It said the issue will not affect its mid-2020 estimate for the plane's return to service. 
Dickson, the U.S. regulator responsible for approving 737 MAX updates, said a key certification flight might take place in the next few weeks, though it could depend on how Boeing resolves the new software issue.
He said that international air safety regulators were likely to agree on the design fixes needed for the return, but cautioned against any definitive timeline.
While international regulators including EASA might differ in terms of the operational return to service of the plane, he said they agreed on what needed to be fixed.
""On the design approval, from everything that I have seen I think we'll have very solid alignment,"" he said.
Boeing shares rose 3.6%, with investors reassured by the comments from Dickson and the planemaker despite the new flaw.
Boeing has said its best estimate is that the aircraft will not be back in the air until mid-2020, after endorsing simulator training for pilots before flights resume, and that regulators will determine the timing.
Last month, Dickson told senior U.S. airline officials the FAA could approve the return of the aircraft before mid-year, earlier than the planemaker has suggested, according to people briefed on the call. 
On the wire bundles, Boeing said on Thursday it was still performing analysis including lab testing, fleet data assessment and third party reviews and that it would be premature to speculate as to whether the analysis will lead to design changes. 
Officials have said the review was looking at whether two bundles of wiring are too close together, which could lead to a short circuit and potentially result in a crash if pilots did not respond appropriately.
""They have not given us a proposal on the wiring yet,"" Dickson said.

""I wouldn't say I'm worried. I want them to take whatever time they need to give us a fulsome and a data-driven proposal.""

  Altria Group   (NYSE:MO), which took a 35% stake in Juul in 2018, rose 1%. The tobacco giant wrote down another $4 billion on its investment in the vaping company last week, bringing the value of the stake to $12 billion from $38 billion originally.

543,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 06, 2020 03:36PM ET</span>","Equity Bulls, Beware. Insiders Are Rushing to Sell Their Stocks","(Bloomberg) -- The list of warning signs for the rally that’s pushing U.S. stocks toward another record is growing longer.
As the S&P 500 Index embarked on a torrid four-day rally, corporate executives and officers have stepped up selling shares in their own companies -- so much so that there were five insider sales for every one buy, according to data compiled by Washington Service. That’s poised to be the highest since early 2017.
Insiders have been stepping up the pace of sales all year, taking advantage of the S&P 500’s 12% rally since the end of September that pushed valuations toward the highest in almost two decades. While other factors can also drive the decision to unload shares, the action from companies’ highest-ranking employees is worth heeding -- a similar spike in insider sales coincided with the market’s peak in January 2018 that gave way to a sell-off later in the year.
“In the broad-brush sense, more sellers than buyers is somewhat related to valuations,” Peter Jankovskis, Oakbrook Investments LLC’s co-chief investment officer, said by phone. “It does provide a note of caution as we continue to see the market surging higher and higher.”

The U.S.-listed casino operator said it would not go ahead with the second tranche of a planned purchase of about 20% of Crown from casino mogul James Packer for a total of A$1.76 billion ($1.19 billion).
Melco, which currently holds 9.99% in Crown Resorts, also abandoned plans for a seat on Crown's board.
The rapid outbreak of the coronavirus has killed more than 560 and infected over 28,000, with airlines cancelling flights and companies closing factories and stores in China.
Earlier this week, Macau, the world's biggest gambling hub, ordered all casino operators to suspend operations for two weeks. The Chinese territory has confirmed at least 10 cases so far.
The company will now focus on Macau, the Philippines and Cyprus and will still seek a casino license in Japan, Melco said in a regulatory filing.

Investing.com – Sonos left its guidance unchanged on Thursday, despite delivering blowout quarterly earnings, but some on Wall Street are convinced the audio device maker is setting itself up to outperform.
Sonos (NASDAQ:SONO) reported earnings of 60 cents a share and revenue of $562 million, beating Wall Street estimates for 48 cents a share on revenue of $546 million, sending its shares up 11%.
The quarter of performance was driven by sales of newly-launched products, with its portable speakers, in particular, proving hit with audiophiles over the crucial holiday period.
Despite revenue rising 13% for the quarter from a year earlier, the company refrained from lifting guidance, saying that planned promotion during the first quarter generated more-than-expected sales that likely pulled forward revenue from the second quarter.
The company maintained its guidance on fiscal 2020 revenue in the range of $1.365 billion to $1.4 billion.
Some on Wall Street, however, see the guidance as overly cautious in the wake of easing U.S.-China trade tensions following the phase one deal agreement last month.
""Sonos reported $20 million of tariff-related impact during the quarter, slightly ahead of the $15 million impact provided with initial guidance,"" RBC said ""Surprisingly, despite the reduction to 7.5% from 15% as part of Phase 1 trade deal, Sonos still expects a $30 million tariff impact for the full year. ""
""While guidance was held flat, we believe that decision is likely out of conservatism, and we expect Sonos will deliver results at the high-end (or above) its full-year targets,"" the bank added."

The S&P 500’s four-day rally topped 3.5% as major equity benchmarks hit all-time highs on the strength of solid corporate results and signs that central banks stand ready to act if growth falters. The torrid ascent has some firms warning about a sense of euphoria taking over among investors, especially as the coronavirus epidemic continues to spread and China's economy remains virtually locked down.

Cancellations included 20 single-aisle jets from Colombia's Avianca, balanced by 20 orders for broadly similar aircraft from leasing company BOC Aviation in what some industry sources have described as a swap to ease their financing. Neither firm was available for comment.

Airbus is expected to give targets next week and barring a worsening of the coronavirus crisis could shoot for record deliveries of at least 900 jets in 2020 as Boeing remains on a backfoot due to the MAX grounding, industry analysts say.

548,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2020 02:22PM ET</span>",BlackRock looks for middle ground on shareholder resolution reforms,"By Ross Kerber
NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) has cited both the value and costs of shareholder proposals in a long-awaited letter to regulators weighing reforms to the proxy process, effectively looking for a middle ground in a hotly contested area of U.S. rulemaking.
The letter provided by a spokesman for the world's largest asset manager on Thursday was just one of thousands of backlogged comments to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that were due on Monday and still being posted to the agency's website.
But with some $7.4 trillion under management, BlackRock's views have been eagerly awaited both by corporations supportive of the rule changes to streamline their annual meetings, and investor activists worried the SEC will make it harder to bring attention to environmental, social and governance issues.
Both sides had hoped that BlackRock would support them ahead of an SEC vote as soon as March, especially in light of a new focus on climate issues outlined by BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink last month.
Instead, in the letter dated Feb. 3, BlackRock Vice Chairman Barbara Novick did not specifically address controversial ideas the SEC advanced in a partisan vote in November, such as raising the current threshold of $2,000 worth of stock needed to file some resolutions.
""Shareholder proposals can be a valuable part of an investment stewardship process, however, it should be acknowledged that the costs of these proposals are borne by all shareholders,"" Novick wrote.
She also did not take a strong stand on related reforms the SEC is considering for proxy advisers, changes that have raised concerns from hedge funds.
BlackRock has previously declined to comment on its views in detail, and spokesmen did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday.
Among other big passive fund managers, Vanguard Group has filed comments supportive of the SEC's changes. A  State Street  Corp (N:STT) executive said in an interview last week the firm did not have a view on the matter. Some smaller active managers have criticized the reforms.
Richard Fields, a King & Spalding LLP attorney who represents corporations, said that in avoiding specifics in its SEC comments, ""BlackRock has chosen to stay squarely on the fence.""
That could reflect the fact that BlackRock's clients will have a wide range of views on the shareholder proposals, he added, but ""one might have assumed that Fink’s January letter would herald a more assertive posture here.""
Jon Hale, global head of sustainable investing research for Morningstar, said previously the new rules would undermine the process of engagement between shareholders and company managers on climate risk and other sustainability issues.
Asked about Novick's letter, Hale said by email, ""I think it would have been more to the point for BlackRock’s letter to have said simply: Dear SEC: We don’t have a clear position on either of these issues. Sincerely, BlackRock."""

Investing.com -   World Wrestling Entertainment   (NYSE:WWE) took another tumble Thursday as its quarterly results disappointed already-pessimistic investors.
The stock fell 9% in afternoon trading.
Shares are at their lowest level since May 2018.
WWE shares had already been slammed at the end of January when it announced it was making changes at the top, based on “different views on how best to achieve our strategic priorities.”
The company said Co-Presidents George Barrios and Michelle Wilson would be leaving, with board member Frank A. Riddick III taking the role of interim chief financial officer.
Before the bell, WWE reported earnings of 78 cents per share on revenue of $322.8 million.
Profit was ahead of the 74 cents per share expected by analysts polled by Investing.com, but revenue fell short of the forecast of $333.7 million.
WWE said it was planning on undertaking strategic alternatives to improve monetization this year, including distribution in the Middle East and India.
Excluding those costs, adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBDA) is expected to be $60 million to $65 million in the first quarter and $250 million to $300 million for 2020."

APASEO EL GRANDE, Mexico (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp will ramp up production at its new Mexican plant to 100,000 vehicles a year by 2021, marking a major step to shift production of its popular Tacoma pickup truck to Mexico from the United States, the company said on Thursday.
The plant in the central state of Guanajuato, along with an older facility near the U.S. border, will bring Toyota's Mexican production to 266,000 trucks a year when at full capacity, the company added.
Toyota said it expects to send 95% of pickups from the two plants to the United States, where the automaker sold nearly 249,000 Tacomas last year, up 1.3%.
""Tacoma production will be concentrated right here in Mexico,"" said Christopher Reynolds, a chief administrative officer for Toyota in North America, at an event to inaugurate the Guanajuato plant.
""What this means is that the Mexican manufacturing facilities of Toyota will build all the Tacomas that serve the mid-size pickup segment in the North American market.""
Toyota previously said it would move Tacoma production from the United States to Mexico as it adjusts production around North America.
Japan's largest automaker pumped $700 million into the Guanajuato site, which began operating last December. Toyota began making Tacoma trucks in 2003 at its plant in Mexico's northern border city of Tecate, where last year it turned out close to 167,000 pickups.
Automotive exports from Mexico fell for the first time in a decade last year, dragged down by weak demand from outside the United States, and industry groups project another drop in 2020."

LONDON/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - China's fast-spreading coronavirus is throwing the global container shipping trade out of sync, with lines re-routing cargoes and reducing calls to Chinese ports, setting the scene for months of delivery delays ahead, industry sources said.
The spread of the deadly virus has shut down cities and factories in China and disrupted global air travel.
China's decision to extend its Lunar New Year holiday period until Feb. 10 has compounded logistical complications, despite its ports staying open. China is a vital link to the container sector, transporting everything from fresh food to phones and designer clothes as well as industrial parts.
The world's top container lines Maersk (CO:MAERSKb), MSC and CMA CGM have all reduced calls to China, known as blank sailings, the companies said in recent days.
Exports of goods from China have already been hit, with broader repercussions.  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380) has said it will suspend production in South Korea, its biggest manufacturing base, because of a lack of spare parts.
Disruptions to sea cargo flows have compounded an already pressured situation for shipping lines as they struggle with weaker markets and higher costs from new International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations on low sulfur fuel.
Shipping and trade sources say regular schedules are also being affected by truck and port workers in China stuck at home or away from their places of work. In addition, warehouses around dock areas in China are not fully working. This has led to ships being diverted from China to ports in South Korea.
South Korea's Busan port, one of the world's major container terminals, has already seen a spillover with container capacity at 78% and could rise further from its usual level of 70%, a Busan port official said.
""Shippers are parking cargo at our ports, so later, perhaps when the coronavirus dies down and the level of cargo (backlogged in China ports) decreases, they can deploy a small ship to carry these cargo to their destination in Chinese ports,"" the official said.
If container levels increased to over 80% it would be difficult to run the port efficiently, the official said.
MORE DELAYS AHEAD
While China's Lunar New Year period usually leads to a slowdown, the virus is expected to further reduce cargo volumes.
Lasse Kristoffersen, chief executive of Norwegian shipping group Torvald Klaveness, told Reuters that 25% of its container fleet was affected as sailings were canceled.
""This is largely due to lower volumes on China. This is normal during Lunar New Year, but it seems to us that the volumes are lower than normal for this period – likely impacted by the coronavirus,"" he told Reuters.
U.S.-based shipping industry consultant Jon Monroe, whose company is active in China, said that blank sailings in February were higher than usual. Even when the impact of the virus dies down there will be a rush to ship goods in and out of China, creating more logistical problems.
""Everybody will be making up for lost time. This is really the perfect storm,"" he said.
Shipping consultancy Alphaliner said extended holidays and emergency measures to tackle the virus were estimated to reduce cargo volumes at Chinese ports including Hong Kong by over 6 million TEUs (20 foot equivalent units) in the first quarter of 2020 and forecast global container throughput growth would fall by at least 0.7% in 2020. China's container throughput rose last year by over 4% to 261.25 million TEU.
""Since these extended void sailing programs on long-haul services (by container lines) are slated to continue until mid-March, any cargo volume recovery could be negatively affected, even after the end of the holidays,"" Alphaliner said.
Executives at seaports on the U.S. West Coast, which handle the majority of Chinese imports into the United States, are preparing for expected disruptions.
""You'll see soft levels of imports go into the month of March,"" Port of Los Angeles executive director Gene Seroka told Reuters."

Earlier this week, Apple closed three stores in China due to concerns about the spread of the virus.
It's joining a handful of overseas retailers, including Starbucks Corp and McDonald's Corp to temporarily shut storefronts as a precautionary measure.
Many other companies, meanwhile, have called for employees in China to work from home and cease non-essential business travel in the first week of February.
Normally, businesses in China would be preparing to return to normal operations following the end of the week-long Lunar New Year Holiday.
Apple remains heavily reliant on China both for smartphone sales as well as for its supply chain and manufacturing. Many factories in Hubei province, including plants run by AB InBev and General Motors Co, have temporarily suspended production due to the virus.

MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - European banks have started 2020 on a strong note, much like their rivals in the United States, with a revival in bond trading offsetting pressures from negative interest rates.
The European bank shares (SX7P) index erased all of its year-to-date losses on Thursday as strong trading and fee revenues from major banks in the region pointed to a better-than-expected earnings season.
Although  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) had to cut profit targets on Wednesday because of the lower for longer rate environment, investors reacted positively to the French bank's bumper trading revenues.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) reported a 5.7 billion euros ($6.3 billion) annual loss last week on turnaround costs but investors shrugged off the one-off impact and welcomed a jump in the bank's cash-cow bond trading business.
Deutsche's shares got another boost on Thursday when Los Angeles-based Capital Group said it had taken a 3.1% stake.
But European bank shares are trading at record low levels relative to their Wall Street rivals partly because they have been losing investment banking market share. Their share of the investment banking business dropped to 36% in the third quarter of 2019 from 45% in 2013, data from Coalition shows.
Margin pressures remain strong. But ""customers' dynamism and financial markets performance enabled banks to report decent toplines,"" Miguel Raminhos, analyst financial institutions at Natixis in Paris, said.
""The other good news is the overall strong capital generation this quarter.""

BUMPER BOND TRADING
Fourth-quarter trends at the European banks mirror that of Wall Street. JPMorgan (N:JPM) and Citi's (N:C) bond trading revenues jumped 86% and 49%, respectively.
In Europe, BNP Paribas' fixed income trading jumped 62.5% to 820 million euros and returns from equity trading and prime services rose more than three times.
More clues on how trading is faring at European banks will come when  Barclays  (L:BARC), one of the biggest players in bond trading, reports its fourth-quarter results on Feb 13.
But the outperformance, in part, also reflects the weak fourth quarter in 2018 when investment banks reported a big drop in trading revenues due to a sharp sell-off in financial markets.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts said European banks' aggregate pre-tax proﬁts are up more than 15% so far in the fourth-quarter reporting season, 5% ahead its own forecasts, with gains in trading and fees lifting overall revenues 3% from a year earlier.
But one quarter of outperformance does not necessarily signal a trend.
European banks still have to grapple with negative rates, slower economic growth, strict capital requirements and more fragmented markets that put them at a disadvantage compared with their U.S. rivals.
On Thursday, European banking index was up 1.6% by 1113 GMT, leading sectoral performers in the region.

Late Wednesday, Huwaei sued Verizon in two U.S. District courts in Texas, alleging the company used 12 Huawei patents without authorization in areas such as computer networking, download security and video communications. The suit sought an unspecified amount of compensation and ongoing royalty payments.
Verizon on Thursday called the lawsuits ""nothing more than a PR stunt"" and ""a sneak attack on our company and the entire tech ecosystem.""
Huawei said in a statement it ""is simply asking that Verizon respect Huawei's investment in research and development by either paying for the use of our patents, or refraining from using them in its products and services.""
Verizon's statement said: ""Huawei’s real target is not Verizon; it is any country or company that defies it. The action lacks merit, and we look forward to vigorously defending ourselves.""
Huawei alleged Verizon has ""profited greatly"" from its technology. It said the U.S. company's Wireline segment, which covers voice, data and video communications products, generated revenue of $29.8 billion in 2018.
Huawei and Verizon held six face-to-face meetings over the matter since February last year, according to the lawsuits. Huawei said it met with Verizon in New York on Jan. 21 ""but there was no substantial progress and thus no licensing agreement was reached.""
Huawei said Verizon is providing access to infringing technologies and services that use Huawei patented technology, ""such as Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) Integrated Service Routers, Aggregation Services Routers, Network Convergence Systems, Nexus Switches, Catalyst Switches, and Clouds Services Router 1000v series, which facilitate communications throughout Verizon’s networks.""
In June, Reuters reported Huawei told Verizon it should pay licensing fees for use of more than 230 Huawei patents and was seeking more than $1 billion.
The Chinese company decided to take action for 12 patents because it considered evidence clearest and that number was manageable for the litigation, a person told Reuters. 
Huawei in December also sued the U.S. Federal Communications Commission after the FCC designated the company a security threat, which Huawei denies, and barred it from a government subsidy program. 

Huawei has received more than $1.4 billion in patent license fees since 2015 and paid over $6 billion for use of patented technology, the company said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Europe's future must be based on fair competition rules, EU antitrust regulators said on Monday, after Germany and France reiterated calls for a speedy overhaul of the bloc's rules to help EU companies better compete with U.S. and Chinese rivals.
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier, Italian Industry Minister Stefano Patuanelli and Poland's Development Minister Jadwiga Emilewicz in a joint letter to EU competition and digital chief Margrethe Vestager called for proposals by the end of June.
Le Maire and Altmaier kicked off the debate more than a year ago after Vestager vetoed  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) and Alstom's (PA:ALSO) bid to merge their rail operations to face off Chinese competitors.
To mollify such concerns, Vestager has subsequently said she was looking to update various elements of EU competition rules to meet digital and green challenges and also reviewing guidelines on state aid and agreements between companies.
She will also issue rules in the coming months which will rein in U.S. tech giants' market power.
Vestager's spokeswoman said the letter from the four ministers would be taken into account in the debate.
""Europe's future industrial, ecological and digital strategy must be based on fair competition,"" spokeswoman Arianna Podesta said.
""Sound EU competition rules can enable pro-competitive cooperation, including data sharing and data pooling, support the growth and development of strong European companies, whether larger ones or SMEs, and further enable and support the greening of our economy.""
EU antitrust enforcers should take into account state aid provided to foreign companies, use interim measures to tackle online platforms' dominance, reinforce advisory committees made up of national competition watchdogs and set up an independent scientific expert body to assist them, they said."
568,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 06, 2020 10:59AM ET</span>",Wall Street Warnings Grow Louder for Investors Defying Virus,"(Bloomberg) -- Right on cue, investors and strategists are lining up to heap doubt on a frenetic rally sweeping up assets from Singapore to New York.
As a gauge of global stocks moves toward a record, alarm bells are ringing over the speed and scale of a rally built on hopes that the economic damage from the coronavirus will be contained.
A steady stream of earnings beats and signs of an uptick in growth are on the side of markets seizing on any bit of good news. Yet behind every upbeat corporate result there’s another with a sober warning that the deadly outbreak will roil economic output and business activity.
Belying the surge in equities and credit appetite, copper and yield curves flash growth risks.
“Pretty much every client we talk to wants to buy the dip,” wrote Tobias Levkovich,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).‘s chief U.S. equity strategist in a note. “And that is not comforting.”
The S&P 500 edged higher Thursday, extending the week’s gains to more than 3.5%, as the Stoxx Europe 600 Index climbed to a record and stocks soared in Asia. A gauge of European credit risk hit its lowest since 2007.
Yet the battle against the virus could suffer a setback as factories reopen in China in the coming days and more people come into contact with each other. On the other hand, if factories fail to reopen, the economic impact could prove much more severe.
At Robeco, money manager Jeroen Blokland is eyeing the rally warily. The head of multi-asset funds at the Rotterdam-based firm recently cut an overweight allocation to stocks to neutral because of the spread of coronavirus. He says it’s not yet time to dive back in.
“Every investor is looking for the bottom and wants to find it a little bit earlier than his neighbor,” he said. “We need a little bit more confirmation that the outbreak will be contained before moving again.”
Earnings Risk
Dassault Systemes SE showed the threat was imminent Thursday, forecasting earnings below estimates and trouble ahead for industries including automakers. Days earlier  BP  (LON:BP) Plc said the coronavirus outbreak could wipe out a third of global oil-demand growth this year.  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE). and Adidas AG (DE:ADSGN) said they’re closing stores in China.
Even though it’s guesswork, investment banks are coming up with damage assessments. The shock could cut Chinese economic growth to 4% on an annualized basis,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). suggested Thursday. The firm’s head of commodity research Jeff Currie said in an interview with Bloomberg TV that oil demand could fall by 2-3 million barrels per day before rebounding in two to three months.
Meanwhile strategists at Citigroup cautioned against a sense of euphoria and “substantive” complacency in financial markets. JPMorgan is telling clients to rein in risk, trimming its overweight call on equities to 5% relative to a benchmark allocation, from 7%.
“Economic spillovers from China to the rest of the world in the event of more adverse scenarios are likely to be significant,” according to JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. strategists.
What makes all this is so striking: Investors are shrugging off virus-related concerns while also betting on an uptick in growth, according to Nomura Securities. The telltale sign is the ramp-up in European stocks to all-time highs.
“As the coronavirus issue passes the panic stage, scenarios for renewed economic growth seem to be gaining new life,” wrote Naka Matsuzawa, the firm’s strategist in Tokyo wrote in a note.
Matsuzawa is watching whether crude oil and industrial metal prices recover to pre-virus levels. That would indicate a belief that Chinese stimulus will forestall the fallout while suggesting central banks may pare back their pre-cautioning easing plans.
But there are plenty of early warning signs.
Earnings for giant Capesize ships that deliver cargoes like coal and iron ore to China -- building-block commodities for the nation’s economy -- have plunged 92% since September, according to the Baltic Exchange in London. They stood at just over $3,000 a day on Thursday, far below even what it costs to pay crew.
Meanwhile, despite a slight recovery this week, the price of copper is near its lowest compared to gold in three years. The ratio between the two is often seen as a bellwether for the health of the global economy because one is a core industrial commodity used in everything from electronics to plumbing. The precious metal also tends to be a haven during times of economic distress.
Perhaps the so-called smart money knows something stock investors don’t.
As equities have moved toward their all-time highs, in the bond market the yield on 10-year Treasuries remains below this year’s starting level and below one- and five-year averages. The spread between the two- and 10-year yield is ultra flat, suggesting money managers are wary on growth and inflation.
“Investors are thirsty for good news, but some remain cautious,” said Philippos Kassimatis at Maven Global, a hedging advisory firm. “The divergence between stock and bond markets in recent days clearly shows that.”

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials indexes eased from their record highs on Thursday, as investors took a breather after a stellar run this week on waning worries about the economic damage from the coronavirus epidemic.
Both indexes scaled new levels at the open as China said it would halve extra tariffs on some U.S. goods following hefty stimulus to support an economy hit by shutdowns and travel restrictions due to the virus outbreak.

Seven of the 11 major indexes were lower, led by a 0.8% fall for energy stocks (SPNY).
Breakfast cereal maker Kellogg Co (N:K) tumbled 6.1% after it forecast full-year earnings well below market expectations.
Becton, Dickinson and Co (N:BDX) dropped 11.2% after the medical technology company lowered its full-year revenue and profit forecasts. The stock was the biggest drag on the S&P 500.
Philip Morris International Inc (N:PM) gained 4.4% after the Marlboro cigarettes maker topped quarterly profit estimates.
 Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) gained about 15.5% after the micro-blogging platform touched $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time ever, beating analysts' estimates.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.20-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.16-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.
The S&P index recorded 55 new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 81 new highs and 20 new lows.

As the week draws to a close, investor attention will shift to the crucial U.S. jobs report on Friday.

LONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (N:GS) plans to expand its retail brand Marcus in Britain this year with more than 65 new staff, a mobile app and more savings products, as part of the group's global shift towards consumer banking.
Since its British launch in 2018 Marcus has gobbled up some 13 billion pounds ($16.8 billion) in savings from competitors, by initially offering a market-leading interest rate of 1.5%.
The new hires will be across Marcus's London office and at its call center in Milton Keynes, north of London, taking the unit's total headcount to over 300 by the end of this year, from 235 now, Marcus UK's head Des McDaid told Reuters.
McDaid said he would consider expanding beyond savings products into current accounts, lending and investment products in Britain – leading to staff numbers increasing ""exponentially"".
""You need a proposition that makes sense and can reach scale, we hope to start looking into that in the second half of the year,"" he said.
McDaid said Germany would be the next logical market for Marcus to enter, but that there are no immediate plans to make that move.
Goldman Sachs will launch joint accounts this week, easy access Individual Savings Accounts in the second quarter and its Marcus app by the end of the year, McDaid said.
The U.S. lender has already launched the app in its home market.
Goldman's push in Britain comes as part of one of the biggest strategic shifts in the U.S. bank's 151-year history, announced on Jan. 29, as it cuts back in its traditional strengths of trading in favor of consumer banking.
The British unit accounted for over a third of Marcus's growth last year, as it grew deposits to $60 billion.
McDaid said the bank is looking to fill all of the 250-staff capacity at its Milton Keynes customer support center and could then look to open a second such unit in Britain in the longer term.
The lender is also looking to establish a technology center in either the midlands city of Birmingham or further north in Manchester, he said.
Goldman has announced plans to launch Marcus current accounts by 2021 in the United States, but McDaid said the lender is focused for now on its savings products in Britain.
The current account, or checking, market in British banking is notoriously hard to make profitable on a standalone basis, with customers reluctant to pay for basic accounts and entrenched incumbents like Lloyds (L:LLOY) and Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS) dominating the market.
When it launched last year Marcus initially offered a 1.5% interest rate.
It has since cut it to 1.35%, tempering its growth as it passed the halfway point to the regulatory limit on deposits of 25 billion pounds. Above that level, Goldman would have to ringfence Marcus deposits from its riskier trading arm."

Investing.com -- Wall Street faltered near record highs at the opening on Thursday, cautious of over-extending a vigorous rally ahead of the U.S. labor market report.
By 10:25 AM ET (1525 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average had given up early gains to be down 43 points, or 0.2%, on the day. The S&P 500 was up 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.2%, but both were off early highs.
The market is already primed for a bullish number on nonfarm payrolls after ADP’s monthly report on private-sector hiring came in well above expectations on Wednesday. Initial jobless claims fell to their lowest since April months last week at only 202,000, further evidence of labor market tightness.
The Dow is already up 1.6% for the week so far, and up 2.6% over a month that has seen the emergence of a major threat to global growth this year. Dallas Federal Reserve head Robert Kaplan said in a speech earlier he expected U.S. growth of around 2.25% this year, a figure that he said would be higher if not for the coronavirus outbreak and Boeing's (NYSE:BA) problems with its 737 Max.
Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) grabbed the spotlight, rising 15% after cracking through $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time, even though earnings fell in the three months to December and the company predicted continued rises in operating costs this year.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock retreated to the sidelines after a wild ride in the first three sessions of the week. It was down 1.5%, with buyers appearing to step in again at around the $720 level.
Becton Dickinson (NYSE:BDX) stock slumped 11.8% after the medical device company said the ongoing dispute over the software controlling its infusion system Alaris would weigh on this year’s earnings.
Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock fell 3.4% after warning that the coronavirus could hit the smartphone market, a key source of sales, this year. There was further bad news as it acknowledged a fresh EU antitrust investigation into possible abuse of its dominant position in the market for 5G modem chips.
  Exxon Mobil   (NYSE:XOM) and other oil stocks slumped again after OPEC and its allies failed to agree in principle on further cuts in crude output to address the demand shock from China, something that triggered fresh selling of U.S. crude futures.
Exxon was down 1.1%, but was still above the nine-year low that it hit on Tuesday. Cheniere Energy (NYSE:LNG) fell 2.2% after reports that China’s CNOOC had declared force majeure to avoid taking delivery of LNG cargoes, a move that threatens to depress gas prices across Asia and further afield.

572,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 06, 2020 10:23AM ET</span>",Mortgage Rates in the U.S. Slide to the Lowest Since July 2016,"(Bloomberg) -- Mortgage rates in the U.S. declined, giving homebuyers a crack at the lowest borrowing costs in more than three years.
The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage was 3.45%, down from 3.51% last week and the lowest since July 2016, Freddie Mac data showed Thursday. The 15-year average slipped to 2.97% from 3%.
Fears of a coronavirus pandemic have fueled a global rush for safe assets, sending the Treasury yields that guide mortgage rates sliding. That provides a window for homeowners looking to refinance into cheaper loans, and helps make purchases more affordable.
“The combination of very low mortgage rates, a strong economy and more positive financial market sentiment all point to home purchase demand continuing to rise over the next few months,” Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist, said in a statement."
573,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2020 10:15AM ET</span>","Fiat Chrysler profit rises, outlook 'firm' ahead of Peugeot merger","By Giulio Piovaccari and Paul Lienert
MILAN/DETROIT (Reuters) -  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) posted a 7% rise in fourth-quarter profit on Thursday, boosted by strong business in North America and better results in Latin America as it headed into a merger with France's PSA (PA:PEUP). 
In a briefing with analysts, Chief Executive Officer Michael Manley said FCA was still ""firm"" on its financial guidance for 2020. Still, he warned that disruptions due to the deadly coronavirus outbreak in China could threaten production at one of Fiat Chrysler's European plants within two to four weeks. He did not identify which plant could be affected.
FCA so far has not reported production shutdowns at plants outside China related to the outbreak. Chinese auto parts and assembly plants have extended previously planned Lunar New Year's shutdowns through Feb. 9, and some have pushed the shutdowns out further.
FCA operates in China through a loss-making joint venture with Guangzhou Automobile Group (GAC) (SS:601238) and has a 0.35% share of the Chinese passenger car market.
Manley said FCA plans to meet tighter emissions regulations in Europe initially with new hybrid gasoline-electric versions of several Jeep models, with plans to shift eventually to more pure electric models beyond 2025.
He said the automaker expected to meet future emissions standards without buying credits from electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) after 2021 in Europe and after 2023 in the United States as it introduces more hybrid models that produce lower emissions.
""Beyond 2025, full electric (vehicles) will become the norm"" across the industry, Manley said, ultimately replacing hybrids which are facing future bans in several countries. 
Asked about FCA's short-term reliance on hybrids rather than pure electric vehicles to meet lower CO2 levels, he said, ""We are going to be part of that solution"" with future electric vehicles, but ""in the most cost-effective way we possibly can.""
The Italian-American carmaker said adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) rose to 2.12 billion euros ($2.3 billion), in line with a 2.11 billion forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts.
That left its adjusted operating profit for the year at 6.67 billion euros, just shy of its target of over 6.7 billion euros. Its adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 6.2%, in line with its target of more than 6.1%.
A trader said Fiat Chrysler (FCA) results were ""a touch above"" expectations, and the carmaker's shares in New York were up 1.3% in early trading, while shares in Milan were up 1.9%.
Fiat Chrysler (FCA) and  Peugeot  maker PSA agreed in December to combine forces in a $50 billion deal to create the world's No. 4 carmaker, in response to slower global demand and the mounting cost of making cleaner cars amid tighter emissions rules.
Manley said last month that talks with PSA were progressing and he hoped to complete the deal by early 2021.
FCA reiterated its plan to boost adjusted EBIT to more than 7 billion euros this year.

575,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2020 09:17AM ET</span>",Swiss investor adviser calls for Credit Suisse chairman to go,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi and John O'Donnell
ZURICH (Reuters) - Prominent Swiss investment adviser Ethos Foundation has called on  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) Chairman Urs Rohner to step down to take responsibility for the Swiss bank's spying on executives.
The intervention comes as investors take sides over whether Rohner, Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam, or both should be held mainly to blame for a scandal that has rocked Switzerland's second-largest bank.
The crisis erupted in September when Credit Suisse's former star wealth manager Iqbal Khan, who had jumped ship to join rival UBS (S:UBSG), confronted a private detective following him and his wife through downtown Zurich.
The bank said the case was an isolated incident run as a rogue operation by then-Chief Operating Officer Pierre-Olivier Bouee without the knowledge of Thiam or the board of directors. 
But Swiss financial watchdog FINMA is conducting its own investigation after the bank subsequently acknowledged it had tailed former human resources head Peter Goerke as well in what it called another solo mission by Bouee. 
Bouee admitted to organizing the first case of spying, but has not publicly commented on the second, after which he was fired. 
Ethos head Vincent Kaufmann, who has been a critic of Rohner for years, told Reuters that Rohner should not stay on a further year, as planned.
""These cases within the management team make our doubts even stronger as to how the board is supervising the bank's management and how the CEO is supervising his colleagues,"" Kaufmann said. 
Thiam should go too if it emerges he was aware of the spying incidents, Kaufmann added.
A spokesman for Credit Suisse declined to comment on behalf of the bank, Rohner and Thiam. The bank's board is meeting this week to try to get to grips with the crisis. 
The scandal should affect executive bonuses, Kaufmann said, adding the bank should appoint an external candidate with a track record in banking as its new chairman.
Ethos, which promotes socially responsible investment, encompasses more than 200 Swiss pension funds and public utility foundations. Its recommendations are widely followed in the Swiss investment community.
Amid an outcry over the scandal in Switzerland, several major shareholders have come out in defense of Thiam, a former Ivory Coast government minister, McKinsey management consultant and insurance executive.
Hired by Rohner in 2015 to turn around the bank, Thiam has sharpened its focus on wealth management, scaled back investment banking, and shored up its balance sheet by raising capital. 
""Now that the bank is well positioned, we don't believe the person who managed the turnaround should leave. It should be obvious if one of the two has to go, it shouldn't be the CEO,"" David Herro, deputy chairman of Harris Associates, said by email. Harris says it has a stake of about 8% in Credit Suisse.
In a letter to Rohner this week, seen by Reuters, U.S. hedge fund Eminence Capital said it was ""increasingly disappointed with the actions taken by the board of directors, which has displayed an utter lack of support for its CEO"".
Eminence Capital says it has a nearly 1% direct stake in Credit Suisse plus options on more shares. 
On his Instagram account, Thiam posted a picture https://www.instagram.com/p/B8KVhqnHjQW of himself surrounded by beaming senior management. 

Sovereign wealth fund Qatar Holding, with a stake of more than 5%, and the Saudi Olayan Group, with around 5%, have not commented on the scandal or who should bear responsibility.

Investing.com -- Stocks in focus on Thursday, 6th February. Please refresh for updates.
9:01 AM ET: Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM) stock was down 4.5% after missing consensus forecasts for same-store sales in the three months through December.
The continued weak performance of Pizza Hut in the U.S., up against increasing competition from the likes of Domino’s Pizza, offset better results from KFC and Taco Bell.

Petrobras ADRs (NYSE:PBR) were up 1.2% after Brazilian bank BNDES completed a monster $5 billion stock placement on Wednesday.

8:58 AM ET: Becton Dickinson (NYSE:BDX) stock was down 9.1% at its lowest level since early December, after the maker of medical devices lowered its outlook for the year amidst ongoing efforts to solve software problems with its Alaris infusion system.
The company now expects full fiscal year 2020 revenue to increase 1.5%-2.5%, which equates to 2.5%-3.5% when adjusted for currency headwinds. Earnings per share are seen in a range around $12.00.
8:51 AM ET: Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock was flat, paring early losses after a disappointing quarterly update after the closing bell on Wednesday. The company’s stock had fallen 4% in after-hours trading after CFO Akash Palkhiwala said he expected the smartphone market – which generates the bulk of Qualcomm’s profits – to be disrupted by the coronavirus outbreak this year.
The company also said it’s in a fresh battle with EU antitrust regulators over suspicions of abusing its dominant position in the market for 5G modem chips, which will be required in the next generation of smartphones.

8:43 AM ET: Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) stock rose 8.5% to its highest level since October after cracking through the $1 billion level in quarterly revenue for the first time. Earnings were down by over half on last year, however, due largely to higher costs. That development is likely to continue this year, the company said. Its forecast for first-quarter revenue were also below expectations.


Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock was down 3.6% as the spike of earlier in the week continued to unwind. The battle between short-sellers on the one hand and true believers on the other is, however, far from over, with short interest in the stock still accounting for nearly 20% of the company.


Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) still has some way to go to catch up   Toyota  , the world’s most valuable auto stock. Toyota ADRs (NYSE:TM) will be in focus later after its domestic stock rose 2.6% in response to an operating profit of just under $6 billion in its fiscal third quarter. Company officials said it still isn’t clear when its factories in China will reopen, but that didn’t stop it raising its profit guidance slightly for the year ending in March.

Shares in Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) were down 7.7% premarket despite late Wednesday reporting fiscal second-quarter earnings ahead of expectations. The company was floated in September last year, and its shares have climbed above its IPO price of $29 after an initial rocky start. That said, the stock is one of the most heavily shorted in the market."

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese auto dealers, who have seen traffic through their showrooms slow to a trickle due to the fast-spreading coronavirus, have sought temporary financial support to see them through.
The coronavirus has killed more than 560 people in mainland China and more than 28,000 are confirmed to be infected, prompting local governments to extend holidays and introduce travel curbs to halt its spread.
In a letter publicly addressed to China's Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, China's Automobile Dealers Association (CADA) asked banks to extend loans to dealers and offer more temporary liquidity support such as credit lines to help dealers who are ""facing extreme liquidity pressure"".
The letter, which is dated Feb. 5 and posted on CADA's social media on Thursday, said auto sales and after-sales service ""show a cliff-like decline"" due to the extension of the Lunar New Year holiday, travel curbs and other factors.
Industry executives said the epidemic was likely to wreak havoc on auto sales and production in the first quarter, but that it was too early to push the panic button. Last year, auto sales in China, the world's biggest auto market, dropped 8.2% year-on-year to 25.8 million vehicles.
In a separate poll conducted by CADA, dealers predicted China's car sales to fall 50-80% this month compared to February 2019. Some 70% of dealers polled by CADA said they had seen ""almost no customers"" since the end of January.
CADA, which represents thousands of dealers nationwide including China Grand Automotive Services Co (SS:600297),  China Yongda Automobiles Services  Holdings (HK:3669) and Zhongsheng Group Holdings (HK:0881), also said short-term liquidity pressure was high.
In China, cities have been shut off, flights cancelled and factories closed, shutting supply lines crucial to the world economy. Auto companies including  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380), Tesla (O:TSLA), Ford (N:F), PSA  Peugeot  Citroen (PA:PEUP), Nissan (T:7201) are taking hits.
As business in China's auto showrooms drops significantly, automakers and dealers such as Tesla,  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) as well as China Grand Automotive and Yongda are promoting products heavily online.
The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment out of usual business hours."

(Reuters) - Yum Brands Inc (N:YUM) reported quarterly same-store sales and profit that missed market expectations on Thursday, as sales at its Pizza Hut chain in the United States were hurt by stiff competition.
Pizza Hut is struggling to keep its market share in a crowded dining market, amid rivalry from Domino's Pizza (N:DPZ), local eateries as well as food-delivery apps that offer a wide selection of restaurants to choose from.
The pizza chain, which has missed Wall Street expectations for sales growth in six out of the past eight quarters, has been a weak spot for Yum, even as its other chains, KFC and Taco Bell, continue to perform well.
""For so many years, people associated takeout and delivery solely with pizza. And now.. these online delivery companies have expanded the universe of what people take into consideration when they order out,"" said Doug Ciocca, chief executive officer of Kavar Capital Partners.
""It used to be family on a Friday night, watching a movie and ordering pizza...now they stream a video and can order from a online menu,"" he said. The firm holds Yum shares.
Yum's shares were down more than 4.5% in premarket trading.
To fight competition, Pizza Hut has introduced new concepts such as heated lockers that allow diners to pick up online orders from restaurants and is testing plant-based meat toppings.
Comparable sales at the chain fell 2% in the fourth quarter, worse than analysts' expectations for a 0.71% drop, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Sales were down 4% in the United States, Yum said.
Overall, sales at Yum's restaurants open at least a year climbed 2%, below the Wall Street estimate of 2.26%.
Sales grew 4% at established Taco Bell restaurants and 3% at KFC, both beating estimates.
Net income rose to $488 million, or $1.58 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $334 million, or $1.04 per share, a year earlier.
Excluding one-time items, Yum earned $1 per share, missing analysts' estimate by 13 cents.
Total revenue rose 8.7% to $1.69 billion, above the estimate of $1.66 billion."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A tribunal in New Delhi has put on hold a sales ban imposed last year on  Anheuser-Busch InBev  (BR:ABI), an order seen by Reuters showed, allowing the world's largest brewer to resume sales of its beer products in the city for now.
Authorities in New Delhi barred AB InBev in July from selling its beer products for three years over allegations related to the evasion of state taxes, which the company had denied. The ban was later reduced to 18 months.
The company's appeal against the ban was rejected in December by a judge of the Delhi High Court, who directed AB InBev to approach the city tribunal for further relief.
The tribunal issued a one-page order on Feb. 4 saying the ban was being ""stayed"" as it continues to hear the company's appeal. The order, a copy of which was seen by Reuters on Thursday, did not elaborate on the reasons.
AB InBev continues to argue against the ban saying it must be quashed as the company was not given adequate notice beforehand, according to a source familiar with the matter.
The next tribunal appeal hearing is on Feb. 25, the order said.
An official from the Delhi government said it would continue to defend its ban order.
New Delhi authorities had found that SABMiller (LON:SAB), bought by AB InBev in 2016, used duplicate barcodes on beer bottles supplied to city retailers, allowing it to pay lower levies.
The Delhi tribunal's stay order will come as a major relief for AB InBev, which was already battling a separate Indian antitrust probe concerning alleged beer price fixing by SABMiller and other companies.
A spokesman for AB InBev India told Reuters the company was encouraged by the stay order, but added it would not comment further during the ongoing appeal process.
""We are committed to operating with integrity and ethics and remain excited about our business in India,"" he added.
AB InBev, whose beers include Budweiser and Hoegaarden, is the second biggest player in India's $7 billion market, with a 17.5% share, IWSR Drinks Market Analysis estimates."

LONDON (Reuters) -  Prudential  (L:PRU) is in talks that could lead to it taking full control of its 50:50 joint venture with China's CITIC (HK:0267) and is considering selling some or all of its U.S. business to sharpen its focus on Asia, a source told Reuters.
Changes in January to foreign ownership laws in China have made it possible for the first time for the British life insurer to own all of its CITIC joint venture, a landmark transaction which the source said Prudential was working towards.
Prudential has not made a formal application to increase its ownership yet but is checking the plan would win approval from the Chinese authorities before it submits an application, the source said.
Insiders at the $48 billion company say the deal could offer a boost to China as it battles to minimize the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak that has disrupted travel to the country and put several cities on lockdown.
It would be hard to put a timescale on the approval process for a possible transaction, the source said, adding that the Chinese authorities were capable of acting fast to grant the necessary permissions if CITIC was willing to sell.
""They want foreign investment post-virus,"" the source said.
Analysts at KBW said they expected Prudential to spend ""a few billion"" dollars increasing their stake in the venture. The company no longer has any British or European business after splitting off its M&G (L:MNG) insurance and asset management unit last year.
The growth of the middle class in Asian economies and the lack of state retirement benefits have driven demand for private life and health insurance.
Many western insurers have joint ventures in China but the Prudential-CITIC venture is among the largest, with around 20 provincial licenses.
Chinese officials have become more welcoming of British and European companies amid Beijing's trade tussle with the United States, the source added.
Insurance sales for Prudential's Chinese business rose 45% in the first half of 2019, and the recent coronavirus outbreak is not seen having much direct impact, analysts said.
Its shares have fallen by 1.5% so far this year but the insurer has low exposure to Wuhan, where the virus originated.
Prudential, which sells insurance in China through 55,000 agents, is opening a technical center in Shenzhen, in mainland China, where hiring is cheaper than Hong Kong because the cost of living is lower.
JACKSON FOR SALE
In addition to the China plans, Prudential is looking at ways to reduce its ownership of its U.S. business Jackson.
Analysts say there is little logic in Prudential holding onto the business, which has few synergies with its Asian arm.
All options are on the table as Jackson seeks ""outside capital"", the source said, adding that the business was attracting interest from private equity firms, sovereign wealth funds and Canadian pension funds.
Jackson had an operating profit of 1.9 billion pounds in 2018 compared with 2.2 billion for Prudential's Asian business. New business sales for the United States totaled only 1.5 billion pounds compared with 3.7 billion in Asia.
A dilution of ownership in Jackson would leave the 170-year-old insurer, Britain's biggest, with the vast bulk of its operations in Asia, along with a smaller African business."

The electric vehicle maker’s market cap stands at $132.4 billion.
Tesla's rally of over 300% since early June has been a vindication for Chief Executive Elon Musk, who has transformed a niche car maker with production problems into the global leader in electric vehicles, with U.S. and Chinese factories.
Still, many investors remain skeptical that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) can consistently deliver profit, cash flow and growth in the face of competition from established rivals.

The S&P 500 cash index closed in record territory Wednesday, as did the Nasdaq Composite, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended comfortably above the 29,000 level, within striking distance of the record closing high of 29,340.10, hit on Jan. 17.
Overnight, China announced plans to cut in half tariffs on $75 billion worth of US imports in a bid to improve Sino-U.S. trading relations. This will come into effect on Feb. 14, when the U.S. will do something similar on $120 billion worth of Chinese imports. 
This move is seen improving negotiating conditions between the two countries for a 'phase 2' deal to follow the interim deal announced last month - although that is widely seen as too complex to complete this year.
More healthy economic data emerged late Wednesday, helping the tone Thursday, as private jobs increased more than expected last month and services activity, which makes up more than two-thirds of economic growth, topped economists' forecasts.
With the U.S. economy seemingly on solid footing, the Federal Reserve remaining accommodative in nature, political uncertainty diminishing with the acquittal of President Donald Trump at his impeachment trial, and the Chinese authorities doing all they can to contain the coronavirus, stock markets are pointing ever higher.
In the corporate spotlight, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) reported a miss in its earnings per share numbers, but its revenue came in above $1 billion, more than expected. Investors will also be looking for any progress fixing the bug that affected targeting ads that plagued its last earnings report. Shares rose over 2% premarket.
Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that topped expectations, while the day’s earnings roster also includes Philip Morris (NYSE:PM). Uber (NYSE:UBER) will report its latest numbers after the close, with analysts looking for the ride-hailing company to report a loss of 67 cents per share and revenue of about $4 billion.
Shares in Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) traded lower premarket after the chip maker said revenue rose 5% in its first fiscal quarter, better than expected, but issued a cautious outlook citing the impact from the coronavirus outbreak.
Also of note is Casper Sleep, which will start trading on the New York Stock Exchange after pricing its IPO at a valuation down sharply from its last private funding round.
The online bedding retail company priced its IPO at $12 per share, raising $100.8 million. That was the low end of the $12 to $13 expected range, a range that had already been lowered from $17 to $19 per share. 
The day’s main economic release is the weekly initial jobless claims figure. This comes after Wednesday’s strong ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) nonfarm employment number and ahead of Friday’s key official employment report. 
Elsewhere, an OPEC+ committee recommended a production cut of 600,000 barrels a day to offset the demand impact from the coronavirus outbreak, but there was no agreement on if ministers from OPEC and its allies should meet this month to ratify the Joint Technical Committee’s suggestion as Russia asked for more time to assess the impact of the outbreak.
That comes among growing signs of demand destruction in the Chinese energy complex. CNOOC, the country's biggest gas buyer, has declared force majeure to get out of taking delivery of contracted volumes of LNG, Reuters and Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed sources. Natural gas futures fell 1.1%.
AT 07:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 1.2% higher at $51.36 and the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.5% to $55.57."

592,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2020 06:07AM ET</span>",Nokia's surprise profit rise fails to salvage 2019 dividend,"By Tarmo Virki
HELSINKI (Reuters) - Cost cuts provided an unexpected boost to Nokia's (HE:NOKIA) fourth-quarter underlying profit on Thursday, driving its share price to a four-month high, although the Finnish telecom company said it was not ready to propose a dividend.
Nokia lowered its outlook in October and halted dividend payouts, blaming a need to step up investments in 5G and knocking more than a fifth from its value. 
On Thursday, Nokia said its underlying earnings for the quarter ending in December rose to 0.15 euros per share from 0.13 euros per share a year ago, above the 0.13 euros consensus in a Refinitiv poll.
The results sent its shares up 7% in early trade, to the highest level since the October warning, and they were up 3.4% at 1009 GMT.
""There are small steps towards a better future,"" Inderes analyst Mikael Rautanen said in a research note. 
Nokia Chief Executive Rajeev Suri told journalists the fourth quarter had marked ""a strong end to a challenging year"".
The company predicted the final quarter of 2020 would also see a concentration of operating profit and free cash flow, but said there were also still problems ahead.
The board would not propose a dividend for 2019 as it only expected to reach the 2 billion euro cash position it sees sufficient for profit distribution during the fourth quarter.
Analysts were expecting a dividend of 0.11 euros, according to a Refinitiv poll. 
Nokia also repeated its forecast for 2020 underlying earnings per share of between 0.20 and 0.30 euros, compared to 0.22 euros in 2019.
Its warning in October was partly caused by investments in its 5G system-on-chip (SoC) development, which allows a single chip to carry an entire computer system and enables Nokia to produce its network technology more cheaply. 
Suri said that by the end of 2019 10% of Nokia's 5G offering was using system-on-chip, and that rate would increase to over 35% during 2020 and to 70% in 2021.
Nokia, which competes with Ericsson (ST:ERICb) and Huawei for 5G network deals, said it expects intense competition to continue in 2020, as rivals seek to grab market share.
Suri told Reuters the company aimed to focus on its most profitable operations in China and make only prudent offers for large 5G radio network deals that are expected to become available. 
Sales in the Greater China region dropped by 25% in the fourth quarter to 469 million euros. 
Group sales were flat at 6.9 billion euros as declines in China and North America were balanced by growth in Asia-Pacific, a region where Nokia flagged new challenges. 

In India, it said customer demand could weaken after the country's Supreme Court upheld a ruling that telecoms companies must pay retroactive license and spectrum fees.

595,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2020 05:55AM ET</span>","Desperate for coronavirus solutions, Chinese turn to HIV drugs, gray market and traditional cures","By Roxanne Liu and Gabriel CROSSLEY
BEIJING (Reuters) - The rapidly spreading virus in China and a shortage of medical resources are prompting people to resort to unorthodox ways to obtain treatment, with some appealing to HIV patients and unauthorized importers for medicine.
Chinese health authorities have said there is not yet any effective cure for the virus, which has killed more than 500 people in China. Although there is no evidence from clinical trials, China's National Health Commision said the HIV drug lopinavir/ritonavir can be used for coronavirus patients, without specifying how they might help. 
That triggered a rush, specifically for Kaletra, also known as Aluvia, which is drugmaker AbbVie's off-patent version of lopinavir/ritonavir and the only version approved for sale in China. 
It is usually used to treat and prevent HIV and AIDS, and AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) said last month that China was testing it as a treatment for coronavirus symptoms.
Devy, a 38-year-old freelancer in Shandong province who did not want to give his family name for fear of retaliation, said he was among hundreds who contacted people with HIV to ask for medicine. 
Although he had not recently traveled to Hubei province or Wuhan, the epicenter of outbreak, he grew worried that he had somehow caught the coronavirus after a doctor's visit found symptoms of pneumonia. He also had other symptoms associated with coronavirus, such as fever and nausea.
Desperate and worried, he heard from a friend that a HIV-positive man nicknamed ""Brother Squirrel"" was offering Kaletra for free to people suspected to have the new coronavirus. He received about 30 pills. 
""When you were left alone, seeing the blur shadow of death far away, I think no one can feel calm,"" Devy told Reuters by telephone. 
Even after he was finally tested negative for the virus, Devy still believed obtaining Kaletra was the right choice. ""You can only try various things to save yourself, right?""
DRUG HOARDER
Brother Squirrel, whose real name is Andy Li, told Reuters he was a 30 years old and coined his nickname because he hoards drugs for his condition the way ""squirrels like to hoard nuts"".
After hearing the Chinese health authorities' comments on Kaletra, he and a few other HIV patients pooled about 5,400 Kaletra tablets in less than a week. They then posted their offer on China's Twitter-like platform Weibo. 
""We felt like we were organized for a military mission,” Li said, recalling that hundreds of messages soon flooded in, leaving him barely any time to sleep or eat in the first three days until all of the pills were mailed. 
""There are so many people in need of the drug, and I don’t want to waste time,"" Li told Reuters. ""Time is life.""
Chinese health authorities cautioned that lopinavir/ritonavir, a prescription drug, has potential side effects such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and liver damage.
BIG PROFITS 
The rush has also opened up moneymaking opportunities. 
More than 28,000 people have been confirmed to be infected in China, most in Wuhan and Hubei. But a shortage of test kits has led to suspicions that many more are undiagnosed. 
Gatsby Fang, a Chinese cross-border buying agent, told Reuters that he ordered generic versions of Kaletra from India on Jan. 23, shortly after he firstly heard that the drug might be useful against the new coronavirus.
Fang, whose primary job is in the financial industry, said he sold each bottle for 600 yuan ($86) each, bringing in 200 yuan to 300 yuan in profit on each. His stock was sold out by Jan. 25. Some clients ordered 600 tablets at once, he said. 
His buyers included infected patients, front-line doctors in Hubei, and those who did not need the drug but thought it might offer protection. Other drug sellers also approached him, pretending to be patients, Fang said.
Gray market prices for the drugs in India, where he sourced them, started to rise on Jan. 25, Fang told Reuters.
""For the 60-pill-per-bottle product, its price went up to about 300 yuan, 400 yuan from about 100 yuan in the beginning,"" he said.
""Basically the patients reaching out to me were those who have no place for treatment, no place where they can confirm 100% if they have or not have the virus,"" Fang said. ""That's the core of the problem.""
The World Health Organization has warned that there are ""no known effective"" treatments for the coronavirus, knocking down unconfirmed reports of a research breakthrough in China.
Some traditional Chinese medicine treatments have also seen a boost in demand.
There is no evidence that such treatments help in fighting the coronavirus, Gauden Galea, the WHO's representative in China, told Reuters on Saturday.

598,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2020 05:29AM ET</span>","Payments in high-value deals not a bribe, Mahathir says about AirAsia probe","KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Thursday payments received to offset the costs of a high-value order could not be constituted as a bribe.
Mahathir was replying to questions by reporters on the controversial sponsorship deal that executives of Malaysia's AirAsia Group Bhd (KL:AIRA) struck with the budget carrier's sole plane supplier Airbus (PA:AIR).
Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) said last week that the European aircraft manufacturer paid a bribe of $50 million to executives of AirAsia and its long-haul arm AirAsia X (KL:AIRX) to win plane orders. 
AirAsia is the world's biggest customer of the A321neo single-aisle aircraft and runs an all-Airbus fleet of 274 planes.
AirAsia co-founders Tony Fernandes and Kamarudin Meranun have both denied wrongdoing and relinquished their executive roles for at least two months while the SFO's allegations are probed.
Asked about Britain's investigation into the case, Mahathir said he would not pronounce a verdict, but that any arrangement should be considered as a quid pro quo deal.
""Often when governments buy equipment, we always ask for an offset...If we can get something because we buy something at a high price, why can't we accept it?"" he told reporters. 
""If the money we get is pocketed, that is corruption. But if that money is for a certain purpose, it would be an offset instead of a bribe. That's my view,"" Mahathir said.
SFO said that Caterham F1, a now-defunct Formula 1 racing team that was formerly co-owned by Fernandes, was sponsored improperly in 2012 by Airbus' then-parent EADS.
Fernandes denied the allegations and said that the team was part of AirAsia's branding campaign. 
Malaysian authorities have also said they are launching their own investigations into SFO's claims.
The allegations come as the Malaysian government evaluates five strategic investment proposals, among them one from AirAsia, to partner with the ailing national carrier, Malaysia Airlines.
Prime-minister-in-waiting Anwar Ibrahim said AirAsia would have to resolve the corruption case if the airline wanted to continue contending for a partnership.

""You can't expect us to consider an entity, when allegations are still there. They have to clear that first to be fair, otherwise we'll be seen to be complicit,"" he told Reuters in an interview on Thursday.

599,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 06, 2020 05:16AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Europe's Bank Stocks Roar on Promises of Higher Payouts,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- European banking stocks are back in fashion.
The sector marched higher on Thursday, led by solid results and promises of greater shareholder returns from the likes of Italy’s Unicredit (MI:CRDI) and France’s   Societe Generale   (PA:SOGN). Better-than-expected earnings at Scandinavian giant Nordea Bank Abp (HE:NDAFI) and eastern European specialist Raiffeisen Bank International (VIE:RBIV) also added evidence to suggest that, after a wretched 2019, things can only get better.
By 5:15 AM ET (1015 GMT), the Stoxx 600 Banks index was up 1.8%, significantly outperforming the broader Stoxx 600 which opened with a new all-time high on the back of news of China’s cut in tariffs on imports from the U.S. The U.K. FTSE 100 was up 0.2% and the German DAX was up 0.6%, meanwhile.
Unicredit (MI:CRDI) was up 5.7%, while Nordea rose 5.2% and Raiffeisen was up 3.9%. The only clear underperformer was Dutch-based ING (AS:INGA), whose fourth-quarter results were hit by a sharp rise in bad loan provisions, including an embarrassing loss related to trade finance fraud in Asia. Italy's banks have been enjoying a particularly good run of late, as the risk premium attached to Italian government has fallen to its lowest since early 2018.
Unicredit (MI:CRDI), Italy’s largest bank by assets, stole the show with its first set of quarterly results free from the burden of underperforming assets that it carved out into a run-off unit in December. The bank was ahead of all its key targets in 2019 – from operating costs and non-performing loans to underlying revenue. It more than doubled its dividend to 63 cents a share, as trailed in December’s capital markets day, and hinted heavily at extra distributions to shareholders through buybacks, both this year and in the next two.
The bank’s war-chest will be bolstered by a further sell-down of its stake in Turkish-based Yapi Kredi to 20% from 32%, as well as the pruning of a real estate portfolio that includes 4,000 properties across Europe.
“We prefer share buybacks over M&A any day of the week,” chief executive Jean-Pierre Mustier told an analyst call, firmly squashing lingering speculation that he secretly yearns to take over his former employer  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
SocGen’s earnings were less impressive, with net profit coming in below expectations for the fourth quarter, but it too promised an improvement in 2020 as cost-cutting measures grip. SocGen also promised higher returns to shareholders in future, targeting a payout ratio of 50% of underlying net income, something that could also include a hefty buyback program.
The morning’s other conspicuous outperformer was   Deutsche Bank   (DE:DBKGn), which rose 4.6% to its highest in nearly three months after Capital Group announced it had accumulated a 3.1% stake. The news shows that the 30% increase in the bank’s battered stock hasn’t just been due to satisfied short-sellers closing out a trade that has been highly profitable over the last couple of years."
600,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2020 04:22AM ET</span>","European shares at record high on China tariff cut plans, robust bank results","By Ambar Warrick
(Reuters) - European shares rose to a record high on Thursday as China's intention to cut tariffs on U.S. goods and a swathe of strong bank earnings energized equity markets.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) rose as much as 0.7% to a record high of 426.700. The index was looking at a fourth straight day of gains as it recovered from heavy selling last week. 
China said on Thursday it intends to halve tariffs on some U.S. goods next week, which could help improve negotiating conditions for a second phase of a trade deal after the signing of a Phase 1 agreement between the two countries earlier this year. 
The initial agreement had signaled no further escalation in a prolonged trade war, which had severely hampered global economic growth.
China's plan also brewed some optimism over dampening the economic shock from a virus outbreak in the country, which has killed over 500 people and caused widespread disruptions in the world's second-largest economy. 
""Generally the mood in the market appears to be positive... The markets that have suffered the most when the virus outbreak was announced are now up,"" said Simona Gambarini, markets economist at Capital Economics in London.

601,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 06, 2020 04:08AM ET</span>","Stocks - Europe Hits New All-Time High on China Tariff Cut, Earnings","By Peter Nurse
Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Thursday, helped by China cutting tariffs on some goods imported from the U.S. as well as a swathe of strong corporate releases.
At 04:00 ET (0900 GMT), the U.K.'s FTSE index was trading 20 points, or 0.3%, higher, France's CAC 40 was up 39 points, or 0.7%, while the DAX gained 80 points, or 0.6%. The Euro Stoxx 50 index, which measures the movement of blue chip stocks in the eurozone, rose 20 points, or 0.6%. The Stoxx 600 index, a broad measure of stocks across Europe, rose 0.4% to 425.48, having hit a new record high of 426.70 earlier in the session.
China’s move to halve tariffs on $75 billion of U.S. imports from February 14 improved sentiment as it’s seen improving negotiating conditions between the two countries for a 'phase 2' deal - although that is widely seen as too complex to negotiate this year.
The tariff reductions come as China struggles to mitigate the economic damage of a novel coronavirus outbreak, which has so far claimed more than 560 lives.
With this wind in their sails, investors have tended to react positively to the latest European corporate earnings.
Shares in Nokia (HE:NOKIA) climbed 4.6% after the Finnish telecom network equipment maker reported a surprising rise in October-December underlying profits, driven by cost cuts. It had taken a hefty hit in October after cutting its outlook and halting dividend payouts, citing the need to step up investments in 5G.
ArcelorMittal (AS:MT), the world's largest steelmaker, soared 10% after it voiced optimism over the outlook for steel demand this year despite the impact from the coronavirus outbreak in China. It expects global steel demand to grow by 1% to 2% this year after expanding 1.1% in 2019.
French drugmaker Sanofi (PA:SASY) climbed over 2% after it said its net income was up more than 18% in the fourth quarter of last year on the back of double-digit growth sales at its specialty care business Genzyme and its vaccines unit.
Shares in   Total   (PA:TOTF) rose over 2% after the French energy major said on it had maintained net profit at $3.2 billion for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with the same period a year ago despite low oil prices.
And   Societe Generale   (PA:SOGN) climbed around 1% after the French bank revealed plans for possible stock buybacks and said profitability would improve this year, after posting an earnings miss for the fourth quarter.
Unicredit (MI:CRDI) and Nordea also rose sharply after beating expectations for profit, while   ING Groep   (AS:INGA) underperformed after reporting a sharp rise in bad loan provisions.
Elsewhere, ECB President Christine Lagarde told the EU parliament that the ECB faced a much-reduced scope for policy action. That came shortly after German factory orders unexpectedly fell 2.1% in December, the biggest drop since February, and dampened the more positive mood generated by a number of confidence surveys.
Elsewhere, the oil market has pushed higher Thursday, as talks between experts from the OPEC coalition have been extended into a third day amid reports the group will agree to further cuts in production. That comes among growing signs of demand destruction in the Chinese energy complex. CNOOC, the country's biggest gas buyer, has declared force majeure to get out of taking delivery of contracted volumes of liquefied natural gas, Reuters and Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed sources. Additionally, reports suggest China intends to cut its purchases of Saudi oil.
AT 04:05 AM ET (0905 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 1.8% higher at $51.66 and the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.3% to $56.02."

LONDON (Reuters) -  BP  (L:BP) is seeking buyers for its stake in a major Algerian gas plant deep in the Sahara desert after recent talks on a sale to Russian oil giant Rosneft (MM:ROSN) failed, three industry sources told Reuters. 
BP hopes to raise around $2 billion from the sale of its 45.89% stake in the In Amenas natural gas plant that was the target of a deadly attack by Islamist militants in 2013. The sale is part of a $15 billion disposal programme BP is targeting by the middle of 2021, two of the sources said.
The approval of a sale of the Algerian assets will be one of the first major decisions for Chief Executive Bernard Looney who took office on Wednesday after his predecessor Bob Dudley stepped down following a decade at the helm.
The sale is politically sensitive for BP and its partners, Norway's Equinor (OL:EQNR) and Algerian state-owned Sonatrach, in the wake of the January 2013 attacks when gunmen raided the site and 40 employees died after a four-day siege.
A BP spokesman declined to comment. Equinor and Sonatrach declined to comment. Rosneft did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
BP has in recent months contacted a number of major international oil and gas companies to test the appetite for the stake after talks with Rosneft failed last year, the sources said.
The collapse in the discussions with Rosneft, in which BP itself holds a 19.75% stake, were partly a result of Equinor's reluctance to partner with the Russian company, which faces U.S. sanctions, the sources who were close to the discussions said.
BP and Equinor in December 2017 signed a five-year extension agreement for the In Amenas production sharing agreement with Sonatrach which was ratified in April 2018.
Equinor holds a 45.9% stake and Sonatrach has the remaining 8.21% of the In Amenas plant, which has a production capacity is 9 billion cubic meters per year. The plant produced around 46,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2018.
Security at Algeria's southern oil and gas facilities has improved in recent years due to a boosted military presence.
In 2016, BP and Equinor temporarily withdrew staff from the In Amenas and In Salah gas plants after an attack on In Salah.
An investigation carried out in 2013 by Equinor, known then as  Statoil , concluded that the operators of the In Amenas site did not have the necessary security measures.
BP has sold nearly $10 billion of oil and gas assets around the world since the start of 2019 and expects to announce an additional $5 billion by the middle of 2021, it said on Tuesday.
The disposals follow BP's $10.5 billion acquisition of BHP's U.S. shale oil and gas assets and are part of a drive to focus BP's operations on higher profit assets in regions such as the Gulf of Mexico and Brazil.

604,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2020 02:22AM ET</span>",Norwegian Air's January passenger income jumps,"By Terje Solsvik
OSLO (Reuters) - Norwegian Air (OL:NWC) cut its capacity by a bigger-than-expected 29% in January from a year earlier, removing unprofitable routes while boosting its income from remaining flights, its traffic data showed on Wednesday.
The budget carrier's yield - income per passenger carried and kilometer flown - jumped 15% to 0.40 Norwegian crown ($0.0435), beating a 0.37 crown forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts.
Analysts in a Reuters poll had expected the budget carrier to report a 22.2% decline in capacity for January.
""I am pleased that we continue to deliver on the strategy of moving from growth to profitability,"" newly appointed Chief Executive Jacob Schram said in a statement.
Norwegian has shaken up the transatlantic travel market with low fares, but breakneck expansion and the grounding of its Boeing (N:BA) MAX fleet also brought mounting losses, forcing the company repeatedly to raise cash from owners.
Seeking to turn itself around and avoid joining the ranks of airlines that have collapsed, the company announced in October it would cut its capacity by 10% in 2020 from 2019.
Norwegian on average filled 80.9% of seats in January, up from a load factor of 76.1% a year ago and beating an average forecast of 80.6%.
""In the coming months, I look forward to working together with my dedicated colleagues on the ground and in the air to position Norwegian for a profitable and sustainable future in international aviation,"" Schram said.
Routes between Ireland and the United States and Canada were cut from Norwegian's schedule last September, and in December the company announced the sale of its domestic business in Argentina.
The cutbacks may also alleviate the pressure on rivals such as Scandinavian Airlines (ST:SAS), which now faces less head-to-head competition on routes between Europe and the United States."

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to push higher at the open Thursday, after China cut tariffs on some goods imported from the U.S. Investors will look to the ongoing earnings season for confirmation of this better tone.
At 02:15 ET (0715 GMT), the DAX futures contract traded 61 points, or 0.5% higher. France's CAC 40 futures were up 40 points, or 0.7%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 24 points, or 0.3%. Futures on the pan-eurozone index, the Euro Stoxx 50, climbed 18 points, or 0.5%. 
China said early Thursday it will halve tariffs on $75 billion of U.S. imports from February 14, a month after Beijing and Washington signed a truce in their long-running trade war. This should help improve negotiating conditions for a 'phase 2' deal - although that is widely seen as too complex to negotiate this year.
The tariff reductions come as China struggles to mitigate the economic damage caused by a novel coronavirus outbreak, which has so far claimed more than 560 lives.
Asian stocks gained on the news, with the Shanghai Composite index in China closing up 1.7%, Japan's Nikkei up 2.4% and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong gaining 2.3%.
With this wind in their sails, investors will take a close look at the latest European corporate earnings.

Sweden's Volvo Car Group reported an 18% rise in fourth-quarter operating profit as cost cuts and growing sales more than offset the impact of subdued global auto markets.
French drugmaker Sanofi (PA:SASY) said net income was up more than 18% in the fourth quarter of last year on the back of double-digit growth sales at its specialty care business Genzyme and its vaccines unit.
Overnight, on Wall Street, the S&P 500 gained 1.1% to a record close of 3,334.69 while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.4% to 9,508.68, also a record high. These indexes were helped by ADP's employment report which showed private payrolls jumped by 291,000 in January, the most since May 2015. This comes ahead of Friday’s key official U.S. employment release, which is forecast to show a jump of 160,000 nonfarm jobs.
Turning back to Europe, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde is scheduled to speak at 03:00 AM ET (0800 GMT), before the central bank publishes its new economic forecasts at 05:00 AM ET (1000 GMT).

Sales of Volvos rose nearly 10% in 2019 - with growth of 23.4% in the fourth quarter alone - as increases in China and the United States and strong demand for a line of SUVs, its best-selling models, gave a boost. 
""During the second half of the year, and specifically during the fourth quarter, both profit and profit margin outperformed the comparative period in 2018,"" Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson said in a statement. 
""This is a result of continued strong growth in volume, especially in SUVs, as well as cost efficiency measurements initiated early in 2019."" 
Automakers have been under pressure over the past year, contending with heavy investment needs in the electric and self-driving technology that is seen reshaping the industry in the years to come, as well as softer demand in many major markets.

While Volvo has also faced higher capital spending needs, which it has sought to offset with 2 billion crowns of cost cuts, its niche position in the premium market and continued expansion in China have left it fairly unscathed by a broader slump in car sales.

609,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2020 01:41AM ET</span>",China regulator asks banks to weigh virus impact on borrowers: sources,"By Engen Tham and Cheng Leng
SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - China's banking and insurance regulator (CBIRC) asked lenders last week in some cities to assess the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on their borrowers, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter.
""Many of my borrowers said they would be facing difficulties, but it hasn't come to a head yet as the problems have only been going on for a couple of weeks,"" said a loan officer in the Nanjing branch of an international lender, adding that they had filed a report to the regulator on Tuesday.
Regulators in Beijing had also asked banks to file reports, according to a person with knowledge of the request, and CBIRC officials were also conducting their own research in some places.
China is struggling to contain the epidemic - designated a global emergency by the World Health Organisation - which has so far led to 563 fatalities.
To stem the spread, authorities have cordoned off cities, suspended transport links and shuttered facilities where crowds gather. The impact on an already slowing economy is starting to take its toll, with small- and medium- enterprises the first to feel the heat.
As part of efforts to combat the impact, the CBIRC has urged banks to lower the interest rates and extend loans to targeted companies that have been affected by the outbreak.
Parts of China's banking system were already starting to show strains last year from an economic slowdown and mounting bad debt. A central bank sample stress test said 7.7% of lenders were at extreme risk and unable to withstand a light shock, while 13.6% were at high risk if a financial crisis hit, many of which were small, rural banks.
""With China’s total outstanding debt equal to just over 300% of GDP, any sizeable disruption of loan quality could put the financial sector at risk, slow the pace of lending through the rest of this year and provide longer term friction to the pace of economic growth in China,"" said Steve Cochrane, Chief APAC Economist at Moody’s Analytics in a report released on Wednesday.
VIRUS IMPACT
The CBIRC in Guangdong, China’s export hub, has pledged to provide support for firms in retail, wholesale, catering, logistics, transportation and tourism sectors that have been hit by the outbreak.
Other than the borrowers, China's banks are also concerned about the impact the virus could have on their bottom lines.
An internal report, seen by Reuters, from one branch of China Construction Bank in Beijing, estimated the likely impact on its business in various sectors.
“For Q1, branch's admission fees on mutual funds is expected to be slashed by 5-10%; admission fees from selling insurance products is expected to be slashed by 20%,"" said the report seen by Reuters on Jan. 30. ""New mortgage loans issued by the branch are expected to be down by one-third year-on-year in the first half of 2020.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Global stocks extended their recovery on Thursday, cheered by record closes in Wall Street benchmarks following encouraging economic data, and after China announced a cut in tariffs on some imported goods from the United States.
The tariff relief added to hopes the global economy may be able to avoid a major shock from China's rapidly-spreading coronavirus, which has battered financial markets in recent weeks.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) jumped 1.66% while Japan's Nikkei (N225) rose 2.38%. Mainland Chinese shares also reacted positively, with the bluechip CSI300 index (CSI300) up 1.97%.
European stocks are expected to enjoy a rally, with pan-European Euro Stoxx 50 futures (STXEc1) up 0.66%, German DAX futures (FDXc1) adding 0.73% and FTSE futures (FFIc1) gaining 0.63%.
U.S. stock futures (ESc1) rose 0.55% in Asia while China's onshore yuan rose 0.2% to its strongest level since Jan. 23 after the tariff cuts were announced.
China said on Thursday it will halve tariffs on some U.S. goods, which could help improve negotiating conditions for a second phase of trade deal after the two countries signed off on a interim deal last month.
""Under the phase 1 deal, China has to meet a tough target to increase U.S. import by $100 billion this year, so a measure like this was necessary and expected,"" said Tomo-o Kinoshita, global market strategist at Invesco Asset Management.
""But at the same time, that they did this now points to their desire to support Chinese companies as the coronavirus epidemic will obviously deal a huge blow to China's growth,"" he added.
Mainland shares have also drawn support from Beijing's efforts to support the market amid heightened anxieties about the coronavirus, including liquidity injections and de facto restrictions on selling.
""It is difficult for investors to sell Chinese shares now given the authorities' stance is very clear,"" said Naoki Tashiro, president of TS China Research.
""Still, until the spread of the virus stops, market stabilization steps won't completely change investor psychology.""
On Wall Street, far from the epicenter of the outbreak, the mood was brighter as the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 1.13% to a record close of 3,334.69 while the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 0.43% to 9,508.68, also a record high.
The ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) National Employment Report showed private payrolls jumped 291,000 jobs in January, the most since May 2015, while a separate report showed U.S. services sector activity picked up last month. Both indicators suggest the economy could continue to grow this year even as consumer spending slows.
Traders also cited vague rumors of a possible vaccine or a drug breakthrough for the coronavirus as a trigger for Wednesday's stock rally, although they said such catalysts were likely to simply be an excuse for short-covering.
The World Health Organization also played down media reports on Wednesday of ""breakthrough"" drugs being discovered to treat those infected with the virus.
Another 73 people on the Chinese mainland died on Wednesday from the virus, the highest daily increase so far, bringing the total death toll to 563, the country's health authority said on Thursday.
""Despite all the efforts by the Communist Party, the virus is becoming a major global disaster. Considering workers usually start to return to hometown about a week before the Lunar New Year, many patients must have left Wuhan before its lockdown on Jan. 23,"" TS China Research's Tashiro said.
Statistics from China indicate that about 2% of people infected with the new virus have died, suggesting it may be deadlier than seasonal flu but less deadly than SARS, another reason investors remained relatively calm.

The euro stood flat at $1.0998 (EUR=).
In commodities, U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CLc1) gained 2.66% to $52.10 per barrel, extending its rebound from a 13-month low of $49.31 touched on Tuesday.
Still it is down about 15% so far this year.
Copper, considered a good gauge on the health of the global economy because of its wide industrial use, showed some signs of stabilization although it remained depressed overall.
Shanghai copper (SCFc1) extended its rebound into the third day, rising 1% from 33-month low hit earlier this week. It is about 5% below its levels just before the start of Lunar New Year holidays.
""One has to wonder whether China can meet its trade agreement with the U.S. to increase imports by $200 billion (in two years), which looked very difficult to begin with,"" said a manager at a U.S. asset management firm, who declined to be named because he is not authorized to speak about China.
""Before the outbreak, a mini goldilocks market was everyone's consensus. But we have to see whether we need to change such a view,"" he added."

(Reuters) - Investors wary about the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak spreading from China turned bearish on most Asian currencies and went short on the baht for the first time since May 2019, a Reuters poll showed.
Market sentiment took a sharp turn for the worse, a fortnight after investors turned long on all Asian currencies for the first time since June 2017, on concerns the new coronavirus could dent growth in China and the region.
The virus death toll in mainland China surged over the last two weeks to 563 from 17, with more than 28,000 confirmed cases.
Prospects soured for the Thai baht , Asia's worst performing currency this year, as the fast-spreading virus weighs on the struggling economy that is heavily reliant on Chinese tourism and trade.
Thailand's central bank unexpectedly cut its benchmark interest rate for a third time in six months on Wednesday, taking it to a record low of 1%.
The bulk of the responses from the 16 poll participants came in before the rate decision.
Rebounding into bear territory, short positions in the Chinese yuan and the South Korean won were at their highest since mid-October 2019.
However, risk sentiment has stabilized over hopes that China's central bank would introduce further stimulus measures to boost liquidity and stabilize the economy.
Bearish positions in the Singapore dollar outpaced that of its peers, with short bets on the currency climbing to their highest in more than five months.
The Sing dollar posted its steepest drop in two years on Wednesday after the Singapore central bank said the currency has room to weaken as the virus outbreak hits its economy though it added its current policy stance remains appropriate.
The dovish monetary policy stance has prompted investors to price in possible central bank rate cuts across the region.
Central banks in the Philippines and India are due to hold their respective policy meetings later in the day.
The Asian currency positioning poll is focused on what analysts and fund managers believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah , Taiwan dollar , Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht.

MILAN (Reuters) - Italy's biggest bank by assets UniCredit (MI:CRDI) took a further step on Wednesday in a strategy to streamline its structure, announcing the placement of a 12% stake in Turkish bank Yapi Kredi (IS:YKBNK).
UniCredit, which reports full-year earnings on Thursday, has been shedding assets and mending its balance sheet under Chief Executive Jean Pierre Mustier, who arrived in 2016 to turn the bank around amid concerns over its capital base.
The latest move in the French banker's strategy, which has led UniCredit out of Poland and shrunk its domestic footprint, was the decision in November to dissolve a joint venture with Turkish conglomerate Koc Holding.
The unwinding of the JV handed UniCredit a direct 31.9% stake in Yapi which would fall to 20% after the share placement.
Through the JV, UniCredit had indirectly held 40% of Yapi, the country's third-largest bank. An economic recession in Turkey and the free fall of the lira currency forced UniCredit to write down the asset by 846 million euros back in 2018.
UniCredit said the sale had yielded around 440 million euros. It added the transaction would generate a negative 0.82 billion euro impact on first quarter earnings partly due to the difference between the market value of the stake and its book value.
""The transaction is part of UniCredit's on-going strategy to simplify its shareholdings and to optimize its capital allocation,"" the bank said in a statement.
UniCredit said in December it planned to book a 400 million euro ($440 million) charge in the fourth quarter of 2019 in relation to the unwinding of the accord with Koc.
This and other one-off hits, coupled with large writedowns of problem loans the bank has decided to bring forward, are behind the 1.1 billion euro net loss forecast by analysts for the quarter in a consensus provided by the company.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Citi, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), and UniCredit/Kepler Cheuvreux are managing the accelerated book-building process.
The sale was completed at a price of 2.88 Turkish liras for each Yapi share, equivalent to a 4% discount to Wednesday's closing price of 3.00 liras."

The Oslo-listed company's adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) fell to $3.55 billion in the fourth quarter from $4.39 billion in the same period of 2018. A poll of 25 analysts compiled by Equinor had forecast adjusted EBIT of $3.37 billion.
The company's overall oil and gas output will grow by 7% in 2020, boosted by the start of production from the Johan Sverdrup field in the North Sea, Equinor said, while the average annual growth between 2019 and 2026 is still seen at 3%.
""Johan Sverdrup phase 1 will contribute to strong growth at the Norwegian continental shelf,"" Chief Executive Eldar Saetre said in a statement.
The cash payout to owners was increased to $0.27 per share for the fourth quarter from $0.26 in the third, matching a $0.27 predicted by analysts in a Refinitiv poll."

The sixth delay is another blow to Japan's commercial jet ambitions and will further raise the development cost of an aircraft that its maker's chief shareholder Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd (T:7011) had planned to bring to market in 2013.
The ""first commercial delivery of SpaceJet is expected to be in FY2021 or later,"" Mitsubishi Heavy said in a statement Thursday when released its earnings for the quarter ending Dec. 31. The company also said it will book a 496.4 billion yen ($4.51 billion) special loss related to the SpaceJet unit.
ANA Holdings Inc (T:9202), Japan's biggest airline by revenue, is slated to take the first delivery of the jet.
When the SpaceJet enters service it will compete against a new generation of regional jets built by Brazil's Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3). Embraer has agreed to sell the bulk of its commercial jet business to  Boeing Co  (N:BA) in a deal that still needs final regulatory approvals.
Mitsubishi also on Thursday said it had appointed Takaoki Niwa, the head of its U.S. operations, as Mitsubishi Aircraft's new president, replacing Hisakazu Mizutani, who will become chairman."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) on Thursday raised its forecast for annual operating profit by 4.2% due to a slightly weaker yen, while it also expects to sell more vehicles than an earlier estimate.
Japan's biggest automaker expects operating profit to rise to 2.5 trillion yen ($22.7 billion) in the year to March, up from 2.47 trillion yen the previous year and its earlier forecast of 2.4 trillion yen.
The outlook is based on a new assumption for the yen to average around 108 yen to the U.S. dollar during the current business year versus 107 yen previously.
The higher forecast came despite a 3.2% decline in third-quarter profit to 654.4 billion yen on softer global vehicle sales. 
The result was, however, slightly higher than an average forecast of 652.3 billion yen drawn from nine analysts polled by Refinitiv.
The automaker sold 2.69 million vehicles globally during the October-December period, compared with 2.7 million units in the same period a year ago. 
Sales in Asia tumbled 12.5% while sales in North America, Toyota's biggest market, slipped 1.8%.

Overall, the automaker expects to sell 10.73 million cars for the year to March, slightly higher than a previous forecast for 10.7 million units.

Investing.com - Hong Kong-listed insurers saw some volatile trading sessions in February amid fears of economic fallout resulting from the coronavirus outbreak. 
 
Shares of Ping An Insurance (HK:2318), China Life Insurance and AIA Group Ltd (HK:1299) fell more than 5% at one point earlier this month before rebounding today as unconfirmed reports said a breakthroughs in the development of a drug might be near. 
 
On Thursday, Bloomberg cited a team of more than 100 agents working for an unnamed insurer and said sales to mainland visitors “plummeted to almost nothing” since late January. 
 
The group only made HK$100,000 ($12,880) in first-month premiums, compared to about HK$5 million in the same month last year, the article said. 
 
“Hong Kong’s protests were nothing compared with the blow of the virus to us,” one of the sources said. “This is the worst I have ever seen.”
 
Some analysts are less pessimistic and believe the virus’ impact on insurers are likely to be “manageable.”
 
Fitch Ratings said in a note in late January that it “expects the recent outbreak of novel coronavirus infections to put some pressure on Chinese insurers’ profitability in the near term, but that earnings pressure will be manageable.”
 
Meanwhile, Nomura also said that direct claim losses for insurance companies will be manageable."

That’s according to Ronald Chan, Manulife Investment Management’s chief investment officer for Asia ex-Japan equities. Indian shares have yet to price in the nation’s slowing economy, which could expand at a rate of between 4.5% and 5% amid ongoing struggles with credit issues, sluggish consumption and conservative stimulus policies, Chan said. Growth of 5% would be India’s slowest pace since 2009.
The benchmark S&P BSE Sensex Index climbed for a third day Wednesday, quickly recovering from the losses triggered by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s latest budget. The gauge is down only 0.3% this year, compared with declines of more than 1.5% in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index and the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.
The current relative strength in Indian equities may be due to a handful of top-weighted stocks outperforming and to inflows from investors avoiding markets more affected by the Wuhan coronavirus, Chan said by phone Tuesday. “Once China stabilizes, I think people would come to the reality that India’s growth trajectory will get lower,” he added.
Chan is underweight India equities and has been cautious on the country’s industrial and consumer stocks. On the other hand, exporters, such as some IT and pharma companies, may take the spotlight this year, as they might benefit from a weaker rupee, he said.

(Reuters) - Drugmakers racing to find a vaccine or effective treatment for the deadly new coronavirus in China cautioned that they have a long way to go.
That runs counter to reports of a supposed ""breakthrough"" that on Wednesday boosted financial markets and spurred optimism not necessarily backed by reality.
At least a dozen drugmakers are working on vaccines or antivirals and other treatments to help those infected with the fast-spreading contagion.
Investment costs for vaccines could run as high as $800 million in a process that, even if accelerated, will likely take more than a year until approval, according to executives from companies involved in the effort.
""It will take at least 12 to 18 months, which means in the acute situation we are in now - at least in China - that will not create a benefit,"" said Thomas Breuer, chief medical officer of GlaxoSmithKline's (L:GSK) vaccine unit. GSK is working with developers by providing a technology that could make their vaccines more potent.
The virus, which emerged in December in China, has killed nearly 500 people and shows no sign of abating, with thousands of new cases reported each day, mostly in central China's Hubei province. But its spread to some 27 countries and regions has caused global alarm.
To be sure, companies developing treatments for patients who are already sick may be able to get a drug approved faster than a vaccine that would be given to healthy people. Even so, logistical and regulatory challenges remain, according to two executives at  Gilead Sciences Inc  (O:GILD), which is working on an experimental antiviral treatment.
""There is a distinction there between a therapeutic and a vaccine. Having said that, I think it is true that this won't be super fast and it will involve us investing at risk right now,"" said Gilead Chief Medical Officer Merdad Parsey.
Clinical trials for treatments can be smaller and of shorter duration than for vaccines, Parsey acknowledged.
Challenges in making sure therapies are effective and then scaling up production still remain. Gilead has only a limited supply of its remdesivir, which will be tested against the coronavirus after previously failing in trials as a treatment for Ebola.
'LOOKING FOR A MAGIC BULLET'
Dr. Thomas Frieden, who was director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during the also deadly MERS outbreak, said the benefit of antiviral treatments for such emergencies in the past has been modest.
What worked with MERS and SARS, for example, was better infection control in healthcare facilities, he said of two other types of coronaviruses that also caused global alarm.
""It doesn't mean we shouldn't try, but we're often looking for a magic bullet and the bright shiny object. Sometimes we need to just have the basics,"" Frieden said.
A Chinese TV report on Wednesday said that a research team at Zhejiang University had found an effective drug for the virus, while researchers in the UK told Sky News separately they had made a ""significant breakthrough"" in finding a vaccine.
Reuters could not independently verify the reports, but several traders cited them for sharp upticks in global stock markets.
""There are no known effective therapeutics against this 2019-nCoV,"" said World Health Organization spokesman Tarik Jasarevic, using the current designation for the new coronavirus, when asked about reports of ""drug breakthroughs.""
Health officials in the United States and China have set ambitious goals for getting a vaccine to initial human testing within the next few months.
Newer vaccine platforms, such as one developed by  Moderna  Inc (O:MRNA), allow scientists to create a potential vaccine in record time just based on knowing the genetic code of the novel coronavirus. With the genetic code in hand, scientists can start vaccine development without needing a sample of the virus.
Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is using Moderna's platform, said the agency is on the fastest pace ever to develop a vaccine candidate.
He hopes to have a vaccine available for initial safety testing within two and a half to three months from the time scientists determined the genetic sequence of the virus.
 Novavax  Inc (O:NVAX) research chief Gregory Glenn told Reuters his company has taken vaccines from discovery to clinical testing in 90 days and believes it could do something similar for the new coronavirus.
But to move vaccine candidates from the lab to widespread use in patients involves a number of hurdles, according to health experts and executives for drugmakers working on coronavirus vaccines and treatments.
In addition to scaling up manufacturing capacity and building distribution networks, there are regulatory hurdles such as conducting large clinical trials to make sure a vaccine not only confers immunity to the virus but is safe for use in the general population.
""The earliest you could even know if it's going to work is a year,"" Fauci said.
Whether even a highly effective vaccine will prove profitable for companies is another big question.
""The outbreak could be abating by the time a vaccine is deemed safe,"" Karen Andersen, who follows biotech companies for Morningstar, said in a research note.
The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) has raised around $800 million from donors to aid in preventing pandemic diseases and has allocated some of those funds to biotechs, including  Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc  (O:INO), Moderna Inc (O:MRNA) and CureVac, which are working on coronavirus vaccines.
""We stepped into this with no economic expectation,"" said Paul Stoffels, Johnson & Johnson's (N:JNJ) chief scientific officer. ""We'll see whether in the end it gives a reward."""

The federal judge in Brasilia ruled against recognizing an employer-employee link, arguing that Uber drivers can disconnect at any time from the app and have a flexible work schedule.
Until today, lower courts had decided on labor issues involving Uber, but now a federal court has ruled and its decision, while not binding for other similar cases, is expected to set the standard.
The ruling was welcomed by Uber, which said in a statement it supported dozens of previous decisions in Brazilian courts establishing that its drivers are not employees.
Uber had argued that its platform is a digital intermediary, not an employer, and that drivers accept that condition when they sign on.
Brazil is the second-biggest market for Uber after the United States, and Sao Paulo is its top city by number of rides, ahead of a metropolis like New York.
The company said the court had recognized the innovative character of its platform that partners with more than 600,000 drivers in over 100 cities in Brazil, serving more than 22 million people who use it app.
The federal labor judge, Breno Medeiros, found that the wide flexibility of the drivers in terms of deciding where they want to drive and the number of customers they serve each day was ""incompatible"" with an employer-employee relationship.

Medeiros said the take-home pay of drivers from each ride, between 75% and 80% of the total fare, was enough to characterize the relationship with Uber as a partnership.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is ramping up pressure against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's government, and energy companies with ties to it, from Russia's Rosneft (MM:ROSN) to U.S.-based  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX), should ""tread cautiously,"" a senior administration official said on Wednesday.
The comments came in response to a question about possible sanctions against Rosneft on a call with reporters ahead of a White House meeting between Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido and U.S. President Donald Trump.
""Everything is an option as regards creating pressure, whether it's towards Russian entities that are supporting Maduro or others. So, absolutely, that ... remains on the table,"" the official said, emphasizing that the administration was ""concerned"" by more than just Rosneft's behavior. 
""Whether it's Rosneft, whether it's Reliance, whether it's Repsol, whether it's Chevron here in the United States, I would tread cautiously towards their activities in Venezuela that are in support, directly or indirectly, of the Maduro dictatorship because ... we're halfway through our maximum pressure campaign,"" he added.
Rosneft, India's  Reliance Industries  (NS:RELI), Spain's Repsol (MC:REP) and Chevron did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
But some company executives were surprised by the tone of the remarks, since the U.S government has not taken action since it threatened oil firms dealing with Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A., or PDVSA, in August, sources told Reuters.
Rosneft, Reliance, Repsol and Chevron have emerged as the main business partners for PDVSA since the United States imposed the steepest sanctions yet on the state-owned Venezuelan company last year.
Most of them share oilfields with PDVSA in Venezuela, and they also act as intermediaries for sales of Venezuelan oil to markets such as Asia. In 2019, Rosneft was the main receiver of Venezuelan oil, followed by China National Petroleum Corp - which suspended direct purchases from PDVSA, Cuba's Cubametales and Reliance, according to PDVSA's internal documents and Refinitiv Eikon data.
Washington imposed a first round of sanctions on PDVSA a year ago, depriving the state-run firm of its main market, the United States. In August, it announced new sanctions targeting non-U.S. firms buying Venezuelan oil. 
""VERY SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES"" 
The official also warned against any interference by the Maduro government in Guaido's trip back to Venezuela. ""Any harm that may be caused on Juan Guaido on his return to Venezuela will have very significant consequences,"" the official said.
Guaido, president of the opposition-held National Assembly, is recognized as Venezuela's rightful president by dozens of countries including the United States.
He was a guest at Tuesday's State of the Union address, when Trump, a Republican, praised him as a ""very brave man who carries with him the hopes, dreams and aspirations of all Venezuelans."" Guaido received a standing ovation from Democratic and Republican members of the U.S. Congress. 
The senior administration official also described ""good momentum"" since Maduro's party failed to wrest control of the national assembly from Guaido last month, and said there would be some ""impactful measures"" within the next 30 days to further cripple Maduro's rule.

The only possible topic up for negotiation with Maduro's government was a discussion of ""certain guarantees"" upon his exit, the person added.

(Reuters) - Chip maker  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM) said on Wednesday that the coronavirus outbreak in China poses a potential threat to the mobile phone industry, with a possible impact on manufacturing and sales.
The comments by Qualcomm, the world's biggest supplier of ""modem"" chips that connect mobile phones and other devices to wireless data networks, dragged down chip stock shares despite signs that an industry downturn was ending.
Qualcomm's chief financial officer, Akash Palkhiwala, on a conference call with investors following the release of quarterly results, said the company expects ""significant uncertainty around the impact from the coronavirus on handset demand and supply chain."" 
Qualcomm shares fell as much as 3.75% in after-hours trade.
The San Diego-based chip supplier forecast revenue for its fiscal second quarter largely above Wall Street estimates, in the latest sign that the protracted slowdown in the global chip industry is easing.
The forecast was wider than usual because of the outbreak in China, which has killed hundreds and sparked fears around the world. The company lowered the bottom end of its earnings-per-share guidance by 5 cents to account for possible disruptions, Palkhiwala said.
On the conference call, Qualcomm officials tried to calm analyst concerns over the virus, saying that the biggest 5G markets this year are expected to be in the United States, Korea and Japan, and that the company could weather disruptions.
""If we have an issue, a supply chain issue or demand issue in China, we tend to have the ability to have other regions to back it up,"" Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf said. ""So we tend to look at the business in terms of our planning. We want to make sure that we maintain that strength across different markets.""
But investors' virus worries overshadowed results that otherwise beat expectations.
While it is dominant in mobile modems and processors, Qualcomm has been pushing to win over customers with the kind of chip called a radio-frequency front end that is more complex in phones that use 5G. Even though it forecast fewer modem sales than Wall Street expected, it generated more revenue per modem shipped than in the past.
In an interview, Mollenkopf said the company's forecast reflected strong demand for radiofrequency chips from phone makers, especially in China, where brands are putting 5G capabilities into cheaper devices that will sell in greater quantities sooner than Qualcomm had originally anticipated.
""It's really the first time that you're seeing that significantly in our numbers,"" Mollenkopf said.
Qualcomm left its estimate of the number of 5G mobile handsets that will be sold in 2020 unchanged at between 175 million and 225 million.
Qualcomm forecast total revenue in the range of between $4.9 billion and $5.7 billion for its second quarter, the mid-point of which is largely above analysts' average estimate of $5.08 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
It forecast revenue for its chip segment of $3.9 billion to $4.5 billion, versus estimates of $3.8 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
Qualcomm, which generates most of its profits by licensing its technology to mobile phone makers and others, said the segment reported revenue of $1.4 billion in the fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 29, in line with estimates of $1.41 billion, according to FactSet. On the conference call, Qualcomm said it has signed 85 license agreements for 5G technology, up from 75 in November.

Excluding items, the company earned 99 cents per share in the first quarter, topping analysts' average estimate of 85 cents. Revenue rose 5% to $5.08 billion, beating analysts' estimates of $4.83 billion.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian regulators will consider intervening to stop banks from automatically directing ""tap-and-go"" card payments through the world's largest payment processors Visa (N:V) and Mastercard Inc. (N:MA), the central bank said on Wednesday.
Banks must stop automatically directing debit card payments through the two global networks, and instead give retailers the cheaper option to use local network EFTPOS, Philip Lowe, the governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), told reporters.
""Regulating here is not the preferred option but it is a fallback option if we don't see the required change,"" he said after a speech in Sydney.
Global card schemes MasterCard and Visa, alongside the major four banks, dominate card payments systems in Australia. EFTPOS is owned by domestic financial institutions and retailers.
The RBA says debit card payments, Australia's most frequently used method, processed through Visa or Mastercard cost retailers more than twice as much as using EFTPOS. 
The retailers' association estimates this adds up to extra costs of between A$300 million and A$500 million ($200 million and $340 million) each year.
""We have made it very clear to the banking industry that we expect them to develop the functionality to allow the merchant to choose which payment rails it goes through, the international schemes or the EFTPOS schemes,"" Lowe added.
""If that process doesn't work then we would have to consider a regulatory solution.""
Visa and Mastercard were not immediately available for comment.
The banks had promised to develop systems to facilitate the cheaper route for retailers, Low said, adding that his preference would be not to have to intervene. 
The RBA is reviewing payments regulations to see what strategic issues need to be tackled, from the impact of new payment technologies and new entrants to regulatory technology and an electronic form of banknotes.
""One of the possible reasons for the major banks dragging their feet on least-cost routing is that they each have very extensive relationships with the large international schemes – we will be exploring this in the review,"" Tony Richards, the head of payments policy at the RBA, was quoted as saying in the Australian Financial Review on Wednesday.
A spokesman from Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA) declined to comment. 
A spokesman for NAB said the bank started letting its merchant customers choose their payment network in April 2018, adding, ""We continue to roll out this service across our client base throughout this year.""
Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC) and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ) were not immediately available for comment.

The January trade agreement between the United States and China paved the way for resumption of new energy sales to the country, but since then travel bans and China's urgent response to the coronavirus have sidetracked discussions and are expected to sharply cut energy use and commercial activity.
China's 25% tariff on imports of U.S. LNG remains the largest barrier to additional sales, said Corey Grindal, senior vice president of gas supply at the largest U.S. exporter of LNG.
“We don’t sell that much to China. Right now we have one contract and they’re still taking their LNG,” said Grindal on the sidelines of the NAPE Summit in Houston on Wednesday. “Coronavirus isn’t the problem. It’s the 25% tariff, and they have still not released that.”
Under a Phase 1 trade deal between the world’s two largest economies, China has committed to buying an additional $52.4 billion worth of U.S. energy supplies, including LNG, over the next two years."

(Reuters) - Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's new streaming service Disney+ reached 28.6 million paying subscribers this week, the company said on Tuesday as it reported quarterly earnings that beat Wall Street forecasts. 
Shares of Disney were flat following the results after bouncing between positive and negative territory.
The results showed Disney made a strong entrance into the streaming video wars dominated by Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). The owner of sports powerhouse ESPN is trying to transform its business to capture audiences that are moving online.
Analysts at three brokerages had expected more than 20 million subscribers to Disney+, which is available in five countries including the United States. Disney+ will be available in India on March 29 through streaming service Hotstar. 
Netflix, which began delivering online video 13 years ago, boasts 67.7 million paid subscribers in the United States and Canada.
Subscribers at Hulu, a streaming service Disney now controls, climbed to 30.7 million as of Monday, the company said. ESPN+ customers reached 7.6 million this week.
""(I) believe we're now well positioned to not only withstand the disruptive forces of technology but thrive in today's increasingly dynamic media environment,"" Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger said on a conference call.
Iger said 50% of Disney+ subscribers signed up directly with the company and 20% came from its partnership with  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ). He said the service did not experience significant cancellations after the end ""The Mandalorian,"" a ""Star Wars"" series that became a cultural phenomenon thanks to a character commonly called Baby Yoda. 
During an earnings call, Iger said that ""The Mandalorian"" will return in October and will go beyond season two, ""including the possibility of infusing it with more characters and taking those characters in their own direction in terms of series.""
Selling Disney+ in a bundle with ESPN+ and Hulu helped lower cancellation rates, Iger added. 
Earnings for the quarter grew with help from healthy business at Disney's theme parks and the strong performance of animated movie ""Frozen 2."" 
Excluding certain items, Disney earned $1.53 per share, above the average analyst estimate of $1.44, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Revenue rose to $20.9 billion, up 36% from a year earlier.
The parks, experiences and products division posted operating income of $2.3 billion, up 9% from the prior year. 
Disney was forced to close both Shanghai Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland in late January during the busy Chinese New Year holiday to help stop the spread of coronavirus.
The closings could shave $135 million off operating income at Shanghai, and $40 million at Hong Kong, if they extend for two months, Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy said.
The bulk of Disney's theme parks revenue comes from its U.S. parks. Iger told CNBC that advance U.S. bookings had not been affected. 
The Hong Kong park could see an additional $105 million decline in operating income during the quarter, McCarthy said, as ongoing anti-government protests have depressed tourism.
Disney's direct-to-consumer and international segment, the division that is spending big to build the streaming business, reported an operating loss of $693 million, below analyst expectations.
Operating income in Disney's media unit, home to ESPN, the Disney Channels and ABC, rose 23% to $1.6 billion.

Profit more than tripled at the movie studio to $948 million.

631,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2020 05:26PM ET</span>","U.S. Senator Feinstein, citing Kobe Bryant crash, calls for helicopter warning systems","By Dan Whitcomb
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein on Wednesday urged the Federal Aviation Administration to require terrain warning systems in commercial helicopters, technology that investigators say was not in use in the crash that killed basketball star Kobe Bryant and eight others last month.
Bryant, 41, his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven other people died when a twin-engine Sikorsky S-76B helicopter slammed into a hillside outside Los Angeles in heavy fog on January 26.
National Transportation Safety Board investigators have said the chopper was not equipped with a terrain awareness warning system, which could have alerted the pilot that the aircraft was dangerously close to the ground.
The NTSB has recommended in the past that the FAA require such equipment on helicopters, along with ""black box"" flight data recorders, the agency's Jennifer Homendy said during a visit to the crash site on January 28.
""In order to ensure such a tragedy never happens again, I ask that the FAA commence a rulemaking process to require all commercial helicopters operating in the U.S. to have terrain awareness and warning systems,"" Feinstein said in a statement issued by her office.
The FAA said only that it would respond to Feinstein ""in an appropriate time frame."" The agency currently requires terrain warning systems, or TAWS, only for helicopter air ambulance operations.
The NTSB's Homendy stopped short of suggesting that such equipment could have averted the fatal crash but said it could have made it easier for investigators to piece together what had gone wrong that morning.
""Initial reports indicate the helicopter was neither equipped with, nor required to have, terrain awareness technology,"" Feinstein said. ""This is concerning, since the NTSB previously issued Safety Recommendation A-6-19 in 2006 that recommend that the FAA require all helicopters that carry six or more passengers to have this technology.""Bryant, who retired from the National Basketball Association in 2016 after 20 years with the Los Angeles Lakers, was on his way to a youth sports academy with his daughter when the helicopter slammed into the ground in Calabasas, California.
Audio recordings of air traffic control revealed the pilot requested flight following, a type of constant monitoring, due to concerns about visibility, but controllers said he was flying too low to be tracked.
Also killed were two teammates of Gianna Bryant, Alyssa Altobelli and Payton Chester, along with Altobelli's parents John and Keri, Chester's mother Sarah, basketball coach Christina Mauser and the pilot, Ara Zobayan."

Matt Gallagher, chief executive of Permian Basin shale producer Parsley, called natural gas flaring a ""black eye"" and urged the industry to reduce emissions, during a speech at the NAPE Summit in Houston.
Flaring, or deliberately burning natural gas produced as a byproduct to oil, can worsen climate change by releasing carbon dioxide.
Larger oil and gas companies are increasingly calling out their peers for flaring, which is rising in the Permian Basin. Oil drillers tend to flare or vent gas when they lack pipelines to move it to market, or when prices are too low to make transporting it worthwhile.
Scott Sheffield, CEO of  Pioneer Natural Resources  (NYSE:PXD), in November said producers should get flaring and venting rates to 2% or less and not drill wells before pipelines are complete.
On Wednesday at a separate oil and gas conference in Houston, the head of Royal Dutch Shell's Permian Basin operations, Amir Gerges, said the region had become ""famous"" for flaring and needs ""robust, fit-for-purpose policies and regulatory requirements that incentivize reduction in flaring.""
Permian Basin flaring and venting totaled about 293.2 billion cubic feet last year, according to state regulatory data compiled by independent energy researcher Rystad – up about 7% from 2018.
Permian producers need to lower gas flaring rates below 5%, Gallagher said. He pointed to his company's recent acquisition of Jagged Peak Energy and neighboring properties where Parsley was not flaring natural gas, but Jagged Peak had a 25% flaring rate. ""It literally is right next to us,"" Gallagher said. ""It was a choice."""

Investing.com - Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) on Wednesday report results that topped analysts' forecasts and the semiconductor company said it was set to benefit from the ramp-up of 5G.

Qualcomm announced earnings per share of $0.99 on revenue of $5.08 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $0.85 on revenue of $4.83 billion.
That compares to EPS of $1.20 on revenue of $4.82 billon in the same period a year before. Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) had reported EPS of $0.78 on revenue of $4.8 billion in the previous quarter. 
Shares rose 2% postmarket.

Chip sales fell 17% to 155 million, and the company is not expecting to turn around performance in the second quarter, guiding chip shipments in range of 125 million to 145 million.
For the second quarter, Qualcomm guided QCT (Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) CDMA Technologies) semiconductor business revenue in the range of $3.9 billion to $4.5 billion and QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) licensing business revenue in a range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion.
Expectations for 3G/4G/5G global device shipments, meanwhile, were maintained, and 5G global handset shipments estimated in the range of 175 million to 225 million.
""Our strong fiscal first quarter financial performance reflects a significant inflection point for Qualcomm as we begin to realize the benefits from the ramp of 5G,” said CEO Steve Mollenkopf.

China’s expanding links to the global financial system means it’s harder than ever for the nation to keep its own troubles from spilling over to the rest of the world.
A deadly virus outbreak has shattered optimism in the world’s second-largest stock market, creating the biggest price swings in four years. Authorities stepped in to stem the panic, banning some brokerages from net selling equities and injecting a net 550 billion yuan ($79 billion) of liquidity in two days as markets reopened after an extended halt.
Index inclusion and fewer restrictions for foreign investors are creating new channels for moves in China’s markets to resonate globally. This week’s measures from Beijing helped soothe nerves, avoiding the kind of global meltdown triggered by the yuan devaluation in 2015 and a liquidity-driven crisis in 2016.
Read how the coronavirus has worsened the outlook for Chinese defaults in 2020
But the central bank won’t be pumping cash into the banking system forever -- it actually withdrew funds on Wednesday -- and China risks the ire of global investors if it restricts the selling of shares for much longer.
Below is a look at how China’s capital markets are connected to the outside world like never before.
Size and scale
The world’s most populous nation is gaining a bigger share of global benchmarks tracked by many investors. Stoked by the nation’s economic rise, Chinese shares comprise about a third of the stocks on MSCI Inc.’s Asia ex-Japan gauge. The Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Global Aggregate Index of bonds has started including Chinese debt, which will this year account for about 6% of the more than $50 trillion in bonds included in the benchmark.
Read why the SARS comparisons don’t work for markets
Global equity markets are moving increasingly in lockstep with China’s: the 30-day correlation between the Shanghai Composite Index and the MSCI Asia ex Japan Index is near the highest since August. The possibility for the Shanghai gauge to move in the same direction with the S&P 500 Index is at a one-month high.
Foreign exposure
Beijing is also allowing foreigners to hold more Chinese assets. Last year, it scrapped limits on overseas purchases of stocks and bonds and said global funds no longer needed approvals for quotas. Through initiatives such as the stock link with Hong Kong, international investors now own about 3% of the onshore equity market. Foreigners only hold about 2% of the world’s second-largest bond market, but are steadily building their positions to records.
MSCI Inc. in November completed its latest round of inclusion of yuan-denominated equities, increasing the weighting of the stocks to 12% of its benchmark China index.
Investors outside the mainland have taken advantage of the sell-off in China. They bought a net 18.2 billion yuan of shares via Hong Kong’s links with mainland exchanges on Monday even as onshore stocks fell the most since 2015.
Overseas listing
But with many Chinese companies listed abroad, in particularly Hong Kong and New York, the virus outbreak has directly impacted offshore markets. About half the companies in Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index generate most of their revenue from the mainland. The Singapore bourse also houses almost 50 Chinese companies.
Investors will now likely have to cope with a delay on financial updates from Chinese companies as work and travel restrictions make it hard to finish accounting. But even worse will be the earnings pressure from the spreading virus, with large parts of China’s economy shut down. The impact on non-financial companies’ first-quarter earnings could be 20 to 30 percentage points, according to brokerage China International Capital Corp.
Investors are betting that China will be able to contain the spread and prevent a global market meltdown.
“We believe that a broad-based correction should be relatively short-lived with a more effective virus containment policy,” said Ronald Chan, chief investment officer Asia ex-Japan at Manulife Asset Management, referring to the global market.
Yuan politics
While the Chinese yuan is far from being a global currency -- and its internationalization hasn’t taken off as expected -- China’s large role in global trade means its exchange rate is closely watched. The currency has been a key point of contention for the Trump administration -- the recently signed phase-one trade deal between the U.S. and China included a currency pact to avoid manipulation.
The yuan’s volatility last year jolted emerging market Asia peers, such as the Korean won and Malaysian ringgit. China’s central bank has this week set the yuan’s daily reference rate stronger than 7 per dollar -- all eyes are on whether it will allow market forces to weaken the currency much further."

Hermes, which already sells perfumes, will make its first foray into cosmetics with lipsticks, and will add other products over time.
The roll-out adds more accessible ranges to a company known for bags that can sell for over $10,000, while cosmetics are often a highly profitable sideline for fashion firms.
High-end make-up and skincare products have outperformed lower end ranges at beauty firms like L'Oreal or  Estee Lauder  (NYSE:EL) in recent years, thanks in part to buoyant Chinese demand for branded wares, anti-ageing treatments and other luxury creams.
But make-up sales are starting to slow globally and particularly in the United States, several firms in the sector have noted, while competition from upstart brands has risen, with celebrities like singer Lady Gaga also entering the fray.
Prices for Hermes' lipsticks will start at 62 euros for one of the refillable lacquer tubes, developed in-house and made at a partner factory. Many fashion labels like Italy's Armani or Kering-owned Gucci tend to contract out their entire cosmetics production under license to the likes of L'Oreal or Coty.
Originally a saddle maker, Hermes - which ranks just behind Gucci, privately-owned Chanel and LVMH's (PA:LVMH) Louis Vuitton as one of the biggest luxury brands in the world by sales - makes most of its money from leather accessories.

Investing.com – The S&P closed in record territory Wednesday as investors bet that efforts to contain the outbreak of the coronavirus and support from the central banks will limit its impact on global growth.
The S&P 500 rose 1.13% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.43%, both record closes. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.68%.
The coronavirus outbreak appears to be gathering pace, with the death toll nearing 500, and more than 24,000 infected. But traders appear optimistic that efforts to contain the outbreak will begin to take shape sooner rather later and any potential economic fallout will be stifled by central banks.
That eased worries about the impact on China oil demand, sparking a bid in oil prices that powered energy stocks up 3.7%, marking the sector's biggest gain since December 2018.
A slump in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Snap (NYSE:SNAP), however, took some shine off the rally on Wall Street. 
Tesla fell 17% as Canaccord downgraded its rating on the stock from buy to hold, citing concerns about the impact on the production in China amid the outbreak of the coronavirus.
""Following an electrifying run in 2020, we are downgrading shares of Tesla to hold as we see a balanced risk-reward for investors to lock in profits,"" Canaccord said. ""Just as we observed a clear buy signal coming into 2020, we see the risk of China's coronavirus as a clear headwind to the Shanghai facility, suggesting a more pragmatic position.""
Tesla reportedly plans to delay the shipment of deliveries in China due to the coronavirus, casting doubt on whether the company will meet its guidance on deliveries for the full year.
Snap, meanwhile, plunged 15% after reporting quarterly revenue that fell short of estimating amid weaker-than-expected average revenue per user (ARPU) – a measure used to gauge the performance of social media companies.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - When London-based Revolut opens its virtual doors in America this year, it will be the latest European digital bank to challenge incumbent U.S. lending giants after forays by Monzo and N26, but the challenges it faces have not diminished. 
While the start-ups are experiencing fast growth at home, a crowded market, complex regulatory environment and different customer needs make it hard to stand out in the United States, financial-technology executives, investors and analysts say. 
Revolut and its rivals have amassed millions of customers and billion-dollar valuations in Europe by offering cheap, user-friendly alternatives to traditional banking services. Branchless, but armed with slick apps, they're particularly popular with younger customers.
In theory, there should be rich pickings in the U.S. where banks often have minimum deposit requirements and hefty overdraft fees, and where there are fewer free ATMs.
But customers of the country's roughly 4,500 FDIC-insured commercial banks are far more dependent on credit than in Europe, with a fondness for racking up credit card loyalty points and individual store cards. 
""(The newcomers') product offering and key features might not be as relevant in the U.S. market,"" said Yann Ranchere, a partner at venture capital firm Anthemis Group. ""Credit cards play a stronger role and FX is of less importance.""
Revolut's flagship offer is a debit card connected to an app. Users can store and spend different currencies at the interbank exchange rate, with low fees. The company plans to offer the same service in the U.S., targeting business travelers, exchange students and unbanked consumers, according to a company executive.
TAILOR MADE 
London-based Monzo launched a limited roll-out of its app-based U.S. checking account in June. There is no minimum balance requirement and no monthly or foreign transaction fees, but deposits don't earn interest.
At the time, Monzo chief executive Tom Blomfield said the company wanted engaged early users to provide feedback to help tailor the product to its new market. It now has 20,000 customers on its waiting list. 
Berlin-based N26 arrived in July, touting cashback rewards and other perks. Its app, which allows customers to store and move money around sub-accounts called ""spaces"", had 250,000 U.S. customers by late January.
Revolut is worth $1.7 billion, Monzo $2.6 billion and N26 $3.5 billion, according to CB Insights.

Whereas challenger banks in the UK are eroding market share of traditional lenders, in the U.S. fintech is mostly snaring business from smaller lenders and credit unions which have less resources to invest in digital, leaving analysts skeptical about whether they will be able to achieve viable scale.
Big banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) already have millions of users of their own well-rounded apps and online tools, while local neobanks including Varo Money and Chime offer inexpensive, easy-to-use products. 
""There is nothing that the startups are coming to market with that is new or different,"" said Ron Shevlin, who heads fintech research at Cornerstone Advisors.
N26's U.S. Chief Executive Nicolas Kopp remains sanguine. 
""There is not a lot of precedent (of successful global expansion) in the core fintech scene,"" Kopp said. ""But academically, I don't see a reason why we shouldn't be able to do it."" 
Just 3% of U.S. millennials -- those born between the early 1980s and mid 1990s and a fintech target group -- surveyed by Cornerstone held their main checking account a digital only challenger.
""U.S. consumers continue to face the issue of legacy banking systems, a lack of transparency and excessive fees. These are real problems which we can solve, a Revolut spokeswoman said. ""There is plenty of room for both incumbent banks and technology companies to transform the U.S. financial landscape.""
REGULATORY HURDLES
New entrants account for just 3.5% of the $1.04 trillion in annual U.S. banking and payment revenues, compared with 14% of the 206 billion euros ($228 billion)(175 billion pounds) in the United Kingdom, according to research firm Accenture (NYSE:ACN). 
Perception is one obstacle facing the newcomers, but there are also practical ones. Whereas banks can use one license to operate across the European Union, startups in the United States face a fragmented regulatory environment with multiple regulators at state and federal levels.
Some partner with local banks for simplicity's sake but that can present its own problems, said Sarah Kocianski, head of research at 11:FS, a London-based financial-technology consultancy. 
""There is the potential for the neobank and the license holder to diverge when it comes to direction of the brand, product suite, third party providers, etcetera,"" Kocianski said. ""The license-holder could well be more cautious given it's their license at stake.""
Stockholm-based Klarna needed almost three years to figure out the right product for U.S. customers, CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski told Reuters. After a slow start, the company is now on track to add 6 million U.S. customers annually via its shopping app, having added retail partners and advertised on social media, he said. ""There are a lot of things that can be replicated, but there are local things you need to take into consideration,"" Siemiatkowski said. 
London-based money-transfer startup TransferWise came to the United States in 2015. The country now accounts for 25% of its worldwide revenue, but the overseas expansion was harder than expected, said Chief Technology Officer Harsh Sinha. 

""In a way you are starting fresh,"" he said ""You underestimate a lot of things.""

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla's (O:TSLA) stock tumbled 17% on Wednesday, hitting the brakes on a dramatic rally as a senior executive said the coronavirus outbreak in China would delay deliveries of its Model 3 cars and analysts warned of its high valuation.
With Tesla still up more than 25% since the company posted its second consecutive quarterly profit a week ago, Canaccord Genuity cut its rating on Tesla to ""hold"" from ""buy,"" further shrinking the already small number of analysts who recommend buying the stock.
Tesla Vice President Tao Lin said on the Weibo social media platform that car deliveries from its new Shanghai plant would be temporarily delayed and that the company planned to restart production on Feb. 10.
The $2 billion factory is a key part of Chief Executive Elon Musk's plan to make more than half a million automobiles this year.
Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill, who recommends selling Tesla, warned in a report that Tesla's stock is trading at extreme price-to-earnings multiples compared to many leading technology companies.
Even after Wednesday's drop, Tesla is trading at about 55 times expected 2021 net income, compared to Amazon (O:AMZN) at 49, Apple (O:AAPL) at 22 and Alphabet (O:GOOGL) at 23, according to Refinitiv data.
""We've never seen a stock rise that much that fast with such little regard to past fundamentals or track record,"" Gill wrote.
Tesla last week said it expected a delay of up to a week and a half in the ramp-up of Model 3 production at the Shanghai plant after the Chinese government ordered it to shut the factory due to the outbreak.
The coronavirus outbreak has disrupted business across China, with the government there saying that the death toll had reached 490 as of Tuesday, up 65 from the previous day.
""Given the 3,000 per week China Model 3 production expectations in a country that remains on lockdown, we feel a reset of expectations in Q1 is likely and thus needs to be reflected in the valuation,"" Canaccord analyst Jed Dorsheimer wrote in a report, leaving his price target unchanged at $750 per share.
The stock was last down 17% at about $738. Wednesday's drop followed a sudden selloff in the final minutes of a rally on Tuesday that still left the stock up almost 14% in that session.
Tesla's rally of over 300% since early June has been a vindication for Musk, who has transformed a niche car maker with production problems into the global leader in electric vehicles, with U.S. and Chinese factories.
Still, many investors remain skeptical that Tesla can consistently deliver profit, cash flow and growth in the face of competition from established rivals including BMW (DE:BMWG) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG). Even many Tesla bulls question the stock's valuation following its recent, electrifying surge.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Brian Johnson maintained his ""underweight"" rating on Tesla while raising his price target to $300 from $200.
""We continue to believe TSLA is fundamentally overvalued – but nevertheless concede that the recent price action opens up the possibility of raising capital cheaply, and hence reduces that chance of a stalled business,"" Johnson wrote in a client note.
Following Canaccord's downgrade, nine analysts recommend buying Tesla's stock, while 11 analysts are neutral and 15 analysts recommend selling, according to Refinitiv.
The median price target of analysts is $390."

U.S. stocks rallied toward an all-time high, while Treasuries slumped on speculation efforts will succeed at minimizing the economic impact from the coronavirus. Crude oil rallied after tumbling into a bear market.
The S&P 500 Index’s three-day gain topped 3%. Energy producers surged as crude rallied the most in almost a month on the prospect of OPEC output cuts. Risk sentiment got a boost overnight after a string of reports on possible vaccines, but the World Health Organization later said there are no proven therapeutics. Treasuries retreated, sending 10-year yields above 1.64%, even as more quarantines were announced in an effort to control the virus.
Havens including the yen and Swiss franc slipped. The dollar rose, with data showing U.S. firms added more jobs than economists’ forecasts in January. Copper jumped 1.7%.
U.S. stocks continued their torrid rebound from the virus-fomented sell-off as optimism mounted that the spread will be contained and more central banks signaled a willingness to act if the virus undermines demand, inflation and financial markets. Better-than-forecast corporate earnings also continued boost equities.
“The market is shrugging it off. You can see that the effort is there and the market is saying that this isn’t going to break out into a pandemic,” Michael Pytosh, chief investment officer of equities at Voya Investment Management, said by phone. “It’s not going to cause some cataclysmic medical problem in the world.”

646,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 05, 2020 03:23PM ET</span>","Tesla Mania Cools With Record 21% Plunge, Snapping Six-Day Rally","(Bloomberg) -- The incredible six-day, 60% rally in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. that left Wall Street watchers scratching their heads screeched to a halt Wednesday.
The electric-vehicle maker fell as much as 21% to $704.11 at 1:21 p.m. in New York, erasing most of the gains the stock saw over the past two days, amid an advance that seemed unstoppable. The stock traded just 7.7% higher than where it opened Monday morning, and 12% above Friday’s close. The breather comes as analysts at Canaccord Genuity cut their rating on the stock to hold following an “electrifying run” on concerns that its Shanghai factory may struggle as China works to contain the coronavirus.
“Look, everybody has a pain threshold,” Steve Eisman, senior portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman Group, told Bloomberg Television’s Tom Keene Wednesday. “When a stock becomes unmoored from valuation because it has certain dynamic growth aspects to it, and has cult-like aspects to it, you have to just walk away.” The investor who bet against subprime mortgages before the 2008 financial crisis said he has covered the short in Tesla he disclosed in 2018.
The rapid run in Tesla shares over the past three months, which accelerated to a dizzying pace over the past week, came on the back of two strong quarterly reports, the quick construction of its China factory, an ahead-of-schedule launch of the new Model Y crossover vehicle and a first profit for the battery plant the company jointly operates in Nevada with Panasonic Corp. Some also pointed to the significant amount of short interest in Tesla and said at least part of the rally was explained by investors exiting bearish positions.
“Many investors are struggling to identify a strong fundamental underpinning for the move,”  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a note to clients, adding that investor feedback from the discussions has been “calm, curious and overall cautious.”
That sentiment may have finally caught up with the stock, starting with the jaw-dropping $109 drop in the price right before the closing bell on Tuesday. The stock closed at $887.06, bringing its 2020 gains to 112%.
Wall Street is pedaling back on some of its enthusiasm, with Canaccord Genuity’s Jonathan Dorsheimer downgrading Tesla to hold from buy, warning of a likely “reset of expectations” in the first quarter and flagging China’s coronavirus as a clear headwind to the Shanghai facility.
Meanwhile, Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, who added $17.6 billion to his own fortunes on the back of the rally since the beginning of the year, teased the possibility of a new factory in Texas by asking his Twitter followers to vote on the idea.
Wednesday’s turn lower does offer some comfort to short sellers, who got off to a rough start for the year, amassing $11.47 billion in mark-to-market losses, including $5.63 billion just in early February, according S3 Partners’ Ihor Dusaniwsky. That compares with the $2.82 billion in mark-to-market losses that bearish investors racked up for all of 2019.
“At the end of it all, there’s a big sentiment shift,” said Ben Kallo, a Baird analyst with the equivalent of a hold rating on Tesla’s stock. “Eighteen months ago, this was a company going out of business, everyone said. Now, it’s a business people want to invest in. Institutional growth investors are starting to look at it as a real company that can make money.”

Investing.com - Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) plunged Wednesday as its sunnier outlook was called into question amid worries over supply chain disruption in China in the wake of coronavirus outbreak.
Shares fell 6%.
The company reported second-quarter earnings of $1.35 a share, above consensus estimates of $1.31 a share, but revenue of $2.7 billion fell just short of Wall Street's call for $2.72 billion.
Seagate guided third-quarter earnings of $1.35 a share on revenue of $2.7 billion, above estimates for earnings of $1.27 a share on revenue of $2.59 billion.
The stronger results, however, were primarily driven by higher sales of surveillance drives, a category that has shown ""somewhat lumpy"" demand characteristics in the past, Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson said. 
Bryson also questioned whether Seagate is setting itself up to fail by offering up aggressive growth expectations at a time when the coronavirus outbreak has disrupted operations in China.
""We remain concerned that near-term expectations are perhaps a bit too aggressive particularly in light of our belief that potential supply chain disruption tied to the coronavirus creates more risk than reward this quarter and next,"" Bryson added.
Wedbush also flagged concerns about visibility after Seagate shifted its hard drive product segments to mass capacity and legacy.
""The shift also leads to some loss of granularity as well as limiting our ability to compare historical results with current performance.""
RBC agrees, highlighting concerns about uncertainty over performance in the back of half of the year.
""While the first half should see notable demand for near-line and data center centric products, back half revenues may be lighter than normal seasonality,"" RBC said."

Airbus agreed last week to pay a record $4 billion in fines after reaching a plea bargain with prosecutors in Britain, France and United States over alleged bribery and corruption stretching back at least 15 years.
Avianca on Monday said it had hired a law firm to investigate its relationship with Airbus and determine if it had been a victim of wrongdoing.
French prosecutors said in settlement documents that Airbus had agreed to pay multi-million dollar commissions to an agent over jet sales to Avianca, some of which were earmarked for a senior executive at the airline's parent, Avianca Holdings.
The payments were thwarted by a freeze on agent commissions as Airbus tightened processes in 2014, they said.
Avianca's negotiations with Airbus for the purchase of about 180 airplanes for operations in Colombia, Brazil and potentially Argentina were direct and took place without intermediaries, Efromovich said.
""We did a totally transparent tender,"" Efromovich told reporters in Bogota. ""If Airbus paid something to someone it was pure imbecility because there was no reason to do it.
""I can't say who was the source of corruption, I don't know. There was never a finger of an intermediary that we know of or at least that I knew of.""
Bolivian-born Efromovich, 69, bought Avianca out of bankruptcy in 2004 and grew it to become Latin America's No. 2. He lost control of Synergy Group, which ultimately controls Avianca, in 2019 amid a dispute with United Airlines.
Efromovich said he is interested in possible investments in Italian airline Alitalia and Indian operator Jet Airways, in company with other investors.
Jet, however, will need to recoup its landing slots in London's Heathrow airport in order for its international operations to be viable, Efromovich said.
""On our own we don't have the resources,"" he said."

Google - along with  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) , Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) - are under a series of probes into allegations that the tech behemoths use their clout to defend their market share or expand into adjacent markets.
""I'm literally open to doing what works. I would look at any remedy as a possible solution,"" said Paxton. ""I'm not going to say I prefer one remedy over another when I don't even know fully what the problem is. I want this to benefit the most number of consumers.""
Paxton was among several attorneys general at the Justice Department on Tuesday to meet officials at the agency to coordinate federal and state efforts.
Asked if a potential breakup was in the cards, Paxton said: ""Everything is on the table. It's kind of up to them to take stuff off the table.""
""Most people are just not aware of Google's dominance. Everyone thinks that the internet's free,"" he added. ""The pricing reflects the fact that there's only one player.""
Paxton's team is fighting Google in court over hiring conditions for two consultants that Texas wants on its team. Google wants them to be barred from working for the company's rivals for a year after their work with Texas ends.
Paxton said he would like the probe to end quickly. Asked how Google could make that happen, he said, ""Cooperate? Tell their story? Tell a story that makes sense?""
Google has been cooperating, the company said in a statement. ""We have been working constructively with the Texas attorney general and have produced a substantial volume of information in response to his inquiry even as we seek assurances that our confidential business information won't be shared with competitors or vocal complainants.""The Justice Department said in late July it was opening a broad antitrust investigation of the big digital firms. Attorney General Bill Barr has since said he would like the probe completed by the end of the year.

The companies have come under fire from both ends of the political spectrum. U.S. President Donald Trump has criticized the companies and Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have called for the break-up of Amazon and Facebook.

After industry lobbying, the bloc's European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) proposed on Tuesday to postpone until February 2021 rules that impose cash penalties for failures to settle share trades on time.
Settlement refers to money exchanged for ownership of securities like bonds. Thousands of trades fail each day, because of an inability to provide the cash or securities on time.
ESMA said market participants had highlighted the need for more time given the extensive changes to IT systems that will be needed for such a ""major development"".
The rules implement a section of the EU's new Central Securities Depositories Regulation, or CSDR.
They had been due to come into force in September, during the transition period that began after Britain left the bloc on Jan. 31 and ends on Dec. 31. Britain has committed to applying EU rules during the transition period.
Britain's finance ministry said that at the end of the transition period, Britain will be able to review and implement its own regulations.
""We will continue to be committed to the highest standards of regulation and supervision,"" the ministry said. ""We are seeking a friendly future relationship with the EU and an outcomes-based approach to regulations.""
""Do UK businesses have to continue investing to comply with those rules?"" Peter Bevan, a lawyer at Linklaters, told a House of Lords sub-committee on EU financial affairs on Wednesday.
Britain's Financial Conduct Authority said it will be up to the government to decide which EU rules are applied.
""The main challenge is that custodians are struggling to access the granularity of information needed to assess the financial instruments that could fail to settle under CSDR,"" said Heiko Stuber, a senior manager at SIX, a Swiss exchange and services group.
Bevan said that there will be other cases of ""in flight"" rules that were not already in force before Brexit, and that Britain needs a better regulatory mechanism for deciding quickly on compliance to give businesses certainty."

Fresh from posting a 58.1% return after fees in 2019, Ackman kicked off 2020 with a portfolio update that also mentioned his latest investment in Agilent Technologies Inc (N:A) for the first time.
He sees a bright future for the testing-equipment company, saying it is currently underleveraged and that there is ""substantial opportunity for further improvement."" He and his analysts see more than 800 basis points margin opportunity, far more than the company's projected 50 to 70 basis points of annual margin expansion over the next few years.
Ackman said Agilent is delivering strong performance under the current leadership team and that he paid an average $76.58 per share for the stake. The company's share price, including dividends, has increased 12% from his average purchase cost in 2019 and is off 2% this year.
Agilent was one of two new investments made in 2019.
Pershing Square, which now manages $8.5 billion in assets, ranks as one of the industry's most powerful activist investors where managers push corporations to perform better. Several years ago Ackman opted to take on a lower public profile, prompting investors to closely follow anything he says about his positions publicly. 
Pershing Square also exited its investment in Starbucks ""after prospective returns became more modest following a total shareholder return of 73% in the 19 months that we owned"" it.
He is sticking with Chipotle, last year's biggest winner for the firm with a 14.7% return, saying management has a ""clear plan to drive continued progress in 2020.""

Ackman also reported that David Klafter, a lawyer who had been a member of his investment team, moved to work for Ackman's family office.

657,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 05, 2020 01:36PM ET</span>",NYSE Owner’s ‘Outside the Box’ EBay Approach Leaves Analysts Bewildered,"(Bloomberg) -- While the owner of the New York Stock Exchange says M&A is always top of mind, the company’s approach to EBay Inc. has many analysts scratching their heads.
The potential link-up has no clear rationale, Piper Sandler Cos. said, while Oppenheimer & Co. voiced a widespread reaction when headlines about the talks first appeared: EBay is not a “conventional” M&A target for an exchange.
“News of the EBay approach strikes us as outside the box of typical exchange M&A and ICE (NYSE:ICE) playbooks,” analysts at  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). wrote in a note to clients. “We question both potential expense and revenue synergies.”
A 0.3% rise in the shares of the exchange as of 12:57 p.m. Wednesday in New York failed to offset Tuesday’s 7.5% slump on the news.
Despite those skeptics, the deal talks show NYSE parent Intercontinental Exchange Inc. is taking a wider view of potential combinations as Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Sprecher keeps pace with acquisitive rivals such as  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSE) Inc. and CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME)
ICE late Tuesday confirmed that it had approached the online marketplace to discuss a deal, though no discussions were active. The news came just a month after Sprecher told analysts and investors that he’s always on the prowl for potentially game-changing deals.
“We meet every two weeks, go over the landscape with this topic in mind,” Sprecher said during a presentation at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).’s financial-services industry conference in December. “I think there is more transformative M&A in our future, but it’s got to feel right. And when we do it and announce that, you all have to say, ‘That’s so logical.’”
Bridge2 Takeover
ICE demonstrated interest in the consumer market on Wednesday with a deal aimed at retail users of its digital-currency trading and warehouse subsidiary, Bakkt. ICE said it acquired Bridge2 Solutions, a provider of 4,500 loyalty and incentive programs to companies across many industries. Bakkt, which offers futures trading in Bitcoin as well as custody services for the digital asset, will integrate Bridge2’s rewards programs into the consumer app it’s building.
“With the launch of the Bakkt app, we will, for the first time, offer consumers a robust platform to consolidate and use all of their digital assets, from crypto to loyalty points to in-game tokens, in one user-friendly wallet,” Mike Blandina, CEO of Bakkt, said in a statement.
ICE’s competitors have been active in M&A. A consortium led by Thomson Reuters Corp. is selling Refinitiv Holdings Ltd. to the London Stock Exchange for $27 billion. The deal, announced in 2019, is expected to be completed by year-end. In 2018, CME Group bought NEX Group Ltd. for $3.85 billion to give the Chicago exchange owner new markets in cash U.S. Treasury and currency trading.
Sprecher told the Goldman Sachs conference he’s not concerned about missing out on those acquisitions.
“I didn’t like those deals,” he said. “I didn’t think they were right for us.”
The right acquisition has to add to the long-term value of the company, Sprecher said. “So that’s not an easy thing. To a certain degree, you have to hang around the net, you have to have meetings every two weeks, but continue to refine your thinking.”"
658,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2020 01:21PM ET</span>","Shell boosts crude output in top U.S. shale field to 250,000 bpd","(Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), which plans billions of dollars in spending on shale drilling projects, boosted output in the top U.S. shale field to 250,000 barrels per day in December, the company's Permian Basin head said on Wednesday.
Shell plans to spend about $3 billion per year for the next five years on shale projects, said Amir Gerges, vice president of Permian assets for Shell, at the Argus Americas Crude Summit in Houston. Its Permian Basin production rose more than 100,000 barrels per day in the last year.
“We continue to ramp up our production from our core acreage,” Gerges said. 
Shell and rival oil majors  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM),  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) and  BP  (LON:BP) are spending billions in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico. The companies see shale as a short-cycle asset that complements projects such as deepwater wells that take years to bring into production.
The Permian has 30 years of so-called “tier one” high quality drilling inventory and will remain at the heart of U.S. oil growth, Gerges said. But the industry faces challenges in the region, ranging from too much natural gas flaring to inadequate infrastructure and ""even today’s investor sentiments,"" he said.
Previously, Shell indicated it might seek a way to expand its presence in the Permian, but during last week's earnings call, Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden indicated the timing is not right for an acquisition. 
""I think anything inorganic would not be the right thing to do,"" van Beurden said.
Oil and gas companies of all sizes have been under pressure to produce more free cash and return it to investors through share buybacks and dividends.
The industry also faces pressures to reduce emissions, especially from prolific gas flaring, deliberately burning gas produced as a byproduct to oil. The practice can worsen climate change by releasing carbon dioxide. 
The U.S. drilling industry flared or vented more natural gas in 2019 for the third year in a row, as soaring production in Texas, New Mexico, and North Dakota have overwhelmed regulatory efforts to curb the practice, according to state data and independent research estimates.
“The flaring and emissions in the Permian Basin have become famous and it’s not something we would like to be recognized for,” Gerges said.

The region needs more infrastructure such as natural gas pipelines, but it is more important to have ""robust, fit-for-purpose policies and regulatory requirements that incentivize reduction in flaring,"" Gerges said.

659,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 05, 2020 01:16PM ET</span>",Stocks - S&P Continues to Flirt With Record as Energy Stocks Jump,"By Yasin Ebrahim 
Investing.com – The S&P eased from highs Wednesday, but remained in record territory, as a surge in energy stocks on easing coronavirus fears offset mostly underwhelming earnings.
The S&P 500 rose 0.81%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.17% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.2%.
Energy stocks jumped, led by a climb in oil prices on reports that OPEC and its allies are mulling deeper production cuts in response to the coronavirus's impact on Chinese demand.
  Exxon Mobil   (NYSE:XOM), Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and   Noble Energy   (NASDAQ:NBL) were among some the biggest the movers.
Sentiment on stocks was also boosted by reports that researchers in the U.K. have made a ""significant breakthrough"" in finding a vaccine to the virus, strengthening hopes the outbreak will be contained sooner rather than later.
Tech, however, lagged the move higher, hit by a slump in shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Snap (NYSE:SNAP).
Tesla reportedly plans to delay the shipment of deliveries in China due to the coronavirus casting doubt on whether the company will meet its guidance on deliveries for the full year.
But the ""aggressive trajectory of Giga 3 production and demand out of Shanghai,"" will likely keep the electric automaker on track to meet guidance, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said.
The sharp selloff could also simply be an adjustment after the huge run shares have had this year and particularly since earnings.
Snap, meanwhile, plunged 13% after reporting quarterly revenue that fell short of estimating amid weaker-than-expected average revenue per user (ARPU) – a measure used to gauge the performance of social media companies.
Elsewhere on the earnings front, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) faced a wave of selling pressure, falling 9% after missing quarterly earnings estimates. And Disney's (NYSE:DIS) better-than-expected subscriber numbers for its streaming service Disney+ were offset by an expected hit in operating income due to closure of its China theme parks.
With just days ago until the crucial U.S. jobs report, investors cheered data showing the economy created more private jobs-than-expected and ongoing strength in the services sector, which makes up more than a third of economic growth."

662,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2020 01:10PM ET</span>",Nasdaq proposes exclusive exchange trading for illiquid stocks,"By John McCrank
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ) asked regulators on Wednesday to allow issuers of thinly-traded stocks listed on its exchange to trade almost exclusively on Nasdaq, as part of a broader plan to boost trading in small- and mid-sized companies.
There are 13 U.S. stock exchanges, with at least two more preparing to launch, and a company's shares can be traded on any of them, regardless of whether they are listed on the Intercontinental Exchange Inc's (N:ICE) New York Stock Exchange, or Nasdaq.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission asked the exchanges in October to bring it proposals aimed at making thinly-traded securities, which Nasdaq defined as trading less than 100,000 shares a day, on average, for six consecutive months, easier to trade.
Concentrating all the orders for a stock on a single exchange would help bring buyers and sellers together, while reducing market complexity and lowering trading costs, Nasdaq said in a filing with the SEC on Wednesday.
""Nasdaq proposes to establish a tier nestled within the U.S. public equity markets that is better tailored and far more hospitable to thinly-traded securities than is the all-purpose, undifferentiated market environment in which they suffer today,"" the New York-based company said.
Shares can also be traded on around 30 broker-run off-exchange trading venues, which would not be affected by Nasdaq's proposal.
Drawing from consultations with market participants, as well as its experience operating a venture exchange in the Nordics, Nasdaq said it would also seek regulatory relief to relax trading and disclosure rules for companies with thinly-traded shares.
For instance, exempting thinly-traded stocks from a rule that says trades must happen at the best displayed bid or offer in the market, would allow the exchange operator to use on-demand auctions to further pool liquidity. And allowing issuers to pay market makers to maintain quotes on their stock could lead to more attractive spreads and more orderly openings and closings of the stock.
Cboe Global Markets (Z:CBOE), which operates four U.S. stock exchanges, but does not have a corporate listings program, said in a Dec. 20 letter to the SEC that allowing companies to trade on a single exchange would dampen competition and innovation among exchanges.
Those who support the move ""criticize the 'one-size-fits-all' market structure in place today,"" Cboe said.
""Their proposed fix is to limit trading to a single national securities exchange, offering a single market structure. The irony of this solution is not lost on Cboe."""
663,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2020 01:08PM ET</span>",Ford says Canadian agency investigating emissions certification process,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said Wednesday Canadian officials have opened a preliminary investigation into the automaker's emissions certification process.
Ford said in its annual report Environment and Climate Change Canada has opened a probe into the matter after the automaker disclosed early last year that the U.S. Justice Department had opened a criminal investigation into the issue.
In February 2019, Ford disclosed an issue with emissions to the Environmental Protection Agency and California regulators. Ford hired an outside law firm and experts to investigate its vehicle fuel economy and testing procedures after employees raised concerns about analytical modeling that is part of its fuel economy and emissions compliance process.
Ford did not immediately comment on the status of its investigation of its U.S. emissions certification process. Ford has said the ""potential concern"" does not involve the use of defeat devices. Environment Canada also did not immediately comment.
The company said Wednesday in its has notified a ""number of other state and federal agencies"" about the issue and continues ""to cooperate fully with these government agencies.""
In April, Reuters reported Ford had held meetings with the California Air Resources Board and EPA and turned over documents related to its review and had submitted a testing plan that has been approved by regulators, citing a person briefed on the matter.
Ford potentially faces significant financial penalties as regulators have taken a tough line on emissions issues. Ford has said it does not know whether it would have to correct data provided to regulators or consumers.
U.S. and California regulators have been cracking down on automakers for emissions cheating following revelations in 2015 that German automaker Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) had used defeat devices to make models equipped with diesel engines appear to comply with emissions standards when they emitted far more pollution than allowed in real-world driving.

In January 2019, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV agreed to an $800 million settlement to resolve claims by the U.S. Justice Department and the state of California that it used illegal software to produce false results on diesel-emissions tests. A criminal investigation is pending.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - South Korea's Kia Motors is discussing with the Indian state of Tamil Nadu the possibility of moving a $1.1 billion plant out of neighboring Andhra Pradesh only months after it fully opened, due to policy changes last year, sources close to the talks told Reuters.
Kia (KS:000270) inaugurated the Andhra plant, its first in the world's fifth-largest car market, in December after two years of construction. It has an annual capacity of some 300,000 units and created 12,000 direct and indirect jobs.
However, Kia is now in talks with the nearby state of Tamil Nadu, home to many major auto parts suppliers, about potentially relocating the plant, a senior state government official and a second source familiar with the discussions said.
""(Kia) are facing problems (in Andhra Pradesh), they have been in preliminary negotiations with us ... There is a secretary-level meeting next week, we might have more clarity then,"" the official told Reuters on Wednesday.
Kia said in a statement it has a long-term commitment to the Indian market and it aims to utilize the full capacity of its Andhra plant ""before considering further expansion"".
""We do not have any plans to shift the manufacturing facility from the current location,"" it said, without commenting on any policy concerns or talks with Tamil Nadu, which are at an early stage.
Kia is being represented in the talks by executives at its sister company  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380), which is India's second-largest automaker and has all its car production facilities in Tamil Nadu, the state official added.
Hyundai did not respond to a request for comment. The Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh chief minister's offices did not respond to requests for comment.
Kia has been troubled by a new Andhra state law on local hiring and by the new state government wanting to review the incentives given out by the previous administration to encourage the company to set up the plant, the second source and a third person with knowledge of the discussions said.
Moving the plant to Tamil Nadu could also help Kia in reducing logistics costs as it would bring it closer to some of its parts suppliers, the second source added.
It was not immediately clear how swiftly Kia could move production lines from a plant in one state to another, or what sort of disruption that would entail.
The sources declined to be named as the talks are private.
STATE POLICY CHANGES
Kia started building the new plant in 2017 and formally inaugurated it in December, when it said the 23 million square foot facility would manufacture vehicles like its Seltos SUV for both the Indian and overseas markets.
It said the facility would ""become a vital part"" of its global production network in the long term.
But considering relocation within months of the inauguration highlights the challenges foreign investors face while dealing with policy changes at federal or state level in India.
Kia was caught off guard in July after the new state government in Andhra mandated companies to reserve 75% of all jobs for locals from the state, making it much harder for the company to find suitable employees, two of the sources said.
Kia has also been unnerved by the new state government's bid to review certain financial incentives - such as breaks on electricity tax and deferred land payments - given to the company by the previous administration, one of the sources said.
After taking control of Andhra in 2019, a new government has decided to review agreements signed with several companies, including from the renewable energy sector, sparking concerns among foreign investors around sanctity of contracts in India.
The Japanese ambassador to India, given Japanese companies interest in the region, told Andhra Pradesh not to renegotiate renewables contracts as it would hit business sentiment in the region, an Aug. 7 letter seen by Reuters showed.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's federal government is separately working on a foreign investor protection law to safeguard against policy changes, Reuters has reported.
""This is a problem for all companies including Kia ... the cost of moving the plant would be too high and would set the company back by about two years and they have made huge investments,"" said one of the sources aware of Kia's concerns."
667,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2020 12:43PM ET</span>",France's BNP Paribas on prowl for further European expansion,"By Maya Nikolaeva
PARIS (Reuters) -  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) is looking for further opportunities to expand its investment banking franchise in Europe and fortify its lead over local rivals after last year taking over Deutsche Bank's electronic equity and prime broking operations.
France's biggest bank has jumped to the top of Europe's investment banking league tables by gaining market share in fixed income and equities trading, as others pare back or exit.
Yann Gerardin, head of corporate and institutional banking at BNP Paribas, told Reuters after the bank reported a doubling of fourth quarter global markets revenue that it would examine openings like the Deutsche (DE:DBKGn) one if they arose.
""If there is an exceptional opportunity, we will look at it,"" Gerardin said.
BNP Paribas has said it hopes the Deutsche deal will bring it an extra 400 million euros ($441 million) in annual revenue, while another of its senior bankers said the deal could help it grow in equity capital markets across Britain and Germany.
The bank said on Wednesday it wanted to strengthen its lead in Europe during 2020, while having ""development plans"" in countries such as Spain and Italy, increasing the number of clients among fund managers and integrating Deutsche's prime brokerage platform, which serves hedge fund clients.
BNP Paribas' strategy is to increase its corporate and institutional client base, while offering them a wide range of products - from advising on listings and acquisitions to selling loans and helping to hedge risks or clear transactions.
This expansion plan comes amid a reshaping of the European financial landscape, which saw Wall Street heavyweights take advantage of a banking sector weakened by the 2008 financial crisis and the tougher regulation to flex their muscles.
However, as some European rivals have retreated, BNP Paribas has picked up staff and businesses in a rear-guard challenge to U.S. firms including JPMorgan (N:JPM), Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS).
This is already paying off for the French bank, which outranked both Deutsche and Britain's  Barclays  (L:BARC) to become the top performing European investment bank last year, Refinitiv data shows, growing its share of the fees earned faster than any of its top 20-ranked rivals.
'LAST MAN STANDING'
BNP Paribas has traditionally trailed the likes of Deutsche and Barclays in the investment banking league tables, while paying its top bankers less. Six years ago the French bank ranked only 7th in Europe, Refinitiv data shows.
Data from their annual reports shows the number of staff receiving annual compensation exceeding 1 million euros ($1.1 million) at BNP Paribas was 181 in 2018, compared to 643 at  Deutsche Bank  and 430 at Barclays.
As well as buying the Deutsche business, BNP Paribas has also drafted in corporate brokers from  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) in Britain and hired senior investment bankers over the last two years from rivals including JPMorgan and  Citigroup  (N:C).
""The corporate and investment bank is one of the main strengths of BNP. It is almost the last man standing within European banks ... thus leaving an open field for U.S. banks and BNP,"" Ion-Marc Valahu, a fund manager at Geneva-based investment firm Clairinvest, said.
Valahu sold his BNP Paribas shares in November after they rose 30% from January 2019, overtaking Santander (MC:SAN) to claim the title of the euro zone's biggest bank by market value.
BNP Paribas' fixed income business was one of its most improved areas in 2019, with revenue up 36%, industry analysts say, but there are questions about the profitability of the business lines it is expanding into.
Despite gaining market share, the bank cut a key profitability target on Wednesday due to persistently low interest rates.
One big growth area has been the low-margin repo market, where it gives clients short-term cash in return for government bonds or other high quality assets as collateral. Clients buy those assets back for a small rate of interest.
""I just don't understand the overall strategy of putting a lot of balance sheet into things like vanilla repo which don't make much money,"" an executive at a rival U.S. bank said.

Koujianou Goldberg said in her email: ""It was a difficult decision, but I felt that the time is right for me to return to my work at Yale University. I appreciate your understanding.""
World Bank President David Malpass, in a separate internal email to staff seen by Reuters, said the bank's management team ""will miss Penny as a colleague and as a friend.""

Koujianou Goldberg is known as an expert in microeconomics research, focusing on topics including trade and inequality, intellectual property rights in developing countries and exchange rates.
In his note to staff, Malpass, praised her ""intellectual rigor and curiosity"" and an October 2018 World Bank study she led that showed the growth of global supply and value chains - a key driver of poverty reduction in emerging market counties - had largely stalled in the past decade and is under threat from trade conflicts and new technologies."

(Reuters) - Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) Technology SA on Wednesday forecast current-quarter revenue largely below analysts' estimates, as the streaming service spends more on promotions to lure listeners in its battle against Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Music and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Shares of the Swedish company were down 5% at $147 in midday trading.
Spotify's paid subscriptions rose a better-than-expected 29% in the fourth quarter, largely from discounted promotional plans.
The company ran several campaigns in the quarter, including a ""3 months on us"" intro offer for new users and a win-back offer for returning customers.
Spotify is also spending more on podcasts, trying to keep pace with its two closest rivals - Apple Music with more than 60 million subscribers as of June and Amazon, which has more than 55 million subscribers globally.
Paid subscribers, which make up nearly 90% of its revenue, tallied 124 million for the three months ended Dec. 31. Analysts on average expected 122 million, according to FactSet. 
The company forecast first-quarter premium subscriber numbers largely in line with estimates. It expects total premium subscribers in the range of 126 million to 131 million for the first quarter compared with the estimate of 128 million, according to FactSet Estimates.
But Spotify reported a decline in average revenue per user (ARPU) for the fourth quarter.
""Our ARPU was down 5% in Q4 and we expect similar declines for 2020,"" Chief Financial Officer Paul Vogel told Reuters. 
Spotify also said it bought Ringer, the sports and entertainment podcast network founded by Bill Simmons, for an undisclosed price.
""What we really did with The Ringer, I think, is we bought the next ESPN,"" said Chief Executive Officer Daniel Ek in a post-earnings call. 
""And we think that's going to be a tremendously valuable property as we look at the development of sports over the next decade."" 
The company, which launched its music service over a decade ago, has invested over $500 million to build its podcast business and currently has over 700,000 podcast titles.
""It's clearer than ever to us that podcast listening is driving the overall health of our business,"" Ek said.
Fourth-quarter revenue rose 24% to 1.86 billion euros ($2.05 billion), missing expectation of 1.89 billion euros, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Spotify expects first-quarter revenue in the range of 1.71 billion euros to 1.91 billion euros, compared with estimate of 1.90 billion euros.
The company reported a loss attributable to shareholders of 209 million euros, or 1.14 euros per share, hurt mainly by social costs in Sweden.

By Kim Khan 

Investing.com – Movie studio Lions Gate Entertainment climbed Wednesday on speculation that it could be a hot acquisition commodity as the streaming wars heat up.

Shares of Lions Gate Entertainment (NYSE:LGFa) rose 5% following a report from Forbes naming it as a candidate to become the first Silicon Valley studio.

While huge deals by Walt   Disney   (NYSE:DIS) and AT&T (NYSE:T) make the merger space at the top extremely limited, streaming companies may want to snap up a mini studio for production like Lions Gate, MGM or Sony Entertainment, Forbes said.
A deal like that would also give suitors like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) a library of existing movie and TV content, it added.
That would be especially important as Disney turns up the heat. The House of Mouse just reported that its Disney+ streaming service hit 26.5 million subscribers. The service can draw on an entire catalog of Disney, Marvel and Star Wars content.
Lions Gate owns franchises like “The Hunger Games” and “Twilight.”
The stock was up about 20% in the last three months before today’s jump."

The company said the fast-spreading virus was having a negative impact on its business but added that it could not yet assess to what extent. 
Adidas has about 12,000 outlets in China, including franchise stores.
Adidas saw sales growth slow to 11% in China in the July-September period from 14% in the second quarter.
Several retailers have warned that coronavirus is taking its toll, including  Nike  Inc (N:NKE) and  Hugo Boss  (DE:BOSSn), which have both closed some stores in China. 
Adidas's German rival Puma (DE:PUMG) said that factories will remain closed until Feb. 10.
""We have so far not been informed of any production or shipment delays. A number of stores - both owned and operated and partner stores - remain closed for the time being due to local regulations"", a Puma spokesman said. 
""It is too early to comment on the effects of these closures"", he added. 

The group cancelled or postponed all Puma events in China in February including training and marketing meetings and put travel restrictions in place. Its Shanghai office remains closed until February 9.

(Reuters) -  Coty Inc  (N:COTY) reported quarterly profit above expectations on Wednesday and said the recent coronavirus outbreak would have a relatively small impact on its earnings, sending the cosmetics and fragrance maker's shares surging as much as 22%. 
The virus, which has killed nearly 500 people and affected hundreds of thousands across the globe, has forced several retailers, including Capri Holdings (N:CPRI) and Ralph Lauren Corp (N:RL), to shut stores and limit working hours.
Chief Financial Officer Pierre-Andre Terisse told Reuters the company would take a hit but it would be smaller than that of its competitors. 
China, an important market for luxury brands, accounts for 3% of Coty's overall sales. 
""Investors have been on edge with beauty and personal care companies because of the impact of the coronavirus, and specifically the impact it will have to sales in the greater China area and travel retail channel,"" CFRA Research analyst Arun Sundaram said. 
""The tone and commentary today gives investors a bit more confidence that COTY will fare better than its peers.""
The results also highlight the CoverGirl cosmetics maker's efforts to draw in millennial customers who are shunning mainstream cosmetics brands for niche ones that are promoted by social media influencers. 
Coty spent $600 million to take a majority stake in reality TV star Kylie Jenner's make-up and skincare businesses in November and is collaborating with American actress Lili Reinhart to promote its brands among millennials.
The company posted a 1.3% rise in its luxury unit on a comparable basis, driven by strong demand for its Tiffany & Love fragrances and glittery Gucci lipstick.
Net revenue fell 6.4% to $2.35 billion, but was still ahead of analysts' estimates of $2.34 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Net loss attributable to the company narrowed to $21.1 million, or 3 cents per share, in the second quarter ended Dec. 31 from $960.6 million, or $1.28 per share, a year earlier.
Excluding certain items, Coty earned 27 cents per share, beating analysts' average estimate of 24 cents.

Share of Coty, which is majority owned by German conglomerate JAB Holdings, were up about 15% at $12.18.

Shares of the electric-vehicle maker fell 9.4% to $803.63, after rising as high as $968.99 Tuesday amid what looked like an unstoppable advance. The breather comes as analysts at Canaccord Genuity cut their rating on the stock to hold following an “electrifying run” on concerns that its Shanghai factory may struggle as China works to contain the coronavirus.
“Look, everybody has a pain threshold,” Steve Eisman, senior portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman Group, told Bloomberg Television’s Tom Keene Wednesday. “When a stock becomes unmoored from valuation because it has certain dynamic growth aspects to it, and has cult-like aspects to it, you have to just walk away.” The investor who bet against subprime mortgages before the 2008 financial crisis said he has covered the short in Tesla he disclosed in 2018.
The rapid run in Tesla shares over the past three months, which accelerated to a dizzying pace over the past week, came on the back of two strong quarterly reports, the quick construction of its China factory, an ahead-of-schedule launch of the new Model Y crossover vehicle and a first profit for the battery plant the company jointly operates in Nevada with Panasonic Corp. Some also pointed to the significant amount of short interest in Tesla and said at least part of the rally was explained by investors exiting bearish positions.
“Many investors are struggling to identify a strong fundamental underpinning for the move,”  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a note to clients, adding that investor feedback from the discussions has been “calm, curious and overall cautious.”
That sentiment may have finally caught up with the stock, starting with the jaw-dropping $109 drop in the price right before the closing bell on Tuesday. The stock closed at $887.06, bringing its 2020 gains to 112%.
Wall Street is pedaling back on some of its enthusiasm, with Canaccord Genuity’s Jonathan Dorsheimer downgrading Tesla to hold from buy, warning of a likely “reset of expectations” in the first quarter and flagging China’s coronavirus as a clear headwind to the Shanghai facility.
Meanwhile, Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, who added $17.6 billion to his own fortunes on the back of the rally since the beginning of the year, teased the possibility of a new factory in Texas by asking his Twitter followers to vote on the idea.
Wednesday’s turn lower does offer some comfort to short sellers, who got off to a rough start for the year, amassing $11.47 billion in mark-to-market losses, including $5.63 billion just in early February, according S3 Partners’ Ihor Dusaniwsky. That compares with the $2.82 billion in mark-to-market losses that bearish investors racked up for all of 2019.
“At the end of it all, there’s a big sentiment shift,” said Ben Kallo, a Baird analyst with the equivalent of a hold rating on Tesla’s stock. “Eighteen months ago, this was a company going out of business, everyone said. Now, it’s a business people want to invest in. Institutional growth investors are starting to look at it as a real company that can make money.”"

Investing.com -- Wall Street surged again at the opening on Wednesday, as strong U.S. economic numbers and speculative reports of progress in fighting the coronavirus combined to revive optimism.
By 10:20 AM ET (1120 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 269 points or 0.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite, which opened at a record high, was up 0.4% and the S&P 500 was up 0.8%.
Sentiment was helped by a private payrolls survey by ADP which showed the U.S. private sector added more jobs in January than in any month since May 2015. The reports sets the scene for the broader labor market report from the Commerce Department on Friday.
Additionally, the Institute of Supply Management said its non-manufacturing purchasing manager index rose by more than expected in January to 60.9, defying expectations of a fall to 56.5 and hitting its highest level since September.
Among individual stocks, however, the biggest mover was Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, which gave up some of its stellar gains of the week so far as more opinion shifted to the view that it is overbought. Tesla stock fell 12.8%, but was still up 34% on the week.
Another big faller was Snap (NYSE:SNAP), the parent of social media network Snapchat, which fell 9.4% after reporting a wider net loss for the last quarter as a 16% annual rise in users failed to generate an equivalent amount in revenue.
Among the gainers, Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) rose 2.4% on continued speculation on a boom in remote working due to the coronavirus. It’s gained 19% this week so far.
Walt   Disney   (NYSE:DIS) struggled to make it over the gain line, losing 0.9% after warning that operating profit would take a hit this quarter from the closure of its theme parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong.
General Motors (NYSE:GM) rose 0.6% after reporting a net loss for the quarter that was narrower than expected after a six-week strike at the end of last year, but Ford Motor (NYSE:F) lost 7.4% after falling short of expectations and giving gloomy guidance for the year after the closing bell on Tuesday.

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) on Wednesday forecast flat profits for 2020 and reported a better-than-expected fourth quarter result as it kicked off a new effort to win over investors stampeding into shares of electric car rival Tesla Inc (O:TSLA).
The automaker's shares were up 1.8% in early trading.
GM said it expects earnings per share for 2020 in a range from $5.75 to $6.25, excluding one time items, taxes and interest. Analysts are expecting GM to earn $6.23 this year on a comparable basis, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The automaker forecast $6 billion to $7.5 billion of automotive free cash flow this year, a range that extends above the $6.5 billion GM's auto operations could have generated in 2019 excluding the costs of the 40-day United Auto Workers strike last fall.
GM expects U.S. car and light truck sales to fall by about 500,000 vehicles from last year's 17.1 million.
""Good enough,"" J.P. Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote about GM's 2020 guidance in a note Wednesday morning.
GM appeared to be getting better treatment from Wall Street than rival Ford Motor Co's (N:F), whose shares slumped Wednesday after the company on Tuesday delivered a weaker-than-expected 2020 forecast. Ford warned of higher warranty costs, lower profits at its credit arm and continued investments in future technology such as self-driving cars.
GM's fourth quarter profits took a $3.6 billion hit from a 40-day United Auto Workers strike that shut down the automaker's profitable U.S. operations. Profits from its operations in China also fell.
The company said pre-tax profits were 5 cents a share for the latest quarter excluding certain restructuring costs, down from $1.43 a year earlier. Analysts had forecast pre-tax income of a penny a share for the latest quarter.
Including restructuring costs, GM had a fourth quarter net loss of $194 million, or 16 cents a share.
Revenue in the quarter fell nearly 20% to $30.8 billion.
GM said income from its joint ventures in China fell to $200 million in the fourth quarter from $300 million a year earlier, as wholesale vehicle deliveries fell by 20%.
The Detroit company said “slower adoption of new fuel-efficient technology” by Chinese customers hit fourth quarter results from the world’s largest auto market. The company is backtracking from an effort to sell vehicles with three-cylinder engines in China, and will offer more four-cylinders.
GM Chief Financial Officer Dhivya Suryadevara said Wednesday the automaker had ""people working around the clock here to mitigate the impact"" of disruptions to production and parts supply from China's deadly coronavirus outbreak. GM will make decisions to restart idled operations in China ""plant by plant,"" Suryadevara said.
But even before the virus outbreak, GM expected the Chinese market to be volatile this year. China's auto market is maturing, Suryadevara said, which means more competitive pressure on prices and slower growth than in the past.
""We are bullish on the Chinese industry and our position in China long term,"" she told reporters ahead of presentations to analysts."

Investing.com -- Stocks in focus in premarket trade on Wednesday, 5th February. Please refresh for updates.
9 AM ET: Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) stock was up 4.0% and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) stock was down 1.9%, partially retracing moves made on Tuesday on the confirmation that the two had held talks over a potential acquisition by ICE, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange.
ICE (NYSE:ICE) confirmed after the closing bell on Tuesday that it had sought to buy the electronic marketplace, which has struggled to redefine itself after trying to grow beyond its roots as an online auction house.
Earlier this week, activist shareholder Starboard had again pressed it to sell its classified ads business in an effort to unlock value for shareholders.

8:50 AM ET: Ford Motor (NYSE:F) stock fell 8.3% after forecasting that this year’s earnings before interest and taxes would fall, without giving a clear explanation why.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Royal Bank of Canada both downgraded their price targets for the stock on Wednesday, Reuters reported.
8:41 AM ET:   Snap Inc   (NYSE:SNAP) stock fell 7.3% to a three-week low after the parent company of social media network Snapchat said its net loss widened and its revenue fell short of Wall Street expectations in the fourth quarter.
The results showed the company still struggling to lure advertising dollars away from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), even though daily average users hit 218 million, up some 16% on the year.

Walt   Disney    (NYSE:DIS) stock was up 0.6%, but underperforming the S&P 500 Futures and Nasdaq 100 futures contracts, after the company reported earnings after the bell that contained both good and bad news.

The good news was that quarterly earnings per share were ahead of forecasts, while the Disney+ streaming service now has 28.6 million subscribers, up from 10 million at launch in November.
The bad news was that Disney expects the closure of its theme parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong, caused by the coronavirus outbreak, to cost it some $175 million in operating profit in the current quarter.
8:27 AM ET: Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) stock fell 2.8% after the streaming company said it swung to an operating loss in the fourth quarter, despite a better-than-expected 29% rise in premium subscribers, who generate almost all of its revenue.
Revenue was some 2% below forecasts, and the company’s guidance for first-quarter revenue at around $1.81 billion was also some 5% below consensus forecasts, reflecting – among other things – some aggressive discounting to gain new subscribers in the face of increasing competition from the likes of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).
8:15 AM ET: Merck (NYSE:MRK) stock fell 1.5% after the pharma giant said it will spin off its lower-margin businesses into a new company, allowing it to focus on higher-margin, higher-cost drugs.   Pfizer   (NYSE:PFE) and GlaxoSmithKline have taken similar steps in recent months.
The future Merck will concentrate on oncology, vaccines, hospital and animal health. It expects annual cost savings of $1.5 billion by 2024 and is targeting an operating margin of over 40%.
The company’s quarterly earnings were broadly in line with expectations.
General Motors (NYSE:GM) stock rose 1.1% after the company said it swung to a net loss of $194 million in the fourth quarter due to a six-week strike that took $2.6 billion of its basic operating profit. Adjusted earnings per share also fell short of expectations at 5 cents rather than the 11c consensus.
GM said it expects adjusted EPS of between $5.75 and $6.25, while cash flow will be between $13 billion and $14.5 billion. 
GlaxoSmithKline ADRs (NYSE:GSK) were down 1.0% after the company missed quarterly earnings forecasts by a wide margin. The company also said it expects additional costs from the proposed spin-off of its consumer healthcare unit of between 600 and 700 million pounds ($780-$910 million).
GSK said it expects adjusted earning per share to fall by as much as 4% at constant exchange rates, but said it would likely keep its dividend unchanged at 80 pence a share.

688,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2020 08:34AM ET</span>",Ford shares fall 8% after disappointing 2020 profit outlook,"By Ankit Ajmera
(Reuters) - Shares of  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) fell nearly 8% on Wednesday, a day after the automaker forecast a lower profit for 2020, surprising analysts who also criticized the company's management for holding back details on the earnings shortfall.
The disappointing outlook underscores the higher costs that Ford has been spending on developing self-driving and electric cars to keep pace with pioneers like Tesla Inc (O:TSLA).
The No. 2 U.S. automaker by sales volume is far behind Tesla in the development of electric car technology. A recent rally in Tesla's shares have taken its market capitalization to $160 billion, nearly four times that of Ford's valuation, despite having sales volumes that are less than 10% of Ford.
Shares of the company were down 7.6% at $8.47 in premarket trading.
Ford forecast 2020 adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) between $5.6 billion and $6.6 billion, largely below at the midpoint, compared with $6.4 billion in 2019.
""It's not clear to us exactly what is driving the profit lower...The lack of transparency is not likely to sit well with investors or inspire confidence,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak said, lowering target price on the stock to $9 from $10.
Ford also warned of lower profits at its credit arm and higher warranty costs, but did not provide details.
""Management declined to quantify the impact of the higher warranty, making it difficult to gauge at the moment how much or when costs should normalize lower,"" said J.P. Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman, cutting price target by a $1 to $9.
""The 2020 guidance makes it hard for us to see why investors should get excited about owning Ford stock now,"" Morningstar analyst David Whiston wrote in a note.
While 2021 looks promising for Ford due to its 2020 new product investment, ""investors are likely to sit out"" until the company is able to show ""sustainable"" improvement in its profit, Spak said.
Ford's adjusted EBIT has fallen for at least two consecutive years. The company's stock rose about 5% in the past 12 months, underperforming a 21% increase in the S&P 500 index (SPX).
Ford's larger rival General Motors Co (N:GM) on Wednesday forecast flat profits for 2020, as it kicked off a new effort to win over investors stampeding into shares of Tesla."

LONDON (Reuters) - Climate protesters forced  BP  (L:BP) to temporarily shut down its London headquarters on Wednesday, the first day in office for the oil and gas company's new CEO Bernard Looney.
BP said more than 100 Greenpeace activists attempted to place 500 solar panels in front of BP's building in St James' Square (NYSE:SQ) in central London, and blocked the entrances with oil barrels.
Police said they had arrested nine people after the protest.
Greenpeace spokesman Stefano Gelmini said several activists had chained themselves to the oil barrels.
BP said Chief Executive Looney, who was visiting staff in Germany on Wednesday, shared the ""deep concerns"" of the climate protesters and understood their frustration and anger.
The 49-year-old Irishman will set out his vision for BP's response to the low carbon energy transition in a speech next week where he is expected to unveil deeper commitments to reduce the company's carbon emissions.
BP said Looney ""hopes that what he has to say then will give people a sense that we get it and are very serious about working to address the problem.""
BP has faced growing pressure from climate activists and investors to meet to the 2015 Paris climate goals to battle climate change.
In a letter published in the Financial Times on Wednesday, Greenpeace UK Executive Director John Sauven urged Looney to ""immediately end investments in new oil and gas exploration, and set out a plan to transition BP to renewable energy by the end of the decade.""
BP, which reported a $10 billion profit in 2019, invested around $500 million in renewables and low-carbon technology out of a total capital spending of more than $15 billion last year."
690,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 05, 2020 07:54AM ET</span>",A $5 Billion Offering Tests Appetite for Slimmed-Down Petrobras,"(Bloomberg) -- Petroleo Brasileiro Petrobras SA (NYSE:PBR) is starting this decade much the same way it started the last: with a highly anticipated share sale. The similarities end there.
Back in 2010, Petrobras was a booming oil powerhouse with ambitions to more than double output and cement its monopoly on a massive offshore oil discovery. In 2020, it is a scandal-scarred company that never came close to hitting its end-of-the-decade production target. Ten years ago, Brazil’s government used a record-breaking share offering to increase its stake. Now, the national development bank known as BNDES is unloading Petrobras stock as both the government and the state-run oil producer slim down.
BNDES will sell as much as 734.2 million voting shares, including over-allotments, in a secondary offering set to be priced after markets close today. The shares, equal to almost 10% of the company’s voting stock, are worth as much as 22.6 billion reais ($5.3 billion) based on Tuesday’s closing price of 30.75 reais apiece. It’s the biggest share sale in Brazil since Petrobras’s $70 billion offering in 2010.
While the hype around the company may have quieted down since then, some portfolio managers argue it’s now a much target for investment. Cash from operations has almost doubled, even as Petrobras shed assets, and the producer is no longer bleeding money by subsidizing the domestic price of gasoline. Voting shares trade at about 10.5 times estimated earnings, compared with a multiple of about 8.5 in 2010.
“It’s a very different moment for Petrobras,” said Andre Ribeiro, who helps oversee 8 billion reais ($1.9 billion) in assets at equity fund Brasil Capital.
Under Chief Executive Officer Roberto Castello Branco, Petrobras has sold assets including operations in Africa and exited businesses such as fertilizers. It’s part of his mission to shore up the balance sheet and focus on ultra deep-water oil fields discovered in 2006 that sit under a thick layer of salt.
“Back then, the market was willing to write the company a blank check to invest billions of dollars in what was essentially a crapshoot,” Ribeiro said. “Today, we know the pre-salt is profitable and that exploration costs are among the most competitive in the world. The company has unloaded debt, and more divestments are coming.”
Of course the company faces headwinds as well. Oil is trading at the lowest price in a year amid fears the lethal coronavirus will imperil demand. And global investors are increasingly seeking out companies with good environmental, social and governance credentials, which are often tough metrics for oil producers. BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), the world’s biggest investment firm, with $7.4 trillion in assets, has said it plans to make emissions a fundamental consideration in its investments.
The BNDES offering, which is being led by   Credit Suisse   (SIX:CSGN) Group (NYSE:CS), is part of a deluge of state asset sales that are expected to reach 150 billion reais by year-end. Privatizations are central to the government’s economic agenda, which is aimed at slashing debt, bolstering fiscal accounts and fueling growth. Today’s sale doesn’t change the government’s control of Petrobras.
Anticipation of the share sale has prompted some investors to sit on the sidelines in recent weeks, said Fernando Fontoura, a fund manager who helps oversee 310 million reais at Persevera Asset Management in Sao Paulo. Petrobras’s voting shares are down 3.9% since the start of the year, compared with a 0.1% drop for Brazil’s benchmark Ibovespa index.
“Investors know they will probably be able to buy the stock at a discount,” Fontoura said. “All eyes are on the offering.”
Alpha Key Capital Management’s Christian Keleti is among managers that have been converting holdings into cash to have money on hand for upcoming Brazilian equity offerings, including Petrobras.
“We’ve been reducing exposure to Brazil equities and piling up cash,” he said. “It’s not only because some stocks have become more expensive, but also because February will be a strong month in terms of offerings.”"

DOHA (Reuters) - The coronavirus epidemic will have a only a marginal impact on global travel demand and the airline industry is healthy enough to absorb any economic slowdown in China, the chief executive of British Airways parent IAG (L:ICAG) said on Wednesday.
Dozens of airlines have suspended flights to China in response to the worsening health emergency that has killed close to 500, nearly all in the country, while a meeting of international aviation officials in Singapore was cancelled. 
""The aviation industry is very robust. We may see some marginal impact,"" IAG CEO Willie Walsh told reporters in Doha at a CAPA aviation summit. 
British Airways has suspended flights between London Heathrow and Beijing and Shanghai, which Walsh said represented around 1% of the airline's capacity. 
There had been no impact on the group's other airlines, including Ireland's Aer Lingus and Spain's Iberia, as they do not fly to China.
Walsh, who steps down in March, said he did not expect the virus to deter people from travelling. Asked if the industry was healthy enough to absorb a downturn in China's economy, he said: ""without question"" adding that airlines were more capable of responding to economic shocks than in the past.
Qatar Airways, which owns a minority stake in IAG, has also cancelled passenger flights to China, though its chief executive said that was because other countries had placed entry restrictions on those who had recently visited China.
Akbar al-Baker said that made it difficult to staff China flights because those staff would not be able to operate flights to some other countries for some time afterwards.
A global airline lobby, the International Air Transport Association said it was too early to say how much the virus would impact the industry this year but is confident of a recovery.

""This industry has demonstrated its ability to overcome these type of difficult events and overcome them successfully,"" Chief Executive Alexandre de Juniac told Reuters.

692,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2020 07:41AM ET</span>",Exclusive: HSBC to axe senior managers in strategy shift - sources,"By Sumeet Chatterjee and Lawrence White
HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC (L:HSBA) is set to unveil a new round of job cuts targeting senior international managers and reduce its presence in some smaller markets as part of a wider strategy overhaul, people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The changes are expected to be part of a strategy update interim Chief Executive Noel Quinn will unveil on Feb. 18 with a view to boosting the profitability of Europe's biggest bank by assets in a tough operating environment, the people said.
Quinn's bid to restructure HSBC comes amid slowing economic growth in its major markets, an outbreak of the fast-spreading coronavirus, Britain's protracted withdrawal from the European Union, and lower interest rates.
While it was not clear how many jobs would go, the people said the planned move would mainly hit operations in London and to a lesser extent in Asia, which contributes nearly 90% of the bank's profits.
The review will look at HSBC's presence in some Latin American markets, the sources said, a region that accounts for just 3% of its pre-tax profit. Apart from Mexico, its presence in other countries in the region such as Argentina is small.
HSBC declined to comment.
The bank's target to cut costs and simplify its notoriously complicated management setup is expected to focus on slashing a large number of global managerial roles across all business units - from investment to commercial banking, the people said.
The people spoke to Reuters on the condition of anonymity as they were not authorised by the bank to speak with the media. 
HSBC has global managers looking after a wide variety of functions for most of the product lines within its business divisions. Those senior managers are backed by a string of administrative and other support staff.
""More than cost-cutting, the idea is to make the structure at the top a bit leaner and give more decision-making powers to the regional managers who are closer to the clients,"" said one of the people who is aware of the internal strategy discussions.
After Reuters reported the strategy shift on Wednesday, HSBC said it had appointed Stephen Moss as regional chief executive for Europe, the Middle East, Latin America and Canada, bringing regions previously managed separately under his responsibility.
HSBC also said Nuno Matos would be appointed chief executive of Europe, replacing James Emmett who will leave the bank in September.
'UPSETTING' REPORTS
Most of the senior bankers in the firing line will be leaving over the next few weeks, the people said.
HSBC had 237,685 staff at end of June 2019, an increase of 2,468 over the same period a year ago. 
Chief Financial Officer Ewen Stevenson said in August the bank would cut about 4,000 jobs in 2019 to reduce costs. It has not yet published figures showing how many jobs went last year.
Analysts expect HSBC to report pre-tax profit for 2019 of about $20 billion on Feb.18, in line with the $19.9 billion profit in 2018. 
In an internal email this week, HSBC told its staff there would be reports in the media ahead of its strategy and results announcements which it said could be ""upsetting"" and that it would not comment on them. 
Quinn, who is tipped by HSBC insiders to get the CEO role full-time, talked in October about the need to ""remodel"" the bank after dropping its profitability target for 2020 altogether and reporting a sharp fall in earnings.
HSBC ousted John Flint as chief executive in August after just 18 months in a shock move the bank's chairman said was needed to speed up progress on priority areas such as the turnaround of its U.S. business.
While the London-headquartered bank has benefited from billions of dollars of investment in Asia, mainly in China, over the last few years, a sluggish performance in Europe and the United States has weighed on its returns.
In his strategy update, Quinn is likely to unveil plans to boost HSBC's profit outside Asia - including a review of some of its markets producing only low returns - while reiterating HSBC's commitment to invest more in China, the sources said.

HSBC is considering pulling out of Turkey and is also seeking to sell or reduce its business in other markets such as Armenia, Greece and Oman where it is struggling to compete with local rivals, Reuters reported last week.

693,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 05, 2020 07:27AM ET</span>","‘Everything Is Accelerating’ in the Climate Fight, Billionaire Investor Warns","(Bloomberg) -- More than a year ago, legendary investor Jeremy Grantham announced he was devoting almost his entire fortune, more than $1 billion, to the fight against climate change.
Humanity is in the “race of our lives,” he warned, a terrifying competition between the Earth’s rising temperatures and the many ways people are responding to the crisis. Since then, the race has only sped up, the 81-year-old co-founder of Grantham Mayo Van Otterloo (GMO) now says.
“Everything is accelerating,” Grantham said in an interview at Bloomberg’s New York headquarters. “The disasters are terrible, one ugly event after another, and they seem to be happening quicker and quicker,” he said. He called the recent fires in Australia “apocalyptic.”  
But also, he said, there is progress in combating such an overwhelming problem. “The technology is just amazing. One pleasant surprise after another,” he said, noting that innovations like electric cars and lab-grown food are transforming energy, agriculture and other fields.
Grantham, who predicted the tech bubble and financial crisis, discussed how the climate race is rapidly altering the world’s economic and investing future. 
What’s your reaction to Larry Fink’s vow that BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), the world’s largest asset manager, will make climate change a priority?I say, “Brilliant well done, Larry.” That was necessary and incredibly welcome and may set a good example. And now we know you can bark loudly. Can you bite? And will you perhaps think about having your giant index funds vote a little greener? They're right at the bottom of the list. Legal & General in the U.K. is way at the top of the list, and  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) is not so bad, and right at the bottom is BlackRock. So they can do better. You're not going to lose business in the index business because you become a little greener in how you cast your proxies. It's the one area I can think of where there's no real cost to either the buyer or the seller.
What’s been holding back companies and investors from doing more?
Capitalism has this strange ability to kind of paralyze the altruistic part of humans. So at the weekends, they’re altruistic, they love their grandchildren. Then during the week they take on the character of the corporation whose only job description, says Milton Friedman, is to maximize short term profits. If a human being does nothing except maximize their self interest, they're a sociopath. That's how it's defined. So during the week you behave like a sociopath and as if you have no grandchildren—or as if you hate the ones you have. And then at the weekend you become a loving grandfather again. That is apparently what capitalism does to us, based on the evidence.You’ve argued that investors should sell oil and gas investments. What does it mean if more investors start to divest?
Divestment is not an economic issue in terms of how it affects the oil companies. The economic impact is for the person who is dumping the stock. He is getting out of an industry that has been put on notice that they're going out of business. 
In the last 10 years they're up 5% or 10% and the S&P 500 has tripled. It has been absolutely awful and I am proud to say that for those 10 years I've been saying, “Don't buy oil stocks.” Forget the ethics for a second. It's a bad economic idea. Going forward, if they rolled with the punches and they tried to redesign their business as an energy provider—rather than oil—they could do okay and get a decent return.
But they fight it. If you want to lose money in a capitalist system, that is how you do it. You underestimate the forces you're dealing with. 
Which of the major oil and gas companies has the most potential to pivot?
The Europeans are always thinking greener thoughts, and longer-term thoughts, than their American brothers. The Americans have not been good at this stuff. They have held us back at least 10 years. Without that push back, we would be perhaps a leader in this field and life would be quite different.
The long term goal is to make them a pariah industry. It took us 20 years on tobacco. Until they were pariahs, politicians would not take a bite out of them. They had misrepresented the dangers of their product. They knew it was causing cancer, et cetera, and they denied it. Energy companies knew that oil was a dangerous product and they obfuscated it. It will take us a while, but they have to become pariahs.
What would you do about investments in the chemical industry?
I think chemicals are about to engage in a war of a thousand cuts. Plastics will get banned. The growth rate will become negative within five years, if not sooner. Sometimes these flashpoints are very rapid. Pesticides will be banned in enlightened countries and their health will immediately improve. Europeans already ban lots of chemicals. We do not. 
When you sit down with foundations, endowments and other institutional investors, how have their attitudes shifted on climate change?
When I gave my first climate change talk at a GMO annual conference dinner 10 years ago, there was, to say the least, some eye-rolling. A few people who were visibly upset.
This 10 years has been a revolution in a typical group of clients. They've begun to realize they have to take it into account, that it has portfolio implications. And the last two years has seen an acceleration in that, as the general public has gotten more involved in Europe and North America, particularly last year. Things are beginning to happen much faster.
Why aren’t college and university endowments divesting from fossil fuel stocks?
I've spoken to over 1,000 investment committees, and they are the most conservative organizations on the planet. And that is the reason that almost all of the universities have had problems divesting, although they're now beginning to.
But at the top end, what about MIT, Harvard and so on? They receive hundreds of millions of good research dollars to do perfectly good, valuable research—from the oil industry. One of the leading university's leading people said to us—and I'm sure she'd be happy to deny it—“we simply can't afford to step away.” I'm mildly sympathetic. You can do a lot of terrific research for $200 million. You wouldn't lightly walk away from it, would you? But having said that, you're still bought. You sold out for a high price, but you're still bought."

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to post strong gains Wednesday, helped by reports of a breakthrough in the fight to combat China’s coronavirus outbreak. The continuing earnings season on Wall Street will also generate attention, with General Motors (NYSE:GM) looking to avoid replicating Ford's slump after the bell on Tuesday.
At 7:00 AM ET (1200 GMT), futures for the S&P 500 traded 23 points, or 0.7%, higher, futures for the Nasdaq 100 up 77 points, or 0.8%, while the Dow Jones 30 futures contract rose 210 points, or 0.7%. 
Earlier Wednesday, reports emerged that a Chinese university had found a drug to treat people with the new coronavirus, while researchers in the U.K. said they had made a ""significant breakthrough"" in finding a vaccine. Neither has apparently been tested yet.
These reports have not been verified, but they add to the more positive tone started by China’s central bank trimming interest rates and injecting billions of yuan of liquidity into the markets.
The coronavirus continues to claim victims, as the mainland China death toll increased to 494, while confirmed cases rose to 24,598. But it looks like the pace of the spread is slowing, and it’s still the Hubei province, where the virus was first noticed, that has suffered the vast majority of fatalities.
Away from virus concerns, attention is set to turn to those companies reporting earnings during the day.
Walt   Disney   (NYSE:DIS) impressed after reporting after hours Tuesday that the number of subscribers to its new streaming service more than doubled in its first three months, to over 28 million. However, it said operating profit could take a hit of $175 million in the current quarter due to the closure of its theme parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong.
On the flip side, Ford’s shares slumped more than 10% after hours after the car manufacturer posted a $1.7 billion quarterly loss and issued a lower-than-expected profit outlook for 2020. 
Rival General Motors (NYSE:GM) is due to report before the bell, with analysts expecting earnings of 1 cent a share on sales of $31.3 billion.
Staying with autos, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock could be due a retracement Wednesday after heady gains so far this week. It soared another 14% Tuesday, up 36% in just the past two sessions and 180% in the past three months. 
The spotlight will also be on eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) Wednesday, after the Wall Street Journal reported that Intercontinental Exchange, the owner of the NYSE, has made a takeover offer for the online marketplace that could value it at more than $30 billion.
Merck reported fourth quarter earnings that beat analysts' forecasts but the focus is likely to be on news that the pharmaceuticals giant is set to spin off its slow-growth products into a new company.
ADP's nonfarm employment release is due at 08:15 AM ET (1315 GMT), ahead of Friday’s key official employment report. Also of note is the ISM non-manufacturing PMI number for January at 10:00 AM ET (1500 GMT).
In the oil markets, crude futures recovered strongly Wednesday, up from the one-year lows they hit on Tuesday, helped a little by a smaller-than-expected rise in U.S. inventories reported by the American Petroleum Institute. Eyes will now turn to the release of the official inventories number at 1030 AM ET (1530 GMT).
AT 07:00 AM ET (1200 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 2.3% higher at $50.77 and the international benchmark Brent contract rose 2.5% to $55.31."

The AirAsia X committee will comprise non-executive members of the board excluding Kamarudin Meranun and Tony Fernandes, who are co-founders of its parent company AirAsia Group (KL:AIRA), the filing with the Bursa Malaysia (KL:BMYS) said.
AirAsia Group said on Monday it had also set up a committee to review the allegations and that CEO Fernandes and Chairman Kamarudin would step aside for at least two months while the airline and authorities investigate the allegations.
Fernandes and Kamarudin have denied any wrongdoing.
Britain's SFO on Friday alleged that planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR) paid a bribe of $50 million to executives linked to AirAsia and AirAsia X to win plane orders.
The SFO said Airbus sponsored a sports team owned by AirAsia executives while negotiating airplane orders.

""Airbus is constantly evaluating the situation and monitoring any potential knock-on effects to production and deliveries and will try to mitigate via alternative plans where necessary.""
Industry sources said the Tianjin plant had been closed along with many businesses over the Chinese New Year but was due to reopen at the end of January. 
The reopening has been suspended due to the virus outbreak hitting the logistics involved in keeping the line open.

Tianjin is one of two Airbus aircraft final assembly lines outside Europe, alongside a sister plant in Mobile, Alabama.

698,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 05, 2020 06:31AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Wednesday, 5th February","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Stock markets jump on tentative reports of progress in developing drugs to fight the coronavirus, whose impact continues to reverberate as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Hon Hai warns of a hit to production. Pete Buttigeig wins in Iowa while President Trump and Speaker Pelosi trade insults at the State of the Union speech. The ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) payrolls report for January is due, along with the ISM's non-manufacturing survey. And NYSE owner ICE (NYSE:ICE) confirms it looked at a bid for eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), while General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) head another long list of earnings Wednesday. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, 5th February.
1. Coronavirus toll nears 500; markets grasp at news of drug progress
The death toll from the coronavirus reached 493, another rise of over 16% on the previous day, but more than twice as many people infected by the disease have now recovered. Fatal cases remain highly concentrated in the Hubei region around Wuhan, where the outbreak originated.
Markets in Europe picked up on reports of progress by lab researchers with drugs aimed at treating the disease, while an institute in Wuhan applied for a patent on an antiviral drug developed by Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD), threatening to revive U.S.-China tensions over intellectual property.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Hon Hai revised down its sales outlook for the year citing the virus, while Disney said it expects the closure of its theme parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong to hit operating profits by a combined $175 million.
2. Stocks, oil set for higher opening on virus optimism
U.S. stock markets are set for another strong opening, helped by more solid gains in Asia and Europe overnight, which in turn reflected the Chinese central bank’s liquidity measures this week and the – still somewhat speculative - reports of progress in finding drugs to treat the coronavirus.
By 6:30 AM ET (1130 GMT), Dow 30 futures were up 264 points or 0.9%, while S&P 500 futures were up 0.9% and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 1.0%.
In China, the Shanghai Composite had ended up 1.3% while in Europe, the Stoxx 600 was up 1.1%.
Crude oil futures had rebounded overnight after dipping below $50 for the first time in a year. U.S. crude futures were up 2.9% at $51.06 a barrel, while gold futures were flat at $1,556.15 and the U.S. 10-Year benchmark Treasury yielded 1.64%, up three basis points from late Tuesday. 
The bounce in crude is set to be tested by the release of government inventory data at 10:30 AM ET (1530 GMT).
3. GM earnings in focus after Ford slumps; ICE-eBay tie-up also eyed
Earnings seasons grinds on, with the focus Wednesday falling on General Motors after Ford Motor slumped 10% in after-hours trading on the back of a gloomy outlook for 2020. Ford’s figures made for an interesting counterpoint to the wild, but volatile, surge in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock on Tuesday amid signs that the company’s valuation had lost all relation to any realistic development in sales and profit in the near term.
Also reporting in the course of the day are pharma giant Merck, Humana, Boston Scientific , Spotify and Metlife. Qualcomm completes day's action after the bell.
Another stock likely to be in focus Wednesday is Intercontinental Exchange Group. ICE (NYSE:ICE), which owns the New York Stock Exchange, confirmed late on Tuesday it had offered to buy struggllng online marketplace eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), in a radical departure for a group which has so far concentrated only on wholesale financial markets. ICE stock, which fell 7.5% on Tuesday on initial reports of talks, recovered 0.8% in after-hours trading as it emerged that no talks were currently in progress.
4. ADP's report to trail Friday payrolls ballyhoo
ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) will update the market on the U.S. private-sector labor market, amid expectations of a slowdown in hiring at the start of the year after the December numbers surged to a seven-month high.
Analysts polled by Investing.com expect a gain of 156,000 in what is widely seen as the dress rehearsal for the broader government report on payrolls on Friday. The report is due at 8:15 AM ET. 
Economic data around the world were mixed: China’s service-sector purchasing managers index fell short of expectations, while the same index in the euro zone outperformed, pushing the composite PMI to a five-month high of 51.3. The ISM’s survey of non-manufacturing activity will be released at 10 AM ET.
5. Buttigeig wins in Iowa as Washington theatricals intensify
Pete Buttigeig emerged as the winner of the Democratic Party’s Iowa caucuses, with Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders a close second and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren a respectable third. Former Vice-President Joe Biden trailed badly in fourth place after a lackluster campaign.
Buttigeig capitalized on the inability of Sanders and Warren to campaign more actively in the state during the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, which is expected to end today with his acquittal by a Republican-controlled Senate. 
Trump’s State of the Union address on Tuesday passed without any major policy initiatives being announced, leaving the public to focus on a theatrical exchange of insults between the President and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi."

Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. plans a quarantine of up to two weeks for any employee that returns to work at its main iPhone-making base, a precautionary measure to curb the novel coronavirus that may hurt Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).’s production.
Apple’s most important manufacturing partner still intends to officially resume work Feb. 10 after an extended Lunar New Year break intended to combat the outbreak. But Hon Hai said in a statement Wednesday that workers returning from outside Henan province, site of its main factory in Zhengzhou, will be sequestered for 14 days. Any staff reporting to work who reside within the province itself will be isolated for 7 days, the company added.
Hon Hai, known also as Foxconn, makes the vast majority of the world’s iPhones from Zhengzhou, central China. The company has become a high-profile symbol of how the outbreak, which has killed about 500 worldwide, could disrupt the world’s supply of made-in-China electronics."

The province, home to Ningbo port and the major commercial hub of Wenzhou city, has asked businesses not to resume working before February 10, a week later than central government order to extend the Lunar New year to Feb 2, in a bid to curb the spread of the epidemic.
As of Tuesday, Zhejiang province had 895 confirmed coronavirus infections, the second highest in the country after Hubei, where the epidemic was originated.
The provincial government said on Wednesday it would allow major exporting companies, listed firms, key manufacturers and profitable companies to return to work first.
""Companies should arrange rational production plans, and prevent production accidents due to overwork,"" said statements from the Zhejiang provincial government and the Ningbo city government.
Some small ports in Ningbo have been hit by vessel congestion due to a drop in the number of officials and workers processing the loading and unloading of goods.

MUNICH (Reuters) - German engineering company  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn), hit by a global slowdown in power and gas and among industrial customers, said on Wednesday it missed forecasts for first-quarter sales and profit in what its chief executive called a ""slow start to the year"".
Losses at its Gamesa wind power unit and feeble demand for large turbines in the slowdown pushed the company's industrial profit down by almost a third.
There were also problems at its flagship digital industries division, where operating profit fell by nearly a third because of weak demand from customers in the automotive and machine building sectors.
""We have had better quarters in the past,"" Chief Executive Joe Kaeser, who also faces protests by environmental protesters over a contract to supply signaling equipment to a coal mine in Australia, told reporters. 
He said the weak performance in Siemens' energy businesses ""reinforces our priorities,"" referring to the plan to spin off wind, gas and power into a separate company and list it later this year.
""For the second half of the year, we expect stabilization of the short cycle business and expect the development of financial results to go accordingly,"" he said.
Kaeser said it was too early to say what the impact of the coronavirus outbreak in China would be on Siemens. 
He said it was ""almost grotesque"" that Siemens had been singled out by environmentalists for criticism over its contract with the Adani coal mine project in Australia, and that the company would become climate neutral by 2030. 
Environmental protesters gathered outside the company's shareholder meeting, with placards bearing slogans saying ""Stop the coal mine. 
The company's shares were down 0.73% at 0921 GMT.
During the first quarter, Siemens's industrial operating profit fell 30% to 1.43 billion euros ($1.58 billion), missing analyst forecasts for 1.88 billion euros in a consensus gathered by the company.
Revenue rose slightly to 20.32 billion euros, undershooting estimates for 20.63 billion euros. 
The trains to factory software maker said its industrial operating margin, excluding severance payments, fell to 8.3% from 10.5% a year earlier. 
Gas and Power saw its operating profit plunge 63% during the first quarter, while Gamesa posted a 165 million euro loss due to project delays caused by the early onset of wintry weather in northern Europe.

Still, the company confirmed its guidance of full year earnings per share in the range of 6.30 to 7.00 euros after posting 1.33 euros during the first quarter.

703,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2020 05:28AM ET</span>","Qatar Airways in talks to buy 49% RwandAir stake, interested in increasing LATAM investment","By Alexander Cornwell
DOHA (Reuters) - Qatar Airways is in talks to buy a 49% stake in Africa's RwandAir, and is interested in doubling its holding in LATAM Airlines Group (SN:LTM) to 20%, its chief executive said on Wednesday.
A stake in an African airline would widen its reach in one of the world's fastest growing aviation regions, and potentially help it bypass restrictions imposed on it by some Arab states.
""We are very tough negotiators ... we will take our time to negotiate,"" Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar al-Baker told reporters in Doha.
Qatar Airways already owns stakes in British Airways-parent International Airlines Group (L:ICAG), China Southern (SS:600029), Cathay Pacific (HK:0293), and LATAM.
It bought some of its stakes in other airlines since once-lucrative markets the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia banned it from its airspace following a regional political dispute.
Qatar Airways has been forced to fly longer routes to avoid the blocked airspace of some of its neighbors.
The ban does not apply to non-Qatari airlines flying to Qatar. RwandAir could potentially carry passengers from Africa over the blocked airspace to the state-owned airline's Doha hub without any airspace restrictions.
RwandAir could not be immediately reached for comment.
Qatar Airways agreed in December to take a 60% stake in a new airport in Rwanda.
Baker, one of aviation's most well-know executives, also said the airline could be interested in increasing its holding in LATAM, and working with fellow shareholder Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL).
""When the right opportunity comes and at the right price we will look at increasing our investment in LATAM,"" he told Reuters.
Qatar Airways, which holds a 10% stake, would be interested in having a stake that is the ""same like Delta,"" which is 20%, he said.
Delta surprised the industry when it announced in September it was taking a $1.9 billion 20% stake in the South American airline group.
Qatar Airways has historically had a contentious relationship with Delta and other major U.S. carriers, which have accused Gulf airlines of receiving unfair government subsidies, distorting competition and costing Americans jobs. The Gulf carriers have rejected such accusations.
However, Baker said had no ill-feeling towards Delta, and was willing to work with the U.S. airline at its hub in Atlanta.
""We can transfer passengers on each other. We are the only Middle Eastern carrier going into their hub so there is huge opportunity,"" he said.
Qatar Airways has also expressed interest in taking a stake in India's IndiGo and Morocco's Royal Air Maroc. A transaction with either airline has yet to take place."
704,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 05, 2020 05:19AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Markets Surge on Hints of Virus Drugs; Smurfit, Vestas Soar","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Stock markets pushed sharply higher on Wednesday on the back of reports that scientists in China and Europe had made significant breakthroughs in developing drugs to treat the novel coronavirus outbreak.
Business surveys showing that better-than-expected levels of activity in the eurozone economy aslo helped: strong services readings helped IHS Markit's eurozone composite purchasing managers' index to its highest level in five months, the increase to 51.3 beating forecasts for an unchanged reading of 50.9.
The news came as a relief to markets that had been pricing in a sharp drop in Chinese economic output at least in the first quarter of this year, along with the threat of reverberations throughout the world economy. 
China accounts for nearly 20% of world gross domestic product, and the implications of the outbreak on Chinese demand have sent the prices of commodities such as oil and copper into freefall, a fall that had only been broken by large-scale liquidity injections by the Chinese central bank earlier in the week.
By 5:15 AM ET (1015 GMT), the benchmark Stoxx 600 index was up 1.0% at 422.58. The German DAX was up 1.1% while the FTSE 100 was up 0.7%. All three were off earlier highs as the initial spike in response to the news faded.
One of the reports was sourced to Sky News, which claimed a team of researchers at Imperial College London would begin testing a quickly-developed drug on animals next week. Reuters also sourced a Chinese television report saying that researchers in Zhejiang had developed a drug capable of treating the coronavirus effectively. However, those claims weren’t visible on any international editions of Chinese state media.
On Tuesday, a research institute had applied for a local patent on the antiviral drug remdesivir developed by Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD), which has also been used with success on coronavirus patients in the U.S. The drug hasn’t yet received approval from U.S. regulators, however.
The news rather overshadowed a flood of earnings from Europe’s blue-chips on Wednesday, which were a mixed bag. Siemens, a traditional bellwether for European manufacturing, underperformed with a 1.0% rise after reporting a slump in margins across all of its businesses, while chipmaker Infineon surged 8.0% after reporting a better-than-expected fourth-quarter report and upbeat guidance.
Elsewhere, packaging companies Smurfit Kappa (LON:SKG) and DS Smith (LON:SMDS) led the FTSE 100 higher with gains of 7.4% and 5.7% respectively, after the Irish-based company raised its dividend on the back of strong earnings at the end of last year. The two companies are riding a wave of enthusiasm for sustainable investment, capitalizing on the shift in public opinion away from plastic packaging to cardboard.
Wind turbine maker   Vestas Wind   Systems A/S (CSE:VWS), another company in the Green space, also surged 3.5% in Copenhagen after forecasting another three years of steady growth, in which it expects the rising share of services in its sales mix to offset declining margins in its biggest division, the manufacture of onshore turbines.
British Airways parent IAG (LON:ICAG) also surged 7.6% after underperforming in recent days on fears around the coronavirus’ impact on the travel sector."

One Metro bank customer was subject to U.S. sanctions on Cuba, while another received payments from Iran, the bank said.
The Evening Standard newspaper reported on Tuesday that Metro Bank appointed law firm DLA Piper to conduct the review, which will look into how the lender's internal controls were breached.
DLA Piper did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Metro Bank declined to comment.
The bank notified U.S. regulators in 2017 about the sanctions breaches, according to a prospectus it released in September while raising funds.
Metro could face a fine proportional to the amount of money handled.
The disclosures follow a turbulent period for Metro Bank, after a major accounting error disclosed last January triggered a share price crash and the departure of its chairman and chief executive.
Metro Bank shares have fallen 90% since it disclosed the problems."

PETAH TIKVA, Israel(Reuters) -  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) is investing heavily in ""smart buildings"" in Israel that will be full of perks to keep employees happy, helping the U.S. chipmaker compete for the country's top professionals. 
Intel, one of the biggest employers and exporters in Israel, plans to invest $11 billion to build a manufacturing facility in the country, where some of its most advanced technologies have been hatched. 
Home to more startups per capita than any other nation thanks to its advanced military and government support, Israel is suffering from a shortage of talent. 
While multinationals like Intel, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) have snapped up local startups and set up research centers, competition is making it tough to find skilled workers. 
Tech companies in Israel were unable to fill about 17,000 positions in 2018, according to Start-Up National Central, a nonprofit research organization, and that figure continues to climb. 
To address this gap and lure talent, Intel has upped the ante at its new development center in the Tel Aviv suburb of Petah Tikva. Replete with environmentally friendly systems, a smart gym, massage parlor, the structure also has 14,000 sensors that monitor motion, light and air to make sure workers are comfortable. 
If these efforts give Intel an edge in hiring, rival companies are expected to follow suit. 
""Anything you offer as a perk, whether it's a gym membership or a paperless work environment or additional days for maternity leave or a go-green policy, all of these things are going to help you,"" said David Gantshar, chief executive of California-based Shepherd Search Group. 
Intel's box-shaped, 10-story building is covered in glass and will accommodate up to 2,700 of its local 13,000 workforce. 
The company declined to comment on how much it spent on the development center. Israeli media reported a cost of 650 million shekels ($188 million). 
David Hareli, deputy CEO of  Afcon Holdings  (TA:AFHL), which constructed the building, said it was a challenge to finish the project within Intel's three-year timetable. 
Originally designed to be seven stories high, Intel asked to add three floors. Once the contract was signed, Intel asked for LEED Platinum certification, the highest standard of green construction, rather than the lesser gold level. 
This required a double-skin facade to improve ventilation and prevent the building from heating up under the strong Middle Eastern sun. 
Architect Dagan Mochli, who designed the building, said he was working on a new development center for Intel in the northern city of Haifa that will also be smart and LEED Platinum. 
He called Intel's building a ""breakthrough,"" with demand growing among clients for similar structures. He is planning a smart 15,000-square-meter banking campus in Israel as well as a 240,000-square-meter smart biotech park in China.
SMART TRAVEL 
The building has an open-space format. An atrium in the center is roofed by skylights, and caps the five top floors. Health-conscious employees often use the internal stairs in the atrium instead of the elevator. 
For those seeking seclusion, there are small soundproof rooms and noise-insulated armchairs near the windows. 
The 14,000 sensors - twice the number found in similar buildings, according to company officials - detect when someone enters a room and adjust the lighting and air conditioning. 
For example, when carbon dioxide levels rise, fresh air is introduced to keep people energetic.
The sensors and corresponding app can also help employees find the best way to travel to and from work and let them know which of the building's three restaurants has room during lunch. The app lets workers alert other staff as to their whereabouts. 
Not everybody was excited about the new workspace. Some employees anonymously complained on an Israeli news website about a lack of privacy. 
Intel Israel CEO Yaniv Garty said the tracking and collection of data is on an opt-in basis. 
""We don't ask people to clock in or clock out. We believe in a relationship which is based on output,"" Garty said. 
Ido Melamed, a hardware engineer who has worked at Intel for 16 years, moved to the new building from an office with cubicles. He said the benefits outweigh the disadvantages. 
""We see each other, we can talk more openly and collaborate more effectively,"" Melamed said. ""There is real trust between the company and employees that the data (collected) is used for the right purposes.""

Investing.com - European stock markets pushed higher Wednesday, overturning a weaker open, helped by a positive tone in Asia overnight and some solid corporate guidance and economic data in Europe.
At 09:10 ET (0910 GMT), the U.K.'s FTSE index was trading 42 points, or 0.6%, higher, France's CAC 40 was up 35 points, or 0.6%, while the DAX gained 93 points, or 0.7%. The Euro Stoxx 50 index, which measures the movement of blue chip stocks in the eurozone, rose 21 points, or 0.6%.
Infineon Technologies (DE:IFXGn) helped the tone, with shares in the German semiconductor manufacturer climbing over 5% after it reported in-line results in the seasonally weak first quarter and confirmed its full-year outlook.
Shares in Smurfit Kappa (LON:SKG), one of Europe's leading packaging company, rose 5.8% after issuing a solid update.
Vodafone's (LON:VOD) shares climbed over 2% after the U.K. telecoms giant reported continued organic service revenue growth in its third quarter, while stating that it is preparing for a potential initial public offering of its towers business in early 2021.
On the flip side, shares in   Siemens   (DE:SIEGn) dropped 0,8% after reporting weaker-than-expected profit during its first quarter as the industrial downturn hit its flagship digital industries business and its wind power unit suffered losses.
Also, tobacco giant Imperial Brands (LON:IMB) slumped almost 10% after issuing a profit warning amid a global crackdown on e-cigarettes, particularly in the U.S.
Helping the tone in Europe additionally was the release of better than expected sentiment from the region’s businesses. 
The eurozone Composite Purchasing Managers' Index for January 2020 came in at 51.3, a report published by IHS Markit on Wednesday showed. This compares with the flash estimate of 50.9 and December's index which was also 50.9. Eyes will now turn to the retail sales numbers for the euro zone at 05:00 AM ET (1000 GMT).
Overnight the blue-chip Shanghai Composite index posted modest gains, closing 1.3% higher, helped by the decision of the People's Bank of China to pump hundreds of billions of dollars into the financial system this week to keep rates from rising and restore confidence.
On Wall Street, the spotlight could be on eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) Wednesday, after the Wall Street Journal reported that Intercontinental Exchange, the owner of the NYSE, has made a takeover offer for the online marketplace that could value it at more than $30 billion.
Late Tuesday, Walt   Disney   (NYSE:DIS) impressed after reporting strong growth in the number of subscribers to its new streaming service, while Ford (NYSE:F) and Macy’s (NYSE:M) disappointed.

Fixed income, currency and commodity trading revenue jumped to 820 million euros ($905 million) in the final three months of the year, way ahead of its lackluster earnings a year earlier, though falling short of the $1 billion generated in the third quarter. The results place BNP ahead of European rivals  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) and UBS Group, and in line with earnings at some of the biggest U.S. banks including  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
Chief Executive Officer Jean-Laurent Bonnafe is overseeing a revival of the bank’s trading performance after slashing costs and downgrading revenue and profitability targets a year ago. That came after the bank lost money on index derivatives hedging and because of “extreme market movements” at the end of 2018.
Still, the Paris-based bank joined European rivals in paring back some of its targets at a time when prolonged negative rates are eating into lending margins. The bank introduced a 10% return on tangible equity target for 2020, dropping a previous and slightly higher target, though the newer figure is still more ambitious than many rivals.
FICC benefited from “very strong growth across all segments” BNP said, highlighting rates, foreign exchange and credit. That helped BNP’s global markets unit -- its key trading division -- more than double revenue from a year earlier. Equity and prime services revenue increased to 520 million from a “low base” of 145 million euros a year earlier.
BNP’s corporate and investment bank is well positioned for 2020 after gaining market share in its key businesses last year, Chief Financial Officer Lars Machenil said in a Bloomberg TV interview. “International financial services remains the engine of growth,” he said.
For 2020, the bank targets business growth in all its operating divisions and a decrease in the absolute value of its operating expenses.
Overall, revenue rose 11.5% in the quarter to 11.3 billion euros, ahead of estimates and outpacing a 4.6% increase in costs in what is known as positive jaws effect. The bank’s common equity Tier 1 ratio, a measure of financial strength, further increased by 10 basis points to 12.1% at the end of the year from the third quarter. Net income rose 8.6% in the quarter to 1.85 billion euros, slightly missing the average analyst estimate of 1.88 billion euros.
As part of the measures announced a year ago, Bonnafe pledged an additional 600 million euros in cost cuts to weather a trading slump. The bank is targeting about 3.3 billion euros of expense reductions by 2020. Results at the end of 2018 had been particularly difficult, when the bank lost about $80 million on derivatives trades linked to the U.S. stock market.
The French bank is past halfway through its 2020 cost plan, but has so far stayed clear of suggesting any big job-cutting plans like those at Parisian rival  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA or the thousands of planned reductions at Deutsche Bank. Instead, BNP’s moves have included outsourcing equity research in Asia to Morningstar Inc. The bank said Wednesday that it plans to generate additional recurring savings of 1.5 billion euros in 2020.
BNP’s performance in FICC trading last quarter puts it near the middle of the pack compared with Wall Street Peers.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) led the gains after seeing revenue more than double, while JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) posted an 86% jump. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) had one of the lowest increases, with a 25% jump in revenue.
BNP Paribas is targeting its spending to win clients in countries such as the U.S., the U.K. and especially Deutsche Bank’s backyard, Germany, where the mass of small and medium-sized companies have traditionally been the backbone of its export-oriented powerhouse economy."

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Jefferies Group LLC ratcheted up its rivalry with brokerage CLSA, announcing it will host a new annual investor meeting that will be held around the same time and in the same venue this year as the Hong Kong firm's own popular yearly forum.
The U.S.-based investment bank and brokerage has poached more than 50 staff in the past year from CLSA including long-time CEO Jonathan Slone as well as research analysts across Asia-Pacific including top-ranked analyst Christopher Wood.
The inaugural Jefferies Asia Forum will be held in Hong Kong during Sept. 14-17 at the Grand Hyatt hotel, the bank said in a statement on Wednesday, adding Jefferies research analysts will present their investment themes and ideas at the event.
CLSA has been holding a week-long forum in the city for 26 years, which is famous among bankers, top company executives, and investors for its partying and celebrity speakers.
Celebrities including George Clooney, David Beckham and former adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump, Steve Bannon, have participated in the CLSA event in recent years. Music performances at its parties have included those from Kylie Minogue, Katy Perry and Jessie J.
In 15 of those 26 years, CLSA has used mid-September for the event which includes hundreds of investor and executive meetings as well as a full agenda of on-stage sessions. The Grand Hyatt has been the venue for at least eight of those.
Jefferies [JGLL.UL] has been working on plans to host an annual forum to boost its brand visibility and compete with CLSA to grab a bigger share of the brokerage business in Asia soon after hiring Slone and other senior bankers in the middle of last year, a person with knowledge of the matter said.
The U.S. brokerage did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for further details.
A CLSA spokeswoman declined to comment.
Last year Slone, Wood, and a host of other CLSA bankers, including its Chairman Tang Zhenyi, left the brokerage, which was bought by Chinese brokerage CITIC Securities (SS:600030) in 2013 for $1.3 billion.
The resignations resulted from CITIC's efforts to revamp CLSA's daily operations and from differences over strategy, people with direct knowledge of the matter said at the time.
Jefferies said the forum presented an opportunity to press ahead with the next phase of its long-term investment in the region.
""We are particularly pleased to have been able to attract nearly 300 additional Jefferies employees to the region over the past two years to help us better serve our clients in the decades ahead,"" it said in the statement.
Jefferies' stepped-up Asia expansion comes at a time when some investment banks are looking to reduce costs in the cut-throat businesses of equities sales, trading and research in the region."

BEIJING (Reuters) - General Motors (N:GM) is backtracking on an aggressive promotion of three-cylinder engines in China that saw some Buick and Chevrolet models offered only in that option - a move which proved highly unpopular and helped sales slide, people familiar with matter said.
Three-cylinder gasoline engines are cleaner and more fuel efficient than their conventional four-cylinder counterparts, and automakers are keen to promote them, particularly in China which has some of the world's most stringent fuel economy and emission rules.
GM went further than competitors, discontinuing four-cylinder versions for many models in the world's largest auto market. By comparison, Honda Motor Co (T:7267) and BMW (DE:BMWG) also offer three-cylinder cars in China but the models are an option in addition to four-cylinder versions.
Many Chinese consumers, however, perceive cars with three-cylinder engines as noisier and prone to vibrating, and sales began to tumble in third quarter of 2018. Last year, GM's China sales fell 15% to 3.09 million vehicles, its second straight year of steep declines and the lowest level since 2012.
The move was ""too quick, too radical and lacked sophisticated planning,"" a senior Shanghai-based sales manager at a Buick dealership told Reuters.
The sales manager, who was not authorized to speak to media and declined to be identified, said his company was among hundreds of dealers which lobbied GM to change the plan at dealer conferences.
By resurrecting four-cylinder options for key models, the hope is that GM, which reports fourth-quarter earnings later on Wednesday, can regain some of the ground it has lost at a time when the new coronavirus is threatening to sink sales in the first quarter.
The outbreak is only adding to pain caused by to a slowing economy, U.S.-China trade tensions, new emission rules as well as fierce competition from Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p).
SAIC-GM, the Detroit automaker's main venture with SAIC Motor (SS:600104), is seeking approval for four cylinder versions of two mass-market sedans, Buick's Excelle GT and Chevrolet's Cruze, government documents show.
Those two versions are slated to hit the market sometime in the second quarter, two people with knowledge of the matter said, adding that four-cylinder versions of the Buick Verano sedan and Encore GX sport utility vehicle were also under consideration.
A Shanghai-based GM spokeswoman said the automaker will continue to offer three- and four-cylinder engines in the future but declined to comment on product plans."
722,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2020 01:21AM ET</span>","U.S. to review new curbs on Huawei, China in Feb. meeting: sources","By Alexandra Alper and Karen Freifeld
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration plans to meet this month to discuss further curbing technology exports to China and its flagship telecoms company Huawei, two sources said, in a bid to resolve differences within the government over the possible crackdown.
The gathering, currently scheduled for Feb. 28, will bring together high level officials for talks after the U.S. Commerce Department withdrew a rule aimed at further reducing foreign shipments to Huawei Technologies amid pushback from the Defense Department, one of the people said. 
The meeting, which is expected to include cabinet-level officials including Commerce Department Secretary Wilbur Ross, Defense Secretary Mark Esper and State Department Secretary Mike Pompeo, is aimed at addressing how best to approach the blacklisted Chinese company and the broader war with China over technological dominance. 
Some U.S. policymakers favor close trade ties with Beijing while others see China and Huawei, the world's largest telecoms equipment maker, as serious threats to national security.
""The administration has to decide how to match its rhetoric on China with policies to deny China key technology and industry,"" said Tim Morrison, a former senior director at the White House's National Security Council under President Donald Trump, who favors tougher rules. 
""Too many tools have not been brought to the President because the entire administration isn't yet in the fight. That must end,"" he added.
U.S. companies have argued the measures that have been floated would harm U.S. business by driving customers to foreign competitors, while doing little to thwart Huawei.
The agencies did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Commerce Department in May placed Huawei on a trade blacklist, citing national security concerns. That allowed the U.S. government to restrict sales of American-made goods to the company and a small number of items made abroad that contain U.S. technology.
Under current regulations, key foreign supply chains remain beyond the reach of U.S. authorities, which fueled frustration among China hawks and prompted a push to expand U.S. authority to block more shipments to Huawei.
But a draft rule by the Commerce Department to expand its authority to block more shipments to Huawei - first reported by Reuters in November - was stymied by opposition from the Pentagon last month over concerns about harm to U.S. interests. The Treasury Department also pushed back against the measure, sources said. 
In an unusual move, Commerce withdrew the rule from the inter-agency review process, pending a meeting of principals to resolve differences.
The gathering comes amid a deepening tech war between the United States and China. The Trump administration is trying to keep sensitive technologies that could be used to harm American interests beyond the reach of Beijing, by cracking down on exports and limiting Chinese investment in key U.S. sectors. 
Reuters reported in December that the Commerce Department was finalizing rules to limit tech exports to adversaries while the Treasury Department has issued new rules to beef up scrutiny of foreign investment in the United States.

725,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 05, 2020 12:41AM ET</span>",U.S. Crackdown on Chinese Stocks Hasn’t Been Ruled Out Yet,"(Bloomberg) -- There is a sense in the upper echelons of Wall Street that discussions within the Trump administration about limiting Americans’ investment in Chinese companies will ultimately lead to nothing.
One top bank executive after another said so when asked in private conversations in Davos last month. The signals they’re getting from administration officials are in part, they say, a result of their lobbying efforts to squelch the idea as something that will only add to market volatility and curb their ability to expand in China.
And yet, many top Trump aides continue to discuss both privately and publicly the possibility of imposing such restrictions -- as part of their effort to protect investors and press Beijing to adhere to U.S. rules even after an initial trade pact was signed between the world’s two biggest economies in January. Larry Kudlow, the White House economic adviser, is among them, saying in a recent interview that multiple government agencies are actively studying the matter.
“We’ve looked at a lot of things,” Kudlow said. “We just haven’t come up with any concrete policies, but it’s an inter-agency study.”
Of course, there’s no certainty in those comments that action will be taken, especially from an administration that is known to be erratic in its policy implementation. It’s also true that, given all the concern today about how the coronavirus outbreak will hamstring the economy in China and across the globe, the threat of U.S. restrictions on Chinese investments is far from the most pressing concern on Wall Street.
Legislative Push
Still, the possible crackdown on investment flows remains a major issue.
In Congress, Senator Marco Rubio continues to lead the legislative push to examine the implications of more U.S. investor money going into Chinese stocks and bonds. Last month, a Congressional commission heard a full day of testimony from experts on “China’s Quest for Capital.”
“There is a growing bipartisan consensus in Congress that the financial relationship between the U.S. and China deserves increased scrutiny – particularly how the Chinese Communist Party exploits American capital markets and transparency rules,” said Rubio, a Florida Republican. “While I hope the administration will take action, it is clear that Congress must act to hold Beijing accountable for their malign activities that put U.S. retail investors and pensioners at risk.”
Rubio has sponsored a number of bills on the issue including one that would prevent a government retirement fund from investing in some Chinese companies and another that could block some Chinese stocks from trading on U.S. exchanges if they don’t comply with U.S. auditing rules.
Kudlow said the administration is pursuing its own plan apart from lawmakers like Rubio, even as there is “some confluence” between their demands and what the White House is asking for. He said the effort isn’t “aimed only or directly at China” and added that the White House never intended to delist Chinese companies from U.S. exchanges.
Goldman Report
After reports late last year that the administration was discussing ways to limit U.S. investors’ portfolio flows into Chinese companies, Wall Street firms plotted worst-case scenarios. Researchers at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). issued an analysis in October on the risk of restrictions, which estimated U.S. investors held about $785 billion of Chinese equities as of September.
The report also highlighted the potential impact to the market for initial public offerings -- a key source of profit for banks as well as private equity, venture and asset management funds. The U.S. market has been one of the three most common destinations for Chinese companies raising capital, the Goldman analysis said.
When the U.S. and China signed an initial trade deal last month, much of Wall Street turned its attention back to Beijing’s promise to further open its financial markets and away from any threat of restrictions to them.
The trade agreement accelerates efforts to make it easier for U.S. banks to operate in China, stipulating that Beijing will remove foreign ownership caps for securities firms in April. Global investment banks have previously faced hurdles to expanding their businesses in the Asian nation. The country’s laws required foreign firms do local securities business through joint ventures with Chinese partners, who kept controlling stakes.

“Right now the administration has little interest in antagonizing the Chinese in ways that could jeopardize the phase-one purchasing pledges, and coronavirus pressures only add to that,” said Leland Miller, chief executive officer of the China Beige Book. “Even so, the idea of prohibiting government pension money from funding Chinese companies, especially ones with close connections to the military, makes for a remarkably attractive political lever. If the White House starts feeling heat on China in the run-up to the election, we could see this idea suddenly resurface.”"

Shares in China rose 1.66% while stocks in Hong Kong climbed 0.52%.
Oil prices bounced by around 1% on hopes for more output cuts from OPEC and its allies but sentiment remained weak on worries about a long-term dent in demand for energy and other commodities.

Euro Stoxx 50 futures were down 0.19%, German DAX futures were down 0.04%, while FTSE futures were down 0.29% in a sign European equities are poised for a cautious start to trading.
China and other countries have imposed travel restrictions to try to contain a new virus that emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, slamming the breaks on manufacturing and tourism in the world's second-largest economy.
Many investors argue that any slowdown will be temporary and that Chinese policy steps are reason to remain optimistic about the growth outlook, but so far public health officials have not found a way to stop the spread of the virus both inside and outside of China.
""We're going to have a strong day in Asia, but whether this is the reversal of a downtrend remains to be seen,"" said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's wine export growth slowed last year and could take another hit in 2020 from the coronavirus outbreak if China, its biggest market, orders fewer crates, a report by an industry body said on Wednesday.
The virus, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has severely impacted food and beverage businesses in mainland China with many global companies including McDonald's (N:MCD) and  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) temporarily shutting stores in the country as a precaution.
""Looking ahead into 2020, we anticipate that coronavirus will have an impact on sales, particularly to China, but at this stage it is difficult to predict the degree of that impact,"" said industry body Wine Australia in its 2019 export report.
Australia's total global wine exports rose just 3% to A$2.91 billion ($1.96 billion) in 2019, compared with 10% growth recorded in 2018, the report said.
Wine exports to China, which is Australia's top market by value, rose 12% to A$1.3 billion last year although the pace of growth slowed from 18% recorded in 2018.
The total value of wine exports was the second highest for a calendar year, however, the volume fell for the first time in seven years, the report showed.
""The volume of exports was down, with the decline heavily weighted toward lower price segments,"" Wine Australia Chief Executive Officer Andreas Clark said.
""The lower vintages in 2018 and 2019, together with lower inventory levels, meant that there was less wine available for export in 2019.""
On Jan. 29, Australia's biggest winemaker  Treasury Wine Estates Ltd  (AX:TWE), which generates a significant portion of its sales from exports to China, said it was too early to say what the effects of coronavirus would be. However, it cut its 2020 earnings outlook citing weakness in its U.S. operations."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's biennial auto show that kicks-off this week is set to be dominated by Chinese automakers showcasing cutting-edge electric vehicles and connected cars - but with booths staffed only by Indian employees and representatives.
With the death toll from a new coronavirus outbreak in China nearing 500 and cases of the disease spreading across the globe, organizers of the show are reassuring visitors that officials arriving from China will not be in attendance.
""There will be no visitors or delegations from China at the Motor Show 2020,"" Rajan Wadhera, president of Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) - which is organizing the show - said in a statement on Tuesday.
Chinese companies have confirmed their booths would be staffed by Indian representatives or employees, he said.
Chinese automakers SAIC Motor Corp Ltd, Great Wall Motor Co Ltd and FAW Haima are set to showcase cars including electric vehicles, while over 300 Chinese autoparts companies are also due to participate.
With India this week identifying a third positive case of the virus in the country, SIAM has also printed advisories for visitors and set up an on-site first aid facility in partnership with a local hospital.
The Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India (ACMA), which is organizing a parallel exhibition for autoparts companies, late on Tuesday said visitors from China would not be attending and that displays of some 30 Chinese exhibitors would be staffed by Indian representatives as a precaution.
Chinese auto firms have been working to woo Indian buyers with internet connected cars, filling a breach left by Western and Japanese manufacturers including Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, Honda Motor Co Ltd and Nissan Motor Co Ltd, which will not participate in this year's show.
They also hope India's market can help combat slowing sales in China, which fell 8% in 2019 and are set to decline again in 2020.
Suzuki Motor Corp and Hyundai Motor Co have long dominated India's market with low-priced compact cars, and have in recent years expanded into other categories.
Chinese automakers do not plan to compete in the entry-level segment, instead appealing to drivers with in-car technology, safety features and clean energy vehicles.
Great Wall, which is making its India debut at the show, intended to bring over 100 delegates but all have canceled, including the president, a local executive said.
""The first and most important thing is the safety of people. Once this situation is taken care of, our senior executives will come to India,"" said Director of Marketing and Sales Hardeep Brar."

Investing.com -   Hyundai Motor   (KS:005380) said it would halt its production in South Korea as the coronavirus crisis has disrupted part of the company's supply chain in China.
Despite the news, the company’s shares traded 1.2% higher to 125,500 KRW by 11:20 PM ET (03:20 GMT). 
“Hyundai and Kia may be more affected as they tend to import more parts from China than other global automakers,” said Lee Hang-koo, senior researcher at the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics & Trade, in a Reuters report. 
Production in Hyundai’s seven factories in South Korea accounts for about 40% of the company’s global output, the article said.
Hyundai, along with other global automakers including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Honda, have already extended factory closures in China under government guidelines.

Hon Hai, which makes the vast majority of the world’s iPhones from the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou, is now projecting a sales increase of 1% to 3% this year, Chairman Young Liu told Bloomberg News in a text message. That’s down from a Jan. 22 forecast of 3% to 5%, before the epidemic spread around the globe, and lags the 5.4% average of analysts’ projections.
The contagion is expected to disrupt Apple’s carefully calibrated production chain centered on China, while also dampening consumer demand and overall economic growth. Hon Hai, an important manufacturer also for major brands from HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ). to Sony Corp (T:6758)., said Tuesday it still expects to be able to restart facilities throughout China on schedule, according to a text message sent to Bloomberg News. Suppliers such as Quanta Computer Inc., Inventec Corp. and LG Display Co. also said they would go back to work next week in China.
Read more: Apple Suppliers Aim to Resume Full China Production Feb. 10
But while Chinese officials and companies have targeted Feb. 10 as the date to resume work in much of the country, doubts about the timing have grown in recent days as the virus death toll rises, workers find themselves stuck in municipal lockdowns and the transport of people and goods has been hampered.
”Given current market conditions, we are lowering to 1%-3%,” Liu replied when asked about whether Hon Hai will cut its original sales growth forecast for this year.
Hon Hai’s shares stood largely unchanged Wednesday after having slid about 11% since a broader Asian market selloff began in mid-January.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
Hon Hai’s lower 2020 sales growth outlook of 1-3% vs. 3-5% just a week ago likely reflects the severity of disruption to its operations from the coronavirus outbreak, in our view. The NT$111 billion reduction in sales at the midpoint of the range vs. the prior midpoint is equivalent to one week of revenue, accounting for the extended factory shutdown imposed by the Chinese government.

FRANKFURT/SEOUL (Reuters) - Major air cargo carriers said they have no immediate plans to add China flights to replace the capacity lost amid steep cuts to passenger travel due to the coronavirus, as many factories have remained shut down after the Lunar New Year.
Aviation data firm OAG said there would be more than 25,000 fewer flights operated to, from and within China this week compared with two weeks ago, with 30 airlines halting services.
About half of the air cargo carried globally is in the belly of passenger jets rather than in dedicated freighters, and the flight cuts have made the Chinese market more dependent on freight haulers.
But a spokesman for Germany's Lufthansa Cargo (DE:LHAG) said it had reduced its flying schedule, in part to allow pilots to spend the night in Novosibirsk, Russia, rather than in China. Demand from China to Germany fell because of the production shutdown, the spokesman said.
The Lunar New Year holiday has been effectively extended by 10 days in many parts of China, including powerhouse regions such as Shandong province and the cities of Suzhou and Shanghai.
The shutdown represents a fresh challenge to an air freight market that was already weak before the coronavirus epidemic. Global demand fell year-on-year for 13 consecutive months through November 2019 amid slowing economic growth and the U.S.-China trade war, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA).
""If you're ordering people to stay in their houses it's difficult to keep factories running,"" Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska said. ""Many supply chains are essentially halted, so there's nothing to transport.""
Air cargo represents less than 1% of global trade by tonnage. But that amounts to about $6 trillion worth of goods every year - more than 35% of global trade by value, according to data from  Boeing Co  (N:BA), the biggest manufacturer of freighters.
 Korean Air Lines Co  Ltd (KS:003490) said a fall in Chinese events and meetings due to the coronavirus and related storage and transportation shortages had led to a decline in fresh food shipments, such as lobster and salmon.
""On the other hand, Chinese transport and request of medical supplies such as masks and cleaning agents is increasing,"" the airline said in a statement.
A spokeswoman at Japanese airline ANA Holdings Inc (T:9202) also reported rising demand for medical supplies such as surgical masks although shipments of other goods had been delayed.
Once most Chinese factories resume production, dedicated cargo carriers like  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS), FedEx Corp (N:FDX) and DHL are likely to be the biggest beneficiaries of any surge in demand, said Helane Becker, an analyst at Cowen.
""Obviously the lack of belly space means everything goes on main deck,"" she said, in reference to how cargo is carried in passenger planes compared with freighter aircraft."

NEW YORK/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Lawyers for  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) last week re-interviewed a former bank executive who said the Swiss lender had her followed in New York, according to a person familiar with the matter, weeks after the company dismissed her allegation as baseless.
Credit Suisse asked lawyers from Zurich-based firm Homburger to speak again to Colleen Graham, who worked in the United States for a joint venture half owned by the bank, about her allegation that she was put under surveillance in July 2017 while in dispute with the bank, the person said.
Two Homburger lawyers met Graham in midtown Manhattan on Jan. 30 and said they had follow-up questions about her surveillance allegations, the source said.
The source declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.
Reuters could not determine why Credit Suisse questioned Graham again after saying in December it had conducted ""thorough and comprehensive internal investigations"" into Graham's allegations and found them to be ""entirely baseless"".
Graham was formerly Credit Suisse's compliance head for the Americas before being selected to co-head a joint venture called Signac. She left the bank in July 2017 after refusing to adopt its position on an accounting issue that she believed was ""mistaken"", according to court documents filed with the U.S. Department of Labor.
According to a Nov. 2017 court filing, Graham said Credit Suisse started retaliating against her in March 2017 after the accounting dispute by threatening to fire her, withholding a bonus, and withdrawing a job opportunity.
Robert Kraus, a lawyer representing Graham, confirmed the Jan. 30 meeting but said Credit Suisse's latest inquiry ""did not appear designed to uncover the truth"".
Investigators did not want to hear from her about the motives for the spying and about a pattern of related misconduct, Kraus said.
Credit Suisse and Homburger declined to comment on whether the firm's lawyers had been sent by the bank to interview Graham again.
Credit Suisse said that since 2017 Graham had brought several court actions against the bank and others in connection with her former employment and they had been dismissed.
Graham has one pending lawsuit against Credit Suisse for unlawful retaliation under the Sarbanes Oxley Act.
""We are aware that Ms Graham is preparing yet another action against Credit Suisse. As part of their investigation, Homburger has investigated Ms Graham's report that she had been followed in or around New York on behalf of Credit Suisse. Homburger found no indication that her report is true,"" it said.
Homburger said it did not comment on its investigations and noted that Credit Suisse had previously reported that, ""we did not find any indications that corroborate Ms Graham's report that she had been tailed on behalf of Credit Suisse.""
MANHATTAN
Homburger was hired in September by Credit Suisse to look into allegations the bank spied on former wealth management chief Iqbal Khan, previously one of its most senior executives.
Graham emailed Credit Suisse that month with details of her alleged surveillance and asked it to share the information with Homburger, according to the source.
She separately emailed Homburger that month and discussed the matter with a partner from the law firm on Sept 30.
On Oct. 1, Homburger released a report saying Pierre-Olivier Bouee, the bank's then chief operating officer and a top lieutenant of Thiam, had ordered surveillance on Khan to see if he was trying to poach Credit Suisse colleagues to join him at UBS. Khan had left Credit Suisse for its crosstown rival over the summer.
In the report, Homburger said ""to date, the investigation has not identified any evidence that Credit Suisse had ordered observations of other employees.""
Credit Suisse said Bouee had acted alone and Thiam was unaware of the surveillance. Bouee resigned after taking responsibility for the spying. He has not commented publicly on the scandal and Reuters could not reach him for comment.
Following the internal probe, Thiam called the spying an isolated event. But a second case emerged, when it was revealed in December that the bank had also spied on its former head of human resources, Peter Goerke.
Credit Suisse said Bouee was again to blame in what was a rogue operation.
In their Jan. 30 meeting, the two Homburger lawyers did not
discuss the state of their investigation, but asked Graham details about her alleged surveillance, such as the attire of the woman she said tailed her, and whether she alerted the police, the source said."

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's top companies are making too little progress in hiring people of color to top jobs and end ""all-white domains"" in many boardrooms, a government-backed report said on Wednesday.
The report, an updated version of a 2017 study that set deadlines for companies to improve boardroom ethnicity, gave a damning verdict of progress so far.
Britain's top 100 companies were set an end-2021 to have at least one person of color as a director. The next tier of 250 companies was given until 2024.
The latest report, again led by John Parker, used data from the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) watchdog that polices corporate governance in Britain and noted how all the companies had fared in efforts to meet the targets.
Parker said that close to a majority of boards at the top 100 companies remain ""all-white domains"" and that hopes of reaching the target look ""some way off course"".
""However, our report suggests that whilst we may not yet be up to speed, it could still be possible to complete our journey in time,"" Parker said.
Only eight companies account for nearly a quarter of directors of color, with only 15 of those directors at chairman or chief executive level across the top 350 companies, the report said.
FRC Chief Executive Jon Thompson said it was unacceptable that talented people are being excluded from succession and leadership simply because companies are failing to put appropriate policies in place.
""We will monitor closely how companies report on their policies or explain their lack of progress in this area,"" he said.
The FRC's corporate governance code was strengthened in 2018 to promote boardroom diversity in gender and in social and ethnic backgrounds.
Companies that sign up to the code are required to set out in annual reports a description of their policy on diversity, including any measurable targets that have been set.
The FRC said that more than half of Britain's top 100 listed companies provided little elaboration in their policy beyond some acknowledgement of the value of board diversity.
Only 21 specified ethnicity in director succession planning, the FRC said."

(Reuters) -  Snap Inc  (N:SNAP) missed Wall Street estimates for fourth quarter revenue on Tuesday as it faced tough competition from digital advertising giants Google and Facebook, sending its shares down 10%.
Snap, which owns the popular photo messaging app Snapchat, had earlier warned its peak advertising demand period between Black Friday and the December holidays had one fewer week this year.
Revenue, which the company generates from selling advertising on Snapchat, rose 44% to $560.88 million but missed the average analyst estimate of $563.03 million.
While Snap has invested in a self-serve platform to make it easier for advertisers to buy ad space, it is still a long way from stealing ad dollars from Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google and Facebook (O:FB), which command a huge portion of the digital advertising market.
Snapchat has only 0.5% of worldwide digital ad revenue, while Facebook accounts for 21.1%, according to a report by market researcher eMarketer.
Snap said daily active users (DAU) on Snapchat rose 4% to 218 million in the three months ended Dec. 31 from the prior quarter.
The user metric stood at 186 million a year earlier.
Snapchat rose to fame with its photo lens filters that can overlay things like dog ears on a user's face and has added mobile games and original shows to keep its audience on the app.
Snapchat's DAU, a widely watched metric by investors and advertisers, was above analysts' average estimate of 215.04 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Average revenue per user jumped 23% to $2.58 during the quarter from a year earlier.
Snap is focusing on growing the total number of advertisers on Snapchat as well as diversifying the types of advertisers it works with, said Jeremi Gorman, Snap's chief business officer, on an earnings call with analysts.
Snap's net loss widened to $240.7 million, or 17 cents per share, from $191.67 million, or 14 cents per share, a year earlier.
The company expects first-quarter revenue in the range of $450 million to $470 million. Analysts on average were expecting $461.6 million.
""Given the substantial long-term opportunities ahead, we are working hard to scale our revenue so that we are able to self-fund our investments in the future,"" Chief Executive Officer Evan Spiegel said during the call.

DEARBORN, Mich. (Reuters) - Investors sent Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co shares skidding on Tuesday after the company delivered a weaker-than-expected 2020 forecast, warning of higher warranty costs, lower profits at its credit arm and continued investments in future technology such as self-driving cars.
Shares in the No. 2 U.S. automaker plunged 9.4% in after-hours trading, shaving more than $3 billion off the company's value. In comparison, electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) closed up nearly 14%, pushing its market cap to $160 billion, more than four times the size of Ford's $36.4 billion.
""The results were not OK in 2019,"" Ford Chief Financial Officer Tim Stone told reporters at the company's headquarters outside Detroit.
""As I look to 2020 and beyond, I'm very optimistic,"" he said, while cautioning that Ford's lower guidance does not yet account for the potential impact of the coronavirus outbreak in China.
In an after-hours call with financial analysts, Chief Executive Jim Hackett was more blunt about the challenge of balancing Ford's protracted turnaround efforts with its continuing work on future technology, including electric and self-driving cars.
""I don't think this company can keep straddling the old and new worlds forever ... This company has to change,"" Hackett said.
Ford said it expects 2020 operating earnings to be in the range of 94 cents to $1.20 a share. Analysts were expecting $1.26 a share.
Stone said Ford expects to continue its quarterly dividend of 15 cents, which could cost the company $2.4 billion in 2020. Asked about continuing the dividend after lowering its 2020 guidance, Hackett said, ""We like to return value to shareholders.""
The disappointing 2020 forecast, coming after Ford previously trimmed its 2019 outlook, is a blow for Hackett, who took the helm in May 2017.
He has been asking investors to be patient with a restructuring that has seen the formation of a wide-ranging alliance on commercial, electric and autonomous vehicles with Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and the sale of its money-losing operations in India to a venture controlled by India's Mahindra & Mahindra. 
But by Ford's own accounting, the restructuring is far from complete. It has booked $3.7 billion of the projected $11 billion in charges it previously said it would take, and expects to book another $900 million to $1.4 billion this year.
For the fourth quarter of 2019, Ford reported a net loss of $1.7 billion, or 42 cents a share, compared with a loss of $100 million, or 3 cents a share, a year earlier.
The quarter included a loss of $2.2 billion due to higher contributions to its employee pension plans, something it disclosed last month. 
Revenue in the quarter fell 5% to $39.7 billion, above the $36.5 billion Wall Street had expected.
Ford's adjusted free cash flow fell 67% in the fourth quarter to $500 million, including the $600 million cost of bonuses related to a new labor deal with the United Auto Workers union. The UAW deal also played a role in driving North American automotive profit margins down to 2.8% in the fourth quarter. 
Ford said its operating losses in China last year totaled $771 million, including a loss of $207 million in the fourth quarter. It lost $1.5 billion in 2018. Ford's market share in China in the fourth quarter fell to 2% from 2.3% last year.
In December, Ford said it would halve its operating loss in 2019 and nearly halve it again in 2020, followed by further improvement in 2021.
However, that forecast was before the appearance of the fast-spreading coronavirus and its crippling effects on China's economy.
Ford's China sales fell about 15% in the fourth quarter and 26% for the year as it continued to lose ground in its second-biggest market. Ford has been struggling to revive sales in China since its business began slumping in late 2017.

Detroit rivals General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles are scheduled to report their results on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.

739,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2020 06:51PM ET</span>","Tesla rally fueled by fear of missing out, not short squeeze - investors","By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A nearly 14% gain in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's stock on Tuesday was likely sparked by investors looking to hop aboard its remarkable rally, rather than a reversal of bearish bets, an analysis of positioning dynamics showed.
While the share price has more than doubled so far this year to $887.06, the gains do not appear to have sparked a reversal of the sizeable short position in them. Short sellers aim to profit by selling borrowed shares and buying them back later at a lower price. As Tesla has rallied 36.4% over the past two days, short sellers have incurred $5.7 billion in paper losses.
Short interest, a measure of how much money is betting on the stock to go lower, has not declined nearly enough to account for the surge in trading volume for Tesla's shares, said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at financial analytics firm S3 Partners.
One factor driving the rally may be fund managers hurrying to raise their allocation of the stock, said Thomas Lee, managing partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors.
Some fund managers whose portfolios are benchmarked to the Russell 1000 and Russell 1000 Growth indexes may have avoided loading up on Tesla shares due to their volatility and subpar performance in 2019 compared to those benchmarks, he said.
""Last year, it was a name that was tough to own,"" Lee said. ""People have a lot of catching up to do.""
Some options traders are positioning for even more gains in the electric carmaker's shares.
The most active Tesla options by trading volume on Tuesday were for calls that could be exercised should Tesla's share price hit $1,000 by Friday, according to options analytics platform Trade Alert. Those options jumped tenfold to $20 on Tuesday from just $1.98 the previous day.
""It seems to me like there's rampant, crazy speculation,"" said Henry Schwartz, founder of Trade Alert.
While many investors have said the big gains in Tesla are not supported by fundamentals, few may be willing to bet against the recent rally.
""People who are trading (Tesla) on a fundamental basis are really getting hurt here,"" said Dennis Dick, proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC. ""Professionals like myself are scared to short it."""
740,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2020 06:19PM ET</span>","China virus claims second life off mainland, Macau casinos told to close","By Farah Master and Ryan Woo
HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - The coronavirus outbreak claimed its first life in Hong Kong on Tuesday, compounding the international financial centre's problems after anti-government protests, and Macau, the world's biggest gambling playground, urged casinos to shut their doors.
The victim in Hong Kong was a 39-year-old man with an underlying illness who had visited China's Wuhan city, the epicentre of the outbreak now under virtual quarantine.
It was the second death from the new coronavirus outside mainland China. A man died in the Philippines last week after visiting Wuhan, the first virus-related overseas fatality. 
State TV late on Tuesday reported 3,156 new cases in China's central Hubei province, as well as 65 new deaths, bringing the total to 479 deaths in Hubei. Wuhan is the capital of Hubei.
Thousands of medical workers in Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous region of China, held a second day of strikes to press for complete closure of borders with the mainland after three checkpoints were left open.
""We're not threatening the government, we just want to prevent the outbreak,"" said a nurse taking part in the strike.
On the financial front, global and Chinese markets rose, with both Europe and metals enjoying their best sessions of the year after Shanghai's main market lost nearly $400 billion the previous day.
But in the latest corporate hit,  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380) said it would gradually suspend production at South Korean factories because of supply chain disruptions.
Prior to the latest figures from Hubei, total infections in mainland China had climbed to 20,438. Nearly 200 cases have been reported across roughly two dozen countries, Hong Kong and Macau. 
Macau, also a special administrative region of China lying across the Pearl River estuary from Hong Kong, said it had asked all casino operators to suspend operations for two weeks to help prevent the coronavirus spreading.
Macau's chief executive, Ho Iat Seng, made the announcement as the former Portuguese colony, whose glittering casinos draw hundreds of thousands of gamblers from across the globe, reported 10 confirmed cases of the virus and imposed tight restrictions on movements in and out of the territory.
Thailand's tally of infections jumped to 25, the highest outside China, while Singapore's rose to 24.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the flu-like virus a global emergency, and experts say much is still unknown, including its mortality rate and transmission routes.
FOREIGN FEARS
Such uncertainties have spurred strong measures by some countries, offending Beijing's communist government, which has called for calm, fact-based responses instead of scaremongering. 
Australia sent hundreds of evacuees from Wuhan to an island in the Indian Ocean, while Japan confirmed about 10 cases of coronavirus among 3,700 passengers and crew aboard a cruise liner held in quarantine, TV Asahi said, citing the health ministry. 
Hong Kong has confirmed 17 cases. The territory was badly hit by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a coronavirus that emerged from China in 2002, killed almost 800 people worldwide and cost the global economy an estimated $33 billion. 
Chinese data suggests the new virus, while much more contagious, is significantly less lethal, although such numbers can evolve rapidly. 
WHO director of global hazard preparedness Sylvie Briand said most who had died or suffered severe infections were people with underlying health conditions or the elderly. 
""NOT A CATASTROPHE""
Raising the prospect of another dispute as trade frictions were easing, Beijing on Monday accused the United States of spreading panic after it announced plans to block nearly all recent foreign visitors to China.
A handful of other nations have done the same.
Britain told its citizens to leave China if they could, and Russia set up a quarantine centre in remote Siberia, where there have been two cases, for Russians evacuated from China.
With the world's second biggest economy facing increasing isolation and disruption, some economists predict world output will shrink by 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points.
White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow played down the potential impact on the United States, but said on Tuesday that China's coronavirus would delay a surge in U.S. exports to China expected from the Phase 1 trade deal that was to take effect later this month. 
MSCI's main world index (MIWD00000PUS) rose 0.5%, led by the biggest leap in commodity-focused stocks in more than three months. ""Investors are tentatively going back into risk,"" said MUFG strategist Lee Hardman.
Many airlines have stopped flights to parts of China.
A flight from Toronto to Jamaica was forced back when a Canadian man falsely announced to passengers that he had the coronavirus - and took a selfie. He was arrested.

741,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2020 06:18PM ET</span>",Boeing will not cancel CEO incentive award tied to 737 MAX return,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) told U.S. lawmakers it will not cancel an incentive award for its new chief executive tied to the return of its grounded 737 MAX despite criticism from Congress, according to a letter made public on Tuesday.
David Calhoun, who took over as Boeing chief executive last month, is receiving a $1.4 million annual salary and is eligible for long-term compensation of about $26.5 million, including a $7 million bonus if he achieves several milestones. The milestones include the return to service of the 737 MAX which was grounded in March 2019 after two fatal crashes that killed 346 people.
Boeing defended the award and noted it is subject to a new clawback policy that applies to misconduct that compromises the safety of Boeing products. It also said Calhoun must serve for multiple years to receive the award.
""We believe tying our new CEO’s incentive-based compensation to key strategic objectives, including the safe return to service of the 737 MAX, is in the best interest of our company, our workforce, and the flying public,"" Boeing government operations executive vice president Tim Keating wrote in a Jan. 23 letter to the lawmakers.
Democratic U.S. Senators Edward Markey, Richard Blumenthal and Tammy Baldwin said in a statement on Tuesday that Boeing's response was ""completely inadequate."" They added that if the planemaker ""really wants to prove it has learned its lesson about prioritizing safety over profit, then it will cancel the proposed bonus immediately and make sure there is no financial incentive for its new CEO to rush the 737 MAX back into the sky.""
Boeing rejected the suggestion that it is rushing the MAX back into service, reiterating in its letter that its best estimate is that the MAX will not be ungrounded until mid-2020 and that regulators will determine the timing.

The Cincinnati, Ohio-based company operated 867 stores according to a regulatory filing a year ago. It had 130,000 total employees at the time.
Macy's said it would close stores in ""lower tier"" malls, and explore new off-mall formats, as it looks to tackle plummeting mall traffic in the United States.
The 161-year-old department store chain has been grappling with retaining existing shoppers and attracting new ones as consumers opt for online shopping. Since 2015, it has closed more than 100 stores and cut thousands of jobs.
""We will focus our resources on the healthy parts of our business, directly address the unhealthy parts of the business and explore new revenue streams,"" Chief Executive Officer Jeff Gennette said in a statement. 
The 125 stores targeted for closure currently account for about $1.4 billion in annual sales, the company said.
Annual revenue was $24.97 billion in fiscal 2019.
The largest U.S. department store operator also said it expects annual gross cost savings of $1.5 billion by 2022, with $600 million expected in 2020. 
It forecast full-year net sales of between $23.6 billion and $23.9 billion, below analysts' average estimate of $24.36 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
""We think the pace of closures across three years is modest compared to years past,"" said CFRA analyst Camilla Yanushevsky.
Shares of the company were trading roughly flat after market close on Tuesday.
The company will host its investor day on Wednesday.

Analysts are looking for earnings of 11 cents per share on sales of about $31 billion.
In January, GM said it delivered 735,909 units in the fourth quarter, down 6.3% from the year-ago period.
After the bell, Grubhub (NYSE:GRUB) and Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) will report.
2. ADP Employment, ISM Services Arrive
The economic calendar kicks off tomorrow with jobs numbers as we get closer to the government payrolls report at the end of the week.
ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) will issue its measure of January private-sector employment activity at 8:15 AM ET (13:15 GMT).

744,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2020 05:37PM ET</span>",NYSE owner Intercontinental Exchange explores taking over eBay: sources,"By Greg Roumeliotis and Svea Herbst-Bayliss
(Reuters) - Intercontinental Exchange Inc (ICE (NYSE:ICE)), the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, has reached out to eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) to explore a potential combination with the e-commerce company, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
The acquisition would exceed $30 billion and represent a substantial departure from ICE's focus on financial markets. The move would call on its technological expertise in running markets to extract efficiencies from eBay's marketplace platform, which connects buyers and sellers of goods around the world.
ICE's interest in eBay is preliminary, and there is no certainty that a deal will be negotiated, the sources said. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the deal discussions, said ICE is not interested in eBay's classified ad unit, which eBay has been considering selling.
EBay's shares ended trading on Tuesday up 8.7% on the news to $37.41, giving it a market value of $30.4 billion. ICE shares fell 7.5% to $92.59, giving the company a market value of $51.6 billion, as investors fretted a deal could be dilutive for the stock exchange operator.
ICE and eBay declined to comment.
ICE, which also operates futures exchanges and clearing-houses, has faced pressure from U.S. regulators to freeze or reduce the fees it charges to operate financial markets, spurring it to diversify its business. 
ICE's approach rekindles debate among investors over whether eBay should be moving faster to shed its classifieds business, which advertises products and services for sale off the eBay marketplace. Earlier on Tuesday, activist shareholder Starboard Value LP once again called on eBay Inc to sell off its classifieds business, arguing the company has not made enough progress to improve shareholder value.
""To achieve the optimal outcome, we believe Classifieds must be separated, and a more comprehensive and aggressive operating plan must be put in place to drive profitable growth in the core Marketplace business,"" Starboard said in a letter to eBay's board.
EBay said it would ""review Starboard's letter and perspectives.""
EBay has been shifting focus to its advertising and payments businesses amid stiff competition in its marketplace business from Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc.
The company faced pressure last year not only from Starboard but also from hedge fund Elliott Management. In a settlement, eBay offered a board seat to Elliott's Jesse Cohn and to Matt Murphy, president and CEO of Marvell Technology, which was backed by Starboard. EBay also agreed in March to conduct a strategic review of its business and in November agreed to sell StubHub for $4.05 billion in cash.

The company is expected to provide an update this year on its classifieds business, which Elliott valued at between $8 billion and $12 billion.

Investing.com – The Nasdaq closed at record highs Tuesday, led by a surge in shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) as the electric automaker continued its drive higher following its upbeat results last week showing record deliveries.
The S&P 500 rose 1.5% to close at a record high, while the Nasdaq Composite surged 2.10% to a record. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.44%.
Tesla was soaring, but saw sharp selling just before the close. There were unconfirmed rumors of a seondary offering, but shares still ended the day 15% higher. Shares have been on fire this week, with rises showing the hallmarks of a short-covering rally.
""(M)any have attributed the ascent to short-sellers who bet against the stock and may have to cover their positions as Tesla stock leaps higher,"" Wedbush said in a note. ""Half of what we've seen is just a historic short-covering rally for the ages. That's put gasoline on the fire for the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) bull story.""
Tesla regained its position as the most-shorted stock in the U.S. at the end of January, according to data from financial-analytics firm S3 Partners.
The broader market, meanwhile, was also lifted by growing expectations that central banks will act should the outbreak of the coronavirus intensify and threaten global growth.
China introduced stimulus measures for a second-straight day in a bid to steady business lending following the rapid spread of the virus, which has killed 400 people and infected more than 20,000.
For weeks, the rapid spread of the virus had raised worries that the death toll could pick up pace, but new information suggests the death rate is not as bad as initially feared.
The coronavirus death rate was 2.1%, lower than SARS' 9.6%, according to China’s National Health Commission.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group's Vision Fund said on Tuesday that Michael Ronen, a managing partner in the United States who oversaw many of its transportation investments, had left the company.
SoftBank, one of the world's biggest tech investors, has come under pressure following the botched public debut of office-sharing startup WeWork late last year on which it had made a big bet.
Ronan, one of Vision Fund's five U.S. managing partners, had been overseeing companies like Getaround Inc, GM Cruise LLC, Flexport Inc, and Nuro, Inc for SoftBank.
The Financial Times first reported on Tuesday that Ronan was leaving the $100 billion Vision Fund after expressing concerns about ""issues"" at SoftBank. It added that the fund was also in talks with long-time SoftBank executive Ron Fisher about his future.
A SoftBank spokesman said Fisher will not be leaving the company.
Neither Ronan nor Fisher responded to requests for comment.
SoftBank was planning to launch its second Vision Fund with $108 billion, but has been unable to raise the funds needed. It has been making investments from funds earmarked by SoftBank Group for the Vision Fund 2.

(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) has hired Michael Cleary from Santander (MC:SAN) Holdings USA Inc to lead sales practices oversight and management, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters. 
A Wells Fargo spokesperson confirmed the contents of the memo, which said that in the newly created role, Clearly will develop an approach to sales practices monitoring and reporting across the company. 
Cleary will report to new Chief Operating Officer Scott Powell who joined the bank from Santander in December to focus on Wells Fargo's relationships with regulators. Powell signed the memo.
During his tenure as co-president of Santander Bank, Cleary served on the sales practices committee and worked on various regulatory compliance initiatives.
Wells Fargo has created a number of new leadership positions to address fallout of a long-standing sales practices scandal that erupted in 2016. Within the past year it has added a ""head of strategic execution and operations"" position to its operating committee to focus on compliance and created ""enterprise customer excellence"" group to organize its remediation and complaints operations. 
The San Francisco-based bank is operating under more than a dozen regulatory consent orders, including an unprecedented growth restriction on its balance sheet from the Federal Reserve until the bank proves it has fixed its risk controls. Additionally, Wells Fargo faces federal probes by the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commision and the Department of Labor.

763,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2020 03:24PM ET</span>",EU governments to review flight compensation as delays grow,"By Marine Strauss
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union will consider raising from three hours the minimum flight delay for which passengers can receive financial compensation, a move that could cut airlines' costs, according to a document seen by Reuters.
Under EU rules, travelers are entitled to up to 600 euros ($663.24) if a flight is delayed by at least three hours or canceled less than 14 days before departure. They can also receive compensation if they are denied boarding.
But some national authorities and courts have criticized the rules, saying member states struggle to process the large number of claims they receive, and airlines' compensation payments have grown because the number of delays and cancellations has risen. 
Croatia, which holds the six-month EU presidency, has proposed amending the rules on compensation for delays and cancellations at talks among EU governments on revising passengers' rights that are due to start in the coming weeks. 
The European Commission, the EU executive, submitted a revised proposal in 2013 to increase the minimum flight delay from three to five years but negotiations stalled after that.
In an informal document circulated among member states, Croatia has proposed keeping the level of compensation the same as now for passengers, but suggested increasing the minimum flight delay for which airlines must make payments.
Zagreb made the proposals ""in order to take account of the high financial burden for airlines and of the fact that delays are less and less imputable to airlines,"" the document said.
The document did not say what Croatia wanted the new minimum delay to be for passengers to claim compensation, or how long before departure flights would have to be canceled for travelers to be compensated.
The number of canceled flights in the EU increased by 70% between 2011 and 2018, while delayed flights rose by 56%, according to a study from the European Commission published last week. 
In 2018, 17.6 million passengers were affected by a cancellations and 16.5 million by a long delay. 
Any agreement among EU governments to change the rules in force since 2005 would still have to be vetted by the European Commission and the European Parliament before approval.

Investing.com – Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) missed on revenue and its stock is paying the price on Tuesday, but the weakness is unlikely too last for long, with several analysts giving the tech giant a thumbs up.
The company reported fourth-quarter results that missed revenue estimates, sending its share price 3% down. But the miss was driven by ""lower-quality"" areas like other bets, RBC said and upgraded its price target on the stock to $1,550 from $1,500.
One of the biggest surprises to come out from Google's quarterly report was the disclosure of how fast its YouTube and cloud businesses were growing.
Cloud revenue surged 53% to $32.52 billion for the quarter year on year, and YouTube rose 31%. 
While the YouTube rise was smaller than expected, some are optimistic that the platform will see growth accelerate as advertising adjusts to the new content medium.
""Search advertising remains the most effective advertising medium that exists today, based on the paid-click advertising model,"" Oppenheimer said, raising its price target on Google to $1,620 from $1,530.
Others on Wall Street said the fall in the tech giant's shares made its valuation attractive.

MUNICH (Reuters) -  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) is buying Iberdrola's (MC:IBE) stake in Siemens  Gamesa  renewable energy (MC:SGREN), the German engineering company said, as it prepares to merge the business with its own energy unit ahead of a floatation later this year.
Siemens on Tuesday approved the purchase of the Spanish utility's 8.1% stake in SGRE, at a price of 20 euros ($22.08) per share.
Siemens will pay 1.1 billion euros and will transfer the shares to its future Siemens Energy unit, combining it with its gas and power business, the Munich company said.
""Siemens Gamesa is a vital cornerstone in the new Siemens Energy portfolio in order to shape the necessary energy transition from conventional to renewable energy,"" said Siemens Chief Executive Joe Kaeser.
Siemens has recently come under fire from environmentalists after it agreed to honor a contract to supply signaling equipment to a massive coal mine project in Australia.
Kaeser said Siemens Gamesa has ""considerable potential to grow and create significant value,"" although the wind turbines business has struggled recently.
On Tuesday, it reported a net loss of 174 million euros ($192.34 million) in the three months to December, down from an 18 million euro net profit in the same period a year earlier, blaming project delays caused by the early onset of wintry weather in northern Europe.
Last week, the company formed in 2017 by a merger between Spain's Gamesa and the wind business of Germany's Siemens, cut its profitability target for the financial year 2020 for a second time in three months.

Following the acquisition of the shares Siemens Energy will hold about 67% of the voting rights at Siemens Gamesa giving it a two-thirds majority at the company’s annual general meeting. No mandatory takeover offer to SGRE’s external shareholders is planned, Siemens said.

“We’re operating with a 5% budget deficit, with a robust economy and full employment,” the head of Maverick Capital said at the Economic Club of New York on Monday. “We’re already $70,000 per man, woman and child in debt and growing that by $3,000 to $4,000 a year -- and what we’ve done to the environment.”
The U.S. budget deficit is on pace to exceed $1 trillion this fiscal year, making it the highest since the financial crisis. The federal shortfall widened to $356.6 billion in the first three months of fiscal 2020, the Treasury Department said last month, as spending rose more than revenue.
Ainslie, who started Maverick in 1993 after leaving Julian Robertson’s Tiger Management, is a value-oriented stock-picker known for investing in the technology sector. At the end of last year, Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. was the biggest U.S. equity position in his portfolio, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
While Ainslie said he expects regulators to scrutinize privacy concerns in the technology industry, he doesn’t believe the biggest firms are in danger of the most serious regulatory action. “There’s not a lot of history of successfully breaking up big companies,” he said.
Maverick, which has $9 billion in assets, gained 16.3% in its flagship fund last year, according to people familiar with the matter.

769,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 04, 2020 02:06PM ET</span>",Trump Rides Poll Bump to State of Union Before Impeachment Vote,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump will try to move past his impeachment and make a case for his re-election in Tuesday’s State of the Union address by taking credit for a strong economy, newly signed trade deals and an immigration crackdown.
Trump said he plans to deliver a “positive” speech -- boasting of his achievements in front of an audience that will include as many as five of his potential 2020 opponents. Some of Trump’s GOP allies urged him not to use his prime-time address to air grievances with Democrats over an impeachment that originated with a near party-line vote in the House and likely will end Wednesday with an acquittal in the Republican-controlled Senate.
“Why should he talk about impeachment when we have the hottest economy in history?” said Senator Mike Braun, an Indiana Republican.
One theme of Trump’s speech will be “the great American comeback” under his presidency, Marc Short, Vice President Mike Pence’s chief of staff, told reporters at the White House on Tuesday. Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley told reporters in the early afternoon that the word “impeachment” didn’t appear in a draft of the speech he had read.
It is the second straight year Trump will deliver the annual address to the nation while beset by a major political crisis. The president was forced to postpone last year’s speech due to a record-long government shutdown that stemmed from a fierce battle with congressional Democrats over his demand for money to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.
This year’s speech comes a day after the Iowa caucuses, the first contest in the race for the Democratic nomination for president. The initial results of the caucus, which was plagued by technical problems, are due out just hours before the speech. Trump has sought to elbow Democrats out of the limelight by holding rallies in the region and sending surrogates to campaign in the state.
Highest Approval
The president plans to address the economy and trade deals with China, Canada and Mexico, a senior administration official said in a briefing for reporters, which would echo key themes from campaign rallies. He’ll also discuss his efforts to crack down on illegal immigration and lower prescription drug prices. The official asked not to be identified as a condition for participation in the briefing.
Trump was greeted with good news the morning of the speech when the Gallup poll announced that his approval rating had reached 49%, his highest ever in the survey. He has chalked up a series of accomplishments in the last month, including the killing of a top Iranian general the U.S. government considered a terrorist, the signing of a “phase one” trade deal with China and congressional approval of his revision of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The White House published a list of official guests for the speech that include a black family from Philadelphia that has sought to move their daughter out of a “low-performing” public school and two black men who have benefited from the “Opportunity Zone” program created by Trump’s 2017 tax overhaul. A former Venezuelan police chief will also attend as Trump’s guest, as a symbol of his effort to depose the government of the country’s embattled president, Nicolas Maduro.
The guests also include the family of a soldier killed in Iraq by a roadside bomb the White House says was supplied by the Iranian general, Qassem Soleimani. Two other guests -- the brother of a man killed by an undocumented immigrant and the deputy chief of the Border Patrol, Raul Ortiz -- will serve to reinforce Trump’s continuing immigration crackdown.
A family with a daughter who was born at less than 22 weeks gestation suggests Trump will again call for abortion to be banned after the 20th week of pregnancy, continuing his recent appeals to evangelical Christian supporters.
‘Head-on’ Guy
Trump has sought to motivate his supporters and raise money by railing against Democrats over impeachment. But the administration official didn’t say whether Trump plans to bring it up in the speech.
“There’s plenty to talk about and it’s an opportunity to move on,” said Senator Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican. “But the other option is to address it head-on and he often is a head-on kind of guy.”
Trump must also decide whether to invite Democrats to work with him to pass legislation in the coming months. The president on Sunday said impeachment makes it difficult to work with the Democratic leaders, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.
“I’d like to, but it’s pretty hard when you think about it because it’s been such -- I use the word ‘witch hunt,’ I use the word ‘hoax,’” Trump said in an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity.
The address is expected to be relatively light on new policy announcements, a tacit acknowledgment of how difficult bipartisan cooperation will be in an election year.
White House officials have been drafting the speech for weeks, though the official said the president has the final say and that last minute changes could be made.
White House senior adviser Stephen Miller and Joe Grogan, director of the Domestic Policy Council, both traveled with the president to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, last weekend to work on the speech, according to a person familiar with the matter. The person asked not to be identified discussing Trump’s preparations for the speech.
Trump’s acquittal in the impeachment trial became all but guaranteed on Friday after senators voted against having witnesses to testify about the president’s alleged effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a top contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, and his son Hunter, over their dealings in the Eastern European country.
Partisan Rift
The outcome has left members of both parties even more divided, with Democrats accusing Republican senators of conducting an unfair trial by blocking witnesses and documents. Several Republicans have said while they don’t condone Trump’s conduct, they also do not view it as impeachable.
Several Democrats who are vying for their party’s presidential nomination to run against Trump are lawmakers and could be present in the House chamber for his address. They include Senator Elizabeth Warren, Senator Amy Klobuchar, Senator Michael Bennet and Representative Tulsi Gabbard.
Past presidents have made a call for unity in their addresses to the nation. Trump used his 2019 State of the Union to inflate his economic achievements and tout numbers that didn’t match up with official data.
Polls show the economy is a bright spot for the president. A Washington Post/ABC News poll released late last month showed 56% of Americans approve of the president’s handling of the economy, up 10 percentage points since September to a high for Trump’s presidency.
In his Sunday interview, Trump said low unemployment and declining poverty among racial and ethnic minorities has created a “positive revolution.”
“I don’t know how anybody could possibly beat me with that vote,” he said.
Trump will attribute the strong economic indicators to “phase one” of a trade deal with China and a revamped trade pact with Mexico and Canada, the official said, as well as other initiatives.
Trump will make specific requests for Congress to act on health care, according to the official. Trump has long spoken about working with congressional Democrats to lower the price of prescription drugs, but the two sides have disagreed on how to achieve that goal.
The White House last year threatened to veto a House-passed proposal that would require the government to negotiate drug prices for Medicare and other insurance plans. It has thrown its support behind a bipartisan Senate bill that also has little chance of becoming law."

The White House published a list of official guests for the speech that include a black family from Philadelphia that has sought to move their daughter out of a “low-performing” public school and two black men who have benefited from the “Opportunity Zone” program created by Trump’s 2017 tax overhaul. A former Venezuelan police chief will also attend as Trump’s guest, as a symbol of his effort to depose the government of the country’s embattled president, Nicolas Maduro.
The guests also include the family of a soldier killed in Iraq by a roadside bomb the White House says was supplied by the Iranian general, Qassem Soleimani. Two other guests -- the brother of a man killed by an undocumented immigrant and the deputy chief of the Border Patrol, Raul Ortiz -- will serve to reinforce Trump’s continuing immigration crackdown.
A family with a daughter who was born at less than 22 weeks gestation suggests Trump will again call for abortion to be banned after the 20th week of pregnancy, continuing his recent appeals to evangelical Christian supporters.
‘Head-on’ Guy
Trump has sought to motivate his supporters and raise money by railing against Democrats over impeachment. But the administration official didn’t say whether Trump plans to bring it up in the speech.
“There’s plenty to talk about and it’s an opportunity to move on,” said Senator Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican. “But the other option is to address it head-on and he often is a head-on kind of guy.”
Trump must also decide whether to invite Democrats to work with him to pass legislation in the coming months. The president on Sunday said impeachment makes it difficult to work with the Democratic leaders, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.
“I’d like to, but it’s pretty hard when you think about it because it’s been such -- I use the word ‘witch hunt,’ I use the word ‘hoax,’” Trump said in an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity.
The address is expected to be relatively light on new policy announcements, a tacit acknowledgment of how difficult bipartisan cooperation will be in an election year.
White House officials have been drafting the speech for weeks, though the official said the president has the final say and that last minute changes could be made.
White House senior adviser Stephen Miller and Joe Grogan, director of the Domestic Policy Council, both traveled with the president to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, last weekend to work on the speech, according to a person familiar with the matter. The person asked not to be identified discussing Trump’s preparations for the speech.
Trump’s acquittal in the impeachment trial became all but guaranteed on Friday after senators voted against having witnesses to testify about the president’s alleged effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a top contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, and his son Hunter, over their dealings in the Eastern European country.
Partisan Rift
The outcome has left members of both parties even more divided, with Democrats accusing Republican senators of conducting an unfair trial by blocking witnesses and documents. Several Republicans have said while they don’t condone Trump’s conduct, they also do not view it as impeachable.
Several Democrats who are vying for their party’s presidential nomination to run against Trump are lawmakers and could be present in the House chamber for his address. They include Senator Elizabeth Warren, Senator Amy Klobuchar, Senator Michael Bennet and Representative Tulsi Gabbard.
Past presidents have made a call for unity in their addresses to the nation. Trump used his 2019 State of the Union to inflate his economic achievements and tout numbers that didn’t match up with official data.
Polls show the economy is a bright spot for the president. A Washington Post/ABC News poll released late last month showed 56% of Americans approve of the president’s handling of the economy, up 10 percentage points since September to a high for Trump’s presidency.
In his Sunday interview, Trump said low unemployment and declining poverty among racial and ethnic minorities has created a “positive revolution.”
“I don’t know how anybody could possibly beat me with that vote,” he said.
Trump will attribute the strong economic indicators to “phase one” of a trade deal with China and a revamped trade pact with Mexico and Canada, the official said, as well as other initiatives.
Trump will make specific requests for Congress to act on health care, according to the official. Trump has long spoken about working with congressional Democrats to lower the price of prescription drugs, but the two sides have disagreed on how to achieve that goal.
The White House last year threatened to veto a House-passed proposal that would require the government to negotiate drug prices for Medicare and other insurance plans. It has thrown its support behind a bipartisan Senate bill that also has little chance of becoming law."

773,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2020 01:37PM ET</span>",Shale pioneer John Hess says key U.S. fields starting to plateau,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Shale pioneer John Hess said on Tuesday that key U.S. shale fields are starting to plateau, calling shale ""important but not the next Saudi Arabia.""
Over the past decade, the shale revolution turned the United States into the world's largest crude producer and a force in energy exports. Yet that did not translate to higher stock prices or returns for investors, with the S&P 500 Energy sector only gaining 6% in a decade, far less than the 180% return for the broader stock market.
Companies remain under pressure to trim budgets and produce enough free cash flow to pay investors higher dividends or buy back shares. The biggest industry challenge is the lack of long-term investment, Hess said.
Production in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas is starting to plateau, while the Bakken field in North Dakota where Hess is a major producer will hit its peak production levels within the next two years, said Hess, who spoke Tuesday in Houston at the Argus Americas Crude Summit.
The Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field in Texas and New Mexico, will plateau in mid-decade and is already facing well interference issues, Hess said.
That means the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will continue to act as the ""Federal Reserve of oil,"" he said.
Hess plans to use cash flow from the Bakken to invest in longer-term offshore investments. The company is relying on offshore Guyana, one of the world's most important oil and gas discoveries in the last decade, which is being developed by a consortium led by oil major  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM).
In the Bakken, Hess said the company expects to reach 200,000 barrels per day of production next year. It would then sideline two of its six drilling rigs in the field for several years to hold production steady.
In the short term, ""the oil market is awash in oil right now, in part because of panic created by the coronavirus,"" Hess said. ""It's a major headwind.""
The industry also has to respond to the threat of climate change, Hess said.
""Climate change is real,"" he said, ""but how do we deal with it?"" The world will need technological breakthroughs and faces the dual challenge of needing to ""decarbonize liquid fuel and make the electric grid stable when it's dependent on intermittent renewable energy,"" he added."
774,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2020 01:31PM ET</span>",White House adviser says China virus to delay U.S. export surge from trade deal,"By David Lawder and Makini Brice
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House's top economic adviser said on Tuesday that China's coronavirus would delay a surge in U.S. exports to China expected from the Phase 1 trade deal that was to take effect later this month.
Larry Kudlow, in an interview with Fox Business Network, said the virus, which has virtually shut down many Chinese factories and cities and cut off much travel in and out of China, would not have a catastrophic effect on business supply chains.
His comments marked the first time a Trump administration official has said that the fast-spreading virus would hamper China's ability to increase purchases of U.S. goods and services by $200 billion over two years, at least in the near term.
""It is true the trade deal, the Phase 1 trade deal, the export boom from that trade deal will take longer because of the Chinese virus. That is true,"" Kudlow said.
The Phase 1 agreement, signed on Jan. 15 and taking effect on Feb. 15, suspended a new round of U.S. tariffs in exchange for the Chinese purchases of agricultural, energy and manufactured goods and services. It also included reforms aimed at improving intellectual property rights and curbing the forced transfer of American technology to Chinese firms.
The deal envisioned that China would increase purchases by $76 billion in the first year and $123 billion in the second year, above a 2017 baseline of imports from the United States.
The text of the agreement has a disaster clause that could be invoked, but how any delays could be resolved is not specified.
""In the event that a natural disaster or other unforeseeable event outside the control of the parties delays a Party from timely complying with its obligations under this Agreement, the Parties shall consult with each other,"" the text reads. 
The number of cases and deaths from the novel coronavirus has shown little sign of slowing - total cases have now surpassed 20,000 - spurring the United States to evacuate some of its citizens from China, issue a travel warning, and impose quarantines and a partial travel ban. Beijing has criticized the measures as unnecessarily spreading fear.
SUPPLY CHAINS
Kudlow played down the potential wider impact of the virus outbreak on the U.S. economy and on company supply chains that are being curtailed, saying: ""It's not a catastrophe. It's not a disaster.""
""We've been through this before and I just think the impact is minimal,"" he said later in the Fox Business interview.
China was the third largest U.S. goods trading partner in 2019 through November, falling behind Mexico and Canada because of the U.S.-China tariff war. 
Kudlow said he thought the virus outbreak could spur business investment and lead to increases in production in the United States.
Asked if component shortages could result from the outbreak, Kudlow said: ""Yes. To a point. It's not across the board.""
""Chipmakers are not going to be affected that much. Pharmaceuticals probably will be affected much more. Some things are kind of in the middle, when you get to automobiles and auto parts.""
Most of the active ingredients used to make prescription drugs sold in the United States are sourced from China.

The move will help the struggling Canadian train and plane maker to pare billions of dollars in debt, the report said.
Bombardier's shares have plunged more than 30% so far this year. On Jan. 16, company flagged a 2019 profit warning, citing problematic rail contracts, as well as warned of a potential write down in the value of a plane partnership with Europe's planemaker Airbus.
Bombardier declined comment on the WSJ report, but a source familiar with the company's thinking told Reuters it was holding talks over both rail and aviation assets to keep all its options open.
Acquiring Bombardier's business jet unit would add the Global series of large-cabin aircraft to Textron's portfolio, which mostly makes small- and medium-sized corporate planes.
Analysts have said that a deal would expand the U.S. company's aircraft offerings, allowing it to offer a complete family of jets to a wider range of customers. 
Textron declined to comment.

Shares of Textron rose more than 9%, while those of Bombardier's were up over 10%.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve said on Tuesday that it permanently barred a former  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) executive from the banking industry over his role in Malaysia's multi-billion-dollar 1MDB corruption scandal.
Andrea Vella, who was co-head of Goldman's Asia investment bank in 2012 and 2013, failed to escalate information he had about Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho's involvement in three bond offerings that Goldman underwrote for Malaysia's sovereign wealth fund, the regulator said. 
Malaysian and U.S. authorities have charged Low in connection with the theft of billions of dollars from 1MDB, which was originally set up by former Malaysia Prime Minister Najib Razak to fund infrastructure projects. 
The Federal Reserve said that Vella did not flag Low's involvement despite knowing that Low was a ""person of known concern"" to Goldman Sachs.
""Vella was responsible for providing full and accurate information to (Goldman's) committees reviewing the complex financing transactions and appropriately supervising financing personnel working on the transactions,"" according to a statement released by the Federal Reserve. 
Vella could not immediately be reached for comment. According to the statement from the Federal Reserve, Vella consented to the bar without admitting or denying any of the allegations made by the regulator.
A spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs confirmed that Vella had left the firm in recent days after being on leave since October 2018.
The U.S. Justice Department says that $4.5 billion was misappropriated by high-level 1MDB fund officials and their associates between 2009 and 2014. 
Vella managed two former Goldman Sachs bankers, Timothy Leissner and Roger Ng, who were both indicted by U.S. prosecutors in November 2018 on charges related to their roles in securing Goldman as the underwriter for the three 1MDB bond offerings.
Leissner pleaded guilty to conspiracy to launder money and conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and agreed to forfeit $43.7 million. Ng pleaded not guilty to charges in May, and his case is currently pending in federal court in Brooklyn. 
According to the U.S. Justice Department, Goldman earned $600 million in fees for its work with 1MDB. Leissner, Ng and others received large bonuses in connection with that revenue. 

Goldman is in ongoing discussions with U.S. and Malaysian authorities over their investigations into what the bank knew about the transactions at the time.

The S&P 500 rose 2.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.9% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average 1.6%.
For a second-straight day, China introduced stimulus measures to steady business lending and offset the economic impact from the coronavirus, which has killed more than 400 people.
Sentiment on risk was also supported by data showing that the coronavirus may not be as deadly as many feared. 
The coronavirus death rate was 2.1%, lower than SARS' 9.6%, according to China’s National Health Commission.
Despite the efforts from China, Goldman Sachs estimated that the global gross domestic product growth this year could fall by 0.1-to-0.2% even if infections slows significantly in February and March.
""The near-term impact is quite large,"" Goldman’s chief economist Jan Hatzius said. ""What happens to 2020 as a whole really depends on how quickly the episode is brought under control.""
But Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) proved an exception to rally, falling about 3%, after the tech giant reported a miss on revenue, led by weakness in its core advertising business.
Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL) surged 12% after its topped quarterly results as price hikes for its winterwear collection boosted margins.
In the wake of easing coronavirus fears, oil prices rebounded after falling into bear-market territory a day earlier, pushing energy stocks higher.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), meanwhile, shrugged off a downgrade from New Street, rising 14% to take its gains for the year so far above 80%, underpinned by its bullish quarterly results released last week. Shares quickly raced past the $800 and are trading above $900."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - China-based  Luckin Coffee  Inc's (O:LK) shares could double in price after it overcomes the negative impact of the coronavirus outbreak and a widely publicized bearish bet against its stock, according to Andrew Left, managing partner at hedge fund Citron Capital.
Better known for his short bets, Left, who is also editor of the online investment newsletter Citron Research, has come out in defense of Luckin’s stock, which his fund owns. The stock will probably eventually trade at $60 per share on U.S. exchanges once uncertainty over the coronavirus clears, he told Reuters.
Luckin was forced to temporarily close an estimated 200 coffee shops in Wuhan, capital of the Hubei province in China and epicenter of the deadly virus outbreak.
Its stock slumped as much as 27% on Friday after hedge fund Muddy Waters said it had sold short the shares of the Chinese challenger to Starbucks (O:SBUX), citing an anonymous report that questioned the coffee chain's financials.
Short-sellers aim to profit by selling borrowed shares, hoping to buy them back later at a lower price.
Luckin has denied all allegations in the anonymous report.
Left said he decided to take a position in the stock after conducting an analysis of Luckin's business, including speaking with stakeholders and competitors and reviewing payments data.
""I don't think that report is correct,"" Left told Reuters.
Luckin shares staged a partial recovery on Friday when Left mounted a defense of its fundamentals via Twitter and said his fund had bought the stock.
Shares were up 14% to $35.64 in afternoon trading on Tuesday.
About 30% of Luckin's available shares have been sold short, with the dollar value of these bearish bets at $951 million, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners. Left, dubbed ""The Bounty Hunter of Wall Street"" by New York Times Magazine, is known for successful bets against Valeant Pharmaceuticals (NYSE:BHC) and for publishing critical reports on Chinese companies and profiting when their shares fell.
Carson Block, founder of Muddy Waters, has made his mark in the hedge fund industry by betting against the stocks of a number of Chinese companies that trade on North American stock exchanges after challenging their accounting practices.
Muddy Waters declined to comment.
The shop closures and movement restrictions due to the spreading coronavirus are putting a damper on Luckin's first-quarter results, brokerage Needham said in a note on Tuesday.
Nevertheless, the firm boosted its target price on the company’s shares by 48% to $40, pointing to Luckin's new unmanned retail and tea partnership store initiatives."

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The finance ministry withdrew 1.6 trillion rubles ($25 billion) from Russia's two top banks in December, as state spending under a stimulus program ordered by President Vladimir Putin picked up, data showed on Tuesday.
In May 2018, shortly after his re-election, Putin announced a $400 billion spending plan for sectors including infrastructure, housing and health, and designed to lift the economy into the world's top five by 2024.
But the project became snarled up in red tape, and last month Putin appointed a new government and prime minister with a brief to focus on delivering strategic goals.
Sberbank (MM:SBER), Russia's top bank, and second-ranked VTB (MM:VTBR) respectively saw 868 billion rubles and 684 billion rubles of outflows of finance ministry funds in December, double that of the same period of 2018, the banks' reports showed.
At the same time, budget spending rose to 3.3 trillion rubles from 1.4 trillion in November, according to finance ministry's data.
In January Raiffeisenbank, after analyzing central bank data, highlighted a similar fall in ministry funds deposited with the banks, saying the need to speed up strategic spending was the most likely reason.
Sberbank said the outflow was driven by an increase in state spending and that there was no need to replace the funds as ""public expenses are received on accounts of state-funded units and remain on the banks' accounts"".
VTB told Reuters that December's outflow was of a ""traditional"" nature ahead of the year-end. The treasury, which manages the finance ministry's funds, the ministry itself and the central bank did not reply to requests for comment."

MILAN (Reuters) - Italy's fashion industry expects revenues to fall 1.8% in the first half of 2020 due as the coronavirus outbreak hits sales, an industry official said on Tuesday, as jewelry maker Pandora warned business in China had ground to a halt.
Several high-end brands also said they had shut down stores in China, the world's biggest luxury goods market, stoking concerns that the industry could face significant damage to sales if the virus is not contained quickly.
Carlo Capasa, head of Italy's national fashion chamber CNMI, said the coronavirus outbreak would cause turnover for the Italian industry to fall by 1.8% in the first six months of the year, mostly in the first quarter.
Home to the likes of Prada (HK:1913), Armani and Moncler (MI:MONC), Italy is second only to France among European countries for fashion and luxury goods sales. Total turnover for the sector was 90 billion euros last year, or about 5% of gross domestic product in the euro zone's third biggest economy, according to CNMI figures.
""In December the outlook for 2020 was a return to our historical annual growth rate of around 3%, but all that changed with the China virus spreading,"" Capasa said.
""The full economic impact can't be calculated yet, but we would be lucky if the sector grew 1% this year.""
Chinese shoppers fueled a decade of growth for the luxury goods industry and today account for 35% of the sector's global sales, estimated at 281 billion euros last year by consultancy Bain & Co.
But the coronavirus has seen parts of China put under quarantine, flights halted and many Chinese cancel trips abroad, including during the New Lunar Year holiday, a peak retail season in China and overseas.
Companies around the world have warned that the outbreak could disrupt supply chains or hurt bottom lines.
Ralph Lauren Corp (N:RL) said on Tuesday it has shut about half of its 110 stores in China due to the disease, which has so far killed over 420 people.
Tiffany & Co, bought recently by LVMH (PA:LVMH), said it had also temporarily closed several stores in affected areas.
` ""As I sit here and watch the Chinese business, it is in a standstill mode, I mean there's pennies being sold,"" Pandora's Chief Executive Alexander Lacik told Reuters on Tuesday, describing an ""unprecedented"" drop in business.
The Danish company, about 10% of whose annual sales are to Hong Kong, China and its tourists, has closed 70 of its 240 shops in China on government orders, customer traffic at other stores, mostly in shopping malls, is ""next to none"", Lacik said.
Capasa said three Chinese designers had been forced to cancel their shows at Milan's Women's Fashion Week on Feb. 18-24, and about 1,000 Chinese people who had been expected to attend would now likely not show up.
""The Chinese are big spenders, for us this is quite relevant,"" he said."

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Ride-hailing company Beat hopes rival Uber (N:UBER) will return to Colombia, but meanwhile, it will capitalize on the void it left and try to fill it, the company said.
Colombia's ride-hailing sector was thrown into disarray in December after Uber was ordered to cease operations following a court ruling that it had violated competition rules. San Francisco-based Uber left the country last week and has since said it is considering taking the dispute to international arbitration.
Local entrepreneurs have railed against what they say are out-dated regulations that threaten Colombia's status as a popular destination for investment. President Ivan Duque said at Davos that technology firms were welcome in the country but had to play by the rules.
""Something that motivates Beat is competition,"" Mauricio Lopez, Beat's general manager for Colombia, told Reuters late on Monday. ""The fact that the market leader has now left definitely puts a limit on that competition (but) that space has to be occupied.""
He said Beat, its rival ride-hailing apps like DiDi and traditional transport sectors would look to grow their offerings in Uber's absence.
Beat, part of  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and BMW's (DE:BMWG) joint venture Free Now, counts some 70,000 drivers in the Andean country, making Colombia one of its most important markets in Latin America.
Before its departure, Uber had some 88,000 drivers and 2.3 million active users in Latin America's fourth-largest economy. It said on Monday initial calculations suggest damages resulting from its dispute with Colombia will exceed $250 million.
""We would like (Uber) to come back,"" Lopez said.
He said the priority for the ride-hailing industry, the government and traditional transport sectors is to nail down regulation that will allow old and new industries to co-exist.
""I believe all parties must push for this regulation, not just the technology platforms,"" Lopez said. ""Within that scope we should also revise regulations that affect traditional transport models.""
Lopez said while Beat is operating in an uncertain environment, conversations regarding new regulations with the government are progressing more quickly than previously, though disagreements remain.
""It is not an easy debate,"" he said.
Lopez said Free Now invested $1 billion in its Latin American operations in 2019, much of it in Colombia, though he would not give an exact figure. Future investments could be affected by regulatory uncertainty, he said.
""It's certainly true the present situation could cause friction for those decisions,"" he said."

786,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 04, 2020 12:25PM ET</span>",Pandemics Are Breeding Grounds for Trade Wars,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- As coronavirus continues to spread outward from China, it’s tempting to see this as a uniquely modern problem, born of the unprecedented ease with which goods, information and people move around the world. In reality, such outbreaks have flourished for centuries thanks largely to a single factor: international trade, the original pandemic superhighway.
Consider for a moment the biggest pandemic in recorded history: the bubonic plague. It ripped through Europe beginning in 1348, killing off a third of the population. Even then, it wasn’t finished, returning in subsequent decades for numerous encores. Though the plague’s precise origins in Asia are still disputed, historians agree that it arrived in Europe via the Crimean port of Kaffa.
Merchants from Genoa stopped there on their way back from China carrying a wide variety of goods – and, unwittingly, Yersinia pestis. They returned home, where other merchants picked up the plague before spreading it throughout Europe. The merchants themselves served as hosts, but so, too, did the ubiquitous black rats that thrived alongside humans. (The rats had arrived as stowaways from Asia on earlier trading voyages.)
This story, one of many recounted by Mark Harrison, a historian at Oxford University, highlights the outsized role that global trade has played in promoting pestilence. It was also clear to people at the time in spite of their medieval understanding of germs, Harrison noted.
As the plague became a pandemic, suspicion fell on merchants, and cities began restricting their movements. But it wasn’t until 1397 that port authorities in Dubrovnik hit upon a clever a way to deal with merchants of death: keep them sitting aboard their ships until they died or got better. The quarantine was born.
Each time the plague revisited Europe in subsequent centuries, the perceived – and very real – connection between trade and disease became more firmly entrenched in people’s minds. This in turn informed how city states and kingdoms responded to the outbreak of disease. By the 1580s, over a third of the so-called “plague decrees” focused on trade and the quarantine of goods from abroad.
Daniel Defoe, the English trader best known for penning “Robinson Crusoe,” voiced a widespread belief in the 1600s that the plague had arrived in “Goods brought over from Holland, and brought thither from the Levant,” the heart of the Middle East. Again, this was not far from the truth: The textiles that dominated long-distance trade likely hid plague-bearing fleas. 
Still, a growing number of merchants questioned whether the cure might be worse than the disease. They began pushing back at quarantine measures almost as soon as they were introduced. A typical petition filed by merchants in Spanish Seville in 1582 claimed “intolerable harm and injury.” Sure, plague is bad, these merchants conceded. But the economic consequences? Catastrophic!
This tension inevitably surfaced during future epidemics, with commercial interests counseling a more conservative approach to reining in disease, and governments opting for more stringent measures. But in the 16th century, political leaders realized that quarantines could be used for another purpose altogether: kneecapping rival nations. The Dutch, who had become a global trading powerhouse by this time, learned this the hard way.
At the time, the Dutch had a reputation for putting profits ahead of public health. When rumors began that the plague had returned to Amsterdam in 1663, the British imposed quarantines on Dutch ships. The “contagion malady” was nothing worrisome, the Dutch replied; borders should remain open.
The truth was somewhat more complicated. The plague in Amsterdam was real, but so were British and French ambitions to cut the Dutch down to size. Quarantines solved both problems. As tensions between these imperial powers rose, each began to use disease as an excuse for undercutting each other’s trade, with the Dutch suffering the most. By the end of the century, quarantines had become glorified tariffs, used largely to keep foreign goods at bay.
This may help explain why some of the first successful attacks on the quarantine came from free-trade advocates. This movement took off in 19th-century Britain, when a growing number of politicians and economists helped repeal protectionist measures like the Corn Laws, and free traders soon turned their attention to the quarantine laws, which the Times of London characteristically described as “absurd and antiquated.” They might as well have described them as “medieval.”
This movement came at an opportune time. By the 19th century, epidemic diseases that traveled trade routes – yellow fever and cholera, most notably – proved far less responsive to quarantines. This alone opened the door to a change of policy. It helped that Great Britain, which had the world’s largest navy and the biggest economy, had the power to force recalcitrant nations to abandon their attachment to the quarantine.
Britain succeeded – up to a point. It convened international sanitary conferences designed to remove quarantines and foster cooperation on containing epidemics. But new diseases undid much of the tilt toward internationalism by the end of the century.
Rinderpest, bovine pleuropneumonia and trichinosis, which affected livestock, not humans, led to bans on imports from countries where the diseases went unchecked. As always, though, it was hard to distinguish the motives behind these measures. If Germany refused pork from the U.S., was this a public health measure, or just plain protectionism?
In the 20th century, the vexed historical relationship between trade and disease largely fell away, save for a few isolated episodes. But what’s happening now suggests that this relationship may be resurgent.
As the coronavirus began to rage unchecked, it followed paths that China has been building for 30 years. The pattern will only intensify in the coming weeks.
So, too, will the response. President Donald Trump’s fondness for isolationism and protectionism has primed him and his top aides to view the outbreak as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to slow China’s rise.
We’re already seeing evidence of this. When discussing the outbreak, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross couldn’t resist taking a self-described “victory lap,” claiming that the pandemic will bring back jobs to the U.S. The statement struck many observers as bizarre and nothing more. But when paired with the president’s own claim that the outbreak would “have a good ending for us,” it becomes easier to envision a resumption of the strategy that hobbled the Dutch: fears of a pandemic serving the protectionist aims of politicians. "

Investing.com – Office communications software company Slack got some good news from Wall Street Tuesday and shares jumped accordingly.
Slack Technologies (NYSE:WORK) was up 11% in afternoon trading.
RBC Capital Markets initiated coverage of the stock with an outperform rating and a price target of $25.
“In a time where data is abundant but attention is scarce, modern workers increasingly turn to messaging and conversational interfaces as they seek lower-friction, real-time, automated experiences that deliver results,” RBC analyst Alex Zukin wrote in an note, according to Briefing.com.
 While the simplistic take on Slack is that it is ‘just another workplace chat tool,’ we believe that the vision around becoming the primary system of engagement for all employees inside (and increasingly outside) an organization creates a positive data feedback loop (more engagement - more data - more insights to drive better results - more engagement) and significant long-term value,"" Zukin said.
Before today’s pop, shares were down nearly 11%.
Among the 20 analysts covering Slack, 10 have buy ratings, 2 have sell ratings and 8 are neutral, according to Investing.com.
The average price target is about $27.40."
788,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 04, 2020 11:56AM ET</span>","As Virus Spirals, Markets’ Bullish Bent Proves Tough to Dislodge","(Bloomberg) -- Anyone who used China’s health scare as an excuse to bail from stocks or redouble bets on bonds is learning again how hard it has become in American markets to shake investors of their optimism.
Even in a world ruled by fear over the scope of the coronavirus outbreak, risk assets are proving impossible to hold back whenever the pace of news flow levels off. Equities as measured in the S&P 500 are having the best two-day surge since October, while 10-year Treasury yields have now climbed the most in almost two months. The yen, a currency haven, is lower for the year again and credit spreads are contained.
That it’s happening as infection rates show no sign of slowing is testament to both the cold-blooded logic of traders and the persistent strength in the global macro backdrop. Convinced there’s no way to assess how bad the virus will get, they’re clinging instead to what they can confirm: especially solid U.S. earnings, a rebound in manufacturing data and a drumbeat of assurances from the Federal Reserve.
“We’ve seen this repeatedly -- May, August, October, and now -- external shocks, political and geopolitical events have difficulty slowing down the U.S. equities on the way up,” said Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute. “The long-term impact of the virus is still unknown, but the attention has shifted to things that are more predictable, like monetary policy.”
Coronavirus fears have dominated sentiment since mid-January, with infections topping 20,000 and the death toll rising to 425. Headlines on the outbreak sent the U.S. stock market to its worst days since August last week, while this week has seen two of its best.
With underlying data pointing to an expansion, several Wall Street strategists have reaffirmed outlooks. The virus shouldn’t derail the economy, Morgan Stanley’s Michael Wilson wrote in a note. Unless a pandemic develops, economic volatility will remain low, Evercore ISI’s Dennis DeBusschere said Tuesday.
“The data has been solid, inventories are low and consumption is firm,” DeBusschere, the firm’s head of portfolio strategy, wrote. “Given the collapse in yields and only a potential short-term impact on EPS, stocks are unusually attractive relative to bonds.”
Strategists in currencies and bonds markets haven’t rushed to alter forecasts. Despite the dollar’s best start to a year since 2016, Paresh Upadhyaya, a portfolio manager at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management, says the currency will still lose ground once global economic growth rebounds after the virus is contained.
“My outlook for a recovery in global growth has been delayed, not derailed,” Upadhyaya said Friday. China over the weekend moved to shore up its markets and economy with a massive injection of stimulus, bolstering optimism any downturn won’t have a lasting impact.
 Eaton  (NYSE:ETN) Vance maintains a “somewhat” weaker dollar position, said Eric Stein, the firm’s co-director of global income. In the Treasury market, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co.’s Alex Roever is convinced 10-year yields will move back just above 2% by year-end despite any haven bid. They hovered near 1.6% Tuesday.
The downturn in global factory data is likely ending, JPMorgan equity strategists wrote, with the signing of the phase one trade deal providing a boost. A gauge of U.S. manufacturing rebounded sharply in January, with the Institute for Supply Management’s purchasing managers’ index surging above the level that signals expansion.
“The latest health scare poses a significant risk to our constructive call, and could lead to continued de-risking in the short term,” strategists led by JPMorgan’s Mislav Matejka wrote in a note. But, they said, “the fundamental backdrop is supportive, and the fallout from the outbreak is unlikely to hurt activity prints over the medium term.”
Fourth-quarter earnings results have outpaced expectations, offering “a port in the storm for stocks,” according to Gina Martin Adams, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. The S&P 500, with 227 reports through Monday, is set to post an EPS decline of 0.3% versus a year ago, she wrote in a note this week. Earnings were forecast to shrink by 1.9% heading into the season.
To be sure, the latest economic data and earnings reports describe periods prior to the virus outbreak. Treasury yields remain near the lowest since September and a key part of the yield curve recently inverting again, reviving concern about a potential slowdown in the U.S. The outbreak will cut U.S. first-quarter economic growth by 0.4 percentage point,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). said, as the number of tourists from China plunges and exports to the Asian nation slow.
Risk assets had been rallying since October, when the Fed began buying $60 billion of Treasury bills per month. The central bank said last month it would extend through April a program aimed at smoothing out volatility in money markets. Chairman Jerome Powell suggested the central bank stands ready to act if the coronavirus looks likely to hamper growth.
But to Gary Bradshaw, a portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management, the recent pullback was an opportunity to add to some of his tech holdings.
“Those that missed the rally late last year and were looking for an opportunity to jump in used the pullback to put money to work,” he said by phone. “Nobody knows what the virus will amount to. But what’s giving investors optimism is solid earnings, good economic growth and low interest rates.”"

Investing.com - Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL) rose higher Tuesday after a blowout quarter that put to bed concerns about Hong Kong dragging numbers down.
Shares of Ralph Lauren jumped 10% in midday trading.
The luxury clothing company reported earnings of $2.86 per share, well ahead of the $2.44 per share expected, according to analysts’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Sales came in at $1.75 billion, beating estimates of $1.72 billion.
Same-store sales in the U.S. rose 2% for the quarter. Asian same-store sales posted a gain of 1%.
Weakness in Hong Kong, where protests have enveloped the administrative region, was offset by growth in brick-and-mortar sales and e-commerce, Briefing.com reported.
The company said it was assessing the financial impact of shutting about half of its 110 stores in China due to the coronavirus outbreak. It gets about 4% of its total revenue from China, a growth market for luxury goods makers.
Looking ahead, Ralph Lauren expects 2020 net revenue growth of 2% to 3%.
For the fourth quarter, heavyweight parkas, coats, light down jackets and wind breakers were among Ralph Lauren's bestsellers during the holidays, CEO Patrice Louvet said.

Thyssenkrupp says it will either list the business, sell either a stake or the business in its entirety as the company aims to cut 12.4 billion euros ($13.7 billion) in debt and pension liabilities.
The deadline for binding bids for the whole business is mid-February.
SUITORS LINE UP
Suitors are:
* Kone has submitted a 17 billion euro non-binding bid, including a roughly 3-billion break fee, beating three private equity consortia whose offers were between 15-16 billion.
Union sources say that may not be enough to compensate for antitrust risks.
Analysts at Jefferies said that a price tag of 15.6 billion euros after tax would be enough ""to negate net debt and pension liabilities, saving about 1.1 billion in outflows per year"".
The rival private equity consortia are:
* Blackstone (N:BX), Carlyle (O:CG) and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board
* A group comprising Advent, Cinven (CINV.UL), the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Germany's RAG foundation
* Canada's Brookfield (TO:BAMa) and Singapore's Temasek (TEM.UL)
A buyout group victory would be Europe's biggest private equity deal since KKR's (N:KKR) $21.4 billion acquisition of Britain's Alliance Boots Plc in 2007, according to Refinitiv data.
KONE VS PRIVATE EQUITY
While being the safest option in terms of execution, a flotation is seen as unlikely at this stage as it wouldn't bring in enough cash.
That's why a sale to private equity looks like the easiest option as it would face little or no antitrust scrutiny and could be completed in months.
A sale to Kone runs the risk of a lengthy regulatory review, even when taking into account a plan to sell Thyssenkrupp's elevator assets in Europe, where overlap is biggest, to CVC (CVC.UL) to try to resolve antitrust risks.
Danske Bank reckons that the combined market share of Thyssen and Kone stands at 43% in North America, which is also expected to lead to a deepened probe.
It took Linde (DE:LINI) and Praxair (NYSE:PX) nearly 17 months to get U.S. antitrust approval for a merger, and only following far-reaching remedy sales to CVC and Messer.
Still reeling from Brussels' veto of a planned steel tie-up with India's  Tata Steel  (NS:TISC), Thyssenkrupp's appetite for that is considered to be limited.
JOB SECURITY
Bidders are courting representatives of IG Metall, Germany's most powerful union which can make or break any deal and will fight to protect jobs and secure sites.
The elevator business employs more than 53,000, a third of Thyssenkrupp's total staff.
Labour representatives also control half of Thyssenkrupp's 20-member supervisory board, which will have to approve an agreement.
Workers fear that a sale to Kone carries a higher risk of job cuts than a sale to private equity. While cost savings are a key for all bidders, Kone needs synergies to justify its higher price tag.
Labour leaders also remain sceptical about Kone's plan to sell Thyssenkrupp's European assets to CVC, as it is uncertain what would happen to workers at the 2.1 billion euro business."

(Reuters) - Higher prices for Ralph Lauren Corp's (N:RL) down jackets and fleeces during the crucial holiday season boosted its margin and helped the company beat quarterly profit estimates on Tuesday, sending the fashion house's shares up over 8%.
The company said it was assessing the financial impact of shutting about half of its 110 stores in China due to the coronavirus outbreak. It gets about 4% of its total revenue from China, a growth market for luxury goods makers.
Sales in China remained strong, rising 30% in the third quarter, benefiting from a marketing drive on social media channels TikTok and WeChat.
The company said it was able to increase product prices and cut promotions due to a ramp up in marketing, especially on social media through supermodels and actors, which has helped lift its brand image.
Heavyweight parkas, coats, light down jackets and wind breakers were among Ralph Lauren's bestsellers during the holidays, Chief Executive Officer Patrice Louvet said. 
""The company's winter wear was on trend in terms of color and silhouette,"" Jessica Ramirez, analyst at research firm Jane Hali & Associates said. ""They got them right."" 
Ralph Lauren's adjusted gross margin rose by 60 basis points in the quarter, driven by a 6% gain in average prices at its own stores and website.
However, new advertising campaigns on television and in stores, as well as a new holiday-themed Snapchat filter drove Ralph Lauren's marketing expenses higher by 16% in the quarter. 
Net revenue rose 1.4% to $1.75 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 28, inching past average analysts' estimate of $1.72 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Its wholesale revenue in North America fell 8% as a record number of consumers shopped online during the holiday season, leading to a drop in traffic at department stores Macy's (N:M), J.C. Penney Co Inc (N:JCP) and Nordstrom (N:JWN). 
Ralph Lauren said it expects fiscal 2020 revenue, excluding fluctuations in foreign exchange, to rise 2% to 3%. 
The company's net income rose nearly three-fold to $334.1 million, or $4.41 per share, lifted by a one-time tax benefit.

Excluding one-time items, the New York-based company earned $2.86 per share, beating analysts' expectation of $2.45 per share.

Shares in the electric-car maker have soared more than 60% in six days to top $900 for the first time. Options traders who held calls that pay out at $800 have done even better, after they jumped from 25 cents to close at $24.22 Monday. The $1,000 calls rose from 2 cents to $1.98, a surge of 9,800%.
Tesla Has Already Doubled This Year on Musk’s Electric Dominance
The fortunes allegedly minted via Tesla options have, naturally, corresponded with a surge in their popularity. The 10-day average call option volume more than doubled since early December, as has the underlying security. On Monday, 1.8 Tesla calls traded for every S&P 500 call, the biggest gap on record according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
There’s an element of circularity at play, but this activity may be contributing to the rally in the shares. When a trader buys a call, the dealer who sells it will typically buy a certain amount of stock in the underlying to offset their exposure. If the shares continue to rise, dynamically managing that hedge can entail increasing purchases.
“So, now you get the picture, that every day at the open lately, folks are grabbing call options quickly and driving the stocks/indexes higher,” writes Scott Murray of Volatility Analytics. “It is much easier for this kind of market to be unhinged, as long call holders’ corresponding dealer position is long the underlying.”"

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Skoda is hoping government moves to drag regulations for cars sold in India up to developed market standards will help turn around its fortunes in a market where it has stalled.
The Volkswagen-owned (DE:VOWG_p) Czech carmaker has been tasked with helping its German parent achieve a 2025 target of a 5% market share in India, which is dominated by home-grown automakers including Maruti Suzuki (NS:MRTI), Tata Motors (NS:TAMO) and  Mahindra & Mahindra  (NS:MAHM).
Among the new rules are tighter emissions standards, pushing up the costs for domestic carmakers and forcing many to increase prices in India, which is expected to become the world's third-largest car market by 2026.
This could make it harder for the Indian incumbents, which have to invest heavily to retain their cost advantage, and prove a potential opening for firms like Skoda, which is launching a new strategy for India to coincide with the changes.
""The strategy was approved keeping in mind future regulations that would help us get competitive,"" Gurpratap Boparai, managing director of new entity Skoda Auto Volkswagen India, told Reuters ahead of India's biennial auto show that begins in New Delhi this week.
Although Skoda and Volkswagen have invested in technologies in developed markets and their cars have typically been designed to meet stricter standards than were needed in India, that meant their cars were over-engineered and more expensive.
Boparai said that much will depend on the kind of technologies rivals bring in and their price points.
Under the new India strategy, Skoda and Volkswagen will use a modular platform to build cars, increase local sourcing of components to 95% to curb costs and design cars to local tastes, while also exporting them.
Skoda this week previewed its first vehicle under the new strategy, a family sport utility vehicle (SUV) which it expects to launch in India next year.
The company is targeting sales of 100,000 cars a year for its brand in India by 2025, from about 15,000 in 2019, and to grow its sales outlets to 200 by 2023, from 85.
PUMP UP VOLUMES
Safety features like driver's side airbags and anti-lock braking systems were until recently optional in India and emissions standards were less robust.
Several global brands were unable to strip back their cars, struggling to generate volumes and make money in the country where Maruti, majority owned by Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp (T:7269), and South Korea's Hyundai (KS:005380) dominate.
But stricter rules will cut the cost differential between firms like Maruti, with low-priced, compact cars and Skoda, said Gaurav Vangaal, associate director at consultancy IHS Markit.
""To maintain that cost advantage, Skoda and VW will need to increase volumes so as to benefit from the economies of scale. This can only be achieved by ramping up exports and having a new and attractive line-up of cars locally,"" he said.
Together Skoda and Volkswagen have less than 2% share of India's car market and dealers and analysts say they also need to improve after sales service and reduce the cost of ownership, both important factors for Indian car buyers.
Volkswagen, meanwhile, this week showcased a compact SUV called Taigun and said it will focus its India strategy on SUVs, mainly in the premium category. It plans to launch 4 new SUV models in India over the next two years and increase the number of sales outlets to 150 by the end of 2020."

Investing.com -- Wall Street opened sharply higher on Tuesday helped by a big liquidity injection into local markets by the Chinese central bank.
But one stock in particular hogged participants’ attention.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock shot up another 16% to a new record high as the company’s recent rally sucked in more and more momentum-based traders. The stock has received several upgrades from Wall Street analysts since a fourth-quarter report that appeared to end most doubts about its ability to scale up production.
CEO and founder Elon Musk said at the time that he expected profit and positive cash flow to be the norm in future quarters after a difficult couple of years in which he repeatedly had to tap the capital markets to build new production capacity in the U.S. and China.
By 10:20 AM ET (1520 GMT), Tesla stock was at $879.96, up 12.8% on the day but still comfortably off an intraday high of $940.00.
That price valued it at $159 billion, or just over six times its trailing 12-month sales – a valuation more usually seen in tech stocks than in autos.
The surge means more pain for those who have shorted Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock. Short interest in the stock was 18% of the free float at the start of trading, according to data compiled by Shortsqueeze.com.
Elsewhere, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 434 points, or 1.5%, while the S&P 500 was up 2.2% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.5%.
Overnight, the People’s Bank of China had nipped in the bud a rout in Chinese financial markets, pumping 500 billion yuan (over $71 billion) into the market to “ensure adequate liquidity” as the country grapples with an economic seizure caused by the novel coronavirus.
Optimism was bolstered by a healthy 1.8% rebound in December factory orders in the U.S. – albeit November’s number was revised down to a 1.2% drop from the -0.7% originally reported.
There were also signs that markets were pricing in a higher chance of President Donald Trump’s reelection in November after the chaotic Democratic caucuses in Iowa, which gave an unflattering picture of the party’s internal state.
One large-cap missed out on the rally, however. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock fell 4% after the Google parent posted disappointing revenue growth and profit for the fourth quarter. The company published a more detailed breakdown of its revenue than usual, but analysts were underwhelmed to realize that YouTube appeared to squeeze less than $8 out of its average user last year. 
Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD), whose antiviral remdesivir drug (which still needs regulatory approval) was successfully used on a coronavirus patient last week, saw its stock rise 1.2% after it reported its quarterly earnings.
The rebound in risk appetite also fed through to the commodity markets, where U.S. crude futures rebounded 1% to $50.41 a barrel, while gold futures fell back 1.5% to $1,558.85 a troy ounce."

DUBAI/RIYADH (Reuters) - Several Saudi Arabian companies are planning to list shares on the Riyadh exchange in coming months in the wake of oil giant Aramco's record IPO. 
 Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) raised $29.4 billion by listing about a 1.7% stake on the Tadawul in December, prompting concerns from some analysts that it would drain liquidity from the market. But the Tadawul's average turnover over the past month, excluding Aramco, has stayed above the average turnover for 2019. 
""Aramco has demonstrated the full power of the Saudi market,"" said Mohammed Ali Yasin, chief strategy officer at Al Dhabi Capital Ltd in Abu Dhabi.
The Sulaiman al-Habib Medical Group, one of the Middle East's biggest hospital operators, is among the first companies to seek a Riyadh listing after Aramco, having delayed the deal due to the state oil company's IPO.
It plans to raise around $500 million and will launch the offering on Feb. 5, according to two sources close to the deal.
The medical group did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
BINDAWOOD, SUPREME
Saudi Arabia is encouraging more family-owned companies to list in a bid to deepen its capital markets under a reform push aimed at cutting the kingdom's reliance on oil revenues. 
As further encouragement, the regulator has relaxed the traditional IPO requirement to list at least 30% of a company.
Saudi retailer BinDawood Group, which aims to raise 1.5 billion Saudi riyal ($400 million), is expected to go public around the end of the first quarter of this year or early in the second quarter, the same two sources said.
The group, which owns the Danube and BinDawood supermarket brands, has hired Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  JP Morgan Chase  (NYSE:JPM), NCB Capital and GIB to organize the deal, the sources said, with Moelis & Co as a financial adviser.
Supreme Foods, which produces processed and cooked meat in three factories, plans to list in the second quarter and raise 300 to 400 million riyals, according to two sources close to that deal. The company has hired Saudi Fransi Capital (SE:1050) to manage the deal, they added.
BinDawood and Supreme Foods did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The financial institutions also did not immediately respond.
TADAWUL RISING
Last year the market saw only three deals, excluding Aramco, versus five in 2018, although proceeds in 2019 were higher because of Arabian Centers' (SE:4321) $660 million IPO, according to Refinitiv data. 
Aramco's listing has sent the Tadawul, already the Middle East's largest bourse, to the 9th place globally in terms of market capitalization.
Shares listed on the Saudi Tadawul market are currently trading with a price-to-earnings (PE) ratio - a key valuation metric - of around 18 times after foreign inflows into the kingdom's exchange and the listing of Aramco.
Yasin, of Al Dhabi Capital, said that was an advantage for companies entering the Saudi market this year. New entrants could come at a discount of 20% to 30%, around 12 times PE, which would represent a handsome return for current shareholders of those companies and to investors, he added.

""That's why we believe the Saudi market will continue to be a strong and vibrant market for IP0s in 2020.""

MILAN (Reuters) - Demand for Ferrari's (MI:RACE) Portofino and 812 Superfast models helped the Italian supercar maker hit profit targets for last year though it only a provided cautious upgrade to its outlook for 2020.
 Ferrari  (NYSE:RACE) said it planned to boost adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to 1.38 billion-1.43 billion euros this year above a previous target 1.3 billion euros given in 2018, disappointing some.
Ferrari shares were 1.4% lower at on the Milan stock exchange by 1335 GMT at 152.1 euros, though that was still near a record high of 158.7 euros hit less than two weeks ago.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts said the outlook was slightly below market expectations though they did not expect a material reaction in the share price, which has been riding high.
Ferrari shares have more than trebled since it listed in 2016 as the brand famed for its racing pedigree clocked up a string of strong results and boosted its profit margins to above 30%, a return most carmakers only dream of.
Rival  Aston Martin  (L:AML), for example, has a margin below 7% while Porsche, which is owned by Germany's Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), as an operating margin of about 17%.
Ferrari - which is controlled by Italy's Agnelli family through Exor (MI:EXOR) - said adjusted EBITDA rose 22% in the last quarter of 2019 to 333 million euros ($368 million), just missing a forecast of 340 million in a Reuters poll.
Net revenues rose 10% in the fourth quarter to 927 million euros.
Deliveries to Europe, Middle East and Africa - by far its biggest market - jumped 29%, more than offsetting a 25% drop in the Americas and a slump of 65% in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, which accounts for about 8% of revenue.
Its fourth quarter results left 2019 profit at 1.269 billion euros, in line with an estimate of about 1.27 billion the company gave in November. Its adjusted core profit margin came in at 33.7% versus a target of 34%.
After releasing a record five new models last year - including the F90 Stradale, the Prancing Horse's first mass production hybrid - Ferrari is set to slow the roll-out of new cars in the coming years.
Ferrari had said it planned to launch 15 models between 2019 and 2022, while achieving a significant increase in their average retail price.
In a bid to extract even more growth, Ferrari last year launched a plan to enhance its brand through new clothing and accessory collections, entertainment offers, and other luxury products and services for clients.
The strategy includes a manufacturing agreement with Italian fashion house Giorgio Armani and the opening of a restaurant with Michelin-starred chef Massimo Bottura in the group's hometown of Maranello in northern Italy in late 2022."

Alphabet’s shares were down 3.1% in U.S. pre-market trading. Analysts at Evercore ISI said that a shorter holiday period could be behind slower revenue growth for the quarter, though a lack of detail from management didn’t give investors much certainty of a re-acceleration in the near-term.
Among the positives were new disclosures for Alphabet’s YouTube and cloud businesses, as well as an increase in share buybacks. Alphabet’s shares have climbed 11% in 2020, reaching a record high last month.
READ MORE: Alphabet Misses Analysts’ Sales Targets; YouTube Disappoints (1)
Here’s a summary of what analysts had to say.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Brian Nowak
Overweight, price target $1,560
At $15 billion, YouTube revenue was about 30% smaller than expected, though growing 300 basis points faster than expected on a year-on-year basis. On one hand, that means YouTube’s growth runway is arguably longer than thought, but on the other, GOOGL must continue to innovate to drive engagement and monetization.
Cleaner disclosure will make it easier for investors to see the impact of company’s budding monetization engines like Maps, Discover, an e-commerce suite of products.
2019 global search revenue was ~6% higher than expected, which speaks to the even-larger underlying free cash flow that GOOGL has to re-invest or let flow down, given that search is the group’s highest incremental margin business.
Evercore ISI, Kevin Rippey
Outperform, price target $1,600
“Biggest surprise” was the flood of new disclosure. Relative scale and growth rates of YouTube and cloud are fairly close to Evercore ISI’s prior estimates and investor expectations, so likely won’t provide a material change to growth outlooks.
Enthusiasm for improved disclosure aside, the quarter’s revenue result falls below expectation, and similar to  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)., U.S. revenue demonstrated a marked deceleration.
While we suspect the explanation for the slowdown is substantially a function of the shorter holiday season, management wouldn’t quantify, leaving investors without much certainty for near-term re-acceleration.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Douglas Anmuth
Overweight, price target $1,535
YouTube sales were “notably smaller” than the $24 billion revenue JPM had estimated for 2019. On the flip side, “Google Search and Other” grew faster than expected last year and appeared to accelerate in the fourth quarter.
While the mix of advertising revenue differs from expectations, we believe it shows the sustainability of search growth, led by mobile, and the headroom for YouTube, especially as bigger TV dollars begin to shift online.
Comments around buybacks suggest upside to JPM’s previously modeled $20 billion of repurchases in 2020.
RBC, Mark S.F. Mahaney
Outperform, raises price target to $1,550 from $1,500
Quarterly earnings per share were “light,” but the miss was driven by “lower-quality” areas like other bets.
There were also key positives in the report, including the new revenue disclosures and expansion in core Google operating margins and record high share repurchases.
UBS, Eric J. Sheridan

Interchange rates of the world's largest payment processor will go up or down depending on the merchant and the way consumers pay for their purchases, the report said.
Higher rates are looming for transactions on e-commerce sites, while retailers in certain services categories such as real estate and education will see fees decline, the report added.
""Based on the most recent review in the U.S., Visa is adjusting its default U.S. interchange rate structure to optimize acceptance and usage and reflect the current value of Visa products,"" Visa said in the document.
Visa did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Interchange fees are what merchants pay to banks when consumers use a credit or a debit card to make a purchase from their store.
Payments networks like Visa and Mastercard Inc (N:MA) earn fees from merchants every time a consumer swipes a card issued by them. They also make revenue from interest paid by customers on overdue spending.

Visa's shares were up 1.2% in premarket trading.

804,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2020 08:20AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Fund giant Vanguard bypasses banks with forex algos,"By Tommy Wilkes
LONDON (Reuters) - Vanguard, the $5.6 trillion asset manager, plans to start using computer-run algorithms this year to trade FX directly with other funds, depriving banks of some of the fees they earn as the middlemen in currency deals.
The head of FX trading at U.S.-based Vanguard, which trades about $225 billion in currencies each month, told Reuters the fund giant was in talks with several forex platforms about launching specialist algorithms designed to seek out and trade with other asset managers. 
It plans to start trading with such ""algos"" later in the year, Andy Maack, Vanguard's FX trading head, said.
Vanguard is also one of three institutional investors that last week executed the first transactions on a new facility, FX HedgePool, that lets managers trade FX swaps directly with each other for their end-of-month currency hedging needs.
""It is going to reduce some dependency on the banks. It's not going to replace the banks, but give real money managers new sources of liquidity,"" Maack said in an interview.
FX HedgePool co-founder Jay Moore said that the new swaps facility went live on Friday - executing several euro/dollar trades - but declined to comment on the names of the first managers to transact. 
Banks play a central role in oiling the $6.6 trillion-a-day forex industry by using their balance sheets and technology to link buyers and sellers, earning a ""spread"" on transactions. The biggest banks, which hold nearly half of worldwide forex trading, earned a combined $16.3 billion in revenue from FX trading in 2018, data from Coalition showed.
But many investors worry that putting all their orders through banks requires them to give out too much information. The fear is that banks can read trading patterns and use that knowledge to trade against them or offer them worse pricing.
Fund managers therefore are keen to reduce their ""market impact"" by spreading their dealings among different counterparties. They can also lower transaction costs by slashing the spread paid to banks.
Previous attempts to get managers trading directly have struggled because investors have been reluctant to join new venues until there was sufficient trading already happening. 
But Vanguard's move is a sign that peer-to-peer trading is gaining more traction. Improvements in technology and the growing concentration of FX turnover among a handful of banks is encouraging players to test new models.
New regulations such as Europe's MiFID II also require managers to demonstrate deals were done at the best price.
Industry executives say Vanguard's model, which sees it make regular, predictable transactions to hedge its vast passively-managed stock and bond portfolios, is better suited to the peer-to-peer model. Investors that take directional bets on currencies will be likely to find it harder to match with other fund managers.
MORE ALGOS
Algorithms play a growing role in the forex spot market - fund managers have doubled the share of their trading using algos over the past six years to 27%, Greenwich Associates found.
Maack said Vanguard already uses algorithms that search for other buyside players when trading on bank-run platforms but would now use them on multi-dealer platforms, which include EBS, 360T and Refinitiv's FxAll, and where asset managers are active.
He declined to provide data on the share of Vanguard's forex trading transacted with other funds but added: ""It's definitely growing. It didn't exist a couple of years ago."" 
Aside from funds' own efforts, several start-ups are trying to break banks' hegemony. 
London-based Siege FX, for example, is building a matching system to check when one manager's currency needs can be ""netted"" against another's.
FX HedgePool focuses on low-margin swaps that investors use for hedging their passively-managed portfolios. The members-only facility was co-founded last year by New York-based Moore, an ex-Brown Brothers Harriman and  State Street  (NYSE:STT) executive.
Moore said that its focus on end-of-month swaps meant that attracting an array of asset managers to its facility before launching was not necessary.
""We don't need critical mass. We need a small number of the right users,"" Moore said.
But the banks' ability to offer better liquidity and pricing will help them retain their dominance in the forex business.
They will also keep a crucial function in peer-to-peer deals by acting as credit counterparty, given FX is traded bilaterally rather than on exchanges.  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Bank is FX HedgePool's initial credit provider.

""Banks will always play a role,"" Vanguard's Maack said. "" (But) We want to customize our liquidity sources,"" so it can ""toggle"" between different groups of buyers and sellers and better disguise what it is doing.

805,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2020 08:19AM ET</span>",Vodacom to launch 5G services in South Africa in 2020,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Vodacom Group (J:VODJ) expects to offer 5G mobile services to its South African customers this year by using a network being built by another African operator Liquid Telecom, Vodacom Chief Executive Shameel Joosub said on Tuesday.
Liquid Telecom announced last month it was building a wholesale 5G network that would be available from early 2020, using its share of the 3.5 GHz spectrum required for 5G. It said it would allow other operators to roam on its network.
Liquid, which said its wholesale service would be available in major South African cities, did not say which technology supplier would be used to roll out its 5G network.
""We expect to be able to launch 5G services in South Africa this year,"" Vodacom's Joosub said. ""This is possible thanks to a recent roaming agreement with Liquid Telecom, as 5G spectrum is largely unassigned in South Africa.""
Vodacom, which is majority owned by Britain's  Vodafone  (L:VOD), said it would manage the 5G network on behalf of Liquid Telecom, although it did not say precisely where or when the 5G service would be available to customers.
Mobile operators in South Africa have complained about delays in allocating the spectrum needed to roll out 5G, which provides much faster mobile connections than 4G networks.
Vodacom and rival MTN (J:MTNJ) have been running pilots for the next-generation technology using spectrum from the regulator but they are not yet permitted to offer this commercially.
The regulator, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA), has said it would outline in April the process and timing for licensing and assigning 5G spectrum.
Rain, a mobile operator that only provides data services, has launched a fixed-wireless 5G network, offering a fast broadband connection to homes and businesses without requiring cables. The service is available in Johannesburg and neighboring Tshwane.
Vodacom, which has already launched a 5G mobile service in the small African nation of Lesotho, would be the first operator in South Africa to offer 5G to mobile users.
In its quarterly results, Vodacom reported a 6.6% rise in group revenue for the three months to December, thanks in part to strong growth in data and revenues from its M-Pesa mobile money service.
Joosub said the company's growth in Tanzania would be hampered after Vodacom said in January it had to disconnect 1.7 million customers in the East African nation because of an issue related to government approved identification documents.
But the chief executive said Vodacom was working to reconnect these customers once they had undergone biometric registration."

808,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 04, 2020 07:31AM ET</span>",ESG-Hungry Investors Have Plenty of ETFs to Pick From in Canada,"(Bloomberg) -- Canada has kicked off 2020 with a slew of new products aimed at investors who want to incorporate environmental, social and governance factors into their investment portfolios.
Seven ESG-focused exchange traded funds began trading in January, the biggest month for launches of those funds since March 2019, when eight ESG products were created, according to National Bank Financial. The new funds are being launched after two years of strong net flows for Canadian-listed ESG ETFs -- more than C$300 million ($226 million) in 2018 and almost C$150 million last year.
The availability of such products in Canada has ballooned as asset managers try to capitalize on rising demand for funds that screen out companies that don’t meet certain environmental and governance criteria. Canada now has more 30 pure-play ESG ETFs. The U.S. has more than 80, though none have been launched this year, said Daniel Straus, vice president of ETFs and financial products research at National Bank Financial.
Investors have also been piling into one of Canada’s oldest ESG ETFs. The iShares Janzi Social Index ETF, which goes by the ticker XEN, attracted more than C$120 million in new capital from 2017 through 2019, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
“ESG investing as a buzzword is not new,” said Straus by phone. “It’s been around for a long time. It did seem to pass a tipping point in terms of attention about a year or two ago, both in Canada and the U.S.”
U.S. ESG ETFs took in $8 billion of inflows in 2019, almost double the amount from the prior year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
ESG ETFs offer a less expensive way for investors to get exposure to the responsible investing trends and are more liquid than active mutual funds. Last month, Larry Fink said BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). will put climate change at the center of the firm’s strategy by prioritizing sustainability in its investment funds.
“The number of inbound requests we’ve been getting for ESG has been skyrocketing,” Straus said. “It remains to be seen whether that interest becomes true grassroots retail investor flows -- that we have yet to observe.”
One firm was responsible for all seven new ESG ETFs last month -- Bank of Montreal. The bank is following larger rival Royal Bank of Canada, which launched six new ESG-focused ETFs last year that are now managed by BlackRock Asset Management Canada Ltd.
“We didn’t want to come out with one or two and look like we were doing a token launch,” Mark Raes, head of product at BMO Asset Management, said by phone.
National Bank’s Straus said more ESG funds will come online. Millennials and Gen-Xers are expected to inherit $30 trillion of wealth in a massive generational transfer over the next 30 years, and many want to avoid investing in companies with a large climate footprint.
“It’s the realities of the world we live in -- the increasing economic power of younger investors and decision makers and the headlines around climate change and social justice issues that are turning investor decision-making processes toward ESG factors,” Straus said.
The large inflow of capital into ESG funds in 2018 was primarily due to new launches like the RBC Vision Women’s Leadership MSCI Canada ETF, which received interest at inception from institutional investors, said Straus. “Both in Canada and the U.S., the creation activity for ETFs in the ESG category has been pretty spiky, suggesting that most of the buying interest is institutional in origin.”"

While the firm recommends steps to soften short-term pain, it still sees double-digit earnings growth for emerging markets and Asia excluding Japan.
Investors can “consider using the recent decline to gain long-termexposure to EM equities, which remains our most preferred regional equitymarket, and the regional market which we expect to deliver the highestreturns over the long term,” Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer at UBS Wealth, wrote in a note.
Chinese shares saw a record $720 billion wiped out in Monday’s rout amid the outbreak that’s threatening the world’s second-biggest economy. Although the market started stabilizing on Tuesday, traders are bracing for wilder swings in stocks.
One way to limit the short-term pain is by avoiding companies exposed to the risk of sharp near-term earnings cuts, such as casinos, airlines, hotels and other travel-related segments, as well as some consumer-related industries, Haefele wrote.
Instead, as more Chinese consumers are stuck indoors following government restrictions, he recommends buying “stay-at-home” stocks such as gaming, e-commerce and food delivery companies. Defensive shares with strong cash flows and high dividend yields are also a good bet, according to UBS Wealth.
The note didn’t specify whether the recommendations refer to onshore stocks in China or those listed in Hong Kong and the U.S.
“The short-term growth and earnings impact from the coronavirus may prove to be significant, but will also likely prove temporary, with pent-up demand spurring a sharp recovery in growth later in the year,” wrote Haefele."
810,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2020 07:14AM ET</span>","Exclusive: India may issue $5 billion of bonds with no foreign investment cap, sources say","By Aftab Ahmed and Swati Bhat
NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - India is likely to issue at least $5 billion worth of bonds with no limits on foreign investment next year, in a bid to list the bonds on global indices and attract more foreign funds, according to two finance ministry sources.
India's government is likely to issue the bonds in several tranches of at least $400 million each, one source said.
""We have spoken to major index operators and we will start pushing these bonds in tranches very early in the first half of the next fiscal year itself,"" the first official said.
The bonds would be rupee-denominated, said the officials, who asked not to be named as the discussions were still private.
The finance ministry did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment. India's fiscal year starts on April 1 and runs through March.
In September, Reuters reported the government was considering a special window free of any foreign investment cap for overseas passive investors.
An inclusion in global indices would open India's bond market to more investors and potentially reduce the government's borrowing costs.
That investment could be significant in the long run, said Ananth Narayan, associate professor of finance at S.P. Jain Institute of Management and Research.
However, Narayan said, ""if it is only a few bonds, a full- fledged index inclusion will not happen. We will get a very small, negligible kind of weightage on the index, but it is a good way to start.""
Generally, to include a sovereign bond global indices the issuing country needs to remove all foreign investment caps. But India has negotiated with some operators to open a new category of bonds that would have no caps instead of removing the 6% cap for the entire market, the first official said.
Finance Minister Nirmala Sithraman announced plans to fully open a certain category of bonds for foreign investors during her budget speech on Feb. 1, but did not give details such as quantity, timing or tenure.
The move would reduce the amount of securities that would need to be bought purely by domestic participants by about 4.5% at the outset. India's total planned borrowing for 2020/21 stands at $109.57 billion.
The Indian government is looking for fresh investors as Prime Minister Narendra Modi plans to spend over 100 trillion rupees to build new roads, hospitals, airports and rural infrastructure.
Chinese renminbi-denominated government bonds were added to the Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Global Aggregate index in April and the country is predicted to get some $150 billion worth of foreign investment.
Several market participants said they expect around $10 billion to $20 billion of inflows if the bonds join a global index. The flows could be much larger if limits on foreign ownership of Indian bonds are completely removed.
Both the officials said that the government is in talks with market players to gauge the appetite for such bonds and may also increase the cap for foreign investment for the entire market if warranted in the future.
The government is currently working on the tenures of the bonds and could come up with 10-year benchmark bonds in the special category as well, said the first official."

BEIJING/WELLINGTON (Reuters) - The economic impact of China's coronavirus lockdown is being felt across the globe, with exporters, miners and manufacturers of everything from coal and timber to meat and fruit facing delays and potential shipment cancellations. 
As the most populous nation and factory floor for most of the world's manufactured goods, China is normally the largest and most voracious consumer of a slew of global raw materials, fuels and foods.
But the combination of an extended Lunar New Year holiday and the rapid spread of the deadly coronavirus that has killed over 420 people and restricted the movement of millions more has jammed logistics channels into and across the country.
GRAPHIC: Comparing coronaviruses - https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-HEALTH-HUBEI/0100B5BM3C1/corona-virus-chart.jpg 
That's caused supply line backups stretching all the way to New Zealand, the United States and beyond. However, for now, the effect is more pronounced for smaller items such as food and forestry products - bulk items like iron ore, fuel and coal have mainly automatic offloading and transfer to storage that has not been affected. 
Exports of goods from China have also been disrupted, leading to other supply chain problems.  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380) has said it will suspend production in South Korea, its biggest manufacturing base, because of the lack of spare parts from the mainland.
At Gisborne's Eastland Port on the east coast of New Zealand's North Island, log exports to China – the port’s main source of revenue – have been halted until further notice, while forestry workers across New Zealand have been told to go home. The port is the country's second largest log exporter.
China is by far the largest market for New Zealand’s export logs, earning half its annual log income from the country. 
""The industry is reeling a bit as you would expect,"" said Prue Younger, CEO for the Forest Industry Contractors Association.
New Zealand's NZ$300 million in annual lobster sales to China have also been badly hit. Local prices of rock lobster have nearly halved as exporters seek to offload stock and fishermen have stopped fresh landings, traders said.
""For New Zealand exporters, the timing is unfortunate because this is a peak period for demand and good prices over the Chinese New Year,"" New Zealand Rock Lobster Industry Council chief executive Mark Edwards told news portal Stuff.

LABOR SHORTAGE
Compounding the impact of port congestion are the several city-wide lockdowns aimed at stopping the virus' spread that are preventing people from getting to work. 
That is leading to reduced staffing for all the necessary functions at typical entry ports, such as customs officers and freight-handling and inspection workers.
There are also reports of a shortage of pilots for tugboats, meaning large ships now take longer than normal to dock at certain ports.
Officials at several of the larger ports say they have been able to sustain normal operations but smaller port facilities are struggling.
""Our port and docks are running normally. But the real problem now is the downstream receiving ports, such as (around) Shanghai and Ningbo,"" said a logistics manager at Yingkou port in the northeastern province of Liaoning, a major iron ore and coal hub.
""What we heard from their report is that they don’t have enough people to drive trucks and boats to transfer goods out of the ports by road and by river. So they are having congestion and want us to slow down our pace to send vessels to them."" 
The manager of a state-backed logistics firm in Ningbo said that the waiting time has swelled to ""at least four days"" to unload river barges due to the staffing shortages.
GRAPHIC: Vessel congestion off Ningbo, eastern China - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/8415/8396/NingboCongestion.png 
But an even bigger problem, he said, is the weak downstream demand due to the extensive lockdowns.
""Traders are supposed to get their goods and sell it to downstream users, but right now they can sell to nobody. So they just stock it at ports, making less and less space for further goods to come in.""
""Taking our port as an example, for small dry boats, that is less than 200,000 tonnes, you have to wait for 2 days to come in and unload. But for bigger boats, you have to wait for longer,"" he said.
EXPORTER CAUTION
The knock-on effects of those delays are starting to be felt farther and farther afield. 
U.S. exporters of agricultural goods said some container shipments may be getting delayed due to uncertainty about the grace period for demurrage, or the fees owed to cargo buyers for any delivery delays. 
Roughly 20 large ports and two interior shipping firms across China have reduced or removed demurrage and detention fees for container, bulk and oil shipments through February 9 to try to sustain the flow of goods to market.
Even so, exporters with weeks-long journey times to China remain concerned about the potential for lengthy delays once their goods arrive, especially for food that is liable to spoil if held up.
""Carriers extended the grace period to February 9, but beyond that the shippers could face steep penalties,"" executive director Peter Friedmann at the Agriculture Transportation Coalition, a U.S.-based industry body

He added that normal demurrage fees for refrigerated containers - used to ship fish, meat and fruit - could run to $350 per container per day, potentially leading to steep losses on low-margin shipments of perishable goods if offloading delays are extended.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open sharply higher Tuesday, helped by a rebound in China after the country’s central bank moved to underpin the markets. The continuing earnings season on Wall Street and the latest political maneuvering will also be in focus.
At 6:55 AM ET (1155 GMT), futures for the S&P 500 traded 36 points, or 1.1%, higher, futures for the Nasdaq up 117 points, or 1.3%, while the Dow futures contract rose 309 points, or 1.1%. 
Earlier Tuesday, financial markets on the Chinese mainland reversed some of the steep losses of Monday. The blue-chip Shanghai Composite index closed over 1% higher, compared with Monday’s drop of 7.7%, thanks mainly to the People's Bank of China saying it will inject a total of 500 billion yuan into the money market to ""maintain reasonable and adequate liquidity in the banking system during the period of epidemic prevention and control.""
The country's central bank had already trimmed interest rates and injected 1.2 trillion yuan into the markets on Monday, although most of that was rolling over liquidity it had provided before the holidays.
Signs that the Chinese authorities will do whatever is necessary to curb the impact of the coronavirus have helped the tone on Wall Street. With this in mind, the focus will turn back to the ongoing earnings season.
Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) reported after hours Monday, missing analysts' estimates while offering up its worst fourth-quarter revenue growth since 2015. Alphabet stock dropped 3% premarket.
Walt   Disney   (NYSE:DIS) is set to report its fiscal first quarter 2020 figures after the market closes later Tuesday, and the market will be looking for guidance about its new streaming service, as well as any coronavirus impacts on its theme parks and movie box office expectations.
Ford (NYSE:F) is also set to report fourth quarter earnings Tuesday. The automaker reported a lackluster previous quarter, and analysts expect another contraction in revenue as well as subdued earnings - and that’s before the problems in China are accounted for.
The earnings season has generally been a positive one for Wall Street this quarter, with almost 70% of companies which have already reported beating expectations.
Elsewhere, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock is likely to stay in focus after melting up almost 20% Monday. Sentiment surrounding the company is very positive in the wake of the company's fourth-quarter results and guidance for 2020. The stock pushed 7.5% higher premarket to $838.50, a gain of nearly $200/share from Friday's closing price of $650.57.
Eyes will also be on the State of the Union speech by U.S. President Donald Trump as his impeachment trial continues. He is widely expected to be acquitted on Wednesday, and the technology problems and reporting inconsistencies which kept Iowa Democratic Party officials from releasing results from Monday’s caucus can only help his reelection prospects.
Economic data releases of note Tuesday include the Redbook at 08:55 AM ET (1355 GMT) and December factory orders at 10:00 AM ET (1500 GMT), before the American Petroleum Institute releases its weekly data on U.S. inventories at 4:30 PM ET (2130 GMT).
AT 06:55 AM ET (1155 GMT), U.S. crude futures climbed 1.3% to $50.76 and the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.6% to $54.76, still below the $55 level after Monday’s drop below that level for the first time since the end of 2018.
These prices have been helped by the news that technical experts from OPEC+ expected to meet at the cartel’s Vienna headquarters later in the day to study the disease’s impact. There has been talk that the group will decide to cut production to try and raise prices from these weak levels.
Gold futures were down 0.6% at $1,573.05 a troy ounce, while the dollar index was up 0.1% at 97.740."

The shareholder rewards came as the London-based company reported a 26% drop in fourth-quarter profit, which easily beat forecasts, and $2.7 billion in charges.
Cash flow rose by more than 10% in 2019 to $25.8 billion, despite lower commodity prices, as a result of higher production - particularly in U.S. shale following the acquisition of BHP assets.
Still, BP's debt-to-capital ratio, known as gearing, rose by the end of 2019 from a year earlier, even though BP sold $9.4 billion of assets, underlying the strain oil companies face as demand for fuels and chemicals weakened last year.
""Solid delivery in a tough environment,"" Redburn analyst Stuart Joyner concluded in a note, adding the focus would be on reducing debt. 
Rivals ExxonMobil (N:XOM), Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) and  Chevron  (N:CVX) reported sharp drops in 2019 revenues due to softer demand, particularly in Asia.

Dudley, 64, bows out after a decade at BP's helm. He was abruptly ushered in as CEO in October 2010 after his predecessor Tony Hayward stepped down in the wake of the deadly Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico. 
He has since led the company through a deep and long downturn and rising pressure from investors to adapt to the transition to more renewable energy.
Looney, who takes over on Wednesday, is planning to expand BP's climate targets and is considering a major overhaul to the structure of the 111-year-old company. 
""I am proud to be handing over a safer and stronger BP to Bernard and his team. I am confident that under their leadership, BP will continue to successfully navigate the rapidly-changing energy landscape,"" Dudley said in a statement.
STRONG OIL TRADING
BP reported $2.57 billion in fourth-quarter underlying replacement cost profit, its definition of net income, exceeding analysts' forecast of $2.1 billion in a company-provided poll.
That was down from $3.5 billion a year earlier, but up from $2.3 billion in the third quarter.
(Graphic: BP quarterly profits, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/8422/8403/Pasted%20Image.jpg) 
The results were driven by a lower tax rate and stronger-than-expected performance of the oil and gas production unit, or upstream, which saw output rise in 2019 by 3.8% to 2.64 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, driven by a doubling of output from U.S. shale oil following the $10.5 billion acquisition of BHP's assets in late 2018.
Refining profits dropped by a third in the fourth quarter to $1.44 billion due to a weaker performance of BP's large oil trading business. 
""Our oil trading result was not as strong as the previous quarters even if it had a record year overall,"" Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary, who steps down in June, told Reuters.
BP raised its dividend by 2.4% to 10.5 cents per share, the second increase since the BHP acquisition.
BP also denied media reports it was considering selling its 10.75% stake in Russian oil giant Rosneft (MM:ROSN).
""Rosneft is one of our closest strategic partners,"" Gilvary said.

BANGKOK/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Deluged by misinformation about the new coronavirus on social media, some Asian governments are fighting back with arrests, fines and fake news laws - something free speech advocates fear will entrench measures that can also silence dissent.
At least 16 people have been arrested over coronavirus posts in Malaysia, India, Thailand, Indonesia and Hong Kong, while Singapore has used its controversial new ""fake news"" law, POFMA, to force media outlets and social media users to carry government warnings on their posts and articles saying they contain falsehoods.
""Fortunately, we now have POFMA to deal with these fake news,"" said Lawrence Wong, one of the ministers heading a Singapore government task force to halt the spread of the virus.
Many details of the new flu-like coronavirus that surfaced just weeks ago in the Chinese city of Wuhan are unknown. As the death toll has passed 420, anxiety has been fuelled by social media posts ranging from the bizarre to the malicious.
Posts include speculation about how the virus can be caught - through a video game according to one - or avoided - a government minister in Myanmar was rebuked for sharing a post that recommended eating more onions - to local scares of deaths or anti-Chinese attacks.
""What I call the 'moron strain' has created a global, social media-driven panic that is in turn feeding on itself,"" wrote Karim Raslan in his regionally syndicated column, noting how much greater the challenge had become for governments to manage.
At least five people were arrested and released on bail in India's southwestern state of Kerala over WhatsApp messages, said Aadhithya R, District Police Chief of Thrissur. Six people were arrested in Malaysia on suspicion of spreading false news.
In Vietnam, where an army of cyber-censors tracks social media comment for the communist government, at least nine people have been fined and three celebrities asked to explain their actions over posts about coronavirus.
Thailand hailed the success of an ""anti-fake news centre"" it set up last year. Dozens of staff reviewed nearly 7,600 posts in four days from Jan. 25 - leading to 22 posts being highlighted as false on its website and two arrests under computer crimes laws.
""The anti-fake news centre is working intensively to verify these rumours and communicating truth to the people,"" said Digital Minister Puttipong Punnakanta.
Thailand is among countries where laws on social media posts have been toughened in recent years despite complaints from human rights groups that they could be used to target government opponents.
CONTROL
Free-speech advocates are wary that the campaign against coronavirus could help governments extend their control as well as damaging the health campaign.
""Criminalisation of speech, even if targeted at falsehoods, is highly likely to stifle the real time sharing of information that is essential during epidemics,"" said Matthew Bugher, Head of Asia Programme for free expression campaign group Article 19.
China has long censored social media heavily and some critics say that may have delayed information on the emerging virus in Wuhan - and therefore potential countermeasures.
Eight people were arrested after being accused of spreading rumours about illness in early January, but the case was dropped last week amid growing public anger over the handling of the new crisis.
Meanwhile, Tencent Holdings' ubiquitous messaging app WeChat has added tools to help debunk virus rumours. The official People's Daily has also introduced a tool to help people verify reports.
Western social media companies are also stepping up action.  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) has said it would take down misinformation about the coronavirus - a rare departure from the usual approach to health content by the world's biggest social network.
GOVERNMENT THREATS
Taiwan has warned of punishment for spreading disinformation. South Korean police were working with telecoms regulators to block ""false information"", Yonhap news agency said.
Indonesian police said two people had been arrested for spreading fake news and face charges that could see them jailed for up to five years. Hong Kong police said a shopping mall security guard was arrested for spreading false news about infections.
In Singapore, some said the government was using its new fake news law responsibly.
""Many examples of misinformation, confusing data and outright fake news present a clear and present danger to public safety, health and security,"" said Nicholas Fang, founder of Singapore consultancy Black Dot Research.
But not all were convinced.
Journalist and activist Kirsten Han is among those who have been given a government correction notice - in her case for sharing an article related to state executions last month rather than anything to do with coronavirus.
""Just because there are relatively more justifiable uses of a #fakenews law, it doesn't mean that the law was well-drafted and can't be an instrument of abuse and oppression,"" she commented on Twitter."

Bill Franke, founder and managing partner of Indigo Partners and a veteran American low-cost airline investor, is chairman of Wizz Air. Indigo cut its stake to 3.4% from 20.6%, according to the bookrunner on Tuesday.
Airlines must be more than 50% owned by European Economic Area nationals to operate flights within the bloc, otherwise the rights of non-EEA shareholders have to be restricted to allow operations to continue.
Wizz, which is focused on central and eastern Europe, said in April last year it was seeking more EU investors in order to comply with EU share-ownership rules or it could lose the right to fly within the bloc after Brexit.
JP Morgan, the bookrunner on the sale, said given Indigo's shares were not held by EEA nationals under EU rules, the share sale would ""at a minimum, maintain Wizz's current level of EEA qualifying ownership, but more likely increase qualifying national ownership"".
Wizz Air declined to provide additional details on the share sale.
In 2017, Indigo had said https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wizz-air-hldgs-indigo-idUSKBN1952LK that it would sell its stake in Wizz Air.
On Tuesday, Indigo Partners said it sold about 12.5 million shares of Wizz Air at a 3.5% discount to the stock's last close, according to a bookrunner.
The stake sale, at a price of 4,015 pence per share, raised proceeds of about 500 million pounds ($648.45 million) and leaves Indigo Partners with a stake of about 3.4% in Wizz Air, or 2.5 million shares.
Shares of Wizz Air were down about 1% at 4,120 pence at 0949 GMT.
Before the sale, the Indigo Partners owned 20.6% of Wizz Air, which was worth about 624 million pounds based on Monday's close.
The share sale comes just days after the European low-cost airline upgraded its annual profit forecast after a strong third-quarter performance when it carried more passengers."

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Foxconn could see a ""big"" production impact and shipments to customers including Apple face disruption if a Chinese factory halt due to the coronavirus outbreak extends into a second week, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Taiwan's Foxconn (TW:2317), which makes smartphones for Apple (O:AAPL) and other brands, has halted ""almost all"" of its production in China after companies were told to shut until at least Feb. 10, the source said, adding that an extension of the stoppage could disrupt shipments to clients including Apple. 
Taipei-based Foxconn, which is the world's largest contract electronics maker, did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while Apple declined to comment.
The source told Reuters on Monday that Foxconn has so far seen a ""fairly small impact"" from the outbreak as it was utilizing factories in countries including Vietnam, India and Mexico to fill the gap, adding that the company will be able to make up for the delay if factories work overtime after the ban.
In Eastern China's Suzhou, one of its largest manufacturing hubs, companies have been told to stay shut until at least Feb. 8 and in Shanghai until Feb. 9. Factories in the southern manufacturing hub of Dongguan in export-oriented Guangdong province have also been told not to open before Feb. 10.
The outbreak of coronavirus, which the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency, threatens to disrupt swathes of Chinese manufacturing.
The source said a halt beyond Feb. 10 could disrupt Foxconn's shipments, highlighting concerns about production hubs in the southern province of Guangdong and the city of Zhengzhou in Henan province where key iPhone plants are located.
""What we are worried about is delays for another week or even another month. The impact would be big,"" the source said. ""It definitely will have an impact on the Apple production line.""
""The tricky question is whether we will be able to resume production (on Feb. 10)...It's up to the instructions given by central and provincial governments.""
The Guangdong Department of Labour and Social Security said in a response to a question from Reuters that no company including Foxconn can resume work before Feb. 9, with the exception of firms involved in making or providing medical supplies and other daily necessities.
HEALTH CONTROL 
Foxconn has asked employees and clients in China's Hubei, the epicenter of the outbreak, not to return to factories and told workers to report their health condition to managers on a daily basis, an internal memo reviewed by Reuters shows. 
The company also said employees who follow the rules will be paid as usual and those we fail to do so will be ""severely"" punished, although it did not elaborate.
A hotline was set up to encourage employees to report those who had broken the rules, with a monetary award of 200 yuan ($29), the note dated Feb. 1 said.
Morningstar analyst Don Yew sees ""limited"" impact on Foxconn's supply chain, saying its four subsidiaries in Hubei only accounted for 1.8% of the firm's overall revenue in 2018 and vendors such as Apple maintain a diversified supply chain.

However, a spread of the coronavirus to major smartphone manufacturing hubs such as Guangdong may lead them to revise financial estimates for companies including Foxconn, Yew said.

821,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 04, 2020 05:28AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Dudley Bows out of BP With a Flourish,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com --   BP   (LON:BP) chief executive Bob Dudley bowed out on the sweetest of high notes on Tuesday, raising the company’s dividend less than a week after arch-rival Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) had been forced to cut the rate at which it returns cash to shareholders.
The company raised its quarterly payout to 10.5 cents a share, from 10.25c previously, after its preferred measure of underlying profit fell less than expected in the fourth quarter of the year. According to data compiled by Investing.com, that takes the yield on one of the U.K. FTSE 100’s most reliable dividends up to 7%. The  BP  (LON:BP) share price rose 4.5% in response, while the FTSE 100 rose only 1.2%. The benchmark Stoxx 600 index was up 1.0%.
By contrast, Shell (LON:RDSa) had been forced to cut its buyback plans for this year by 60%, and while it left its dividend untouched, the accompanying rise in net debt put questions marks over its ability to stay so free with its cash. Shell, for its part, is now yielding 7.39%.
 BP  (LON:BP), at least, is bringing in more cash in these days than it used to. The acquisition of BHP’s shale assets in the U.S. kept the expected decline in upstream profit to less than one-third, and the headwinds from the Gulf of Mexico spill a decade ago continue to drop: this year, BP will pay less than $1 billion in costs related to that accident, down from $2.4 billion last year.
But the sustainability of the new dividend is still likely to be tested. Production is likely to fall from last year’s average of 2.6 million barrels of oil equivalent a day in the current quarter due to the ongoing disposal program, while the company also expects lower refining margins and bigger discounts for its heavier north American crude blends. 
Most worrying, naturally, is the impact of the novel coronavirus on global oil demand. Chief financial officer Brian Gilvary told Bloomberg on Tuesday that the company sees the virus wiping out one-third of all forecast demand growth this year – a reality check to those still hoping for a V-shaped rebound in global demand and economic activity. Gilvary said the demand destruction is likely to be in the range of 300,000-500,000 barrels a day. 
Brent crude prices dropped below $55 a barrel for the first time since the end of 2018 on Tuesday, before recovering to trade at $54.86 a barrel by 5:25 AM ET (1025 GMT).  BP  (LON:BP) has set itself the target of generating a return on average capital employed of over 10% at that price level by 2021, while keeping gearing below 30%.
Given that  BP  (LON:BP) and other majors weren’t able to cover their capex and dividends at even $60 a barrel the last time oil prices collapsed in 2015/6, this represents some remarkable progress. But, as Tuesday’s presentation made clear, it depends on rapid sales of marginal assets. BP is targeting over $15 billion in disposal proceeds by the middle of next year. The company may be well on top of its core projects, but unless crude prices turn around, the risk is that it will have to sell some of its better assets to meet that target. "
822,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2020 04:50AM ET</span>","Sony raises outlook on strong sensor demand, warns of virus risks on supply chain","By Makiko Yamazaki
TOKYO (Reuters) - Sony Corp (T:6758) raised its annual profit outlook on strong sales of smartphone image sensors after reporting a smaller-than-expected decline in quarterly profit, but it warned of an impact from the Wuhan coronavirus on its global supply chain. 
Demand for image sensors has been strong enough that even with its plants operating at full capacity Sony has been unable to pile up planned inventories, Chief Financial Officer Hiroki Totoki said at an earnings briefing on Tuesday. 
But he said sensor shipments could be disrupted if the spread of the coronavirus forces client smartphone makers to suspend their assembly plants in China for a prolonged period. 
The virus outbreak could also rattle supply chains for its PlayStation gaming hardware and other consumer electronics, he said. 
""We can't deny the possibility of the virus threat expanding to a scale large enough to wipe out our latest upward earnings revision,"" Totoki said. 
The Japanese entertainment and electronics firm raised its annual operating profit forecast by 5% to 880 billion yen ($8.1 billion), roughly in line with the 878.47 billion yen consensus of 22 analysts compiled by Refinitiv. 
For the October-December quarter, profit dropped 20% to 300.1 billion yen, still beating the 271.07 billion yen average analyst estimate. Excluding an accounting gain linked to the acquisition of music publisher EMI and that boosted profit a year earlier, the latest quarter marked a profit increase. 
Sony's sensor business continued to thrive as smartphone makers compete to adopt larger image sensors and multiple lenses on embedded cameras for improved picture quality, driving quarterly profit at the business by 62% to 75.2 billion yen. 
The Japanese firm controls about a half of the world's image sensor market, supplying most global smartphone makers including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.
To reduce dependence on smartphones, Sony has been working on sensors for automotive applications.
Meanwhile, Sony's gaming business saw profit fall 27% to 53.5 billion yen as sales of its six-year-old PlayStation 4 console continued to decline.
The firm has said the PlayStation 5, scheduled for release this year, will feature better graphics, advanced haptic controllers and other improvements. 

Sony's share price has shot up more than 40% over the past year to its highest in nearly two decades - a vote of confidence for Chief Executive Kenichiro Yoshida's ability to retain momentum after a corporate turnaround led by his predecessor.

SHANGHAI/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hedge funds are holding their nerve on China's ability to rebound quickly from the coronavirus outbreak rattling global markets, but many are also adding caveats as they try to predict the potential economic fallout.
Mainland China stocks fell sharply on Monday when Shanghai and Shenzhen markets opened after an extended Lunar New Year break, wiping out nearly $700 billion in market capitalization.
But the broad blue-chip CSI 300 (CSI300), which fell almost 8% on Monday, rose 2.5% on Tuesday.
""In a crisis, everyone feels the sky is falling. But the sky does not fall in the end,"" said Gu Weiyong, chief investment officer at Shanghai-based hedge fund manager Ucom Investment Co.
He said he favored battered stocks of airport operators such as Shanghai Airport (SS:600009) on the basis that an economic recovery was only a matter of time.
Shares in Shanghai Airport were down 19% so far this year as of Monday's close, but gained 8% on Tuesday.
Oil prices, often considered a barometer of investor confidence in the global economy, eased off 13-month lows hit on Monday, with benchmark Brent crude (LCOc1) gaining 0.8% to $54.90 a barrel.
Futures prices also indicated an opening gain for the U.S. S&P 500 index (SPX) to add to a 0.7% bounce on Monday.
""The market seems to have reacted quite reasonably,"" said Switzerland-based David Nietlispach, portfolio manager for Pala Asset Management, who added that it was, however, a ""wait and see"" moment for Chinese stocks, as the government continued to battle the epidemic and assess economic damage.
HEDGES, VOLATILITY BETS
Stock market volatility – a favored play for many hedge funds - has risen sharply in recent days. On Monday the VIX index (VIX) measuring U.S. market volatility, reached its highest in more than three months.
Christopher Stanton, chief investment officer at Sunrise Capital Partners LLC, on Monday bought derivatives that rise in value if volatility picks up.
The fund uses computer-driven strategies to time short-term market swings.
""Am I happy about it? No. Because everything in my body tells me this is not over yet,"" he said pointing to the risk that a faster-than-expected increase in the number of coronavirus cases could trigger more selling.
The epidemic has claimed more than 420 lives in mainland China but has spread to several countries such as the United States, Japan, India and Singapore.
""What do you think isolating the world's second-largest economy is going to do?,"" he said. ""It can make (trade) tariffs look like a mosquito bite.""
Yuan Yuwei, who manages a global macro fund from China's eastern city of Hangzhou, said the sectors most vulnerable to an epidemic included property, retail, luxury goods, travel and leisure.
He shorted several stocks ahead of China's new year holiday, including Yum China (N:YUMC) and Starbucks (O:SBUX), while also betting on some potential gainers, such as Chinese online video platform Bilibili (O:BILI).
""In such a crisis, if you're cool-headed, there are plenty of opportunities to jump into a trend,"" he said.
Yang Xiaofan, Japan-based hedge fund manager, was however more pessimistic, and is shorting copper, whose price typically tracks global growth, while buying silver as a less crowded safe-haven trade than gold.
""The new virus itself is not that horrible，but the supply chain disruptions and factory closures caused by city lock-ins and holiday extensions would deal a real blow to the economy in the near term,"" he said.
""Supply side problems cannot be addressed by rate cuts or liquidity injections."" "

SEOUL (Reuters) -  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380) said it will suspend production in South Korea due to the coronavirus outbreak disrupting parts supply, becoming the first major automaker to do so outside of China.
The flu-like virus has killed more than 400 people and its economic impact has spread beyond mainland China.
In China, global automakers have already extended factory closures in line with government guidelines including Hyundai, Tesla (O:TSLA), Ford (N:F), PSA  Peugeot  Citroen (PA:PEUP), Nissan (T:7201) and Honda Motor (T:7267).
""Hyundai and Kia may be more affected as they tend to import more parts from China than other global automakers,"" said Lee Hang-koo, senior researcher at the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics & Trade. 
Hyundai has built up a huge production capacity in China over the past two decades.
""South Korean parts makers followed and built their own facilities along with Hyundai,"" Lee said. 
South Korea imported $1.56 billion worth of auto parts from China in 2019, up from $1.47 billion in 2018, trade data show. 
Most of Hyundai's South Korean factories will be fully idled from Feb. 7, while some production lines are expected to restart on Feb. 11 or Feb. 12, a union official said, declining to be identified given the sensitivity of the matter.
Schedules for suspension will vary by production line, a Hyundai spokeswoman said. 
'EMERGENCY'
The move follows a shortage of wiring harnesses which Hyundai sources mainly in China, industry officials said. 
Two of the affected suppliers, Kyungshin and Yura Corporation, said they were trying to boost production at their factories in South Korea and Southeast Asia to compensate for the disrupted supply from China. 
They both also plan to resume production at their Chinese factories after Feb. 9. 
""We are in an emergency,"" a Kyungshin official told Reuters.
Hyundai has seven factories in South Korea, catering to the local market and the United States, Europe, Middle East and other markets. 
Hyundai's production in South Korea accounts for about 40% of its global output. 
Hyundai's decision to halt assembly lines at home could delay supplies of its popular sport utility vehicles (SUVs) such as the Palisade and Genesis GV80.
The automaker recently turned in its best quarterly profit in more than two years and said it was on track for higher profit margins, aided by more sales of SUVs. 

The virus outbreak may slow manufacturing activities in automobiles and other sectors, Japanese trading house Mitsui & Co (T:8031) has warned.

828,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2020 03:20AM ET</span>","Bottled water firms turn on the taps with filters, flavors and fizz","By Silke Koltrowitz and Emma Thomasson
BERLIN/VEVEY, Switzerland (Reuters) - A German firm backed by bottled water giant Danone plans to launch a sparkling-water machine for the home early next year, its chief executive told Reuters, squarely taking aim at PepsiCo's SodaStream. 
Nestle, the bottled water market leader, is also considering a machine for the home with filters, flavors and fizz that would be a smaller version of its Refill+ dispensers being rolled out in cafeterias, hotels and offices this year.
Concerns about plastic waste and the environmental impact of transporting bottled water are prompting more people to drink straight from the tap, which is in turn pushing water firms to come up with new products to keep customers on board.
""Bottled water as we know it today, I don't think will exist in 30 years. You will see much more point-of-use solutions like ours,"" said Moritz Waldstein, chief executive of Mitte, the Berlin-based company backed by Danone.
""I am of the strong belief that it will be a fraction of the market size that we have today,"" he told Reuters.
The global bottled water market was worth $135.6 billion in 2019, according to market researcher Euromonitor International, and is expected to grow to $170.9 billion by 2022, with demand expanding fastest in Asia.
Like Nestle, Mitte is betting that concerns about plastic pollution and contamination of public water supplies mean consumers will want countertop devices at home that filter tap water, as well as adding fizz and flavors like SodaStream. 
In 2018, a Danone fund which invests in firms responding to growing environmental awareness joined a $10.6 million funding round for Mitte, which is developing a device to purify tap water and add minerals via cartridges.
Danone, the world's third-largest bottled water seller with brands such as Evian, Volvic and Badoit, had slightly lower water sales in its third quarter. It is also looking to boost plastic recycling and encourage alternatives - such as Mitte.
""We think there could be demand from sophisticated consumers who for many reasons will prefer to make their mineral water at home,"" said Danone Chief Executive Emmanuel Faber.
Mitte said it received extra funding from its shareholders in an investment round in December, including the Danone fund, and it might raise more money as interest had been very high.
Mitte's first machine to go on sale will both filter and carbonate water. Set to retail for about 200 euros ($220), it will mostly be sold online and Mitte will initially target top SodaStream markets such as Germany and Sweden.
The company also has high hopes for the United States. When it ran an online kickstarter campaign to raise funds in 2017, the most pre-orders for its machines came from the United States, followed by Germany and the United Kingdom.

U.S. MARKET FIZZES
Sparkling water has long been popular in western Europe but has only really taken off in North America in recent years as health-conscious consumers swap sweet colas for water, often flavored or with infused vitamins and minerals.
PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) CEO Ramon Laguarta said in October that SodaStream, which it bought in 2018 for $3.2 billion, was doing better than it expected, particularly in western Europe, Japan and Canada.
He said SodaStream was planning ""transformational programs"" in 2020 to boost penetration in the U.S. market, where Costco (NASDAQ:COST),  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) and Kohl's and  Target  (NYSE:TGT) currently sell it, with a basic device costing about $85. 
Nestle is also making a renewed drive to revive U.S. sales, where it has lagged rivals such as PepsiCo, LaCroix and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) in the sparkling and flavored water market.
In October, Nestle said it was overhauling its water division, which generates 9% of group sales, after it posted growth of just 0.5% in the first nine months of 2019.
Federico Sarzi Braga, the new head of Nestle's water business, told Reuters in his first interview that it would put more focus on its premium sparkling water brands Perrier and S.Pellegrino in the United States. 
""The value we can get from functional and flavored water is much higher,"" he said. ""So we play strongly in the premium and super premium segment, especially in sparkling.""
Sarzi Braga, an Italian who started out with Nestle in 2000 at S.Pellegrino, said products launched last year in the United States - including Perrier mixed with fruit juice and flavored S.Pellegrino Essenza - were selling very well.
U.S. sales of flavored, sparkling and functional water - water with added vitamins and minerals - rose 8% last year to represent 30% of the U.S. bottled water market, outpacing the overall market which grew 3.6%, said Euromonitor International.
The flavored, sparkling and functional category already makes up 45% of bottled water sales in western Europe and almost 75% in the world's biggest sparkling water market, Germany.
Nestle's top-selling bottled water, however, is the budget still brand Pure Life which has been suffering from the tap water revival and an increase in freight costs - which is where its Refill+ water dispensers come in. 
It has yet to finalize where the Refill+ system, due to be rolled out to businesses by mid-2020, will be launched first.

""From still water without flavor to caffeinated, carbonated raspberry water, you can do everything. You choose, pay with your smartphone and that's it,"" Nestle Chief Executive Mark Schneider told Reuters.

The company's shares were up 3.2% at 7,120 pence in early trading and were among the top gainers on Britain's blue-chip index.
In September, Ferguson named a new chief executive officer and said it would separate the UK operations in a bid to focus more on its U.S. business after billionaire activist investor Nelson Peltz's Trian fund took a 6% stake in Ferguson.
Ferguson could scrap its current American Depository Receipt program and list additional shares on an exchange in the United States, while remaining listed on the London Stock Exchange, the company said.
Another option would be to have the primary listing in the U.S., but give up its position in the FTSE 100 (FTSE) as Ferguson changes the category of its listing in London.
""The Board believes that Ferguson's natural long-term listing location is the USA but it is mindful that this is a complex issue for many of our existing shareholders,"" Chairman Geoff Drabble said.
Both proposals would require majority shareholder approval of 75%, said the Virginia-based firm, which mainly serves the repair, maintenance and improvement markets.
Separately, the company also announced a $500 million share repurchase. Jefferies analysts called the buyback a ""positive surprise"" highlighting Ferguson's strong cash generation.

Glencore, which in December forecast a modest decline in copper output over the next three years, shut its Mutanda mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo in November due to falling cobalt prices and rising costs and taxes.
In 2019, copper output fell 6% to 1.37 million tonnes while cobalt climbed 10% to 42,200 tonnes as ramping up of its Katanga mine in Congo was offset by the closure Mutanda. 
The London-listed company said copper output fell to 355,400 tonnes in the final quarter and cobalt production dropped to 11,900 tonnes.
Production of zinc, lead, ferrochrome and nickel fell slightly, missing forecasts, but the company kept its full year 2020 outlook unchanged.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The Singapore Airshow, Asia's biggest aerospace gathering, will go ahead as planned next week despite China's virus epidemic prompting some firms to pull out, but a key meeting of aviation officials has been canceled, organizers said on Tuesday.
The trade portion of the airshow, held every two years, is set to begin on Feb. 11 under the shadow of the virus outbreak that has prompted measures by several nations, including the wealthy city-state, to contain the spread of infections.
Singapore banned entry to all Chinese visitors and foreigners with a recent history of travel to China, which had raised concerns over the staging of the event.
The move comes as the death toll in mainland China from the flu-like virus rose to 425, with two other fatalities reported in Hong Kong and the Philippines.
The World Health Organization last week declared the virus, which has spread to almost two dozen countries, a global emergency.
""In view of the evolving 2019 novel coronavirus situation, the organizer will introduce enhanced precautionary measures to safeguard the well-being and safety of all attendees,"" Experia Events Pte Ltd said in a statement on Tuesday.
Additional temperature screenings will be conducted at the show's access points.
However, Experia said an aviation leadership summit scheduled on the eve of the event will be canceled as this will allow aviation executives to work out responses to the virus outbreak.
Aviation data firm OAG said there will be over 25,000 fewer flights operated to, from and within China this week compared to two weeks ago, with 30 airlines halting services.
Citing industry sources, Reuters reported earlier that the summit, which was to involve 300 aviation executives, comprising government officials, civil aviation authorities and airline executives, had been canceled.
International Air Transport Association Director General Alexandre de Juniac will no longer travel to Singapore, said a spokesman representing the airline body.
Ten companies from China, including Commercial Aircraft Corp of China, which is developing the C919 narrowbody jet, and another six exhibitors from four other countries, will not attend the airshow, Experia said.
Business jet manufacturers  Bombardier Inc , (TO:BBDb),  Textron Inc  (N:TXT) and General Dynamics Corp's (N:GD) Gulfstream division are among those that have pulled out.
However, Boeing (N:BA), Airbus (PA:AIR) and  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT), among the biggest exhibitors, said on Tuesday that they still plan to attend the show.
The lower attendance at the airshow, which is used as a barometer of the industry's health, is a poor omen for a sector grappling with a sharp fall in travel demand due to the virus.
At the last show in 2018, there were 54,000 trade attendees from 147 countries and 1,062 participating companies, some of whom end up signing deals covering commercial aviation, defense, maintenance and repair operations and business jets."

The company forecast an operating profit of 10 billion yen ($91.91 million) for the year ending in March, versus its previous forecast for a loss of 110 billion yen. That compares with an average loss forecast of 75.6 billion yen from 13 analysts polled by Refinitiv. 
Takeda surprised markets in May last year when it reversed its full-year profit forecast to a loss, citing costs linked to its $59 billion Shire deal. It later revised the forecast to a smaller loss on strong sales of its core drugs.
The Shire acquisition, which was completed in January 2019, expanded Takeda's pipeline and diversified its global sales, with half now coming from the United States. 
The drugmaker, now the 15th largest in the world by revenue, told investors in November it expects to launch 14 new products through fiscal 2024 that will deliver about $10 billion in peak yearly sales.
But while the Shire buy gave Takeda global heft, it left it with net debt of about $40 billion as of September 2019.
To pare down debt, Takeda has pledged to dispose of $10 billion worth of non-core assets. 
It completed $7 billion in divestitures in calendar 2019, including assets in the Middle East and Africa and a dry-eye drug sold for $5.3 billion to Novartis, Refinitiv data shows.
Takeda is focusing on five key business areas: oncology, gastroenterology, neuroscience, rare diseases, and plasma-derived therapies.

In the third quarter ending in December, Takeda had operating profit of 112.2 billion yen, based on Reuters calculations, about the same as the previous year.

SILVER SPRING, Md. (Reuters) - For the first time in nearly 50 years, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will examine asbestos testing for talc powders and cosmetics at a hearing on Tuesday.
Regulators are taking a closer look after finding asbestos, a known carcinogen, in several talc cosmetics and powders, including a bottle of Johnson & Johnson’s well-known Baby Powder. Citing those FDA results, some U.S. lawmakers and consumer advocates have called for stricter safety regulations to protect public health.
J&J, the market leader in talc powders, has defended the safety of its talc. The company said tests by labs it hired found no asbestos in samples from the same bottle the FDA examined - except for some the company attributed to contamination from a lab air conditioner.
In a statement, the company said it looks forward to the FDA’s ""thorough review of the most effective and reliable ways to test for asbestos in cosmetic talc.""
The hearing on asbestos testing in talc, the FDA’s first since 1971, will focus on testing standards recommended by a panel of government experts. The recommendations, published last month, embrace positions held by public health authorities and experts for plaintiffs who allege that contaminated talc products caused their cancers.
After hearing from the government panel, FDA officials will take public comment from consumer advocates, industry representatives and testing experts.
For decades, the cosmetic talc industry has largely been allowed to police itself with little oversight from the FDA. Although talc and asbestos are similar minerals often found together in the ground, the FDA has never required manufacturers to test for the carcinogen.
In a written report, the government panel said the talc industry’s standard test methods have ""long-recognized shortcomings in specificity and sensitivity.""
One of the most significant recommendations from the expert panel is that mineral particles found in talc products small enough to be drawn into the lungs, even those the industry would not call asbestos, should be counted as potentially harmful. The expert panel said both asbestos and look-alike minerals are suspected of causing ""similar pathological outcomes,"" so the ""distinction is irrelevant.""
The U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency have limited exposure to asbestos on the job and in the air to reduce cancers since the 1970s when the hazard was well established. A Reuters report in December (https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-health-fda-talc) showed that, during the same period, the FDA downplayed health concerns, including possible asbestos contamination, in talc powders and cosmetics and deferred again and again to manufacturers.
David Michaels, a former OSHA administrator during the Barack Obama administration, said he welcomed the public discussion because even small amounts of asbestos are unacceptable in easily-inhaled consumer products.
""I hope the national attention given to this issue will help insulate FDA from pressure from corporations that manufacture cosmetics and personal care products, who are likely to oppose the newly-recommended testing protocols,"" said Michaels, a professor at the George Washington University School of Public Health and author of a book, ""The Triumph of Doubt,"" which examines corporate influence on science.
The Personal Care Products Council, a cosmetics trade group, declined to comment before the hearing.
FDA spokeswoman Monique Richards said no decisions are expected to be made Tuesday, and the focus will be on gathering public feedback. The FDA has not announced a timetable for deciding whether it will pursue rules on testing.
The increased scrutiny on this issue follows a 2018 Reuters report (https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/johnsonandjohnson-cancer) which showed that although J&J knew for decades its raw talc and powders sometimes tested positive for asbestos, the company did not report those findings to the FDA."

SYDNEY/TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian stocks bounced on Tuesday with Chinese markets reversing some of their previous plunge amid official efforts to calm virus fears, although investor sentiment remained fragile with oil near 13-month lows.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) rose 1.5%, led by gains in South Korea (KS11) and Australia (AXJO). Japan's Nikkei (N225) edged 0.6% higher.
China's markets steadied in choppy trade after anxiety over the spreading coronavirus erased some $400 billion in market value from Shanghai's benchmark index on Monday as markets resumed from the Lunar New Year holiday.
The Shanghai Composite (SSEC) gained 1.2%, while the blue-chip CSI300 (CSI300) rebounded 2.5%, one day after a nearly 8% slide on Monday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng (HSI) advanced 1.0%.
Despite the relative market calm on Tuesday, the outbreak continued to generate concerning headlines with Hong Kong reporting its first coronavirus death, the second fatality outside mainland China with the total death toll now 427.

""Chinese authorities have been providing a lot of support for the financial markets. There's a level of assurance that the rout would not be allowed to go on much further than necessary,"" Christy Tan, head of markets strategy for Asia at National Australia Bank in Singapore.
""This could prove to be temporary if we see worse news or little sign of reaching containment of the (coronavirus) situation,"" she added.
In an effort to stop the plunge, China's state-backed Securities Times published an op-ed on Tuesday to call on investors not to panic.
That followed moves by China's securities regulator on Monday to limit short selling and stop mutual fund managers selling shares unless they face investor redemptions, according to Reuters.
China's central bank has flooded the economy with cash while trimming some key lending rates, but analysts suspect more will have to be done to offset the economic fallout from the virus.
""Given the extent of the shutdowns in China as well as the rapid rise in the virus that is likely to continue through March or April, a significant hit to China and regional growth is very likely,"" said JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) economist Joseph Lupton.
""We would assume that in addition to bridging any funding stresses, fiscal policies will need to be ramped up to support growth once the contagion gets under control.""
European markets were expected to follow suit, with major stock futures (STXEc1) (FDXc1) (FFIc1) trading up around 0.4-0.5%.
Elsewhere, E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 (ESc1) gained 0.6%, extending a 0.7% bounce overnight, even after disappointing earnings results from Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL).
Wall Street had taken comfort from a surprisingly solid reading of U.S. manufacturing with the Dow (DJI) ending Monday with a rise of 0.5%, while the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 0.7% and the Nasdaq (IXIC) 1.3%. (N)
""This is just a typical reversal after a big fall. Vague concerns about Wuhan virus are still weighing on U.S. stocks,"" said Masanari Takada, cross asset strategist at Nomura Securities in Tokyo.
U.S. factory activity rebounded in January after contracting for five straight months amid a surge in new orders, offering hope that a prolonged slump in business investment has probably bottomed out.
The upbeat report nudged Treasury yields up from deep lows and gave the U.S. dollar a modest lift.
The dollar firmed to 108.83 yen  from an overnight low of 108.30, while the euro faded a fraction to $1.1059 (EUR=) but remained well within recent snug ranges.
Against a basket of currencies, the dollar bounced back to 97.826 (=USD) from a trough of 97.406.
The offshore yuan gained 0.3% to 6.9935 yuan per dollar , in line with rebounds in Chinese shares and holding above its one-month low of 7.0230 per dollar hit in European trade on Monday.
The Aussie dollar rose 0.4% to $0.6718 , pulling away from the 10-1/2-year low of $0.6670 touched in October, after the Reserve Bank of Australia kept its main cash rate at a record low of 0.75%.
In the commodity markets, oil futures staged a modest rebound, one day after slumping to the lowest in more than a year on worries about the impact of the coronavirus on demand for fuel.
Brent crude (LCOc1) added 0.8% to $54.90 a barrel, while U.S. crude (CLc1) gained 1.1% to $50.67.
A swath of commodities from copper to iron ore joined oil in the dumpster amid fears the drag on Chinese industry and travel would sharply curb demand for fuel and resources.
The Dalian Commodity Exchange's most-traded iron ore futures contract , expiring in May, slumped as much as 6.1% to 569.50 yuan ($81.12) a tonne, its lowest since Nov. 12.

Spot gold was off at $1,572.41 per ounce , from a top of $1.591.46, as the dollar firmed and safe haven demand waned a little.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - AirAsia Group Bhd's (KL:AIRA) Tony Fernandes on Tuesday denied a now-defunct Formula 1 racing team formerly co-owned by him had any links to a bribery scandal involving the Malaysian airline's only plane supplier, Airbus SE (PA:AIR).
Fernandes, one of the aviation industry's best-known faces, on Monday stepped aside as chief executive of Asia's biggest budget airline for at least two months, as authorities investigate allegations that Airbus paid a bribe of $50 million through sponsorship of the Caterham F1 team to win orders from AirAsia.
AirAsia Chairman Kamarudin Meranun also stepped down along with Fernandes, though both will remain advisers. The AirAsia co-founders, who bought Caterham in 2011, issued a joint statement on Tuesday reiterating that they did nothing wrong.
""Caterham F1, the company alleged to have been sponsored improperly by Airbus, was at the relevant time a Formula 1 racing team that had gone round the globe promoting amongst others AirAsia, AirAsia X, GE and Airbus,"" Fernandes and Kamarudin said in the statement.
""Throughout the period we were shareholders in Caterham, the company made no profit and was eventually disposed of for 1 pound sterling in 2014. From start to finish, this was a branding exercise and not a venture to make profit.""
The allegations by Britain's Serious Fraud Office on Friday concerned a 2012 sponsorship agreement between the now-defunct racing team and Airbus' then-parent, EADS.
AirAsia runs an all-Airbus fleet of 274 planes. It is the world's largest customer of the A321neo single-aisle aircraft.
Shares of AirAsia fell 5% as the stock market opened in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday. Those of long-haul subsidiary  AirAsia X Bhd  (KL:AIRX) lost 8%.
Malaysia's MIDF Research downgraded its recommendation on AirAsia stock to ""neutral"" from ""buy"" on Tuesday whereas AmInvestment Bank maintained its ""sell"" rating.
""We find it difficult to argue for a case that 'business as usual' will prevail in the absence of the direct involvement of Fernandes and Kamarudin in the management and decision-making process of the company,"" AmInvestment Bank said in a client note.
""The duo are the founding members, visionaries and key strategists for the group. This could not have happened at a worse time, amidst the Wuhan conoravirus epidemic that is severely hurting the demand for air travel (which is partially offset by plunging prices of crude oil, and hence jet fuel)."""

A move to allow global funds to buy more government and corporate debt is unlikely to reverse sentiment hurt by record bond sales and shrinking returns, investors say.
“High bond supply means potential pressure on bond prices, so easier access to the local market does not mean a potential positive return in the near term,” said Arthur Lau, head of Asia ex-Japan fixed income at PineBridge Investments Asia Ltd.
Foreigners have turned cold on Indian debt in recent months, trimming holdings to a four-month low amid slowing growth and speculation that policy makers have limited scope to ease further after five rate cuts in 2019.
Rupee debt has climbed 1.5% since the start of the year, about half the gain posted by Indonesian notes, Asia’s other high-yielding bond market. The yield on 10-year bonds have declined 12 basis points this week, further diminishing the relative attractiveness of Indian debt.
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her budget speech on Saturday said certain categories of sovereign bonds will be fully opened to non-resident investors. She also announced raising investment limits in corporate bonds to 15% from the current 9%.
While greater access could boost inflows over time, the benefits may take time to materialize and focus is likely to remain on the looming $109 billion bond supply for now.
“It may be argued that overall interest in Indian bonds is anyway muted for now and hence these expansions may amount to little in the near term,” said Suyash Choudhary, head of fixed income at IDFC Asset Management Co.

ZTE and Huawei were designated as national security risks in November by FCC. In a filing on Monday, ZTE asked the U.S. authority to ""take additional time to assess ZTE’s enhancements in the area of U.S. export control and economic sanctions compliance and security controls in ZTE products.""

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - AirAsia Group (KL:AIRA) CEO Tony Fernandes and Chairman Kamarudin Meranun will step aside for at least two months while the airline and authorities investigate allegations Airbus paid a bribe of $50 million to win plane orders from the company.
A committee comprising the non-executive members of AirAsia's board will review the allegations and take any necessary action, Asia's biggest budget airline said on Monday.
Fernandes, one of the aviation industry's best known executives, and Kamarudin will remain advisers, however, ""in view of the current difficult economic circumstances facing the airline industry"", the company added.
Senior company executive Tharumalingam Kanagalingam will be the acting CEO, with the changes effective immediately.
In a joint statement, Fernandes and Kamarudin denied any allegations of wrongdoing or misconduct as directors of AirAsia.
""We would not harm the very companies that we spent our entire lives building up to their present global status,"" they said.
Shares of AirAsia and unit AirAsia X (KL:AIRX) fell on Monday after the allegations by Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) came to light on Friday. AirAsia stock fell as much as 11% to 1.27 ringgit, their lowest since May 2016, while AirAsia X dropped 12% to an all-time low of 11.5 Malaysian sen.
Malaysia's anti-graft agency is also investigating the allegations. AirAsia has said it never made any purchase decisions that were premised on Airbus (PA:AIR) sponsorship, and that it would fully cooperate with the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC).
Malaysia's Securities Commission said on Sunday it would also examine whether AirAsia broke securities laws.
The allegations were revealed as part of a record $4 billion settlement Airbus agreed with France, Britain and the United States. Prosecutors said the company had bribed public officials and hidden payments as part of a pattern of worldwide corruption.
""This agreement and the contents were arrived at without any reference to us; neither were any explanations sought from us,"" Fernandes and Kamarudin said in their statement.
""This is in clear violation of fundamental legal principles of fairness.""
Airbus said at the weekend it would not comment on the Malaysian investigations.
The SFO's allegations concern a 2012 sponsorship agreement between the now-defunct Caterham Formula 1 racing team, founded by Fernandes, and Airbus's then-parent, EADS.
The SFO said on Friday that between October 2013 and January 2015, EADS paid $50 million to sponsor a sports team which was jointly owned by two people described as AirAsia Executive 1 and Executive 2. It said Airbus employees offered an additional $55 million, though no payment was made.
Fernandes bought Caterham together with Kamarudin in 2011. 
The SFO said Executives 1 and 2 were ""key decision makers in AirAsia and AirAsia X, and were rewarded in respect of the order of 180 aircraft from Airbus"".
Analysts said the accusation against AirAsia comes at a particularly bad time as airlines grapple with a slowdown in business because of the fast-spreading coronavirus epidemic that has killed more than 300 people in China and disrupted air travel.

The Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component rose 0.1% and 1.2% respectively by 10:30 PM ET (02:30 GMT). 
 
Investors remained cautious and continued to monitor developments on the ongoing virus outbreak. In the latest tally, China said its total death toll from the virus stood at 425 and cases rose to more than 20,000.
 
As an attempt to support its plunging financial markets, the People’s Bank of China injected 400 billion yuan ($57 billion) into the banking system on Tuesday through reverse repurchase agreements. It was the the largest single-day addition in more than a year.
 
The Hang Seng Index advanced 1.2%. On Tuesday, a 39-year-old patient was confirmed to be the first death in Hong Kong after being diagnosed with the deadly coronavirus a week ago. 
 
On the data front, the city’s economy shrank by a seasonally adjusted 0.4% in the October-December period from the previous quarter, versus a revised 3.0% in July-September.
 
For the whole of 2019, real gross domestic product contracted by 1.2%, the first annual decline since 2009.

The CSI 300 Index of equities gained 1.4% at 9:37 a.m. local time. The broader Shanghai Composite Index climbed 0.4% with more than two stocks dropping for each that advanced.
Even for an equity market that’s no stranger to volatility, declines of Monday’s magnitude are rare. The CSI 300 Index has only dropped 7.5% or more on eight previous occasions in its almost 15-year history, and half of those were during the turmoil in 2015. The last time it happened -- around the yuan devaluation in August that year -- the benchmark fell another 7.1% the following day.
The CSI 300 slumped 7.9% Monday as mainland markets traded for the first time since Jan. 23. All but 162 of the 4,000-odd stocks in Shanghai and Shenzhen recorded losses, with about 90% dropping by the maximum allowed by the country’s exchanges. The huge number of shares trading limit down means it could take days for investors to execute their orders.
China set its daily yuan fixing stronger than the key 7 per dollar level on Tuesday in a signal of support even as the currency weakened past the key level on Monday. The People’s Bank of China set the daily reference rate at 6.9779 per dollar.

(Reuters) - A California lawmaker has introduced a bill aimed at making PG&E Corp (N:PCG) a publicly owned utility, a year after liabilities from wildfires traced back to some of its equipment pushed the power producer into bankruptcy.
""Today I'm introducing legislation to force PG&E to become a publicly owned utility,"" California State Senator Scott Wiener said on Monday, adding it was time for a new approach at the utility company.
""PG&E has failed. It's failed on safety & reliability. PG&E has forfeited its privilege to operate as an investor-owned monopoly in California,"" he said in a tweet The company said it opposed the bill from Wiener. ""PG&E's facilities are not for sale,"" a company spokesman told Reuters in an emailed statement.  ""Changing the structure of the company would not create a safer or cleaner operation. Recent takeover attempts have largely failed due to a range of factors,"" the spokesman said. The power producer said on Saturday it had submitted an updated reorganization plan including a new board of directors and new roles aimed at addressing concerns raised by California Governor Gavin Newsom. Newsom last month rejected an earlier PG&E reorganization plan saying it lacked major changes in governance and tougher safety enforcement mechanisms mandated under a recent state wildfire statute. The company filed for Chapter 11 protection in January last year, citing potential liabilities in excess of $30 billion from deadly wildfires in 2017 and 2018 linked to its equipment. 
Separately, it came under renewed criticism last year for precautionary power outages to guard against the risk of wildfires posed by extremely dry and windy weather.

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China has agreed to allow U.S. health experts into the country as part of a World Health Organization (WHO) effort to help fight the fast-spreading coronavirus, as the number of cases and deaths continued to mount.
In central China's Hubei province, epicenter of the epidemic, China state TV reported there were 2,345 new cases of the virus and another 64 deaths, bringing the total of virus-related fatalities in Hubei to 414 by Monday.
The Chinese stock market plunged about 8% on Monday, wiping $393 billion off the value of the Shanghai bourse, on the first day of trading following an extended Lunar New Year holiday in a bid to help keep people at home and contain the virus' spread.
The White House said on Monday China had accepted its offer to have U.S. experts as part of a WHO mission to study and help combat the virus that emerged in Hubei's provincial capital of Wuhan.
A 1,000-bed hospital built in eight days to treat people with the virus in Wuhan was due to receive its first patients on Monday, state media said. A second hospital with 1,600 beds is due to be operational later this week.
With Wuhan and some other Chinese cities in virtual lockdown, travel severely restricted and China facing increasing international isolation, fears of wider economic disruption are growing. Sources at the OPEC oil cartel told Reuters producers were considering cutting output by almost a third to support prices.
The WHO last week declared the flu-like virus a global emergency. It has spread to 23 other countries and regions. The Philippines reported the first coronavirus death outside of China.
Airlines around the world have stopped flights to parts of China. A suspension by the United Arab Emirates on Monday will affect the Gulf airlines Etihad and Emirates.
Earlier on Monday, China accused the United States of spreading fear by pulling its citizens out and severely restricting travel.
Washington has ""unceasingly manufactured and spread panic,"" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters, noting that the WHO had advised against trade and travel curbs.
""It is precisely developed countries like the United States with strong epidemic prevention capabilities and facilities that have taken the lead in imposing excessive restrictions contrary to WHO recommendations,"" she said.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defended the measures taken by the United States, including suspending the entry of foreign nationals who had visited China within the past 14 days.
""We made an aggressive decision in front of an unprecedented threat that action now had the biggest potential to slow this thing down. That's what the theory is here,"" said Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, as she noted that there are already some 17,000 cases of a virus for which the population does not have immunity.
'NO REASON' FOR TRAVEL CURBS
The WHO's director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, again said travel bans were unnecessary.
""There is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade,"" he told the WHO's executive board in Geneva.
""The chance of getting this (virus) going to anywhere outside China is very low, and even in China when you go to other provinces, it's very low,"" he added.
The outbreak is reminiscent of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a virus from the same family that emerged in China in 2002 and killed almost 800 people around the world out of the roughly 8,000 who were infected.
Chinese data suggests the new virus, while much more contagious than SARS, is significantly less lethal, although such numbers can evolve rapidly. Prior to the latest figures from Hubei, the number of confirmed infections in China stood at 17,205.
The WHO said at least 151 cases had been confirmed in 23 other countries and regions, including Japan, Thailand, Germany, Britain and the United States, which on Monday reported its second case of person-to-person transmission within its borders. 
Chinese President Xi Jinping said controlling the virus was his country's most important task, Xinhua state news agency said.
In addition to Monday's Chinese stock selloff, the yuan currency had its worst day since August, and Shanghai-traded commodities from oil to copper hit their lower limits - all despite the central bank's injection of 1.2 trillion yuan ($174 billion) into money markets.
The selloff did not extend to U.S. markets, which closed higher on Monday with the S&P 500 up 0.7%.
Fears over the effect of China's lockdown on global growth have slashed more than 22% off the price of the Brent global crude oil benchmark since its recent peak on Jan. 8.. 
Economists are predicting world economic output will be cut by 0.2 to 0.3 percentage point.
'YOU HAVE BEEN SPOTTED'
Taiwan's Foxconn, which makes smartphones for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other brands, has halted ""almost all"" of its production in China after companies were told to shut until at least Feb. 10, a source said. The company did not respond to a request for comment.

PARIS (Reuters) - Fallout from the Airbus bribery scandal reverberated around the world on Monday as the head of one of its top buyers temporarily stood down and investigations were launched in countries aggrieved at being dragged into the increasingly political row.
Airbus agreed on Friday to pay a record $4 billion in fines after reaching a plea bargain with prosecutors in Britain, France and United States over alleged bribery and corruption stretching back at least 15 years.
Now, it is bracing for a rocky period with airlines and foreign governments, some of which have complained they were not forewarned about the charges and claimed little knowledge of the sums of money swirling around their fleet purchases.
""Friday was the end of Act I, now we are seeing the beginning of Act II with possible repercussions on airline relationships,"" said a person close to the company.
Airbus declined to comment further after welcoming the agreement on Friday as an opportunity to ""turn the page"".
Prosecution documents agreed by Airbus detailed a global network of agents or middlemen in transactions across the group's business and run from a cell in Paris where the group had part of its headquarters, split between France and Germany. 
Outlines of the operation and its annual budget of 250 million to 300 million euros had been reported by Reuters.
Prosecutors also cited parallel projects or investments alongside some negotiations, including the sponsorship by Airbus' then-parent EADS of a Formula 1 team owned by top officials at AirAsia, a major customer.
Shares in AirAsia fell up to 11%.
AirAsia Group said Chief Executive Tony Fernandes and Chairman Kamarudin Meranun would step aside for at least two months while both the airline and government probed allegations.
In a joint statement, the two co-founders of Asia's largest budget airline denied any wrongdoing or misconduct.
""We would not harm the very companies that we spent our entire lives building up to their present global status."" 
Fernandes, one of aviation's best known executives, already faces domestic pressure after backing former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak in 2018 elections. Najib was ousted by Mahathir Mohamad, prompting Fernandes to apologize for backing the loser.
INQUIRIES LAUNCHED
In Ghana, a political storm erupted over accusations of Airbus payments to a relative of a government official in connection with the purchase of military transport planes.
Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) said the agent had no aerospace experience, having previously worked in football merchandising and as a facilities manager. It did not say what the agent, who had been helped by two unnamed British television actors, did with the money.
President Nana Akufo-Addo’s office said Ghana would ""conduct a prompt inquiry to determine the complicity or otherwise of any Ghanaian government official, past or present"".
The National Democratic Congress (NDC), which was in power at the time, said claims that Airbus paid bribes were false. 
In Colombia, airline Avianca said it had hired a law firm to investigate its relationship with Airbus and determine if it had been a victim of wrongdoing.
French prosecutors said in settlement documents that Airbus had agreed to pay multi-million dollar commissions to an agent over jet sales to Avianca, some of which were earmarked for a senior executive at the airline’s parent Avianca Holdings (CN:AVT_p).
The payments were thwarted by a freeze on agent commissions as Airbus tightened processes in 2014, they said.
Avianca is ultimately owned by Synergy Group, formerly the vehicle of Bolivian-born entrepreneur German Efromovich who bought the airline out of bankruptcy in 2004 and grew it to become Latin America's No. 2. He lost control of Synergy in 2019. Contacted by Reuters, Efromovich declined to comment. 
Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa ordered a full investigation after Britain's SFO reported that Airbus had hired the wife of a SriLankan Airlines executive as its intermediary in connection with aircraft negotiations.
Airbus misled UK export credit agency UKEF over her name and gender, while paying her company $2 million, the SFO said. 
Korean Air and Taiwan's China Airlines declined to comment on allegations of payments to intermediaries over jet purchases.
Settlements in France and the United States also trained a spotlight on dealings in China, which tends to be supplied through large plane orders coinciding with state visits. 
Prosecutor findings issued with the settlement detailed alleged bribery and hospitality paid for using money diverted from a pilot training fund, into which Airbus made payments.
Analysts had said Airbus is poised to win more business in China as a result of recent U.S.-Chinese trade tensions, though the prospect of a trade deal has also boosted Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co.

Chinese aviation officials, many affected by an order to government officials to work at home due to the coronavirus outbreak, could not be reached for comment. But the foreign ministry said, ""China has always attached great importance to its cooperation with France in the aviation industry"".

857,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2020 06:43PM ET</span>",United Airlines suspending U.S.-bound mainland China flights a day earlier,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - United Airlines said on Monday it will move up its temporary suspension of U.S.-bound flights from mainland China by one day to Tuesday.
The airline, which is the last U.S. airline still conducting China flights, said on Friday it planned to fly its last flight from China on Wednesday because of the coronavirus outbreak.
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) moved up its suspension of flights over the weekend. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) ended its flights from mainland China on Friday. United said Monday it still plans to resume flights to and from China on March 28. 
The Trump administration on Friday said it was barring nearly all foreign visitors who have been to China within the past 14 days to address the threat of the virus.
The White House said initially it was limiting flights from China and for Americans who have visited China within the last 14 days to seven major U.S. airports for enhanced screening: New York's JFK, Chicago's O'Hare, San Francisco, Seattle-Tacoma, Honolulu, Los Angeles and Atlanta.
On Sunday, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said it was adding four additional airports to the seven that are allowed to receive flights from China -- Dallas, Detroit, Newark, and Washington Dulles.
The new rules mean airlines must now ask U.S.-bound passengers from all destinations if they have visited mainland China. Airlines are expected to scrutinize passports of travelers, and warned the new rules could require passengers to arrive even earlier for U.S.-bound flights.
American Airlines said Sunday it encouraged U.S.-bound passengers ""to arrive at the airport three hours early as we expect this additional screening will lengthen the normal check-in process.""
The new rules do not impact cargo-only flights, DHS said. Many other nations are imposing similar restrictions.

DHS said Sunday none of the restrictions impact flights or visitors from Hong Kong or Macau.

858,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 03, 2020 06:00PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch Feb. 4,"By Kim Khan
Investing.com – Here are three things that cold rock markets tomorrow.
1.  Disney  Reports; Market Anxious for China Update
Dow component Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) will report earnings after the bell tomorrow.
The company is expected to report a profit of $1.46 per share on revenue of about $20.8 billion, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
All things being equal, investors woul probably be most interested in more updates and numbers from the Disney+ streaming service as it takes on Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and others in the hot space.
But what the company has to say about any impact it’s seeing and expects from the coronavirus could take the spotlight.
Disney temporarily shut down its amusement parks in China – Shanghai Disneyland and Disneytown -- to limit the spread of the disease.
Last week, Needham lowered its quarterly estimates for the company, citing lower political advertising demand at broadcasting and lower box office (offset by lower marketing spending).
Before the bell, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) will issue its numbers.
Analysts are looking for earnings of 80 cents per share and revenue of about $8.2 billion.
Energy shares were hammered last week on earnings, particularly ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), and the landscape is looking grim at the moment, with oil prices pressured by worries of Chinese demand slumping on the virus impact.
2. Factory Orders, API Inventories on Tap
The economic calendar is fairly light tomorrow.
At 10:00 AM ET (15:00 GMT), the Commerce Department will release the latest figures on factory orders.
December factory orders are expected to have risen 1.2%, reversing the drop of 0.7% in November.
For energy traders, the American Petroleum Institute will issue its measure of weekly U.S. oil inventories.
The API snapshot serves as a guide for the official figures out Wednesday, but the two sets of numbers often diverge.
Last week API reported a drawdown of about 4.3 million barrels in crude stockpiles.
Oil entered a bear market today, down 20% from recent highs, and WTI and Brent fell below important technical levels.
3. First Voting Round for Democrats
Investors will also have politics to contend with tomorrow, with the results of the Iowa Caucuses come out tonight, the first hurdle for Democratic presidential nominee hopefuls.
If candidates like Sen. Elizabeth Warren or Sen. Bernie Sanders do well, that could weigh on equities. Both have platforms that Wall Street sees as unfriendly, to say the least.
The caucus voting in Iowa starts at 7:00 PM ET (00:00 GMT).
Late Tuesday night, President Donald Trump will give his State of the Union speech at 9:00 PM ET."
859,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2020 05:51PM ET</span>",China's 'perfect storm' a boon to Brazil's meat producers: ABPA,"By Ana Mano
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's meat industry association ABPA said a ""perfect storm"" of health and food security concerns in China promises to drive up demand for South American meat, giving Brazilian meatpacker shares a boost on Monday.
China reported a new outbreak of bird flu on Saturday while millions of chickens face the prospect of starvation amid a lockdown in Hubei province, near the epicenter of the coronavirus epidemic.
That comes as Chinese meat suppliers are still grappling with the lasting effects of African swine fever (ASF), which decimated a major portion of the country's pig population.
""ASF, coronavirus and bird flu influence consumer habits and may drive Chinese demand for Brazilian meat,"" Francisco Turra, president of ABPA, told Reuters in a telephone interview.
""Our representatives in China tell us that there are major concerns over food security.""
Brazil stands to benefit as a safe source of meat, having never had a case of bird flu or African swine fever, he added.
The country has capacity to step in to cater to at least some of the additional Chinese demand for imported poultry, having processed some 6 billion birds last year, Turra said.
Shares in the world's largest chicken exporter, BRF SA (SA:BRFS3), rose 6% in São Paulo trading Monday before paring gains to 3.4%, while shares of rival JBS SA (SA:JBSS3) rose 3.7% before falling back to 2%.
Bloomberg reported on Thursday, citing letters from Hubei's poultry association, that the lockdown of the province threatened more than 300 million chickens due to an imminent shortage of feed.
Turra said the threat comes as China has been trying to increase local poultry output to substitute for pork, whose production has suffered due to swine fever.
Before the problems associated with the coronavirus and bird flu, China had been expected to produce some 12 million tonnes of chicken this year and Brazil around 14 million tonnes, Turra said.
Last year, Chinese imports of Brazilian chicken rose 34% while its imports of Brazilian pork jumped 61%, according to ABPA figures."
860,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2020 05:40PM ET</span>","Houlihan Lokey named as adviser on U.S. overhaul of Fannie, Freddie","By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. housing finance regulator has selected investment bank Houlihan Lokey Capital Inc as its financial adviser for a potential overhaul of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency said in a statement Monday that Houlihan Lokey will advise on how the mortgage finance giants could be rebuilt into fully private companies. The firm will be paid up to $45 million in fees over 5.5 years.
Houlihan Lokey will advise on ""business and capital structures, market impacts and timing, and available capital raising alternatives,"" the FHFA said.
The selection of a financial adviser was seen as a critical step in any effort to return Fannie and Freddie to the private market, after operating under a government conservatorship since being bailed out in 2008. The FHFA's director, Mark Calabria, previously had said he wanted the FHFA to hire an adviser before Fannie and Freddie hired their own to avoid a conflict.
The Trump administration has said it is a priority to recapitalize the pair, which guarantee over half of the nation's mortgages, and remove them from their government lifeline.
Calabria said in a statement that he planned to release a new capital rule for the companies in the ""near future.""

The regulator will pay Houlihan $9 million for the first year of work, with options to extend the relationship for four and a half more years and up to $45 million more in fees.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) canceled its annual partners meeting scheduled for this week because travel restrictions resulting from the deadly coronavirus outbreak prevented some Asia-based employees from making it to the bank's New York headquarters, according to two people familiar with the plans.
Goldman's global partners meeting, an annual week-long event for the firm's roughly 400 most elite employees, was canceled late last week, the people said.
Chief Executive Officer David Solomon will instead host a townhall meeting for about 250 of the partners able to attend in New York, one of the people said.
The flu-like coronavirus has interrupted global business and trade as airline companies worldwide have suspended flights to parts of China, and the U.S. on Friday said it was barring entry to foreign nationals who have recently visited China.
The death toll in China, where the virus first emerged in December, rose to 361 as of Sunday, and there were more than 17,200 cases confirmed in 23 countries worldwide, authorities said.

Carnival (NYSE:CCL) Shares Fall as Passenger Tests Positive (1:20 p.m. NY)
Carnival Corp.’s Princess Cruises said a recent passenger in Asia tested positive for coronavirus, prompting Japanese health officials to delay the ship he’d been on while they conduct a review of all guests and crew.
Princess said in an emailed statement Monday that the passenger embarked in Yokohama, Japan, on Jan. 20 and disembarked in Hong Kong on Jan. 25. The ship, Diamond Princess, then continued its round-trip journey to ultimately take other passengers back to Yokohama, which is near Tokyo.
On Saturday, the passenger, who was from Hong Kong, tested positive for coronavirus at a local hospital there, according to Princess. The episode comes just days after a ship from Carnival’s Costa Crociere unit was put on lockdown at a port near Rome over concerns that passengers might have had coronavirus. Those passengers were eventually diagnosed with the flu.

CDC Seeks Emergency Approval for Virus Test (11:58 a.m. NY)
U.S. health officials are seeking emergency approval to roll out a test for the coronavirus that can be used by hospitals and state health authorities, instead of having samples shipped to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for analysis.
The agency is preparing for the outbreak as if it will be a pandemic that spreads widely from China to other countries, including the U.S., said Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. The goal of public health officials is to slow the virus’s entry into the U.S., she said.
Federal and local health authorities have been monitoring people who have displayed symptoms and have a travel history that puts them at risk. The vast majority have tested negative: There are 11 confirmed cases in the U.S., and 167 people who have a negative test. It’s possible that some people can test negative and then have a positive result later, depending on how far along their illness is.
The severity of the U.S. cases has varied, with some people becoming more severely ill, Messonnier said. Some have needed oxygen, she said.

It has a clause that states the U.S. and China will consult “in the event that a natural disaster or other unforeseeable event” delays either from complying with the agreement.

By Yasin Ebrahim 
Investing.com - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) reported on Monday fourth-quarter earnings that beat analysts' forecasts, but revenue fell short amid slowing growth in its core advertising business. 

Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) announced earnings per share of $15.35 on revenue of $46.08 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $12.50 on revenue of $46.91 billion.
That compares to EPS of $12.77 on revenue of $39.28 billion in the same period a year before. Alphabet had reported EPS of $10.12 on revenue of $40.5 billion in the previous quarter. 
The company’s core advertising business grew 16% to $37.9 billion, slower than the 20% growth from last year’s fourth quarter.
Cost per click on Google properties -- the amount Alphabet charges advertisers for each ad placed on its web sites -- grew 18% from last quarter, underpinning hopes that Google’s pricing power for ads has steadied, following a wobble last year.
Against calls from investors for the company to provide more insight into the performance of its businesses, Alphabet provided growth metrics for its cloud business, search and YouTube. 
“In 2019 we again delivered strong revenue growth, with revenues of $162 billion, up 18% year over year and up 20% on a constant currency basis,” said Ruth Porat, chief financial officer of Alphabet and Google. “To provide further insight into our business and the opportunities ahead, we’re now disclosing our revenue on a more granular basis, including for Search, YouTube ads and Cloud.”
Google cloud revenue surged 53% $32.52 billion for the quarter year on year, YouTube grew 31% and search was up about 17%. 
Operating income was $9.27 billion for the quarter, below consensus estimates of the $9.86 billion consensus on margin growth of 20%, short of estimates of 21%.
“The biggest positive is that investors, for the first time, are seeing the breakdown of Google’s main revenue-generating units, such as its fast-expanding cloud business,” Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar said.
“These results will not awe the Street, but they can’t be seen as a big disappointment,” Anwar said.
“More transparency in the company’s financial reporting means the practice will provide a greater insight to investors where the ad giant stands in terms of competition and where it’s facing competitive pressures,” he added.

Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) shares are up 10% from the beginning of the year, still down 1.17% from its 52-week high of $1,500.58 set on January 22. They are outperforming the Nasdaq which is up 2.59% year to date.

Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) lost 4.5% in after-hours trade following the report.

Shares of the company fell 4% in extended trading.
The company reported a net income of $10.67 billion, or $15.35 per Class A and B common share and Class C capital share, for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $8.95 billion, or $12.77 per share, a year earlier.
Revenue jumped 17.3% to $46.08 billion.

Investing.com – The S&P bounced back from a rout last week, with investors pouring into beaten-down stocks as China's efforts to limit the impact on global growth from the coronavirus and strong U.S. stronger manufacturing data supported sentiment. 
The S&P 500 rose 0.73%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.34% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.51%.
Fears about a significant slowdown in China denting global growth eased somewhat after the People's Bank of China said it would inject stimulus of $21.7 billion to curb the expected impact on the economy.
The action by China's central bank stoked hopes that other central banks could follow suit and adopt ultra-easy monetary policy in the event of a pandemic.
But Allianz (DE:ALVG) Chief Economic Adviser Mohamed El-Erian warned that central banks were nearing a point where they are ""ineffective if not counterproductive"" in solving current issues.
Beyond virus concerns, consumer discretionary raked up gains on a rally in   Nike   (NYSE:NKE) and Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) amid favorable upgrades from analysts on Wall Street.
Nike rose about 3% after UBS upgraded its rating on the company to buy from neutral and its price target to $136 from $103. The athletic footwear and apparel maker’s product innovation investments and e-commerce business are expected to boost growth, UBS said.
In addition, J.P Morgan added the stock to its Analyst Focus List.
Goldman Sachs upgraded Ulta to buy from neutral and raised its price target on the stock to $307 from $285, citing a favorable valuation at current levels. There is little chance that of Ulta's operating margins ""unraveling"" in the event that its sales growth slows further, the investment bank said. Shares were up nearly 3%.
A rebound in manufacturing, meanwhile, also added conviction to the rally on Wall Street.
ISM manufacturing data for January showed an uptick to 50.9, beating expectations of 48.5. 
The energy sector kept gains in check, however, as oil prices fell into a bear market, down more than 20% from their recent peak amid ongoing worries about the virus impact on air travel.
In other news, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) continued to advance, surging 20% after Argus boosted its price target on the stock to $808 from $556, on expectations for continued growth following the electric vehicle's better-than-expected quarterly results reported last week."

870,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 03, 2020 03:15PM ET</span>","Virus Jolts China Economy, Forcing Rethink on Almost Everything","(Bloomberg) -- China is preparing steps to adjust to a slower rate of economic growth as coronavirus shows few signs of abating.
Officials are evaluating whether to soften the economic-growth target for 2020, while state-owned liquefied natural gas importers are considering declaring themselves unable to fulfill some obligations on cargo deliveries -- known as force majeure -- according to people familiar with the matter. And authorities in Beijing are hoping the U.S. will agree to some flexibility on pledges in their phase-one trade deal, people close to the situation said.
Two-thirds of the Chinese economy will remain closed this week as several provinces took the extraordinary step of extending the Lunar New Year holiday to help curb the spread of the disease that’s claimed more than 360 lives, with confirmed cases reaching almost 17,400.
Below is a wrap of the considerations:
Potential GDP Reduction
The annual growth target is typically unveiled in March at the country’s legislative session after being endorsed by top leaders at the yearly closed-door Central Economic Work Conference in December. Economists had expected China would aim for output growth of “around 6%” this year after seeking a range of 6% to 6.5% in 2019. Bloomberg Economics reckons growth could dip to 4.5% in the current quarter.
Officials are also considering further measures to shore up the economy, including selling more special government bonds, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing the private talks. They also could increase the planned cap on the ratio of the budget deficit to gross domestic product, they said.
This year’s legislative gathering, which is scheduled to begin March 5, could be delayed as the epidemic disrupts work across the country.
China’s State Council Information Office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Any changes to the growth target would have to be approved by top leaders of the Communist Party.
LNG Deliberations
Oil consumption in China, the world’s the top crude importer and second-biggest LNG buyer, is already estimated to have dropped by 20%, which is expected to cause fuel makers to cut back production and seek to delay some oil shipments. A decline in gas demand is similarly forcing buyers to consider postponing deliveries to cope with high inventories.
LNG importers including China National Offshore Oil Corp. are still assessing the impact on consumption and haven’t decided yet whether to make the declarations, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the information isn’t public. Firms declare force majeure when they’re unable to meet contractual obligations for reason beyond their control.
CNOOC and PetroChina Co. have begun drafting the necessary documents to issue the declarations, in case they decide to move ahead, said the people. Sinopec Corp. is also considering force majeure.
PetroChina and Sinopec declined to comment. Nobody answered multiple calls to CNOOC.
U.S. Trade
The U.S. and China on Jan. 15 sealed the first phase of a trade agreement that’s supposed to take effect in mid-February. It has a clause that states the nations will consult “in the event that a natural disaster or other unforeseeable event” delays either from complying with the accord. It’s unclear whether China has formally requested such a consultation yet, but the people familiar with the matter said the plan is to ask for it at some point.
A spokesman for U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said Washington hadn’t received any request from China to discuss changes in Beijing’s purchase commitments. The Chinese Commerce Ministry didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
In the first year of the deal, China committed to buy an extra $76.7 billion of American goods beyond what it did in 2017, and an additional $123.3 billion in the second year. Purchases of agricultural products are particularly important for the livelihoods of American farmers who’ve been hurt in an escalating tariff war with China over the past two years and are a key base of support for President Donald Trump.
Read the latest on impact of the coronavirus from Bloomberg Economics
Even before the outbreak, China’s economy was already slowing amid weak domestic demand, a crackdown on debt and the trade war with the Trump administration. GDP expanded 6.1% last year, the least in almost three decades, and just within the range targeted by President Xi Jinping’s administration.
In a containment scenario -- with a severe but short-lived impact -- the virus could take China’s first-quarter gross domestic product growth down to 4.5% year on year, according to Bloomberg Economics. That’s a drop from 6% in the final period of 2019 and the lowest since quarterly data that begins in 1992.
Most of China’s provinces said before the virus became widespread they’re expecting slower economic growth in 2020, with at least 22 out of 31 major cities, provinces and autonomous regions cutting their targets as of Jan. 21, according to their work reports which lay out plans for this year.
China’s central bank took its first concrete steps to cushion the economy and plunging markets from the blow of the virus, providing short-term funding to banks and cutting the interest rate it charges for the money.

On Monday, Chinese officials were said to be seeking flexibility on their pledges under the deal signed with the U.S. last month, as the Asian nation struggles to contain the virus that’s already spreading around the world.
“This is destroying the narrative of economic green shoots that we saw build up throughout November, December -- the deal with the U.S. and China is basically dead,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank A/S. “There’s no way China can live up to the agreement of the phase-one deal. So growth is going to be delayed.”
Copper futures for March delivery fell 0.4% to settle at $2.507 a pound at 1:06 p.m. on the Comex in New York, after touching $2.4875, the lowest for a most-active contract in five months. The metal has dropped for 13 consecutive sessions, the longest slump in data going back to 1988.
Before traders in China returned from the Lunar New Year holiday on Monday, the sell-off in copper had been deepening amid fears that the virus outbreak will hurt global economic growth, denting demand for the metal used in everything from electronics to automobiles.

China’s importance to the copper market has grown considerably, with its share of global consumption expanding by about 30% since 2003, when the SARS epidemic broke out, according to Capital Economics analyst Kieran Clancy.
Capital Economics estimates the virus will shave about 500,000 tons from global demand, bigger than the 125,000-ton hit during during SARS epidemic.
Hopes for further recovery in global trade, stemming from strong Chinese December trade data and the signing of the deal between the U.S. and China, “have now been stopped in their tracks, and we anticipate global new orders and business expectations indices will drop sharply when next published,” said Colin Hamilton, analyst at BMO Capital Markets. Some Chinese buyers are expected not to honor contracts for commodities currently en route, according to Hamilton."

Investing.com – Seagate edged higher Monday, just a day ahead of its fiscal second-quarter report after one analyst upgraded the storage company to buy, forecasting shares to rise by about a fifth.
Stifel upgraded shares of Seagate to buy from hold and raised its price target on the stock to $70, nearly 20% above current levels. Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) rose 0.9%.
Losing about 8% from its recent peak on Jan.24, shares of Seagate are now a buying opportunity, with a valuation made all the more attractive by a favorable backdrop for data center fundamentals, Stifel suggested.
But not everyone agrees amid concerns about near-term demand and the impact of the coronavirus risk. 
Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson remained on the sidelines, maintaining his neutral rating on Seagate, on worries about a lofty valuation. And expressed concerns that the company will ""not be able to meet forward expectations in light of what we expect to be flattish nearline market demand, slower immediate 16 TB penetration rates, and now coronavirus related risk.""
""Seagate's operations in Suzhou, could potentially be directly impacted by the coronavirus outbreak,"" Bryson added.

In a statement, Treasury said it would borrow $367 billion during the January-March quarter, $22 billion less than its previous estimate, assuming an end-March cash balance of $400 billion.
It said the reduction in borrowing was due to changes in fiscal projections in which a lower cash deficit was ""somewhat offset"" by a lower beginning quarter cash balance.
In October, Treasury said it expected to issue $389 billion in net marketable debt in the January-March period.
Treasury said it expects to pay down $56 billion during the April-June quarter, assuming an end-June cash balance of $400 billion.

TOKYO/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's stock surged 17% on Monday, taking its rise since early June to over 300%, fueled by a quarterly profit at Panasonic's battery business with the U.S. car maker and an investor report predicting its shares would rise more than ten-fold by 2024.
Shares of Tesla have rallied over 30% since the car maker run by Chief Executive Elon Musk posted its second consecutive quarterly profit last Wednesday, which was viewed as a milestone for the company competing against established heavyweights including General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and BMW. 
The stock on Monday was on track for its largest one-day gain since October after Panasonic Corp reported the first quarterly profit in its U.S. battery business with Tesla, which followed years of production troubles and delays.
That added to recent gains driven by Tesla's better-than expected financial results and ramped up production at its new car factory in Shanghai.
""We are catching up as Tesla is quickly expanding production,"" Panasonic Chief Financial Officer Hirokazu Umeda told an earnings briefing, referring to battery cell production.
""Higher production volume is helping to push down materials costs and erase losses.""
Musk last April said that battery production had become a constraint on output of Tesla's Model 3 sedans.
Adding to jubilance around Tesla, investment management firm Ark Invest, in a note dated Jan. 31, said it expects the company's stock to hit $7,000 by 2024, compared to its current price of $754. It based that prediction in part on Tesla launching a fleet of profitable ""robotaxi"" autonomous cars. 
Musk told investors last April that robotaxis with no human drivers would be available in some U.S. markets in 2020, a claim met with skepticism by experts who said the company's technology was nowhere near ready.
Tesla's recent rally has pummeled short sellers. Almost $16 billion worth of Tesla's shares are currently short sold, making the company the most shorted on Wall Street, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm.
Panasonic first invested in Tesla in 2010 and announced its partnership in building the U.S. firm's Gigafactory plant in Nevada in 2014 as part of its strategic shift from low-margin consumer electronics to automotive components.
But as its $1.6 billion Gigafactory investment failed to produce solid returns, Panasonic has grown cautious about its battery business with Tesla.
It chose not to build a new battery plant for Tesla in China, ceding its battery cell monogamy as Tesla entered into a partnership with South Korea's LG Chem Ltd and China's CATL.
""We will focus on demand at Gigafactory for Model 3 and Model Y,"" Umeda said. 
Panasonic is turning to Toyota Motor Corp for battery partnership, setting up a joint venture for electric vehicle (EV) batteries in April.
Panasonic said operating profit for the October-December quarter rose 3% to 100.4 billion yen ($915 million), beating analysts' estimates by 49%, thanks to the improvement at the Tesla battery business as well as cost cuts.
It maintained its profit forecast for the year through March at 300 billion yen, above an average estimate of 295.14 billion yen by 20 analysts.

Investing.com – Sometimes it just takes a little star power to shake off the worries about a stock.
  Canada Goose Holdings Inc  . (NYSE:GOOS) had been struggling in recent sessions on concerns about how much the coronavirus would affect the Chinese economy and, consequently, the demand for its clothing in that important country.
The company said in its third-quarter earnings report that revenue in Asia nearly doubled. It reports fourth-quarter earnings on Feb.7.
Shares bounced 3% higher today.
The company announced it had signed a deal for supermodel and actress Kate Upton to become a Goose Person.

The shaving market has long been dominated by Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG), which makes Gillette brand razors, and Edgewell, which makes Schick and many private label razors. But it has been shaken up with the arrival of Harry's, which began online and later entered brick and mortar stores.
The arrival of the upstart forced its bigger rivals to lower prices, said Daniel Francis, deputy director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition.
""The loss of Harry's as an independent competitor would remove a critical disruptive rival that has driven down prices and spurred innovation in an industry that was previously dominated by two main suppliers, one of whom is the acquirer,"" the FTC said in a statement.
Edgewell Chief Executive Officer Rod Little said the company was evaluating the FTC decision. Harry's co-CEOs, Jeff Raider and Andy Katz-Mayfield, said they were disappointed by the FTC's opposition to a sale.

PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad/CARACAS (Reuters) - Trinidad and Tobago has canceled an agreement with Venezuela for the joint development of a natural gas field straddling their maritime border because of U.S. sanctions on Venezuela's state energy company PDVSA.
The Caribbean island nation is a major exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG), but its own offshore natural gas output has been declining in recent years.
That has raised the possibility of using gas from neighboring Venezuela, which has large untapped offshore gas reserves, to feed LNG plants in Trinidad.
Trinidad and Tobago's prime minister, Keith Rowley, said on Monday during an energy conference in Port of Spain that the two countries will now independently develop the 10.04 trillion cubic feet Loran-Manatee shallow-water field.
""Progress in the development of the unitized Loran-Manatee field has been impeded by the sanctions imposed by the U.S. government, which inhibits U.S. companies from doing business with Venezuelan oil company PDVSA,"" Rowley said.
Under the agreement signed between the two countries in 2013, 73.75% of the joint field belongs to Venezuela and the rest to Trinidad and Tobago.
U.S. oil major  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) holds a 60% interest in the Loran field, with the remainder held by PDVSA, while Shell (LON:RDSa) Trinidad and Tobago holds a 100% interest in the Manatee field.
PDVSA, the Venezuelan oil ministry, Chevron and Shell did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Washington slapped sanctions on PDVSA last year in a bid to oust socialist President Nicolas Maduro. He has overseen an economic collapse and is accused by the United States and others of corruption and human rights violations.
PDVSA's output has declined, but exports have increased in recent months and Maduro remains in power.
Rowley said gas production from the Manatee field could start by 2024 or 2025 at rates ranging from 270 to 400 million standard cubic feet per day.
He said the decision to independently develop their fields also has implications for the development of other cross-border fields, the Mankin-Cocuina and the Kapok-Doradoh.
These are estimated to hold 850 billion cubic feet of gas within the Trinidad and Tobago maritime area."

By Kim Khan 

Investing.com - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares continued their breathtaking run Monday, blowing past $700 per share and gaining more than $100 in the session.

Tesla stock jumped 16% in afternoon trading, getting as high as $769 per share earlier, showing the hallmarks of a short squeeze.

Another price target hike for the stock arrived from the sell side, with Argus boosting its forecast for shares to $808, near the highest on Wall Street. Argus maintained its buy rating on the stock.
""Our positive view assumes continued revenue growth from the legacy Model S and Model X, as well as strong demand for the new Model 3, which accounted for more than 80% of 4Q19 production,” Argus analyst Bill Selesky wrote in a note, according to StreetInsider.

“Despite past production delays, parts shortages, labor cost overruns, and other difficulties, we expect Tesla to benefit from its dominant position in the electric vehicle industry and to improve performance in 2020 and beyond,"" Selesky said.
But with the way shares are running the way they are, the new price target could be eclipsed by midweek.
 
Earlier, Chinese battery maker CATL confirmed it had signed a deal to supply the automaker. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has recently commissioned its new factory in Shanghai and had flagged last week that it had diversified battery suppliers beyond traditional partner Panasonic.

Those short Tesla must be wondering what has to happen to the stock to retreat. Even amid Friday’s broad and bloody selloff, shares ended in the green.
The overall consensus estimate for shares from analysts is still way off the pace at about $456, so expect more target hikes in the near term."

The alleged spying case dates back more than 15 years and has roiled Spain's corporate sector. In July the High Court placed BBVA, the country's second-largest bank, under formal investigation as part of the case.
News websites El Confidencial and Moncloa.com reported last year that BBVA had hired Grupo Cenyt, led by Jose Manuel Villarejo, to investigate officials of construction company Sacyr (MC:SCYR) as part of efforts to halt its 2004 takeover bid for the bank.
On Monday, Spain's High Court lifted the secrecy order in the case, releasing some of the details of an investigation that began in December 2018.
The investigating judge said the BBVA had hired Villarejo for services of ""illicit character,"" amounting to what the court described as a crime of ""passive bribery.""
BBVA declined to comment on Monday, instead referring to comments made last Friday by its chairman, Carlos Torres, who denied any personal involvement in the case linked to the bank and added that the bank bore no responsibility.
No members of the current board have been put under investigation regarding the case.
The bank has officially acknowledged that it hired Grupo Cenyt. But BBVA, which is being investigated on offences of bribery, disclosure of secrets and corruption in business and is also conducting its own probe, has said it had not found any evidence of spying."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) said on Monday it will give $20 million to seven nonprofit groups working to prevent youth suicide and fight depression and other children's mental health problems. 
Calling the initiative the Morgan Stanley Alliance for Children's Mental Health, the bank aims to recruit other donors to help fund the rapid expansion of the groups in the United States, Britain and Hong Kong. 
Roughly 17 million people in the United States under age 18 have a mental health disorder, but the vast majority will never receive treatment, said Joan Steinberg, president of Morgan Stanley's foundation.
""We are not going to make a dent in this problem by ourselves,"" said Steinberg. ""The problem is way bigger than any one us. But we are all hiring these kids when they grow up.""
The bank's grants will substantially increase funding for the Jed Foundation, a U.S. group that works to combat teen suicide, and the Steve Foundation, which promotes mental health and emotional well-being for students of color. 
Non-profits like these run lean operations, Steinberg said, and the Morgan Stanley grants are among the largest either group has ever received. The Jed Foundation reported total revenues of $8.9 million in 2018, and the Steve Foundation reported $1.15 million, according to tax filings. 
""Our hope is to bring capital to the table, ours and other groups — private philanthropy, our clients, employees and our (Wall Street) peers,"" said Steinberg.
Some of the groups will use the money to make their resources available to more communities, she said.
For example, Child Mind Institute offers an online symptom checker parents can use to analyze symptoms they recognize in their child for possible psychiatric or learning disorders.
The group currently offers the symptom checker in English and Spanish, and they will use the grant money to upgrade all of its online services, which includes health guides and more than 1,000 articles, to also offer them in Spanish. 
Access to mental health resources is limited for people in Spanish-speaking communities, and poorer and geographically isolated communities, the Child Health Institute said, and they will use the money to make their online tools more useful and applicable to these groups. 

Other groups that also received grants from the bank include the New York-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, Mind HK in Hong Kong, Place2Be in London and Scottish Association for Mental health in Glasgow, Scotland.

Investing.com – Wall Street rose Monday, but was off earlier highs on rising fears that the coronavirus is now likely to become a pandemic as more cases of the disease were identified over the weekend.
The S&P 500 rose 0.91%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.48% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.70%. 
The number of cases of the virus rose to 17,200, with the first death reported outside China in the Philippines prompting experts to warn of an impending pandemic as China battles to contain the virus.
With fears that the virus will take an economic toll on China's economy, leading to a slowdown in the global economy, the People's Bank of China said it would inject a stimulus of $21.7 billion to ease the impact.
""Roughly two-thirds of the Chinese economy closed or impacted, and economists anticipate the coronavirus will have a deeper and more lasting impact than the SARS epidemic which subtracted an estimated 0.8%-1.0% from annual Chinese GDP growth,"" Stifel said.
The bullish start to the week for stocks was led by a sharp upswing in consumer discretionaries thanks to strong gains for sector stalwarts like   Nike   (NYSE:NKE) and Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA).
 Nike  (NYSE:NKE) rose about 4% after UBS upgraded its rating on the company to buy from neutral and its price target to $136 from $103. The athletic footwear and apparel maker’s product innovation investments and e-commerce business are expected to boost growth, UBS said.

The military controls dozens of companies, ranging from agriculture and industry to services and mining, through several entities, including the National Service Projects Organisation (NSPO).
The NSPO agreed with the Sovereign Fund of Egypt on Monday to help it prepare the assets of its companies for sale and to promote them, the fund's CEO Ayman Soliman told reporters at a signing ceremony at the council of ministers.
Up to 100% of the shares of some NSPO companies could be floated on the exchange, Soliman said. The fund itself may take stakes in the companies as well.
""The agreement will see the fund promoting and co-investing with private investors in agreed on, investable assets and companies owned by the NSPO to increase private sector participation in the NSPO's asset base,"" the fund said in a statement.
The agreement is in line with President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi's instructions to float military companies on the stock exchange, Planning Minister Hala al-Saeed told reporters. The companies would be open to local and foreign investment.
Sisi, speaking in October at the inauguration of two army chemical factories, said companies owned by the military must be allowed to sell shares on the stock exchange. He said in 2018 that Egypt planned to offer shares on the stock market of a $1.1 billion cement plant owned by the military.
Critics complain that the expansion of the military into the economy over recent years represents unfair competition and is deterring private investment.
The Sovereign Fund of Egypt, set up last year, said it aims to cherry-pick some of Egypt's most promising state assets and bring in private investors to develop them. Sisi said its capital could be increased to as much as several trillion Egyptian pounds."

888,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 03, 2020 12:59PM ET</span>",Wall Street Fixates on Every Fear Gauge to Map the Virus Fallout,"(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street is on the hunt for pressure points in global markets that signal just how lasting damage from the coronavirus is going to be.
With the number of confirmed infections surging, strategists and investors are turning to everything from S&P 500 options and bond spreads to monetary liquidity signals for macro insights, trading ideas and hedging strategies.
Shares in Shanghai tumbled the most since 2015 as the nation’s economy remained virtually shut down because of the deadly outbreak.
Sure, U.S. stocks are rebounding after last week’s slump but traders are far from sanguine with corners of the options market on high alert.
Here are some of the things the pros are looking at:
Sell Mode
Aberdeen Standard bond fund manager Luke Hickmore is eyeing tourism trends and big automakers that rely on Chinese manufacturers.
I reduced exposure to supply chain-at-risk businesses on Wednesday. So VW went, GM went, InterContinental Hotels went, and APT Pipelines from Australia went. The airlines have stopped flying to China and the capacity coming out of China has collapsed. The impact will be at least through to the end of February, possibly March even if we see a peak in the short-term over the next few days.
Hickmore’s main measure of stress is global bond yields which have plunged toward August levels.
Goldman Gauge
Based on previous viral outbreaks,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). strategists George Cole and Avisha Thakkar note that risk assets tend to stabilize two weeks to one month on average after initial panic selling -- while often recovering before the full impact shows up in underlying data.
By contrast rate markets tend to stay low even when the data perks up, anchored by dovish monetary policy. They wrote in a Friday note:
This suggests that equities and long-end rates could snap back on news of stabilization in infections. But the incoming data flow could induce risk-averse central banks to shift towards a more dovish stance, such as the BoE, the RBA and the BoC. For the major markets we expect that curves will re-steepen when risk sentiment eventually recovers.
Inversion Watch
Ben Emons, managing director of macro strategy at Medley Global Advisors, is looking out for actions by the Chinese central bank. Policy makers on Monday cut rates and injected cash into the financial system as part of a slew of measures to shore up markets.
The unknown economic effects of the coronavirus have led to the plunge in the copper price. This is signaling a material global growth slowdown could be ahead. As such, global yield curves could re-invert, which can deteriorate market sentiment and completely reverse euphoria about the phase one deal.
When liquidity conditions in the onshore market deteriorate, the People’s Bank of China could ramp up liquidity injections. A gauge of large injections to come is when the difference between the implied yield of the onshore yuan and offshore yuan is significantly wide.
At a point the net liquidity in the Chinese inter-bank system has contracted, there is the potential of a PBOC liquidity wave.
Volatility Twins
Tallbacken Capital Advisors’ Michael Purves is watching the correlation between one-month risk reversals on the Korean won and the Cboe Volatility Index. The pair moved more or less together for most of 2019 as trade headlines flared. They’re still moving together, but for a different reason. “This correlation persists even though the reasons are shifting from trade to coronavirus,” Purves wrote in an email.
Curve Anxiety
The spread between one- and three-month put options on the S&P 500 is one way Yannis Couletsis gauges whether market nerves about the respiratory outbreak are reaching an inflection point. When this turns positive, it’s a sign that anxiety has reached a crescendo. The trader at Credence Capital Management describes it as a “gauge of the insurance premium investors are willing to pay for the downside.”
Commodity Fear
George Pearkes, macro strategist at Bespoke Investment Group, is watching the dynamics of the oil market where the pricing curve offers clues to demand in China.
Large declines in reported demand in China have led the market to rapidly reduce the premium paid for barrels delivered near-term -- front-month futures -- relative to out-month barrels. This decline in backwardation shows how much the shift in Chinese demand has served to loosen the physical market, which tends to be best-proxied by the shape of the futures curve."

Investing.com – Dow component   Nike   (NYSE:NKE) saw strong gains in midday trading after getting a double-dose of optimism from analysts.
Nike shares rose 11%, bringing shares close to a 52-week high and adding 27 to the blue-chip index.
J.P. Morgan added the stock to its Analyst Focus List, noting that its price/earnings to growth (PEG) ratio was at 1.5x, lower than the average of 1.8x.
 “We see the recent pullback as a multi-year buying opportunity,” retail analyst Matthew Boss said in a note.

Greek banks have been working to reduce more than 70 billion euros ($77.32 billion) in soured loans, the legacy of a financial crisis that shrank the country's economy by a quarter.
Piraeus said it aims to cut its NPE ratio to 15% of its total loan book in 2022, from 49% last year, and to a single digit by 2023.
Its NPEs, which include loans which a bank thinks might become non-performing, were 25.7 billion euros at the end of September, from 27.3 billion at the end of 2018.
In an effort to help banks offload up to 30 billion euros of sour loans, the government has set up the so-called Asset Protection Scheme Hercules (HAPS). The plan is similar to Italy's GACS model.
In October, Piraeus Bank announced a deal with Sweden's Intrum (ST:INTRUM) to create a company to service its bad loan portfolio."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar strengthened and a gauge of global stocks jumped, lifted by an unexpected rebound in U.S. manufacturing that helped temper fears that caused stocks overnight in Asia to plunge on the potential impact of the coronavirus in China. 
Gold fell more than 1%, retreating from a four-week high, as China's efforts to protect its economy from the virus and the injection of 1.2 trillion yuan ($174 billion) worth of liquidity into the markets helped stem inflows into safe-haven assets.
Bond yields rose, while the Japanese yen and Swiss franc retreated as risk sentiment improved despite a rising infection rate and death toll from the coronavirus outbreak. 
Deaths rose to 361 as of Sunday, up 57 from the previous day, China's National Health Commission said. All fatalities have occurred in China, with the exception of a Chinese man who died in the Philippines after traveling from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak.
Oil prices fell, however, over concerns about energy demand in China, though the possibility of deeper crude output cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies offered some price support.
Shares in China plunged during the first day of trading since China closed equity, currency and bond markets on Jan. 23 for the Lunar New Year, a break that was extended by the government because of the coronavirus. 
The benchmark Shanghai Composite index fell 7.7%, slicing $420 billion in value from the index, and the yuan opened at its weakest level of 2020, sliding past 7 per dollar.
Japan's Nikkei dropped 1% to the lowest since November and Australia's benchmark index fell 1.3%.
But shares edged higher in Europe on relief the UK finally exited the European Union, while U.S. stocks initially surged more than 1% as factory activity unexpectedly rebounded in January after contracting for five straight months amid a surge in new orders.
""Traders are looking for value where they can,"" said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Cambridge Global Payments in Toronto. 
""A large part of what we're seeing in the market today is bargain-hunting in anticipation of a return to stimulus from the Chinese government,"" he said.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.30% and its emerging market index lost 0.21%. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.31%, while the major Wall Street indexes gained in a broad rally. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 184.83 points, or 0.65%, to 28,440.86. The S&P 500 gained 22.72 points, or 0.70%, to 3,248.24 and the Nasdaq Composite added 108.56 points, or 1.19%, to 9,259.50.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of U.S. factory activity increased to 50.9 last month, the highest level since July, from an upwardly revised 47.8 in December.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for 11% of the U.S. economy.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Women gained seats on U.S. corporate boards at a steady pace in recent years, but their share of top board leadership roles is still stuck at a low level, according to a new study.
Among the largest 500 publicly traded U.S. companies by revenue, the share of female directors rose to 25.9% last year from 18.9% in 2015, research firm Equilar found in the study, released on Jan. 30. The rise, which quickened last year, came as more companies disclose details on directors' gender and race. 
But women's representation in board leadership positions barely changed over the period, edging up to 7.5% from 7.4%, as women's share of combined CEO-chair jobs declined. The leadership figure also included women who were non-executive board chairs and lead independent directors. 
""These stagnant numbers in board leadership positions suggest that women still face significant hurdles when attempting to climb the top rungs of the corporate ladder,"" the study's authors wrote.
The overall share of corporate seats held by women and minorities has drawn new scrutiny in recent years as investors pay greater attention to social issues and some studies ties more diverse boards to better performance. 
Under a new law in California, publicly-held companies whose principal executive offices are located in the state were required to have at least one female board director by the end of 2019.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) last month said starting June 30, it will require that companies it helps take public have at least one diverse board member, with a focus on women.
Courteney Keatinge, senior research director at proxy adviser Glass Lewis & Co, said Equilar's figures may reflect how companies now often turn to nontraditional places in the search for female board candidates, such as high-ranking scientists, or marketing or cyberseurity experts. But the backgrounds of some of those new directors may make them less likely to take board leadership roles quickly.
""They are often newer directors so they’re not automatically going to take a leadership position,"" Keatinge said.
Women led 23.2% of audit committees last year, up from 17.8% in 2015, Equilar found. They also led 23.2% of compensation committees, up from 13.6% in 2015. Women accounted for 30.9% of nominating and governance committee chairs last year, up from 20.3% in 2015. 
The share of women leading nominating and governance committees ""may have significant dividends over the long term, as (those committees) have grown in importance as the focus on board composition and board effectiveness continues to increase,"" Susan Angele, senior adviser at the KPMG Board Leadership Center, said in a commentary in the Equilar report.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks bounced sharply at the opening on Monday as a measure of confidence returned to markets in the absence of game-changing news regarding the novel coronavirus outbreak in China.
Markets that had had their worst week in months opened as much as 0.7% higher, not least on the back of reports that products from U.S. pharma giants Gilead (NASDAQ:GILD) and AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) had had encouraging results in treating the disease.
Gilead) stock rose 4.3%, while AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) stock rose 1.5%.
By 10:23 AM ET (1523 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 325 points, or 1.2%, while the S&P 500 was up 1.2% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.5%.
The overall tone was helped by the Institute of Supply Management’s monthly business survey, where the main index showed activity rising to 50.9, its highest since August. Other purchasing manager indices published in China and Europe had shown a weaker picture. The eurozone manufacturing PMI was still below the 50 level that separates growth from contraction despite hitting an 11-month high of 47.9.
Airline stocks recovered a little of their poise after spreading bans on flights into and out of China undermined the outlook for the current year. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Airlines (NYSE:DAL) and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) were all between 2.5% and 3.0% higher.
The biggest gainer, however, was   Nike   (NYSE:NKE) stock. The sportswear giant rose 4.1% after UBS and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) both upgraded it, the latter putting it on its “analyst focus list”, saying that last week’s selloff had created a rare buying opportunity.
Nike is exposed to any short-term weakness in the economy because it gets around 16% of its sales from China and sources nearly one-third of its shoes and other sports gear there.
Another stock exposed to China fared less well. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) opened lower but turned around to be 1.0% higher, despite saying it would keep its Chinese stores and corporate offices closed for another week after the end of the Lunar New Year holidays.
However, oil and gas stocks continued to underperform as U.S. crude futures market shrugged off reports of deeper production cuts by OPEC and its allies. The global benchmark Brent fell 1.3% to $55.89 a barrel.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Taiwan's Wistron Corp plans to assemble printed circuit boards (PCBs) for iPhones at its new plant in southern India, two sources said, highlighting Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Inc's push to expand manufacturing in the world's second-biggest smartphone market.
The local assembly of PCBs by Wistron's India unit will be a first for the contract manufacturer, which began making Apple's low-priced SE model in the southern tech hub of Bengaluru in 2017. It currently assembles the 6S and 7 iPhone models there as well.
A PCB is a bed for key components such as processors, memory and wireless chip sets that are the heart of an electronic device. Once assembled, or populated with components, PCBs account for about half the cost of a smartphone.
Wistron's second iPhone plant, some 65 km (40 miles) from Bengaluru, is expected to become operational by April, the sources said, adding that it will make iPhone 7 and 8 models, some of which will be exported.
The facility will be capable of producing up to 8 million smartphones annually, they said.
The plan is part of Wistron's 30 billion rupee ($422.12 million) investment proposal submitted to the Karnataka state government in 2018.
Wistron's bigger rival Foxconn, which began making iPhone XR models in India last year, already assembles PCBs for those devices locally.
The deepening of PCB assembly in India will help Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple save on import taxes on smartphone components, levied by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government to boost local manufacturing and create new jobs.
On Saturday, India said in its federal budget that it will from April begin taxing imports of populated PCBs at a higher 20%, from the previous rate of 10%.
Apple declined to comment. Wistron did not respond to a request for comment. 
Apple, which still makes most of its iPhones in China, has gradually moved to expand production in other countries as Washington and Beijing wage a disruptive battle over trade and technology.
In India, a market with 1.1 billion wireless connections and about 480 million smartphones, Apple's premium devices have proven too costly for many consumers. The company's market share by shipment volumes is just over 1%, though it was among the fastest growing smartphone brands in India in the quarter to Dec. 2019, according to market researcher Counterpoint.
India remains largely dependent on China for supplies of smartphone parts such as cells, display panels, camera modules and printed circuit boards.
The coronavirus outbreak in China could cause a delay in Wistron and Apple's plans for India, one of the sources said. 
The epidemic, which has killed more than 250 so far, threatens to disrupt India's production of smartphones if it continues to spread, Reuters reported previously.

The company makes some 20% of its iPhone sales in China. In addition to the sales issue, the company also faces possible supply-chain issues as the Chinese government has ordered factories around the country to stay shut until Feb. 10.


Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock was up 0.1% despite suggestions of further complications to the process of getting the 737 MAX airborne again. The New York Times reported that European regulators want the company to relocate certain stretches of wiring to reduce the risk of short-circuiting. The Wall Street Journal said that the Federal Aviation Agency, which disagrees with its European counterpart, may push back a key certification flight as a result.


AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) stock was up 1.2% after reports that its antiviral products were part of a cocktail of drugs successfully used to treat a patient suffering from the novel coronavirus in Thailand.

Investing.com - U.S. stock markets are set to open a touch higher Monday, clawing back some of Friday’s hefty losses, but the deadly coronavirus in China remains a drag on sentiment as earnings season continues.
At 06:55 AM ET (1155 GMT), futures for the S&P 500 traded 17 points, or 0.5%, higher, futures for the Nasdaq 100 up 53 points, or 0.6%, while the Dow Jones 30 futures contract rose 133 points, or 0.5%. 
On Friday, Wall Street closed sharply lower. The S&P dropped 1.8% to 3225.52, its lowest level since October, while the Dow plunged 2.1% to 28,256.03, its largest drop in six months. The Nasdaq slid 1.6% to 9150.94, and is the only major index still on positive ground so far in 2020.
These losses could well prompt some bargain hunting Monday, but the news out of China remains grim. The death toll continued to climb, reaching 361 from 17,205 confirmed cases, while large parts of the Chinese industrial sector remain closed, and are likely to do so until Feb. 10 at the earliest.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) said at the weekend it would also close its stores in China until at least Feb. 9 out of what it called ""an abundance of caution."" Apple gets some 20% of its iPhone sales out of China.
The financial markets on the Chinese mainland did reopen after the government-extended Lunar New Year holiday, but saw sharp losses with the blue-chip Shanghai Composite index closing almost 8% lower, a one-year low, and the yuan losing over 1% against the U.S. dollar.
The tech sector will be in focus Monday as Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is set to report after the close. This will be the company’s first time facing investors after it announced that Sundar Pichai would take over as CEO, after previously being in charge of just the Google section.
So far, there's no sign that spending on digital advertising is weakening. Analysts expect 19% growth in Google’s sales to $46.91 billion in the fourth-quarter when compared with the same period a year ago.
The earnings season has generally been a positive one for Wall Street this quarter. So far just under a half of the S&P 500 has reported, with 69% beating expectations and only 20% missing.
The economic data release of note Monday is the ISM manufacturing index at 10:00 AM ET (1500 GMT), and is expected to see a small uptick in the wake of the phase 1 trade deal between the U.S. and China. This comes ahead of Friday’s key U.S. nonfarm payrolls report.
Crude oil is also in focus Monday amid reports that the major oil producers are considering deeper production cuts to combat the recent price slump.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, known as OPEC+, are considering a further cut in their oil output of 500,000 barrels per day, Reuters reported, citing sources. The group is considering holding a ministerial meeting on Feb. 14-15, Reuters said, earlier than the current schedule for a meeting in March.
Additionally the Wall Street Journal reported Monday that Saudi Arabia may temporarily cut its own output by 1 million barrels a day as a temporary and short-term measure. it cited OPEC officials. 
As of 06:55 AM ET (1155 GMT), U.S. crude futures rose 0.4% to $51.76 but the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.2% to $56.51."

PARIS (Reuters) - Payments company Worldline agreed on Monday to buy French rival  Ingenico  (PA:INGC) in a 7.8 billion euros ($8.7 billion) deal to create a new European leader in the sector and fend off cut-throat competition from internet and telecoms companies.
The purchase by Worldline, which was born out of French IT company Atos (PA:ATOS), is the latest deal in the payments sector, where the firms cater to everything from small shops needing card terminals to large online businesses. 
The increasing use of smartphones for online payments and the growing success of Apple Pay (O:AAPL), Google Pay (O:GOOGL) and Amazon (O:AMZN) has led to more competition, with mergers and acquisitions allowing firms to build scale and cut costs.
The global payments industry is set to reach $3 trillion a year in revenue by 2023 as more people switch from cash to digital payments for online and store purchases, according to research by consulting firm McKinsey.
In 2019,  Fiserv Inc  (O:FISV) bought First Data Corp for $22 billion, while Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) (N:FIS) bought Worldpay for about $35 billion, consolidating their positions as the top two players globally.
The takeover of Ingenico gives the firm an implied equity value of 7.8 billion euros and would immediately boost Worldline's earnings per share, with around 250 million euros expected in savings by 2024.
The price tag implies a premium of about 16% to Ingenico's closing market value on Friday of around 6.7 billion euros.
The companies expect the transaction, which requires regulatory approval, to close in the third quarter of 2020. 
Ingenico shareholders would receive 11 Worldline shares and 160.5 euros in cash for seven Ingenico shares, in a primary tender offer. There would also be a secondary offer, with 56 Worldline shares exchanged for 29 Ingenico shares, translating into an offer price of 123.10 euros per Ingenico share.
INGENICO SHARES SURGE
Ingenico shares jumped 11.2% to 117 euros in early trading, while Worldline shares fell 4.2%, reflecting some concerns that Worldline is paying a hefty premium to buy Ingenico.
On closing the deal, former Worldline shareholders would own 65% of the combined entity and former Ingenico shareholders would own 35%. Worldline Chairman and CEO Gilles Grapinet would become CEO of the combined company and Ingenico Chairman Bernard Bourigeaud would become non-executive chairman.
Worldline, in which Atos still has a 16.9% equity stake, said the deal would give it access to Ingenico's strong presence in the travel, health and retail sectors, while the combined company would have a bigger geographic reach and an extended partnership with German savings banks.
Creating a European champion able to compete with bigger American rivals could also be welcomed by European politicians, with Europe's antitrust chief having voiced concerns over Apple Pay.
""The local tie up by Ingenico and Worldline makes sense so instead of competing with each other in their domestic space the combined company can focus on bigger fish to fry,"" said MB Capital managing director Marcus Bullus.
""I don't see there being any anti-trust issues in what should be quite a clean streamlined deal that will create added value for shareholders of the combined company,"" he added.
Atos welcomed the deal and said it could continue to sell down its stake in Worldline. Ingenico has long been seen as a target. Sources previously told Reuters that  Edenred  (PA:EDEN) and French bank  Natixis  (PA:CNAT) had both been at one point interested by Ingenico.

 Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) and Cardinal Partners were the financial advisers to Worldline, while Goldman Sachs Paris (N:GS) and Rothschild (PA:ROTH) advised Ingenico.

911,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 03, 2020 05:31AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Worldline, Ingenico Aim to Catch up Nimbler Rivals","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- France’s two biggest payments companies, announced the creation of a new European champion in the space on Monday, after Worldline (PA:WLN) agreed to pay some 7.8 billion euros ($8.6 billion) for   Ingenico   (PA:INGC).
While that’s true in a narrow sense – the two companies had total revenue of 5.3 billion euros in 2019, according to figures they both released on Monday – the reality is a little more prosaic: Ingenico is paying the price for not moving fast enough beyond its legacy business – the card payment terminals seen in shops all over Europe – and into the online retail payments space.
Although Ingenico has made progress in the last year – organic sales growth of 10% actually exceeded Worldline’s 6.9% - the perception is still that it is not in the hottest part of a sector that is still growing rapidly. Ingenico stock was up only around 10% from its levels of five years ago at Friday's close.
One of the reasons Worldline is buying Ingenico, rather than the other way round, is that Worldline stock is valued at over four times sales, more than twice the valuation of Ingenico stock. That has given Worldline the luxury of being able to offer its stock as part of the deal.
The relative valuations suggest not too much should be read into the 4.6% drop in Worldline stock on Monday. The 17% premium it’s offering over Ingenico’s Friday close is not egregious by the usual standards, and easily justifiable, if one extrapolates the convincing rebound that Ingenico stock has had in the last 12 months as its diversification has started to bear fruit under new chief executive Nicolas Huss.
However, the combined company will have some work to do if it wants to match the valuation of  Adyen  (AS:ADYEN), the Dutch-based company that floated in 2018. It was still growing sales at a clip of 64% in the six months through last June, thanks to strong links with likes of Uber (NYSE:UBER), Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) and Booking (NASDAQ:BKNG), all big beasts in online payments.
At 25 billion euros, Adyen is still worth over 25% more than the combined value of Worldline-Ingenico. Even Germany’s Wirecard (DE:WDIG), after all the knocks it has suffered due to governance concerns over the last two years, is still valued at only a touch less than the new French giant. Again, that’s due to its relative strength in areas where growth is faster, although Wirecard’s strength is regional (Asia) rather than sectoral.
Bulking up is a process that will give the French companies greater clout vis-à-vis smaller competitors (Italy’s Nexi (MI:NEXII), for example, rose 3.5% on Monday as market participants added a little takeover premium to the stock). But for the term ‘champion’ to mean anything, the combined company will have to show that it can grow at least as fast as the broader sector. It still has some convincing to do."

Irving, Texas-based Exxon's results missed Wall Street's recently lowered estimates, with earnings sliding to $5.6 billion from $6 billion a year ago as weak oil and gas prices, sliding refining and chemicals profit margins offset a sharp increase in oil and gas production.
Exxon CEO Darren Woods described the margin weakness as ""a short-term impact"".
But Goldman said its decision to downgrade Exxon from ""neutral"" stemmed from ""lack of free cashflow limiting capital returns, and risk to long-term return on capital employed (ROCE)targets"".
Goldman said it saw ""clear downside"" to Exxon's target of reaching 15% ROCE by 2025, with its own modelling now showing 8% ROCE due to lower downstream margins, lower crude oil prices and risks to execution of projects.

China’s stock market opened to the most savage wave of selling in years, with thousands of shares falling by the daily limit after just minutes of trading.
Though investors turned on computers hours early to tee up their sell orders, many of them couldn’t exit the market fast enough. All but 162 of the almost 4,000 stocks in Shanghai and Shenzhen recorded losses, with about 90% dropping the maximum allowed by the country’s exchanges. Health-care shares comprised most of Monday’s gainers on speculation they will benefit from the virus outbreak.
“The sell-off was so quick and intense,” said Li Changmin, managing director at Snowball Wealth in Guangzhou. “We’ll be busy dealing with risk controls and even liquidation pressure if stocks keep falling.”
While it was always going to be brutal for China’s $7.5 trillion stock market as investors caught up with losses worldwide, Monday’s declines were particularly severe. The CSI 300 Index sank as much as 9.1% -- a slump rarely seen in its almost 15-year history. The huge number of stocks trading limit down means it could take days for investors to execute their orders, prolonging the sell-off.
“I was anxious before the market opened, and had made plans on what to sell and by how much last Friday,” said Bruce Yu, a fund manager with Franklin Templeton SinoAm Securities Investment Management Inc. in Taipei. “Some of my trades weren’t made today -- we’ll see if we can sell them tomorrow.”
Making matters even more difficult for mainland-based traders was that many couldn’t trade from the office, and some had to do it with a reduced working force. Some of the country’s largest cities -- including Shanghai -- extended the Lunar New Year holiday until the end of the week, while Beijing’s government encouraged residents to work from home.
It was the first chance mainland investors had since Jan. 23 to trade, due to the extended Lunar New Break. Officials urged investors to evaluate objectively the impact of the coronavirus, which has killed more than 360 and spread to more than 17,000 people in China alone.
The sell-off was widespread on Monday: commodity futures from iron ore to crude sank by the daily limit, and the yuan weakened past a key level against the dollar.
Fund managers hit the phones to calm investors, seeking to avoid the kind of redemptions and forced selling seen as recently as 2018. China’s securities regulator took steps to support the stock market, telling some brokerages that their proprietary traders aren’t allowed to be net sellers of equities this week, according to people familiar with the matter.
“My biggest concern was that investors would rush to redeem their holdings in private and mutual funds,” said Jiang Liangqing, a money manager at Ruisen Capital Management in Beijing whose team is working from home across China. “A key task for us is to reassure our fund holders and ask them to stay calm.”
Some avoided the market altogether, deciding there was no point trying to get orders through if it meant selling at such a deep discount.
“I had a look at stocks at the open, grabbed my fishing pole right after and left home,” said Yin Ming, Shanghai-based vice president of investment firm Baptized Capital. “What else can you do? I knew the market would be ugly today but didn’t expect a drop of this magnitude.”
Others were brave enough to buy, keeping their cool as China attempted to stem the panic. The central bank took its first concrete steps to cushion the economy and plunging markets from the blow of the coronavirus, providing short-term funding to banks and cutting the interest rate it charges for the money. Investors purchased $2.6 billion worth of onshore stocks on Monday through exchange links with Hong Kong, the second-largest amount on record.
“Buying is all I’m doing,” said Hou Anyang, a partner at Shenzhen Frontsea Asset Management, who was one of four working Monday out of a team of 20. “I’ve been through the circuit-breaker of 2016 and other big routs -- as a professional investor, this is a huge opportunity.”"

Bombard replaces Alison Cooper, whose departure was announced last October.
Bomhard joins the maker of Gauloises and Winston cigarettes after five years at the helm of British car dealer Inchcape and, prior to that, senior roles at Cadbury, Burger King and  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) among other consumer goods groups. 
He faces the task of turning around Imperial's vaping and other ‘next generation’ products, which were meant to be the future for Imperial Brands but growth has been slower than expected.
Imperial, like its peers, has been hit hard by a slowdown in e-cigarette sales after a number of vaping-related deaths and illnesses and after high rates of teen use of e-cigarettes triggered regulatory scrutiny on the safety of these products. 
This month the U.S. government banned the sale of some pod-based flavors for e-cigarettes, including fruit and mint, in the country. Imperial makes 30% of its profits in the United States, the world's biggest vaping market.
Bomhard will also be seeking to boost sales of Imperial's flagship blu e-cigarette brands, which Cooper admitted were not attracting consumer loyalty despite Imperial's marketing efforts.
Imperial Brand shares have fallen nearly 23% over the past year, underperforming the broader FTSE (FTSE)'s 4.5% rise. They were down 0.4% at 1,942.6 pence in early trade on Monday, as the company also announced that Matthew Phillips was stepping down as chief development officer with immediate effect.
""Stefan takes on the chief executive officer role at a significant point in Imperial's development,"" Chairwoman Thérèse Esperdy said. ""Stefan has significant experience across multiple consumer sectors."" 
As CEO, Bomhard will get an annual salary of about 1.27 million pounds ($1.7 million) and a pension allowance equivalent to a maximum of 14% of salary and other usual benefits, the company said.

It did not say when he would take up the role but said Cooper had stepped down effective immediately. Dominic Brisby, currently divisional director, Americas, Africa, Asia and Australasia, and Joerg Biebernick, divisional director, Europe, will assume the roles of joint interim chief executive officers until Bomhard takes over, the company said.

SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Investors erased $393 billion from China's benchmark stock index on Monday, sold the yuan and dumped commodities as fears about the spreading coronavirus and its economic impact drove selling on the first day of trade in China since the Lunar New Year.
A nearly 8% plunge on the Shanghai composite index was its biggest daily fall in more than four years. The Chinese yuan blew past the 7-per-dollar mark and Shanghai-traded commodities from palm oil to copper hit their maximum down limits.
The wipeout came even as the central bank made its biggest cash injection to the financial system since 2004 and despite apparent regulatory moves to curb selling.
The total number of deaths in China from the coronavirus rose to 361 by Sunday, compared with 17 on Jan. 23, when Chinese markets last traded.
""You wanted to know what a real decoupling from China might look like, or what a 'What if everyone just stayed at home and didn't buy anything?' economic thought-experiment looks like? Well here you are, folks,"" Rabobank strategist Michael Every said in an afternoon note.
The yuan began onshore trade at its weakest this year and was down 1.2% by the afternoon, sliding past the symbolic 7-per-dollar level to close at 7.0257. [MKTS/GLOB]
Shanghai-traded oil, iron ore, copper and soft commodities contracts all posted sharp drops, catching up with sliding global prices.
The new virus has created alarm because it is spreading quickly, much about it is unknown, and authorities' drastic response is likely to drag on economic growth.
""This will last for some time,"" said Iris Pang, Greater China economst at ING.
""It's uncertain whether factory workers, or how many of them, will return,"" she said. ""We haven't yet seen corporate earnings since the (spread of the) coronavirus. Restaurants and retailers may have very little sales.""
More than 2,500 stocks fell by the daily limit of 10%. The Shanghai Composite closed down 7.7% at 2,746.6, its lowest since August and a modest recovery from early trade, when it was down nearly 9%.
Copper sank to its lowest in more than three years, falling by its daily limit of 7%, while aluminum , zinc and lead shed more than 4% and soybeans dropped 2%. [MET/L]
Bond prices surged, with March futures contracts for 10-year bonds jumping 1.4% .
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said the stocks plunge had irrational or even panic elements, triggered by herd behavior, in a newspaper commentary published after markets closed.
The sell-off cast a pall over Asia, though losses were contained because a slide had been expected. Hong Kong's Hang Seng (HSI), which shed almost 10% in two weeks, closed 0.2% firmer.
(GRAPHIC: China stocks plummet as virus takes economic toll - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/76/76/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
CLEAR MESSAGE
Amid the selldown, the PBOC had injected 1.2 trillion yuan ($173.81 billion) into money markets through reverse bond repurchase agreements, the largest such move since 2004, according to DBS analysts.
It also unexpectedly cut the interest rate on those short-term funding facilities by 10 basis points.
The chance of a benchmark lending rate cut on Feb. 20, the date of its next monthly fixing, has significantly increased, central bank adviser Ma Jun said.
China's securities regulator moved to limit short selling and urged mutual fund managers not to sell shares unless they face investor redemptions, sources told Reuters.
""It is a clear message that they want to take growth-supportive measures and keep the market reassured,"" Mayank Mishra, a macro strategist at  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Bank in Singapore, said of the PBOC move.
""They are managing the situation well. The timing of the repo rate cut came a little quicker than some people were expecting, but they wanted to send a clear message.""
Beijing has also said it would help firms that produce vital goods resume work as soon as possible, state broadcaster CCTV said.
Cities like Wuhan, where the virus originated, remain in virtual lockdown and China faces mounting international isolation. Analysts are beginning to suspect the impact will be greater than the hit from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002-2003.
That pounded growth across Asia, especially in Hong Kong, and sent the Hang Seng index down by 18% over four months.
Though it quickly rebounded then, China's share of the global economy has grown fourfold since and, with so many unknowns, few are willing to call a bottom just yet.
""At this point, we don't see this as a buying opportunity,"" said Invesco's David Chao, a global market strategist for Asia ex-Japan. ""We are in the midst of the escalation period."""

Investing.com - European stock markets traded marginally higher Monday, rebounding after Friday’s hefty losses, but sentiment remains weak as China’s coronavirus continues to claim victims.
At 04:00 ET (09:00 GMT), the U.K.'s FTSE index was trading 20 points, or 0.3%, higher, France's CAC 40 was up 18 points, or 0.3%, while the DAX gained 49 points, or 0.4%. The Euro Stoxx 50 index, which measures the movement of blue chip stocks in the eurozone, rose 13 points, 0.4%.
All the major European indexes lost well over 1% Friday amid concerns over the economic repercussions of the outbreak, and so a partial rebound is understandable. Helping were the release of final manufacturing PMI numbers for Germany, France and Italy, all coming in slightly above initial releases. 
The final eurozone manufacturing PMI rose to 47.9, its highest since March last year but still clearly below the 50 line that separates growth from contraction. 
The overall tone remains one of caution after financial markets on the Chinese mainland reopened to sharp losses after a government-extended Lunar New Year holiday. The blue-chip Shanghai index closed almost 8% lower, a one-year low. Hong Kong markets, which had reopened last week, edged up 0.2%.

Xie Shanpeng, who runs a travel agency in Tokyo for Chinese tourists, had expected the months from Lunar New Year to the Tokyo Olympics starting in late July to be busy.
""It's a terrible situation. I think we won't have any inbound Chinese tourists for the next three to six months. I don't know what to do,"" he said, pointing to a list of cancellations.
""Most bookings area canceled... We only have one reservation now.""
While Japanese automakers and companies such as Fast Retailing (T:9983) have been affected by factory stoppages and store closures in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, many small businesses in Tokyo are also feeling the pain as they have grown dependent on Chinese tourist spending.
Chinese make up 30% of all tourists traveling to Japan and nearly 40% of the total amount foreign visitors spent last year, according to an industry survey.
Masako Takabayashi, who manages a glass ornament shop in Asakusa, a historic Tokyo district popular with tourists, said she had not had any Chinese customers on Monday.
""I don't see them at all,"" she said.
Dai-ichi Life Research Institute economist Hideo Kumano forecast the economic impact to be less than 200 billion yen ($1.8 billion).
But he said it could be more serious if the outbreak continues for longer and affects visitor numbers for the Olympics -- a business opportunity many companies are counting on.
""Chinese people will probably decide to go to the Olympics around April or May. But if this virus continues, the number of tourists from China to Japan will decrease,"" he said.
""About 2 trillion yen increase in demand is expected during the Olympics in July and August, but a few percent of that figure will be lost if the virus drags on."""
920,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2020 03:51AM ET</span>","'Busy looking for masks': Financiers worry about virus, Hong Kong braces for business slowdown","HONG KONG (Reuters) - Temporary relocation for families and face masks were two of the top issues concerning Hong Kong finance professionals as they began their first full business week, after the Lunar New Year holidays, under the shadow of a fast-spreading coronavirus.
""I'm not in town and won't return until things become normal,"" one senior equity capital market (ECM) banker said.
Financial firms in Hong Kong have variously told or allowed staff to work from home as part of broader precautions against the virus - which can be transmitted from person to person, has claimed 361 lives in mainland China and has spread to around two dozen other countries.
In many cases they have also asked workers returning from the mainland, where the coronavirus originated, to quarantine themselves for up to two weeks.
""The loss of staff, either to the virus itself, or the unwillingness of staff to come in, is a real issue. Plans for telework need to be implemented and tested,"" said Harry Rhulen, chief executive of New York-headquartered adviser CrisisRisk.
Additional caution would be another blow for Hong Kong whose economy and market have already suffered from months-long pro-democracy protests and the U.S.-China trade war.
Initial public offerings, other equity sales and bond deals, the bread and butter of investment bankers, typically take at least a week to get going following new year holidays but dealmakers now fear a longer pause.
""It's definitely not business as usual for us or our clients and our entire focus now is to make sure that the things that were in the pipeline get executed somehow,"" said a senior commercial banker with a large European bank.
MEETINGS CANCELED
An Australia-based lawyer said he had turned down a request for a meeting in Hong Kong for fear he may not be able to return. Australia has barred travelers from the mainland, but not those from Hong Kong, from entering. The Philippines has included the city in its ban on travelers from China.
All the people spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized by their firms to speak on the subject.
One Hong Kong-based private equity executive said he had canceled all his meetings.
""My priority is not really on (business) anyway - I'm more concerned about the short supply of (face)masks,"" he said.
""For all I know, investment teams in other firms are all busy looking for masks. They are not looking at any projects right now,"" he added.
SCHOOLS CLOSED
Worries about the spread of the coronavirus wiped around $400 billion off the value of China's stocks as markets reopened after the holidays.
Reflecting the overall gloom, cafes in Hong Kong's compact Central business district were noticeably quieter on Monday, according to baristas and customers.
Many expatriate professionals have sent their families away as they eye the threat of further travel bans.
Hong Kong has closed all schools until March 2.
""There's nothing (for them) to do with schools and all sports and cultural facilities closed - and no one wants their kids mingling at play dates,"" said a banker whose family had left."

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair (I:RYA) may have to push back its long-term target of flying 200 million passengers per year by as much as two years due to delays in the delivery of Boeing's (N:BA) 737 MAX jet, Europe's largest low-cost carrier said on Monday. 
Ryanair, one of the biggest customers of the grounded jet, with 210 on order, hopes to have its first 55 jets flying by summer 2021, a year later than originally planned, with 50 more planes per year due for each of the following three summers.
But Chief Executive Michael O'Leary suggested Boeing's delivery schedule could ultimately be up to two years late - meaning it may hit its long-term 200 million passenger target by March 2026 rather than March 2024. 
""What is likely is they will push out that delivery profile with Boeing by at least 12 months,"" O'Leary said in a pre-recorded video presentation in which he was asked about the impact of Boeing's decision to temporarily halt the production of the MAX. 
""At best that means we will have to roll forward our plans to fly 200 million passengers per year ... by at least 12 months, possibly 24,"" he said. 
Chief Financial Officer Neil Sorahan, asked by Reuters if there was any risk to its plans to take delivery of 55 planes by next summer, said: ""I don't believe so, but we have been disappointed before.""
Boeing in January said it did not expect the MAX, which was grounded after two fatal crashes, to return to service until mid-2020.
Ryanair, which does not take deliveries during its summer peak of June-August, said on Monday it did not expect to receive the first MAX jets until September or October 2020. 
It will take a maximum of eight planes per month, or around 50 deliveries per year, O'Leary said. 
The 737 MAX, Boeing's fastest-selling aircraft, was grounded in March after 346 people died in two crashes attributed to the plane's anti-stall software.
The executives were speaking after Ryanair reported profit after tax of 88 million euros ($97.63 million) for the three months to the end of December, the third quarter of its financial year, with average fares up 9% and revenue for optional extras like pre-booked seating up 21%. 
The release came weeks after Ryanair raised its profit forecast to between 950 million and 1.05 billion euros ($1.17 billion) for its financial year to the end of March, versus the 800 to 900 million euro range it forecast in November, citing a better-than-expected performance over Christmas and New Year.
Analysts said the delay of MAX deliveries has reduced capacity in Europe, pushing up fares.
""The performance was even stronger than we had forecast,"" Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo said in a note. 
Ryanair said the MAX delays had forced it to close a number of loss-making winter bases, leading to some crew redundancies in Spain, Germany and Sweden, but CFO Sorahan said the number of redundancies was very small.

Westpac was sued by Australia's financial crime watchdog AUSTRAC in November for 23 million alleged breaches of anti-money laundering laws, including payments between known child exploiters.
The latest suit, filed by investor rights law firm Bernstein Liebhard in a U.S. court, comes just days after six U.S.-based law firms announced similar class-action lawsuits against the lender. 
Westpac on Saturday had cautioned that similar suits may follow, while responding to New York-based Rosen Law Firm's suit.
Bernstein said in a statement the class action was filed on behalf of investors who bought Westpac's securities between Nov. 11, 2015 and Nov. 19, 2019.
The law firm accused the lender of not carrying out appropriate due diligence on transactions in Southeast Asia and the Philippines, and failing to monitor terrorism financing risks with movement of money into and out of Australia among others. 
Last month, the lender appointed a former  Barclays  (L:BARC) boss as its chairman to steer it through the money-laundering scandal.

The Indian Ocean nation was among the countries whose officials figured in a $4-billion settlement Airbus agreed with European and U.S. regulators, as having been accused of getting bribes to clinch sales of its aircraft.
Sri Lanka will conduct ""a comprehensive investigation into reports of allegations over financial irregularities"", the office of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa said in a brief statement on Sunday.
Detailed findings from Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) said Airbus had hired the wife of a Sri Lankan Airlines executive as its intermediary and misled export credit agency UKEF over her name and gender, while paying $2 million to her company.
In a statement, SriLankan Airlines said its chairman and board had directed the management to cooperate fully with any government agency regarding any investigation or prosecution.
The board had also told the management to ""preserve and study all available internal documentation with a view to take all possible corrective future action,"" it added in Sunday's statement.
The alleged corruption in dealings between Airbus and SriLankan Airlines took place between July 2011 and June 2015, the SFO added.

Please refresh for updates for U.K. market news from the LSE’s RNS on individual U.K. shares from FTSE 100, FTSE 250 and FTSE All-Share.
Imperial Brands (LON:IMB) said it has found someone to replace Alison Cooper as chief executive.

The tobacco company has appointed Stefan Bomhard, currently CEO at car dealership network   Inchcape   (LON:INCH), although it wasn’t able to say when he’ll start.

Prior to Inchcape, Bomhard had also held senior positions at Cadbury,   Unilever   (LON:ULVR) and Procter & Gamble.

Power generator   Drax   (LON:DRX) said it will review options for two coal units at Drax Power Station and the small Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) at Blackburn Mill, after choosing not to accept capacity payments for its two coal units at Drax Power Station and the small Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) at Blackburn Mill.
Drax said it had secured agreements to provide 2,562 megawatts of capacity from its existing gas, pumped storage and hydro assets for the delivery period October 2022 to September 2023, at a price of £6.44/kW.
In all, the capacity payments are worth £15 million in that period. These are in addition to existing agreements which extend to September 2022.
Capacity payments are made by the system operator to power plant owners to ensure that generating capacity is available, even if it is not needed at specific times. In the case of the coal units, the price offered by the grid operator is unlikely to have covered the cost of keeping them available.

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to open higher Monday, emerging from Friday’s sea of red, but sentiment remains weak as Chinese markets reopen with hefty losses and the coronavirus continues to claim victims.
At 02:05 ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract traded 54 points, or 0.4% higher. France's CAC 40 futures were up 36 points, or 0.6%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. gained 44 points, or 0.6%. Futures on the pan-eurozone Euro Stoxx 50, rose 26 points, or 0.7%.
All the major European indexes lost well over 1% Friday amid concerns over the economic repercussions of the outbreak, while on Wall Street there were drops of more than 1.5%, sealing the worst week in six months.
This was the backdrop into which financial markets on the Chinese mainland reopened on Monday. And the blue-chip Shanghai index promptly fell around 8% to a one-year low, wiping almost $370 billion off the market value. The Chinese government had extended the Lunar New Year holiday after the deadly virus outbreak to try and curb its spread.
That was despite a liquidity injection from the central bank and a ban on short selling handed down by the country's securities regulator.
In a bid to cushion the impact on China's economy, the People's Bank of China cut reverse repo rates by 10 basis points and injected 1.2 trillion yuan ($173.8 billion) of liquidity into the markets on Monday. The net injection was far smaller as nearly 1 trillion yuan in loans was due to expire.
The coronavirus death toll continues to climb, reaching 361 with 17,205 confirmed cases, as of early Monday, and at least 24 provinces have told businesses not to resume work before Feb. 10 at the earliest. 
The earnings season continues in Europe, although Monday’s cupboard is a little bare.
Ryanair (LON:RYA) will be in focus Monday after stating that delays in the delivery of Boeing's 737 MAX plane meant it would have to put back its target of flying 200 million passengers in the year to 2025 or 2026, from March 2024 as previously planned.

SYDNEY/MONTREAL (Reuters) - Some aerospace companies including business jet manufacturers  Textron Inc  (N:TXT) and General Dynamics Corp's (N:GD) Gulfstream division said they no longer planned to attend the Singapore Airshow due to the new coronavirus epidemic.
The trade portion of Asia's biggest airshow, held every two years, is set to begin on Feb. 11 under the shadow of the fast-spreading virus that has prompted Singapore to deny entry to all Chinese visitors and foreigners with a recent history of travel to China, where the virus originated.
The death toll from the coronavirus has risen to 361 in China, bringing the number of confirmed infections to 17,205. The flu-like virus, which can be transmitted from person to person, has spread to more than two dozen other nations and regions.
Experia Events, the organizer of the Singapore Airshow, said last week the show would continue as planned, but the government measures meant it would ""undoubtedly see a reduction in terms of the number of expected exhibitors and visitors this year"".
The organizer said there would be doctors and medics on standby to attend to visitors who were feeling unwell.
In 2018, there were 54,000 trade attendees from 147 countries and 1,062 participating companies who come to network, examine products and sign deals covering commercial aviation, defense, maintenance and repair operations and business jets.
Typically, it is not a major show for commercial plane orders but talks during the show can set the stage for deals that are completed later in the year.
Boeing (N:BA), Airbus (PA:AIR) and  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT), among the biggest exhibitors, said they still planned to attend the show.
Textron and Gulfstream said their decision to not attend was a precautionary measure to protect the health of employees.
South Korea's air force said on Monday it had decided not to participate as part of broader precautions against the coronavirus. Its Black Eagles aerobatic team has taken part in the flying display at Singapore airshows in recent years.
Russian aerospace group Rostec plans to send a reduced delegation to the show, Russian media reported. Rostec did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
The deputy administrator of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, Li Jian, is no longer listed as a speaker at a pre-show leadership conference on Feb. 10.
Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC), which is developing the C919 narrowbody jet, had been due to attend the airshow before the travel ban was announced. COMAC did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
The outbreak of the new virus has sent shivers through financial markets, with investors drawing comparisons to the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) that also started in China and killed 800 people globally.
Singapore, a Southeast Asian tourism hub where Chinese nationals make up the largest share of visitors, was among the worst hit outside of China during the SARS outbreak."

The German maker of diagnostic equipment said adjusted earnings before interest and tax declined to 484 million euros ($536 million) during the October-December period.
That was below an average analyst estimate of 568 million euros, according to a consensus posted on the company's website.
""Profitability was negatively impacted by a temporary dip in Imaging and the guided weak margin performance in Diagnostics,"" the group said in a statement on Monday.
Atellica ramp-up costs were inflated by the shipment of more than 600 analyzers from July to September last year, it added."

One solution proposed is that companies with a December year-end could apply for a waiver on releasing their annual result, the people said. In mainland China, the People’s Bank of China announced over the weekend that listed companies and bond issuers could apply for a one month extension to April 30.
China’s Measures to Support Financial Markets
Separately, another solution could be to allow companies to release unaudited reports by the deadline, according to the people.
A final decision on what approach to take hasn’t been made yet, said the people. A decision is likely to come in the next two weeks as Hong Kong regulators are still gathering information on the scale of the problem, said one of the people.
A spokesman for Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. said it’s “working closely with the Securities and Futures Commission to ensure that investors continue to receive updated information to enable them to make investment decisions, whilst making appropriate accommodation for companies whose audits are impacted by current travel restrictions.”
“We expect to provide more detailed guidance in due course,” the spokesman said.
A spokesman for the SFC, confirming the cooperation with the exchange, said guidance will be issued “shortly.”
Auditors in Hong Kong raised the alarm last week of possible delays and held emergency talks with regulators and the exchange. Verifying final accounts of the more than 1,200 mainland Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong has become difficult with travel restriction in place and many offices closed to guard against the spread of the virus.
According to current Hong Kong exchange rules, missing a deadline on releasing earnings would lead to a suspension in trading.
China last week extended its Lunar New Year holiday as authorities struggle to contain the deadly virus, which has killed more than 350 people so far.
The Hong Kong Economic Journal earlier reported on the possible solution."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. utilities stocks have outperformed other traditional havens in recent days, as worries over the spreading coronavirus epidemic sparked a rush to safety.
The S&P 500 Utilities (SPLRCU) index is up about 3.2% since Jan. 21, when the first case of coronavirus was reported in the United States. The index has risen 6.6% this month, logging its best monthly gain since 2016 and beating every other sector in the S&P.
By comparison, gold rose 1.8% in that period, while the Japanese yen notched a 1.6% gain, and the dollar edged lower. The ICE (NYSE:ICE) BofA US Treasury Index , which tracks the performance of U.S. dollar-denominated sovereign debt publicly issued by the U.S. government in its domestic market, rose 2%.
""Not all safe-haven assets are created equal,"" said John Praveen, portfolio manager for QMA, the quantitative equity and global multi-asset solutions business of PGIM in Newark, New Jersey.
Comparatively high yields and expectations of steady earnings during troubled times have made utilities a popular destination for nervous investors.
With the economic toll of the coronavirus outbreak still unclear, utilities have more recently attracted those seeking to reduce exposure to riskier assets while still remaining in equities, which have outpaced most other markets over the last decade.
""Markets are ... not expecting the end of the world,"" said Juha Seppala, director of the macro asset allocation strategy team at UBS Asset Management. ""You want to be defensive, you want to reduce your risk, but you don't want to be completely out of the market.""

The benchmark S&P 500 Index (SPX) is down about 3% since Jan. 21 but remains close to record highs earlier last month. Betting against stocks has been a losing strategy during the more-than-decade-long bull market: the S&P gained 29% last year despite a trade war between the United States and China and worries over a slowdown in global growth.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said they expected a 0.4 percentage point hit to U.S. annualized growth in the first quarter, followed by a rebound in the second.
High yields in utilities stocks have been another draw for investors at a time when Treasury yields are near historic lows. The S&P utilities sector sports a dividend yield of nearly 3%, compared with 1.6% and 2.2% for 10-year Treasuries and the S&P 500, respectively, according to Refinitiv data.

The dollar, which often rises during times of market stress, has declined 0.3% since Jan. 21. Weaker-than-expected U.S. data on Friday - the Chicago Purchasing Management Index fell to a lower-than-expected 42.9, the lowest since December 2015, as new orders tumbled and producers forecast tepid activity in 2020 - sent the dollar index down 0.5% on Friday.
A drastic worsening of the virus outbreak could push Treasury yields lower and further boost the appeal of utilities, some analysts believe.
""The yield differential between Treasuries and utilities will get even wider so I would not necessarily think that, at least in this period, utilities are going to underperform Treasuries,"" said Praveen of PGIM."
939,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 03, 2020 12:48AM ET</span>",Merkel Plan for Huawei Gets Pushback From Within Her Own Ranks,"(Bloomberg) -- Chancellor Angela Merkel’s efforts to rule out a ban on Huawei Technologies Co. have hit a wall of resistance in parliament.
While the U.K. and the European Union introduced policies that allow Huawei’s partial participation in next-generation wireless networks, Merkel has failed to forge a compromise with lawmakers in her Christian Democratic-led bloc who want to ban China’s biggest maker of telecommunications gear, according to three officials familiar with the process. Attempts to reach an agreement last week failed and will be resumed later in February.
The stalemate reflects Merkel’s difficulty in asserting control in a standoff that pits trade interests with China against security concerns raised by Washington and her own intelligence agencies. Open dissent such as that over the 5G policy is uncommon in Merkel’s otherwise disciplined CDU. Since the 65-year-old former physicist announced over a year ago that she wouldn’t run for a fifth term, she has withdrawn from domestic politics and her agenda has at times been overshadowed by a power struggle to succeed her.

BMW China 2019 Vehicle Sales Rise 13% to Record 723,680 UnitsMerkel’s Partner Wants to Forget Talk of Ditching CoalitionGermany Lifts Economic Outlook, But Says Better Is Needed (1)The security concerns over Beijing’s potential influence over Huawei are shared by many in her allied Social Democratic party and in the Foreign Ministry. Yet the balancing act is proving difficult for Merkel and her government, which are torn between an allegiance for a traditional ally and the risk of antagonizing and isolating Germany’s largest trading partner by shutting out Chinese technology.
“I call on us not to slip into a new form of bi-polarity,” Merkel said in a speech last month in Berlin. “Rather we must try, with the results and experiences we have around multilateralism, to include a country like China and at least treat it on the same terms.”
Yet skeptics accuse Merkel of adhering to an outdated geopolitical view that Chinese economic development would spur political reform and a convergence of the world’s most populous nation with international standards and norms.
“Merkel is stuck with an idea of China that is 10 years old,” Nils Schmid, a senior SPD lawmaker on the Bundestag foreign affairs committee, said in an interview last week.
A group of Bundestag lawmakers is standing by a bill drafted in December that would exclude “untrustworthy” equipment vendors from the whole network, a clear reference to Huawei and a break from last week’s decisions in London and Brussels that defied U.S. demands to exclude Huawei. The U.K. said that Huawei would be allowed access to the periphery of 5G networks, but not the core -- a principle that Merkel’s chancellery had agreed to late last year in a concession to hawks.
Smoking Gun
The hard-liners got a boost last week, when Handelsblatt reported on a classified document from the Foreign Ministry containing U.S. intelligence linking Huawei to Chinese security services, or a “smoking gun.” The ministry declined to comment on the report.
U.S. Deputy National Security Adviser Matthew Pottinger led a delegation to Berlin in December and another to London last month as part of a Trump administration effort to warn the Europeans about Chinese technology and to alert them that intelligence-sharing across the North Atlantic is at risk.
Such warnings haven’t convinced the French government. France’s cybersecurity chief said his agency hasn’t uncovered any evidence of Huawei snooping via Europe’s communications networks.
“There is no Huawei smoking gun as of today in Europe,” Guillaume Poupard, the head of the national cybersecurity agency ANSSI, said in an interview last week. “There is no situation with Huawei being caught massively spying in Europe. Elsewhere maybe it’s different, but not in Europe.”
Merkel will now have to seek a compromise with lawmakers in the Bundestag, which reconvenes Feb. 10."

Japan's biggest car maker will roll out what it calls an ""accelerator suppression function"" in new cars from this summer, beginning in Japan.
The system is a response to an increasingly common cause of traffic accident in ageing Japan where the driver, often elderly, mistakes the accelerator for the brake.
Some 15% of fatal accidents on Japanese roads in 2018 were caused by drivers who were 75 years or older, showed a report from the government, which actively encourages elderly drivers to give up their licenses.
Toyota's announcement comes as automakers globally invest heavily in so-called active safety features as they work to develop fully autonomous cars.
It also comes in the same year Toyota will act as exclusive mobility sponsor for the Tokyo Olympics, where it will showcase its fully self-driving e-Palette transportation pods carrying athletes around the Olympic village at low speeds.
Among competitors, Honda Motor Co Ltd plans to launch a car this year capable of full autonomy in highway traffic jam situations. Nissan Motor Co Ltd released the second generation of its ProPilot driver-assist system last spring, offering hands-free operation for single-lane highway driving.
Toyota rolled out its first-generation Safety Sense package in 2015, which included automated emergency braking and a lane departure alert. The second generation became available in 2018, adding assisted single-lane highway driving and making the car capable of recognizing pedestrians at nighttime and bicycles.
Its new feature was developed using data collected from the internet-connected cars it has on the road. Unlike the car maker's existing safety options, the new system does not require the presence of an obstacle to function."

SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Auditors for listed Chinese companies will likely struggle to complete their work by stock exchange deadlines because of travel bans and other restrictions designed to limit the spread of the new coronavirus, auditors and analysts said.
The restrictions come just as accountants enter their busiest period of the year when the majority of companies are due to file full-year accounts.
A delay in filings could hit companies' ability to raise funds if they cannot show would-be investors and lenders up-to-date numbers. Reduced confidence could also impact share prices.
""This is a real problem. If things get worse, both companies and auditors will have a hard time getting done on time,"" said Paul Gillis, a professor at Peking University's Guanghua School of Management.
Accounting firms are in talks with China's securities regulator over difficulties they are having meeting the April-end deadline for Shanghai-listed companies to announce their results, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter.
The people declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.
Similar lobbying efforts are underway in Hong Kong, where companies must publish their results by March 31, but where the regulator - the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) - has high standards on allowing an extension because of the importance of fresh information for fair trading conditions.
""Normally it is quite a challenging reporting timeline. With the coronavirus happening at such an unfortunate time, we are facing almost an impossible task because of the travel restrictions,"" said Clement Chan, managing director in the assurance practice at BDO partners.
Chan said the problem was compounded because many staff in companies' in-house finance teams were unable to travel back to their city of work after visiting their families for the Lunar New Year holiday.
A total of 1,241 mainland-headquartered companies were listed on the stock exchange of Hong Kong at the end of December, and many other Hong Kong-listed companies have substantial operations on the mainland.
""It is the SFC's view that an issuer would need to demonstrate specific, practical impediments, which are not capable of resolution, to justify any delay,"" a spokesman for the regulator said.
The Hong Kong stock exchange was ""closely monitoring developments,"" a bourse spokesman said.
Year-end audits involve a large degree of field-work, where auditors visit sites to check figures. While much of the work will have been done before year-end, visits now are needed to finalize details.
""You need to sit next to them and make them give you that detailed excel spreadsheet otherwise they don't respond,"" an employee at one of the so-called Big Four auditors told Reuters.
""You also need to randomly check the stock, for example if you're counting female pigs you actually need to go and check that they're female,"" the person said.
The flu-like virus, originating in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has resulted in 361 deaths on the mainland, local health authorities said.
Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province are in virtual quarantine, travel restrictions have been imposed across China, and the Lunar New Year public holiday has been extended to keep people at home and help stop the virus spreading."

Investing.com - Chinese equities slumped almost 8% on Monday morning as markets reopened to the worsening coronavirus outbreak after an extended Lunar New Year holiday. 
The Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component plunged 7.9% and 7.4% respectively by 9:45 PM ET (01:45 GMT). The two indices slid as much as 9% earlier in the day as traders dumped risky assets in response to rising fears about the spread of a new virus across China. 
The death toll from the new coronavirus rose to 361 in China on Monday, while confirmed cases increased to 17,205. 
The People’s Bank of China cut the rates on the funds by 10 basis points on Monday and said it will inject 1.2 trillion yuan ($174 billion) into the financial system as the central bank seek to ensure ample liquidity. 
On the data front, the Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index eased to 51.1 from 51.5 in December, missing expectations but remaining above the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction for the sixth straight month.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dropped 0.3%. 
Meanwhile, Japan’s Nikkei 225 lost 1.2%. South Korea’s KOSPI traded 0.3% lower.
Down under, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 declined 1.2%. The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported on Monday showed approvals to build new homes held steady in December, a surprisingly firm result after a steep jump the month before.
Meanwhile, data from property consultant CoreLogic also showed home prices across the nation rose 0.9% in January, from December when they were up 1.1%.

Members of the United Steelworkers (USW) local 13-2001 in the refinery and laboratory voted down the three-year extension because it included a 6-month expansion of the current four-year period that starting workers must wait before their pay reaches parity with veteran hourly employees, the sources said. 
An Exxon spokesman was not available on Sunday night. USW representatives were also unavailable. 
USW-represented workers in the adjoining Exxon Baytown chemical plant accepted the extension, according to the sources. 
""The refinery and lab were unwilling to sell out future new hires for a $2,000 one-time, lump-sum bonus,"" said one of the sources. ""It would have cost new hires a lot of money over the course of their career."" 
The contract proposal would raise pay by 3.5% in the first year and 4% in the second year. In the third year, the increase would match the pay hike in the new national agreement the USW will negotiate for oil industry workers with energy companies in January 2022, according to the sources. 
The current contract for workers at the Exxon Baytown refinery and laboratory expires on May 15. 

The 560,500 barrel-per-day Baytown refinery is Exxon’s largest in the United States.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued rules on Sunday to implement new restrictions on Americans who have recently visited China to address the threat of the coronavirus.
Airline officials said Sunday the new rules will mean they must now ask all U.S.-bound passengers if they have visited mainland China. Airlines are expected to scrutinize passports of travelers, and warned the new rules could require passengers to arrive even earlier for U.S.-bound flights.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Inc said Sunday it encouraged U.S.-bound passengers ""to arrive at the airport three hours early as we expect this additional screening will lengthen the normal check-in process.""
The United States said Friday that for flights departing after 5 p.m. EST Sunday, it will bar entry to nearly all foreign visitors who have been in China within the last two weeks.
The Trump administration is limiting flights from China and for Americans who have visited China within the last 14 days to eight major U.S. airports for enhanced screening: New York's JFK, Chicago's O'Hare, San Francisco, Seattle-Tacoma, Honolulu, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Dulles in Washington, DC.
Three more airports - Newark, Dallas/Fort Worth and Detroit - would be added on Monday, DHS announced on Sunday.
The new rules do not impact cargo-only flights, DHS said.
American Airlines temporarily halted all flights to mainland China on Friday, while Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) said Sunday its last flight had departed China before it planned resumption of flights in May. United Airlines is scheduled to continue China flights through Wednesday before halting flights through March 27.
Many other nations are imposing similar restrictions.
Airlines must ensure foreign visitors arriving in the United States have not visited China within the last two weeks and Americans who traveled within the last 14 days to China are flying to one of the seven designated airports.
Airlines said they are working to ease the burden on gate agents by also including questions about China travel online and at check-in lobbies, and adding new signs.
A spokeswoman for a group representing U.S. airlines said Sunday ""carriers will continue to comply with all government rules and regulations.""
DHS warned that ""travelers without a nexus to China"" may also be routed through one of the screening airports if it is discovered mid-flight that someone else on their flight has been in China in the last 14 days.
Americans who have been in Hubei, China province within 14 days of their return will be subject to up to 14 days of mandatory quarantine. U.S. citizens who have been in other areas of mainland China within the last 14 days ""will undergo proactive entry health screening and up to 14 days of self-quarantine,"" DHS said.
For Americans who recently traveled to China - but outside Hubei - if they show no symptoms after a screening ""they will be re-booked to their destination and asked to 'self-quarantine' at their homes.""
DHS said Sunday none of restrictions impact flights or visitors from Hong Kong or Macau."

Then-Chief Operating Officer Pierre-Oliver Bouee ordered his head of security to infiltrate the environmental group after Greenpeace disrupted the bank's annual shareholder meeting in 2017, the paper said in an article published on Sunday.
Credit Suisse, which has been criticized by Greenpeace for investing in fossil fuels, gained access to emails, tipping the bank off to demonstrations planned against it, the report said.
A spokesman for Credit Suisse declined to comment on security matters. Greenpeace said it was following up the report and had no comment yet.
Bouee was dismissed in December over the surveillance of former executive board members Iqbal Khan and Peter Goerke. Switzerland's market supervisor FINMA is investigating the issue.
Credit Suisse has said CEO Tidjane Thiam was unaware of the surveillance, and that Bouee had acted alone.
The affair has triggered a power struggle between Thiam and chairman Urs Rohner, with one expected to leave the bank soon, SonntagsZeitung reported. A board meeting is due to be held this week. The bank has rejected a Bloomberg report that Rohner is drawing up a list of potential successors to Thiam.

The allegations came to light on Friday when Airbus agreed to a record $4 billion settlement with France, Britain and the United States. Prosecutors said it had bribed public officials and hidden payments as part of a pattern of worldwide corruption.
Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) said on Friday that between October 2013 and January 2015, Airbus's then-parent EADS paid $50 million to sponsor a sports team that was jointly owned by two people described as AirAsia Executive 1 and Executive 2.
The SFO said the executives were rewarded for an aircraft order from Airbus, an allegation AirAsia denied late on Saturday.
""The Securities Commission Malaysia will examine the allegations and review all available evidence to determine if there is any breach of securities laws,"" Syed Zaid Albar, the regulator's chairman, said in a statement.
Directors who act with the intent to cause wrongful loss to their listed firms can face jail or fines, he said.
Malaysia's anti-graft agency has already launched a separate investigation into the allegations.
AirAsia said in its Saturday statement that it had not been involved with the SFO’s investigation of Airbus or given any opportunity to provide clarification. It denied any wrongdoing.
Reached for comment by Reuters on Sunday, the company pointed to the statement that said it would fully cooperate with ""relevant authorities where required"". Airbus said it had no comment.

952,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2020 04:07AM ET</span>",Philippines reports first coronavirus death outside China,"By Ryan Woo and Enrico Dela Cruz
BEIJING/MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines on Sunday reported the growing epidemic of a coronavirus has claimed its first fatality outside of China, where new confirmed infections jumped by a daily record to top 14,000 cases.
The Philippines Department of Health said a 44-year-old man from Wuhan city in central Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak, had died in a Manila hospital after developing severe pneumonia.
It was the first death out of more than 130 cases reported in around two dozen countries and regions outside of mainland China.
The man who died was a companion of a 38-year-old Chinese woman, also from Wuhan, who was the first and only other person to test positive for the virus in the Philippines. Both patients arrived in the Philippines via Hong Kong on Jan. 21.
China's death toll from the outbreak reached 304 as of the end of Saturday, state broadcaster CCTV said on Sunday, citing the country's National Health Commission.
China is facing mounting isolation as other countries introduce travel curbs, airlines suspend flights and governments evacuate their citizens, risking worsening a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy.
China's central bank has promised to provide monetary and credit support to companies struggling due to the virus. It said it will inject a hefty 1.2 trillion yuan ($173.8 billion) worth of liquidity into the markets via reverse repo operations on Monday as the country prepares to reopen its stock markets after an extended Lunar New Year holiday.
China Evergrande Group, the nation's third-largest property developer, said in an internal note on Sunday it would extend its Lunar New Year holiday to Feb. 16, and suspend construction work at all of its 1,246 sites until Feb. 20.
Also on Sunday, state media reported that construction of one of two hospitals in Wuhan dedicated to treating coronavirus patients has been completed. Huoshenshan, a hospital with 1,000 beds, was built in eight days and can receive patients from Monday, state media said.
TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS MOUNT
The World Health Organization on Thursday declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, but said global trade and travel restrictions are not needed.
However, some countries are responding to fears of the virus spreading by ramping up border controls. Singapore and the United States announced measures on Friday to ban foreign nationals who have recently been to China from entering their territories, and Australia followed suit on Saturday.
Russia introduced visa restrictions and will start evacuating Russian citizens on Monday and Tuesday, Interfax and TASS news agencies reported.
The Philippines expanded its travel ban to include all foreigners coming from China, widening an earlier restriction that covered only those from Hubei province.
New Zealand and Vietnam also barred foreigners who have been in China, with Vietnam saying it would halt all flights to and from China.
Taiwan has asked its diplomats to talk to governments where Taiwanese airlines fly to ensure flights are not cut off due the island's inclusion by the WHO as part of China.
Meanwhile, nations continue to evacuate citizens from China.
More than 100 Germans and family members landed in Frankfurt on Saturday after being evacuated from Wuhan. Around 250 Indonesians were also evacuated from Hubei.
China will start making arrangements to fly back to Taiwan the first 200 Taiwanese who have been stranded in Hubei, Chinese state media reported on Sunday. China said about 500 Taiwanese are in the province.
Japan plans to send another chartered plane mid-week or later to bring back Japanese nationals who are still in Hubei, its foreign ministry said on Sunday.
Japan also confirmed an additional three cases of the new coronavirus among an earlier batch of evacuees, including one who initially tested negative, the health ministry said, bringing the country's total to 20 cases.
Japan has barred foreigners who have been in Hubei from entering the country, a move followed on Sunday by South Korea where the entry ban will go into effect on Tuesday, South Korean Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said.
Hubei has been under virtual quarantine for the last week, with roads sealed off and public transport shut down. The province extended its Lunar New Year holiday break to Feb. 13 in a bid to contain the outbreak.
The number of deaths in Hubei from the outbreak had risen to 294 as of the end of Feb. 1, with a total of 9,074 cases, the majority in the capital city Wuhan, where the virus is thought to have emerged late last year in a market illegally trading wildlife.
New confirmed cases also surged by 276 in nearby Huanggang. One death was reported in the city, about 60 km (37 miles) east of Wuhan."

CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - As global investors shift away from heavy industry in favor of cleaner sectors, mining companies are losing billions in financing, raising the cost of capital and jeopardizing projects.
Making the mining industry more sustainable by running mines on renewable energy, for example, will be a key focus at the annual Investing in African Mining Indaba conference in Cape Town this week, as companies hunt for new sources of capital including private equity, debt, offtake finance and royalty finance.
Environmental, social & governance (ESG) concerns have driven money into specialized ESG funds which often exclude mining stocks among other 'dirty' assets. ""You talk to anyone at the moment, they say there's no money,"" said Boris Kamstra, executive director of Alphamin Resources, which manages the Bisie tin project in Democratic Republic of Congo.
The capital squeeze that started about two years ago has worsened recently, said Julian Treger, CEO of  Anglo Pacific Group  (L:APF), a mining royalty and streaming company. The average cost of capital for early-stage mining projects rose by two percentage points over the past two years, he estimates.
""Even for companies that have good projects it's very difficult for them to raise any money in these markets,"" said Caroline Donally, managing director at private equity firm Denham Capital, in Houston.
""Previous investors who would provide equity appear to have withdrawn. A number of specialist funds have shut up shop, and generalists aren't investing in commodities anymore,"" said Donally, who will be attending Mining Indaba, the world's biggest mining investment conference, which takes place Feb. 3-6.
Cannabis stocks and cryptocurrencies are among alternative assets that are luring retail investors away from miners. Mining-specific private equity funds raised $0.3 billion in 2019, a fifth of the amount raised in 2009, and just barely more than the $0.2 billion raised in 2014 during a global commodity crash, data from Preqin shows.

COAL PROJECTS FLOUNDER
Coal miners - especially those extracting thermal coal, burnt to produce electricity - are bearing the brunt of the sustainable investing trend.
Norway's sovereign wealth fund divested from all fossil fuel last year, and the world's biggest asset manager Blackrock (N:BLK) said on Jan. 14 it would sell active holdings in companies generating more than 25% of revenues from thermal coal.
""If you’re a small coal explorer, I don’t think you stand much of a chance of raising any money at all,"" said Fred White, associate director at Medea Capital Partners in London.
""There’s still a huge market and huge demand [for coal], but it's not getting financed by Western banks,"" he added. Local trading houses and lenders are stepping in instead.
Thermal coal accounts for nearly 40% of the world's electricity generation and more than 40% of energy-related carbon dioxide emissions, according to the International Energy Agency.
In Africa, where access to electricity is still a problem, coal-to-power projects could previously rely on support from development finance institutions.
But even they are withdrawing under pressure.
In November, the African Development Bank (AfDB) decided against funding a Kenya coal project that was halted by a local environmental tribunal in June.
The continent's biggest coal producer, South Africa, is also seeing funding dry up. South Africa's Nedbank (J:NEDJ) has stopped funding coal-related projects, while FirstRand (J:FSRJ) cut greenfield thermal coal projects to less than 0.5% of its lending."

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's anti-graft agency is investigating allegations by Britain's Serious Fraud Office that Airbus paid a bribe of $50 million to win plane orders from Asia’s largest budget airline group, Malaysia-based AirAsia, it said on Saturday.
The SFO said on Friday that Airbus had failed to prevent individuals associated with it bribing executives linked to AirAsia Group and its long-haul arm, AirAsia X.
AirAsia said it had never made any purchase decisions that were premised on an Airbus sponsorship, and that it would fully cooperate with Malaysia's Anti-Corruption Commission.
In a statement, it said it had not been involved with the SFO’s investigation of Airbus or given any opportunity to provide clarification.
""AirAsia vigorously rejects and denies any and all allegations of wrongdoing,"" it said.
""As AirAsia and its executives have no visibility on Airbus’ internal processes, we cannot comment on or be associated with any alleged failures or lapses on the part of Airbus to comply with its own policies or applicable legal requirements.""
Airbus declined to comment.
On Friday, Airbus agreed a record $4 billion settlement with France, Britain and the United States after prosecutors said it had bribed public officials and hidden the payments as part of a pattern of worldwide corruption.
The deal allowed Airbus to avoid criminal prosecution that could have led to it being barred from public contracts in the United States and the European Union.
The disclosures came after an investigation spanning sales to more than a dozen overseas markets.
""Under the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) Act we are empowered, and have jurisdiction, to investigate any act of corruption committed by any Malaysian citizen or permanent resident in any place outside Malaysia,"" MACC Chief Commissioner Latheefa Koya said in a statement.
""In the case of the Airbus-AirAsia disclosures, I confirm that the MACC is in touch with the UK authorities and is already investigating the matter.""
MALAYSIA AIRLINES SEEKS PARTNER
The investigation comes as the Malaysian government evaluates five strategic investment proposals, among them one from AirAsia, to partner with the ailing national carrier, Malaysia Airlines.
AirAsia runs an all-Airbus fleet of 274 planes. 
The SFO's allegations concern a 2012 sponsorship agreement between the now-defunct Caterham Formula 1 racing team, founded by AirAsia boss Tony Fernandes, and Airbus's then-parent, EADS.
The SFO said on Friday that between October 2013 and January 2015, EADS paid $50 million to sponsor Caterham, which was jointly owned by two people described as AirAsia Executive 1 and Executive 2. It said Airbus employees offered an additional $55 million, though no payment was made.
Fernandes bought Caterham together with his partner Kamarudin Meranun, AirAsia's chairman, in 2011. Fernandes and Kamarudin could not immediately be reached for comment.
The SFO said that Executives 1 and 2 were ""key decision makers in AirAsia and AirAsia X, and were rewarded in respect of the order of 180 aircraft from Airbus"".
""The payments to the sports team were intended to secure or reward improper favor by them in respect of that business.""
The airline's statement said that ""all negotiations and dealings leading to the signing of any aircraft purchase agreement have been undertaken directly with Airbus on an arm’s length basis, and without the involvement of any third parties or intermediaries"".
Malaysia has been trying for years to recover billions of dollars allegedly stolen https://www.reuters.com/article/us-malaysia-politics-mahathir-1mdb-expla/explainer-malaysias-mega-1mdb-scandal-that-has-scalded-goldman-sachs-idUSKBN1YE0KS from the state fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd.

957,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2020 11:06AM ET</span>","13 minutes, $13 million: The logistics of pulling off a Super Bowl halftime show","By Nick Brown
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The popular Super Bowl halftime show is only 13 minutes long, but the million-dollar-a-minute extravaganza takes thousands of people, months of planning and near military precision to pull off.
Organizers have the Herculean task of turning a football field into a concert venue and back in less than half an hour, and without damaging the playing surface.
Halftime at Sunday's 54th Super Bowl between the San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs in Miami will be headlined by Latina pop stars Jennifer Lopez and Shakira. It also will feature surprise artists and other ensemble singers, said Dan Parise, a producer working with Roc Nation, the entertainment company producing the show with the National Football League. 
PepsiCo (O:PEP) is sponsoring the show for the eighth straight year. A source with direct knowledge of the show said it would cost about $13 million, a figure an NFL spokeswoman declined to confirm.
""There are so many aspects of it, the dancers, the lighting elements, the special effects,"" said Parise. ""It's like a big jigsaw puzzle.""
The work starts almost a year in advance, said Mark Quenzel, the NFL's senior vice president for programming and production. Organizers scout the venue for logistical hurdles or unique structural elements they could use to their advantage. 
In 2014, for example, producers had to keep Bruno Mars’ show relatively simple, because it was impossible to predict field conditions at MetLife (NYSE:MET) Stadium in New Jersey, a rare outdoor cold weather Super Bowl. 
This year, said Parise, a newly renovated overhang at Hard Rock Stadium allowed for deployment of more advanced audio equipment.
All in, the production takes 2,000 to 3,000 people to produce, said Quenzel, who is on his 10th halftime show. 
Like past performances, this year's show will include an on-field “audience” of some 800 people, mostly kids from local schools who are cast in advance, and must rehearse with the artists.
Often, they are asked to play a larger role than that of cheering fans. During Justin Timberlake's 2018 rendition of “Mirrors,” the on-field crowd held up mirrors to reflect stadium lights.
LIKE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS
The biggest feat of coordination is setting up the stage, which is wheeled in on 38 separate carts, each requiring 12 people to move. Another 18 carts, with 6-member teams, carry the audio equipment.
Like air traffic controllers, team leaders wearing headsets direct each team. A stage piece ending up in the wrong place, even by an inch or two, could be disastrous, Quenzel said.   
The setup takes eight minutes, with the show itself lasting about 13. Removing the stage takes just over six minutes, Quenzel said, before the teams retake the field.
During the show, behind-the-scenes personnel wait in predetermined spots to carry away clothing during wardrobe changes that must be executed down to the second, Quenzel said. “Part of the art of the show is what we don't show you, what you don't see,” he said. 
An example that stands out to Quenzel was in 2015, when pop star Katy Perry wanted to sing her hit, “Roar.""
She and the producers thought it would be fun if she entered riding a golden lion. The 20-foot (6.1 m) mechanical beast was set on wheels concealed by legs that were pushed back and forth by performers to mimic footsteps.
For such a massive spectacle, there is precious little time to rehearse. Shakira and Lopez began separate rehearsals as early as December, Parise said, but had only a few days to practice together.
Rehearsals mostly took place at the Miami Dolphins’ practice facility, before moving to the Super Bowl stadium on Wednesday. “We were working 12-to-15-hour days,” Parise said. 
Communication is another challenge. In addition to the hundreds of people hired by the NFL, each artist brings enormous teams of dancers and staff. To get everyone on the same page, producers hire veteran industry pros, including producer Ricky Kirshner and director Hamish Hamilton. 
Sunday's show is said to feature plenty of special effects and dancing. But with all that goes into planning, it is important to remember the show is not the main event, Quenzel said. 
""It's never lost on us that we're the side show,” he said."
958,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2020 08:11AM ET</span>",India raises import taxes in move set to spook some foreign firms,"By Aditya Kalra and Chandini Monnappa
NEW DELHI/BENGALURU (Reuters) - India on Saturday raised taxes on imports of goods such as electronic items, toys and furniture, aiming to give impetus to domestic manufacturing in a move that will hit Sweden's IKEA and other foreign firms.
The measures, announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her 2020-21 budget, come amid criticism from some companies that India has increasingly resorted to protectionist rules that discriminate against foreign companies.
Listing the new taxes, the government said they were in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""Make in India"" program aimed at promoting domestic industry.
Taxes on imports of items including kitchenware, fans and small electrical appliances will be doubled to 20%, while the levy on furniture including seats, lamps and mattresses will be raised to 25% from 20%.
IKEA's India CEO Peter Betzel said the company was disappointed with the increase. ""We are further evaluating the impact of the hike on our total business,"" he said. IKEA, which has committed more than 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion) in India investments, imports roughly 75% of goods sold in the country.
Sitharaman defended the decision, saying the rationale was that if certain goods were being manufactured locally at ""equal quality, if not better, (then) we had no reason to import.""
Taxes on imported toys would be tripled to 60%, a move one industry executive said could hit imports of toys made by firms such as Lego, Hasbro (O:HAS) and Mattel (O:MAT), and boost smuggling of unbranded toys from abroad.
""It's a protectionist move,"" said the executive.
The new tariffs also come as India and the United States try to resolve trade differences and have been at odds over certain tariffs. Washington has been urging India to not impose trade barriers that restrict growth of American firms.
The government also said a tax of 5% will be imposed on imported medical device imports to fund health infrastructure. The measure could hit firms such as Abbott (N:ABT) which are already battling price caps imposed by the government.
""It would make some imported medical devices costlier and that increase will likely be passed on to consumers,"" said an India-based executive of foreign medical device company.
The duty on shelled walnuts will be raised to 100% from 30% while certain car and smartphone parts will also face higher import taxes."
959,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 01, 2020 05:54AM ET</span>",3 Things Under the Radar This Week,"By Yasin Ebrahim and Kim Khan 
Investing.com - Wild market swings came this week as a Black Swan swooped down on 2020 in the form of the coronavirus.
That lent an extra edge of volatility to what was the busiest week of earnings for the season, which also had a Fed decision a Bank of England decision, U.S. GDP and the U.K. officially leaving the EU. It’s not surprising some things may have gone unnoticed.
While stocks were still diving on Friday, investment banks were betting on a white knight to fix the economic ramifications of the coronavirus.
Telsa had another stellar week, but is there one area out its control that could stifle the stock?
And investors shouldn’t ignore the big game this weekend.
Here are three things that flew under the radar this week.
1. In the Fed We Trust
A deadly disease emanating from Wuhan, China rocked global markets to the core this week. The S&P 500 turned negative for the month. The CBOE Volatility Index, or fear index, spiked to three-month highs. And safe havens like gold and bonds rode the wave of fear to sharp weekly gains.
In the wake of the rising coronavirus risk, some on Wall Street have warned that a 5% to 10% correction beckons for stock markets. But they appear reluctant to wave the white flag on the decade-long bull run in equities, claiming the Federal Reserve will save the day.
If China's economy comes under heavy siege from the virus ""its 18% weight in the global economy would have an overwhelmingly negative effect on the rest of the global economy,"" and likely call the Fed into action,   Societe Generale   (PA:SOGN) said in a note.
  Morgan Stanley   (NYSE:MS) agreed, saying the Fed won't allow an accelerated slump in stocks as ""liquidity remains flush.""
But Societe Generale is still not keen to wade into beaten-down stocks.
""In our view, it is too early to call a generalized ‘buy the dips,’ given the newsflow on the virus is currently anything but reassuring,"" it said.
J.P. Morgan is a little more daring.
""The latest health scare is likely to worsen before getting better,"" but ""past outbreaks have tended to drive only limited market falls,"" J.P. Morgan said. 
These previous health scares did not lead to a prolonged period of selling, and were a ""buying opportunity within weeks,"" it added.
2. Can Anything Stall Tesla?
It was quite a week for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which seems it can do no wrong at the moment.
It knocked its earnings out of the park, sending the high-flying stock still higher. On Friday, during the massive selloff on coronavirus fears, it ended 1.5% higher, even though its Shanghai factory could be impacted. CEO Elon Musk even dropped an EDM song entitled “Don’t Doubt ur Vibe.”
Is there any fly in Tesla’s ointment? Perhaps one is the attitude of governments towards electric vehicle subsidies.
Around the globe, the message looks mixed.

In the U.S., Tesla hit the cap of 200,000 vehicles that was set for a $7,500 consumer tax break in 2019 and Congress declined to extend the cap to 600,000 vehicles.

In China, Beijing plans to end its new energy vehicle (NEV) subsidies after 2020, but said it would not cut subsidies again this summer, which the auto industry saw as a win.
In Norway, where electric cars make up more than 40% of sales, VAT exemptions have been extended to the end of 2021.
In Germany, Tesla's lower-priced Model 3s are subsidized with a grant of 4,000 euros that the government plans to increase by half over the five years from 2020.
In Canada, the Model 3 can get a rebate of up to C$5,000 under the zeo-emission incentive program.

In the U.K. all Tesla models are eligible for a rebate od up to 3,500 pounds.

3. What’s the Super Bowl to the S&P?
It’s Super Bowl LIV weekend and while U.S. investors may know the connection to equities, the Super Bowl Indicator may have flown under the radar for global traders, especially considering all the other big headlines.
The Super Bowl Indicator says that if a team from the NFC wins the big game there will be bull market that year and if the AFC team wins, there will be a bear market. (It’s quite straightforward if you don’t get too hung up on expansion teams arising after the 1970 NFL/AFL merger and teams switching conferences.)
That means a win by the San Francisco 49ers will be good for stocks and a Kansas City Chiefs win won’t.
Noticed in 1978 by a New York Times sports writer and popularized by market newsletter, this coincidental correlation still gets attention as it’s been mostly right.
Through 53 Super Bowls, in 79% of years when the NFC has won, stocks have ended the year up.
But it’s been wrong the last four games.
For the real gamblers who can’t even wait for the big game, videogame maker Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) ran its game simulation on ""Madden NFL 20,"" with the Chiefs taking the Vince Lombardi trophy home, beating the Niners 35-31.
And for those who don’t like sports, there’s the classic January Indicator that says as goes the first month, so goes the year. Friday’s big selloff pushed the S&P 500 just into the red for the month."
960,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2020 04:32AM ET</span>",PG&E proposes board revamp in revised bankruptcy plan,"(Reuters) - Bankrupt California power producer PG&E Corp said on Saturday it had submitted an updated bankruptcy reorganization plan including a new board of directors and new roles aimed at addressing concerns raised by California Governor Gavin Newsom. 
PG&E filed for Chapter 11 protection in January last year, citing potential liabilities in excess of $30 billion from deadly wildfires in 2017 and 2018 linked to its equipment.
Newsom, in a public letter to the company on Dec. 13, had rejected an earlier PG&E reorganization plan saying it lacked major changes in governance and tougher safety enforcement mechanisms mandated under the state wildfire statute. 
Newsom has accused the company of putting profit ahead of maintenance of its power lines and of poorly managing the widespread blackouts PG&E used to avoid sparking wildfires during high winds.
PG&E said it believed its updated plan addressed the Newsom's concerns.

Aside from the new board, the plan would also create two newly expanded roles of Chief Risk Officer and Chief Safety Officer, who will both report directly to the company's chief executive, the company added in its statement.

961,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2020 02:32AM ET</span>",Earnings volatility set to kick in as coronavirus worries mount,"By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Concerns over the outbreak of coronavirus from China have largely overshadowed corporate results, but the back half of the earnings season could hold greater sway over the performance of individual stocks.
Earnings-related stock moves have been smaller this season in comparison with the average over the past 12 quarters, according to data from options research company ORATS. 
The muted moves reflect a broader trend of subdued volatility that had limited price fluctuations in a range of assets over the last several months. Some of that calm was disrupted this week, as mounting concerns over the spread of the coronavirus on Friday dealt the benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) stock index its biggest daily percentage loss since October.
The dampened earnings-related moves have benefited options sellers, who profit when the change in share price is smaller than expected.
Yet betting that earnings-related moves will remain subdued could soon become more costly. 
Options traders have priced in more volatility for broader exchange-traded funds. Implied volatility on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (P:SPY), which shows expectations for future stock swings, has climbed since mid-January, according to data from Trade Alert. That rise coincides with mounting concerns over the potential economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak.
""The options market is reflecting this new risk, this coronavirus risk,"" said Ophir Gottlieb, chief executive of Capital Market Laboratories in Los Angeles.
Moreover, risks from the virus outbreak are beginning to spill over into earnings commentary. Companies such as  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX), Levi Strauss & Co (N:LEVI) and Oreos maker  Mondelez International Inc  (O:MDLZ) have warned of a financial hit from the outbreak. As such remarks pile up, they could also bump up volatility among shares of certain companies, Gottlieb said.
""Some CEOs are openly saying, 'Hey, things are going to be a little harder,'"" Gottlieb said.
At the same time, the fourth and fifth weeks of the six-week earnings season have usually reaped the greatest rewards for traders buying options in anticipation of outsized stock moves, according to ORATS data.
Earnings-related moves tend to be greater in those weeks in part because smaller companies, whose stocks are often more volatile, tend to report later in the season, said Matt Amberson, founder of ORATS, in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.
Options for several S&P 500 (SPX) companies reporting next week - including  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (N:CMG),  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) and  Coty Inc  (N:COTY) - show a gap of several percentage points between investors' expectations for share moves and past share performance after quarterly reports.

It appears that the cost of buying options on individual stocks ahead of a company's earnings report is ""getting cheaper when it should be getting more expensive,"" Amberson said.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Weaker crude oil and gas prices drove quarterly results sharply lower at  Exxon Mobil  Corp and  Chevron  Corp, pushing down shares at the two largest U.S. oil producers and signaling a weak start to the new year. 
While one-time asset sales or write downs were large factors, the two companies said earnings suffered from weaker margins in crude oil, natural gas, chemicals and fuel production. They gave tepid outlooks for the near term.
""There's no silver bullet on improving returns in a flat commodity price environment,"" said Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth. ""You roll up your sleeves and you get to work on all the little things.""
Shares of Exxon and Chevron were about 4% lower on Friday, pressured by the results and worries about global economic growth that drove the broader market lower. Exxon lost $2.67 to close at $62.12 and Chevron fell $4.26 to $107.14.
Fourth-quarter results at Exxon (N:XOM) fell below Wall Street's recently lowered estimate, with earnings sliding to $5.6 billion from $6 billion a year ago. Per share profit excluding one-time gain from asset sales was 41 cents, below Wall Street's estimate of 43 cents.
Chevron (N:CVX) swung to a loss of $6.61 billion from a year-earlier profit of $3.73 billion. The company had $10 billion in charges including writedowns on the value of oil and gas properties that were no longer economic to pump. Excluding charges, its $1.49 cent a share profit topped estimates. 
This week, Royal Dutch Shell's shares hit a three-year low after it laid out a plan to pull back on share buybacks amid slower global growth.  BP  PLC (L:BP) and  Total  SA (PA:TOTF) report financial results next week.
Exxon CEO Darren Woods said its natural gas, refining and chemicals businesses have suffered from prices near or at decade lows. Exxon will keep investing in new projects on the belief that a growing global middle class will drive demand for its products, Woods said, describing the margin weakness as ""a short-term impact.""
Exxon and Chevron are racing in the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field, to each reach 1 million barrels per day of production, but neither is anywhere near that level right now.
Exxon’s output rose 54% from a year ago while Chevron's gained 36%.

Values are down across the oil and gas sector, prompting ongoing speculation that large companies will acquire smaller ones in the Permian Basin. Woods, though, said that the best opportunities are usually the ones ""that you can generate organically.""

WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - All three major U.S. airlines announced the cancellation of flights to mainland China on Friday as the U.S. government unveiled additional steps to curb the spread of the coronavirus, which originated in China.
The trio of carriers, United Airlines Holdings Inc, Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc, had already moved to reduce flights to China amid a sharp drop in demand due to the flu-like virus.
The Trump administration on Friday declared a public health emergency over the coronavirus outbreak and said it would take the extraordinary step of barring entry to the United States of foreign nationals who have recently traveled to China.
As of Sunday, the United States will also limit flights from China to seven U.S. airports and U.S. citizens who have traveled to China's Hubei Province within the last 14 days will be subject to a mandatory 14-day quarantine.
However, the administration was not considering ""at the moment"" more drastic actions like barring all flights from China, assistant Transportation Secretary Joel Szabat said at a White House briefing, noting that airlines were already voluntarily taking action to stop flights.
""There is no travel ban,"" said Szabat, adding: ""This is an evolving situation.""
On Thursday the U.S. State Department elevated a travel advisory, raising China to the same level as Afghanistan and Iraq. 
Airline crews had urged carriers stop flights to the country, with American's pilots filing a lawsuit on Thursday seeking an immediate halt.
American on Friday announced cancellations to Beijing and Shanghai starting immediately and running through March 27, though it will continue to fly to Hong Kong. 
United and Delta's last flights out of mainland China will be Feb. 5, with cancellations running through March 28 and April 30 respectively. 
Some internal messages by employees of United, the largest U.S. carrier to China, seen by Reuters expressed concern that the airline was not stopping flights sooner.
In its statement, United said the decision to operate flights until Feb. 5 would ""help ensure our U.S. based employees, as well as customers, have options to return home.""
United will also continue to operate a daily flight to Hong Kong.
U.S. airline shares have posted heavy losses this week on concerns of the financial impact of the virus.
Passenger traffic from China had fallen by nearly 20% over the last week as of Thursday, while travel from the United States to China had dropped by more than 50%, Acting Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Ken Cuccinelli said.
Other airlines that have stopped their flights to mainland China include Air France KLM SA, British Airways, Germany's Lufthansa and Virgin Atlantic.

Major Chinese carriers were still operating flights to and from the United States as of Friday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's major averages tumbled more than 1.5% on Friday, sealing its worst week in six months, as the spreading coronavirus outbreak, coupled with sluggish U.S. economic data and a mixed batch of corporate earnings, fueled concerns about global growth.
After suffering its biggest one-day percentage decline since Oct. 2, the S&P 500 (SPX) is down more than 3% from its closing high hit earlier in January, as businesses struggle with supply problems from the coronavirus epidemic that has killed 213 people in China and been declared a global emergency.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said it had issued a quarantine order for all Americans repatriated from China to an air base in California. However, stocks pared losses late in the session as the agency director, Robert Redfield, said the risk to the U..S public is low.
Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) lost 2.38% and  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) fell 3.17% after the companies said they would suspend all flights to mainland China. 
Economists fear the coronavirus could have a bigger impact than Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed about 800 people between 2002 and 2003 at an estimated cost of $33 billion to the global economy, since China's share of the world economy is now far greater.
U.S. data showing consumer spending rose steadily in December while wage gains indicated moderate growth in consumption amid contracting business investment added to the growth concerns. Additionally, a report on manufacturing in the Midwest hit a four-year low for January.
""We spent most of this week still with this kind of euphoric optimism about the U.S. market, and today that finally began to fade... people are finally starting to get concerned,"" said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Stamford, Connecticut.
""(The virus is) going to take a toll on the global economy, and investors are just starting to realize that now here in the U.S.""
Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) was a bright spot, surging 7.38% on better-than-expected results for the holiday-quarter that pushed it back into the $1 trillion market capitalization club.
Gains in Amazon helped the consumer discretionary index (SPLRCD) rise 0.82%, the only sector on the plus side. Energy (SPNY) was by far the worst performer, tumbling 3.18%.
Oil majors  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) and  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) were the primary drags on the sector as each dropped more than 4% after disappointing results. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 603.41 points, or 2.09%, to 28,256.03, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 58.14 points, or 1.77%, to 3,225.52 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 148.00 points, or 1.59%, to 9,150.94.
For the week, the Dow fell 2.5%, the S&P lost 2.1% and the Nasdaq declined 1.8%. Both the Dow and S&P 500 had their worst weekly performances since early August. For the month, the Dow lost 1%, the S&P slipped 0.2% and the Nasdaq rose 2%. 
 Visa Inc  (N:V) fell 4.44% after its quarterly revenue missed estimates and the payments network warned of incentives hitting 2020 results.
International Business Machines Corp (N:IBM) gained 5.09% after it named a new chief executive officer.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.58-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.35-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 33 new 52-week highs and 12 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 54 new highs and 121 new lows.

Investing.com – The S&P capped the first month of the new decade with its biggest daily loss since October as coronavirus-led selling intensified on concerns a pandemic could send the global economy into turmoil.
The S&P 500 fell 1.77%, while the Nasdaq Composite slumped 1.59% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.09%. 
Thr S&P and Dow ended January in the red.
Fears of contagion gripped stocks amid growing doubt about whether China can contain the outbreak, with more than 10,000 cases reported globally so far, and the death toll rising to 213.
The White House on Friday declared the coronavirus a public health emergency in the United States and warned that people who pose a risk of transmitting the disease will temporarily be suspended from entry into the U.S.
The rapid spread of the virus has triggered recession fears as the impact on China's already slowing economy could spill over into the global economy.
But some have said it is far too early to estimate the impact on global growth and suggested the recent selloff was a long time coming as stocks were overbought.
""Global growth right now is projected to be greater than 3%. If this continues, and maybe even if it only continues for another month, you could knock that down below 3(%),"" Blackstones' Byron Wien told CNBC. 
""I think the market was overbought. It was due for a correction. A correction is healthy,” Wein added.
The selling on stocks was exacerbated by a slump in energy, paced by weakness in   Exxon Mobil   (NYSE:XOM).
Exxon fell about 4% after the oil major missed quarterly estimates, which it blamed on short-term supply issues in its refining business.
Industrials also played a role in the broader selloff, paced by declines in   Caterpillar   (NYSE:CAT) and Honeywell (NYSE:HON) on weak quarterly results and guidance. 
Caterpillar fell 3% after reporting mixed quarterly results and offering up a weaker-than-expected outlook on full-year performance, warning that global economic uncertainty would continue to weigh on performance.
Honeywell slipped about 3% as its quarterly revenue missed Wall Street estimates, with the industrial pinning the blame on impact from the grounding of Boeing's 737 Max.
Consumer discretionary proved an exception to the rout on Wall Street thanks to a pop in shares of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) after the e-commerce giant smashed earnings expectations. Shares rose 7%, but were off earlier highs."

NEW YORK/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Buyout firm  Carlyle Group  Inc (O:CG) has delayed the U.S. initial public offering (IPO) of its German specialty chemicals group Atotech, concerned that the coronavirus outbreak would negatively impact the valuation it could achieve with investors, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
Carlyle's decision highlights the uncertainty that the spread of the virus in China and around the world has brought to financial markets, with the benchmark S&P 500 Index (SPX) on track for its worst week since August.
Atotech, which makes specialty chemicals and equipment for printed circuit boards and semiconductors, had planned to kick off its IPO process this week by publishing an indicated price range.
However, Carlyle became concerned that Atotech's production and business exposure in China, as well as the broader market volatility caused by the outbreak, would hurt investor demand in the IPO, the sources said.
Atotech operates several manufacturing facilities in China, accounting for 38% of the revenue in its chemistry segment, which in turn makes up about 90% of its business, according to its IPO registration.
It could not be learned when Atotech was planning to resume its IPO preparations. If the delay extends beyond Feb. 14, the company would have to resubmit its IPO filing to U.S. regulators to include full-year earnings, pushing back the process further.
The sources requested anonymity because the decision is confidential. Atotech and Carlyle declined to comment on the IPO plans and on any potential impact of the coronavirus outbreak on Atotech's business in China.
To be sure, the window to go public is still open for companies with less or no exposure to China. Household goods maker Reynolds Consumer Products (O:REYN) and digital-focused healthcare provider  1Life Healthcare Inc  (O:ONEM), which is also backed by Carlyle, successfully completed IPOs this week.
Carlyle acquired Atotech in 2016 in a deal worth $3.2 billion, including debt. The company was looking for a valuation of around $5 billion, including debt, in its IPO, Reuters previously reported."

Investing.com – Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has weathered the selling storm Friday, underpinned by its blowout quarterly results. But the e-commerce giant's rally is far from over, with one analyst laying out a bull case for the stock to rally nearly 60% over the next two years.
RBC Capital's raised its price target on shares of Amazon to $3,200 from $2,700 and estimated that the stock could rally to $3,200 on a favorable backdrop.
In an upside scenario, Amazon shares could be worth $3,200 as heightened growth could spur support higher multiples for the e-commerce giant, RBC said.
The investment bank said highlighted various segments that would likely drive higher-than-expected revenue growth rates over the next two years, including ""international growth, Alexa device adoption, Amazon Web Services and advertising revenue growth.""
""Operating margins could expand in 2019 due to increased revenue growth coupled with improving efficiencies,"" it added. 
The bullish outlook comes a day after the e-commerce giant delivered blowout quarterly results, with a beat on both the top and bottom lines.
Growth was led by strong performance in its North American retail business as the rollout of its one-day shipping program bolstered sales.
Its cloud business, AWS, also impressed with better-than-expected as revenue of $9.95 billion for the quarter, topped estimates of $9.84 billion.
The beat in cloud services in the face of rising competition should ease investor concerns about the slowing growth in the e-commerce giant's high-margin business.

The U.S. central bank’s No. 2 official said it’s too early to determine whether the coronavirus outbreak in China will significantly affect the U.S. economy, which remains in a “good place.”
“It is a wild card,” said Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida in an interview on Bloomberg Television Friday. “We’re looking into how it translates into the outlook for Chinese growth, for global growth and for how it impacts the U.S.”
Clarida said the U.S. economy could absorb a temporary stutter, saying “if this were to result in, say, a one or two-quarter slowdown in growth, that’s probably not something that changes the big picture. But I do agree it’s a challenging situation. We’re going to keep on top of it.”
Fed policy makers left interest rates unchanged this week and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell hinted that he and his colleagues were shifting to an even more dovish posture in a effort to get inflation back to their 2% target over time, putting further downward pressure on 10-year Treasury yields.
Clarida reiterated that current policy was appropriate and the Fed wouldn’t shift interest rates unless there was a “material” change in U.S. forecasts. His remarks suggest a brief economic softening wouldn’t reach that threshold.
Financial markets are on edge over the economic fallout from the coronavirus, with U.S. stocks falling more than 1.5% Friday. The outbreak has claimed more than 200 lives in China and spread to more than a dozen countries, prompting the World Health Organization to declare a global health emergency.
The Fed vice chair repeated the U.S. economy is in “a good place” and played down the implications of a renewed inversion in a key portion of the yield curve.
“That is really driven not so much by an outlook for the U.S. economy, but globally when there is uncertainty money flows into the U.S.,” he said. “That tends to lower yields.”
A yield-curve inversion occurs when returns on shorter-dated Treasury securities exceed those on longer-dated bonds.
“I’m not today concerned about the inverted yield curve because I think it’s not really reflecting the U.S. outlook,” he added.
Clarida also said the Fed is continues to expect that current policy will raise inflation, which has undershot the central bank’s 2% target for most of the past seven years, gradually up to that goal.
“We’re not that far away now,” he said. “We provided some accommodation in 2019 with a total of three rate cuts, and we think with those rate cuts in place, it takes time for them to work through the economy, we do think and we project that we will get back up to 2%.”

Below are charts of other assets reacting most to the risk-off mood.

The Baltic Exchange Capsize Index, a gauge of freight rates for dry-bulk cargoes, is down 99.95% this month as the virus accentuates a seasonally slow period. That’s not to say rates are near zero. Rather it measures demand for shipping versus availability of ships and is now showing a huge imbalance.
Companies that ship via the air aren’t doing much better, with Air Freight & Logistics the worst-performing sub-industry in the S&P 500 this week.
While the World Health Organization stopped short of recommending a ban on travel and tourism, passenger airlines received only a brief respite. Many have since taken measures into their own hands, with Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) on Friday announcing a suspension of all U.S.-China flights from Feb. 6 through April 30. Other airlines previously announced plans to reduce service.
With China’s economy virtually shut down, and only about one-third of it likely to come online Monday, demand for commodities from the world’s biggest user is dropping precipitously. Copper futures have fared worst among the most-liquid commodities, with the metal on a record 13-day losing streak, half of which predates virus fears.
Shares of mining giant Freeport-McMoRan Inc. have similarly swooned. Stress in the commodity complex is also evident in junk energy bonds, with spreads widening more than 100 basis points since mid-January.
U.S. Treasury bonds are in high demand amid the market tumult, with both real rates and breakevens contributing meaningfully to the more than 35 basis-point monthly decline in the 10-year rate. The 30-year slumped below 2% for the first time since October, and the yield on December 2020 Eurodollar futures (a proxy for the amount of tightening or easing traders expect from the Federal Reserve), implies nearly a full 25 basis point cut has been priced in relative to the start of 2020.
The Brazilian real weakened to a record low of 4.2779 per dollar Friday as traders dumped emerging-market assets amid growth fears. Economists expect the central bank to deliver a 25 basis point cut next week.
The Chilean peso is also tumbling, approaching levels that prompted central bank intervention in November. Roughly one-third of Chile’s exports go to China.
U.S. stocks sank Friday, but selling has been much worse the closer you get to China. Though markets are closed there for the Lunar New Year holiday (and the virus), Chinese equity futures traded on the Singapore Exchange are down over 8% this week. Asian and emerging-market indexes are trailing the S&P 500 by a substantial margin.
Segments within the equity market coming under acute stress include casino operators with exposure to Macau, luxury goods sellers, and cruise liners.

""Roku's tactics are a poorly timed negotiating ploy, fabricating a crisis with no thought for the alarm it generated among its own customers,"" Fox said in a statement sent to Reuters.
Roku did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Carriage disputes between networks and cable providers in the past have led to viewers losing the ability to watch channels. Last July, millions of DirecTV subscribers temporarily lost access to CBS programming in over a dozen cities.
While viewership has declined in recent years, the Super Bowl remains the single most watched U.S. event of the year, making it a potentially high-value pawn in contract negotiations.
Riding a wave of investor enthusiasm over the consumer shift from cable television to streaming, Roku's stock has surged almost 800% since its initial public offering in 2017. Friday's sell-off reduces Roku's 12-month return to 172% and leaves it at a level last seen in November."

Investing.com –   World Wrestling Entertainment   (NYSE:WWE) sank like a rock Friday after two top executives were forced to tag out and it issued cautious guidance.
Shares of WWE were down 22% in afternoon trading.
The sports entertainment heavyweight said postmarket Thursday that Co-Presidents George Barrios and Michelle Wilson will be leaving, with board member Frank A. Riddick III taking the role of interim chief financial officer.
“I would like to thank George and Michelle for their 10+ years of service and contributions to the organization,” Chairman and CEO Vince McMahon said in a statement. “I am grateful for all that was accomplished during their tenure, but the Board and I decided a change was necessary as we have different views on how best to achieve our strategic priorities moving forward.”
The company will commence a search for a permanent CFO and chief revenue officer.
WWE also said it sees operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBDA) of $180 million for 2019, down from previous guidance of $190 million. It will report earnings next week.
Wall Street’s sell side dove in from the top rope to downgrade this morning.

Investing.com – A sea of red washed over stocks Friday as the spread of the coronavirus continued to drum up fears about slowing global growth, while a slump in oil major   Exxon Mobil   (NYSE:XOM) exacerbated selling in energy.
The S&P 500 fell 1.44% and the Nasdaq Composite slumped 1.15%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 1.73%, or 499 points.
Nearly 10,000 cases of the coronavirus have been confirmed worldwide and the death toll in China rose to 213, threatening to slow growth even more in China, which many fear will spill over into the global economy.
Mizuho Securities estimates that a prolonged spread of the virus threatens to knock full-year growth in China by 0.3% to 5.6%.
Several countries have tightened travel restrictions including the U.K. and the U.S, exacerbating investor concerns about the impact slowing air travel will have airline stocks. 
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) fell more than 3%, with Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) down more than 2%.
Energy, already under pressure from falling oil prices, led the decline in the broader market pressured by a slump in Exxon (NYSE:XOM).
Exxon (NYSE:XOM) fell about 4% after the oil major missed quarterly estimates, which it blamed on short-term supply issues in its refining business.
Industrials also played a role in the broader sell off, paced by declines in   Caterpillar   (NYSE:CAT) and Honeywell (NYSE:HON) on weak quarterly results and guidance. 
Caterpillar fell nearly 3% after reporting mixed quarterly results and offering up a weaker-than-expected outlook on full-year performance, warning that global economic uncertainty would continue to weigh performance.
Honeywell dropped more than 3% as its quarterly revenue missed Wall Street estimates, with the industrial pinning the blame on impact from the grounding of Boeing's 737 Max.
Consumer discretionary proved an exception to the rout on Wall Street thanks to a pop in shares of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) after the e-commerce giant smashed earnings expectations. Shares rose nearly 9%, but were off earlier highs."

Long Into the Weekend? With China Open Looming, Investors Say No
Investors in China will get their first chance to trade since Jan. 23 on Monday, when financial markets reopen. For equities, the declines are likely to be exacerbated by the amount of leverage in the market. That could create a downward spiral where steep losses become steeper as traders face margin calls. As an example of how extreme selling can be, the Shanghai equity benchmark fell almost 6% in May, when it resumed trading following a holiday break on negative trade-war news. With all the angst over the viral outbreak this week, the offshore yuan tumbled past the key level of 7.
The final week of January has been tumultuous across global markets, as a barrage of corporate earnings, central-bank decisions and economic data landed in the growing shadow of the deadly epidemic. The outbreak will cut U.S. economic growth by 0.4 percentage point in the first quarter as the number of tourists from China plunges and exports to the Asian nation slow, according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). Still, a report showed that American consumer sentiment increased in January to an eight-month high, indicating sustained optimism in the face of the coronavirus.
Global stocks headed toward their worst week and month since August, with the S&P 500 trimming its January advance to less than 0.5%. Alongside tech, defensive companies such as utilities and real estate have driven gains in the U.S. benchmark. Energy and material shares have underperformed.
“The virus outbreak represents this unknown that, frankly, markets aren’t very good at handicapping,” said David Lafferty, chief market strategist at Natixis Investment Managers in Boston. “It’s almost like an open-ended risk.”

988,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2020 12:03PM ET</span>","Exclusive: BMW delays next generation Mini due to Brexit uncertainty, costs","By Edward Taylor
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - BMW (DE:BMWG) has delayed the development of its next generation Mini as it seeks to cut costs and as uncertainty over Britain's trade relations with the European Union make long-term investment decisions harder.
The German carmaker has developed three generations of the Mini since buying the marque from Rover Group in 1994, keeping each vehicle in the market for about six years. 
The current Mini hatch model, which has been on the market since 2014, is built on the company's technological platform called UKL1.
""The lifespan of this platform has been extended,"" BMW spokesman Maximilian Schoeberl told Reuters. ""For cost reasons and because of Brexit.""
Pressure has risen on carmakers to free up resources so they can shoulder hefty investments to build next generation low emission electric, hybrid and connected vehicles. 
The combustion-engined city car has suffered as customers migrated toward larger sports utility vehicles and as tightening emissions rules force carmakers to include costly modifications to exhaust systems. 
Anti-pollution rules and cost pressure have already forced Opel and Vauxhall to drop the Adam and Karl models from sale. Mini's sales fell 4.1% last year to 346,639 cars and showed an 18% drop in registrations in December.
In March BMW said it would seek 12 billion euros ($13.3 billion) in cost savings and efficiency gains by the end of 2022. To reach its goal BMW is cutting the number of available engine and gearbox combinations by 50% and slashing vehicle development costs. 
New vehicle platforms cost around 1 billion euros in research and development costs and are used for around six years, Juergen Pieper, an auto analyst at Metzler told Reuters.
It is for this reason that several carmakers have sought to carry over as many common components into next generation vehicles. Volkswagen's Golf 7 and 8 models share common underpinnings.
BREXIT UNCERTAINTY
The Mini is currently built in Oxford and in Born, the Netherlands, and any next generation car would require investments into the production lines of both factories. 
BMW will not make large scale investments until there is greater certainty over the outcome of negotiations between Britain and the European Union over a trade deal.
“If tariffs are in the range of zero and 5 percent, the business case would not dramatically change,” BMW Chief Executive Oliver Zipse said last year, referring to Oxford’s status as a production and export hub for the Mini.
But higher tariffs on exports to and from Britain may force BMW to consider shifting more production to the Netherlands.
BMW produced 211,660 cars in the Netherlands in 2018, a 39 percent increase from 2017. BMW uses contract manufacturer VDL Nedcar to build the BMW X1, the Mini hatch, Mini convertible and Mini countryman models at its Dutch plant.
BMW's plant in Oxford made 234,501 Minis in 2018.

PARIS/LONDON (Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR) bribed public officials and hid the payments as part of a pattern of corruption that led to a record $4 billion bribery settlement with France, Britain and the United States, French prosecutors said on Friday. 
The disclosure kicked off a day of transatlantic hearings to formally approve the settlements, lifting a legal cloud that has hung over Europe's largest aerospace group for years. It follows a nearly four-year investigation spanning sales to more than a dozen overseas markets.
Announcing the agreement - effectively a corporate plea bargain - France's financial prosecutor said the company had also agreed to three years ""light compliance monitoring"" by the country's anti-corruption agency. 
The simultaneous settlements in Britain, France and the United States mean the European planemaker has avoided criminal prosecution.
""In reaching this agreement today, we are helping Airbus to turn the page definitively"" on corrupt past practices, French prosecutor Jean-Francois Bohnert said, adding that the group could now ""now look to its economic future with serenity"".
As part of the deal, Airbus reached an agreement to settle corruption charges with France for 2.08 billion euros, France's financial prosecutor, Parquet National Financier (PNF), told a crowded hearing at the modern courthouse in northern Paris.
The planemaker would also pay around a 525 million euros fine to U.S. Department of Justice and roughly 984 million euros to Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO), it said.
""It was a pervasive and pernicious bribery scheme in various divisions of Airbus SE that went on for a number of years,"" said U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan, approving the deal in a Washington court. 
The U.S. State Department said it had also fined Airbus $10 million to settle separate violations of export controls.
DRAWING A LINE
Airbus has been investigated by French and British authorities for suspected corruption over jet sales dating back more than a decade. It has also faced U.S. investigations over suspected violations of export controls.
In a London court hearing, an Airbus lawyer said the settlements ""draw a clear line under the investigation and under the grave historic practices"". 
In calculating the final amount, the French court reduced the public fines by half to reflect Airbus’s ""exemplary cooperation"" with the investigation, prosecutors said.
Aggravating factors included the ""corruption of public officials,"" the repetition of breaches over a sustained period and the use of company resources to hide payments, they added.
The investigation examined transactions involving the United Arab Emirates, China, South Korea, Nepal, India, Taiwan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, Japan, Turkey, Mexico, Brazil, Thailand, Kuwait and Colombia, French prosecutors.
British prosecutors said Airbus failed to prevent individuals associated with the company from bribery involving Malaysia's AirAsia and AirAsia X (KL:AIRX), SriLankan Airlines, Taiwan's TransAsia Airways, Garuda Indonesia (JK:GIAA) and Citilink Indonesia. They said the case also involved the sale of military aircraft to Ghana.
The overall deal, believed by anti-corruption experts to be the largest ever in a bribery case, ends an almost four-year crisis that led to a sweeping management overhaul, hampered sales and delayed plans to redeploy the firm's cash surplus.
While the size of the penalty is larger than some analysts expected, criminal charges would have risked the company being barred from public contracts in the United States and European Union - a massive blow for a major defence and space supplier.
INDIVIDUALS 'STILL ANSWERABLE'
French and U.S. prosecutors said the deal covered Airbus only as a corporate entity and any current or former employees involved in related crimes could still be open to potential prosecution.
""With this settlement we've completed a first phase,"" French prosecutor Bohnert told reporters after the hearing. ""Individuals remain answerable, and we are now going to have to examine individual responsibilities.""
Britain's SFO last year abandoned attempts to prosecute individuals following what was then a record bribery settlement with engine maker Rolls-Royce (L:RR) in 2017.
At the centre of the case was a decades-old system of third-party sales agents run from a now-disbanded headquarters unit which at its height involved some 250 people and several hundreds of millions of euros of payments a year, sources familiar with the matter have said.
Airbus has said it halted payments in 2014 after discovering misleading and incomplete statements on the use of agents to Britain's' export credit agency and later took its findings to UK authorities, triggering a massive internal and external probe.
The probe has triggered an internal row over responsibility for lapses of control, with Airbus employees insisting they had no control over the choice of agents or offset deals handled under a separate entity, EADS, the former Airbus parent company.
Others say the system, whose roots go back decades to an era when payments to win deals were tolerated and tax-deductible, was an open secret in the company and French political circles where it was intertwined with influence-building abroad.

993,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2020 11:22AM ET</span>",Burger King says it never promised Impossible Whoppers were vegan,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Burger King, saying it never billed its ""Impossible Whoppers"" as vegan or promised to cook them a particular way, said a proposed class action by a vegan customer over the plant-based patties being cooked on the same grills as meat burgers should be thrown out.
In a court filing on Thursday, Burger King said plaintiff Phillip Williams (NYSE:WMB) should have asked how Impossible Whoppers were cooked before ordering one that he said was ""coated in meat by-products"" at an Atlanta drive-through.
Burger King said reasonable customers would ask about its cooking methods, and Williams would have known he could request an alternative method had he done even ""the smallest amount of investigation"" on its website or by reading media reports.
Williams ""assumed that an Impossible Whopper would satisfy his own particularly strict form of veganism... solely because he asked a Burger King restaurant employee to 'hold the mayo,'"" Burger King said. ""This claim has no basis.""
Lawyers for Williams did not immediately respond on Friday to requests for comment.
Williams claimed in his Nov. 18 lawsuit in Miami federal court that Burger King ""duped"" him into buying the Impossible Whopper at a premium price and is seeking damages on behalf of all U.S. consumers who bought it.
Burger King is a unit of Toronto-based Restaurant Brands International Inc (TO:QSR), which also owns the Canadian coffee and restaurant chain Tim Hortons and is overseen by Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital.
Impossible Foods Inc, which helped create the Impossible Whopper, has said it was designed for meat eaters who want to consume less animal protein, not for vegans or vegetarians.

(Reuters) - As  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGn) tries to settle U.S. lawsuits claiming that its weedkiller Roundup causes cancer, the company is considering a proposal that would bar plaintiffs' lawyers involved in the litigation from advertising for new clients, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Bayer has said it is engaged in mediation to resolve the litigation, which has hit its share price since it acquired Roundup as part of its $63 billion takeover of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) in 2018.
The company has denied claims that Roundup or its active ingredient glyphosate causes cancer, saying decades of independent studies have shown the product is safe for human use.
The person said that Bayer believes an agreement with plaintiffs' attorneys to ban advertising would limit the company's future legal exposure since the ""vast majority"" of U.S. law firms that would bring such claims would be bound by the agreement.
Bayer declined to comment. 
German newspaper Handelsblatt reported on Thursday that Bayer was considering stopping retail sales of glyphosate while continuing to serve farmers, because the bulk of plaintiffs are private users. Bayer did not comment to Reuters on this report.
The company has ruled out putting a cancer warning on the weedkiller because market regulators such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency have deemed it save to use, but that means lawsuits could keeping piling in.
In October, Bayer largely blamed law firms' TV ad campaigns for the more than doubling of U.S. plaintiffs seeking damages to 42,700 within just three months. 
A provision such as the one the company is considering could result in ""dramatically fewer claims"" so that the litigation is no longer a ""big drag on Bayer's balance sheet,"" said David Noll, a professor at Rutgers Law School and expert in mass torts, who is not involved in the litigation. 
In January, court-appointed mediator Ken Feinberg put the number of Roundup cancer claimants at more than 75,000, which includes those that have not been filed. Bayer said the claims it has been served with in court were below 50,000.
While such a provision is unusual, there is precedent.
As part of a 2013 settlement between Merck & Co and plaintiffs claiming the company's Fosamax osteoporosis drug caused jaw injury, lawyers pledged that they did not intend to ""solicit claims"" that arose after the settlement.
Perry Weitz of Weitz & Luxenberg, one of the leading plaintiffs' firms involved in the Roundup litigation, criticized an idea to bar firms from advertising for future clients.
""A company cannot ask a lawyer to enter an agreement to restrict his practice in the future,"" he said.
He said there had not been ""serious discussions about future cases,"" but declined to elaborate.
Michael Miller of The Miller Firm, another major party in the talks, said that ""it is possible, if done correctly, to manage the exposure to future claims."" He declined to elaborate. Three other plaintiffs firms who have brought the bulk of the claims - Baum Hedlund Aristei & Goldman; Andrus Wagstaff PC; Holland Law Firm - declined to comment. Moore Law Group PLLC did not respond to requests for comment. 

Bayer’s shares have lost about 20% of their value since August 2018 when a California jury in the first lawsuit over Roundup found Monsanto should have warned of the alleged cancer risks. Bayer has lost two more jury verdicts and is appealing all three rulings.

(Reuters) -  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGn) is in mediation to potentially settle thousands of U.S. lawsuits claiming that the company's Roundup weed killer causes cancer, but some legal experts said the cases raises novel questions that may prevent an easy settlement.
More than 42,700 plaintiffs claim Roundup causes a type of cancer called non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Bayer to date has lost three U.S. jury trials in the Roundup litigation. The company is appealing or has vowed to appeal the decisions, saying Roundup and its active ingredient glyphosate are not carcinogenic and safe for human use.
Legal experts outlined several obstacles the parties may face on the path towards settlement.
WHY IS THE ROUNDUP LITIGATION DIFFERENT FROM OTHER PRODUCT CASES?
Settlements involving drugs, medical devices or consumer goods often result in the addition of a warning label, a recall or the outright discontinuance of a product. Those steps generally close the door to future lawsuits, making settlement costs and risks predictable.
Bayer has never publicly considered pulling Roundup off the market. The company in June announced a $5.6 billion investment to research and develop a glyphosate alternative.
Bayer unit  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) began selling Roundup in 1974 and while the formulation is no longer patent-protected, Roundup remains widely available today. Bayer has repeatedly said Roundup is safe and important to farmers who use the herbicide in combination with the company's genetically modified seeds
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma on average can take up to 10 years to emerge, increasing the likelihood of claims being filed after the litigation has settled. Product liability settlements generally include a cut-off date for future claimants and need to be properly funded for a court to approve the agreement.
As long as the product continues to be sold without changes to the label, plaintiffs may continue to file lawsuits, said Elizabeth Burch, a law professor at the University of Georgia.
COULD BAYER ADD A CANCER WARNING?
Plaintiffs lawyers, who claim the company manipulated the science, told Reuters they would insist on a cancer warning label as part of any Roundup settlement.
Such a warning has been rejected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which regulates pesticides and repeatedly has found glyphosate to be safe.
The agency said it has finished a regulatory review that found glyphosate is not a carcinogen.
In a filing to a federal appeals court, which hears one of the appeals to a jury verdict, the EPA and the U.S. Justice Department backed Bayer and said it was unlawful for manufacturers to make label claims that differ from EPA approval.
David Noll, a professor at Rutgers Law School, said adding a cancer warning over a regulator's explicit opposition presented unchartered legal territory.
HOW COULD BAYER SETTLE THE ROUNDUP LITIGATION?
To settle product liability litigation, companies generally set up a fund and the parties define criteria that current and future claimants must fulfill to receive compensation.
In the Roundup litigation, claimants could be divided into different groups depending on the frequency of their Roundup use and disease severity and length.
But Adam Zimmerman, a law professor at Loyola Law School, said defining those groups is complicated by the lack of a signature disease associated with Roundup, making it difficult to predict Bayer's liability.
For example, in asbestos litigation, mesothelioma, a rare tissue cancer, was recognized as a signature disease caused by exposure to asbestos fibers.
Doctors recognize several risk factors leading to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, but the disease is largely considered to have no known cause. Around 74,000 people in the United States are expected to be diagnosed with the disease in 2019, according to the American Cancer Society.
Settling claims might not preclude future lawsuits if the fund runs out of money. In the Agent Orange litigation, Vietnam War veterans were allowed to sue chemical companies decades after a settlement was reached because the compensation fund was depleted by the time they developed their diseases."

LONDON (Reuters) - Canadian billionaire Lawrence Stroll and investors have rescued Aston Martin with a 500 million pound cash injection that analysts say will help stabilize the British carmaker whose first sport utility vehicle (SUV) is set to hit the road.
Stroll agreed to buy up to 20% of the 107-year-old company and will become executive chairman of James Bond's automaker of choice, which has gone bankrupt seven times in its chequered history.
A consortium led by Stroll will invest 182 million pounds ($239 million), whilst major existing shareholders - primarily Italian and Kuwaiti private equity groups - will be part of a rights issue to raise 318 million pounds. 
""It likely gives them enough liquidity to tide them over for a couple of years,"" said Charles Coldicott, Redburn equity research analyst.
Outgoing chairwoman Penny Hughes, who will be replaced by Stroll, spelt out the degree of trouble the firm has been in after core sales fell last year. 
""The difficult trading performance in 2019 resulted in severe pressure on liquidity which has left the company with no alternative but to seek substantial additional equity financing,"" she said. 
""Without this the balance sheet is not robust enough to support the operations of the group."" 
Now Aston will need to turn the financial lifeline into part of a sustainable plan as it delays investment in electric vehicles and cuts its operating costs. 
A key future milestone includes around 1 billion pounds worth of debt due to mature in 2022.
The company also suffers from lower gross margins than rival Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), according to analysts at Jefferies, who have said scaling up is just as important as extra capital.
Key to the company's success is its first foray into the lucrative SUV market, a late entrant compared to many rivals such as Volkswagen-owned Bentley and BMW's Rolls-Royce (LON:RR). 
Aston has built a new factory in Wales to make the model, known as the DBX, which it hopes will attract more women to the brand and some buyers to purchase both it and a vehicle from its traditional line-up. 
With the DBX model not due to roll off the production line until the second quarter of this year, the firm has taken the cost with only some of the benefit so far. 
Based in central England, Aston said earlier this month that it already had around 1,800 orders for the car which will retail for 158,000 pounds in Britain, a ""materially better"" rate than for any previous models.
""When we were looking at the amount of money needed, we were thinking about deleveraging, creating the liquidity buffer that was missing and also be able to continue investing in some longer-term critical products including the mid-engine platform,"" said Philippe Houchois, equity analyst at Jefferies.
""All that works as long as DBX is successful so they have to deliver that,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Tech and internet titans were the first to reach $1 trillion in stock market value, but the next U.S. companies that could do so are better known for their plastic. Soaring stock prices are propelling credit and debit card companies  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V) and Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) up the market value charts, where they currently rank 7th and 11th among companies in the benchmark S&P 500 index. The stock prices of both Visa and Mastercard have gained roughly 50% in the past year. While the stocks may not keep up that torrid pace, Visa and Mastercard would each be worth over $1 trillion by 2023 if their average annual gains of the past three years were to continue, surging past the likes of  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc, if they also maintain their recent pace.
Fueling their rise is a shift toward cashless financial transactions spurred by a rise in online shopping.
""Everything travels on their rails,"" said Sandy Villere, portfolio manager of the Villere Balanced Fund, which holds Visa shares. ""They literally sit in the middle of the banks, consumers and merchants and that has been a really enviable place to be.""
Visa had a market value of $449 billion and Mastercard's stood at about $324 billion as of Thursday's close. The $1 trillion club currently includes Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).com's market value jumped back above $1 trillion on Friday morning as the stock soared on the heels of its earnings report on Thursday. 
(GRAPHIC: Top U.S. market cap companies - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/USA-STOCKS/0H001R88DBP0/eikon.png)
Revenue for both Visa and Mastercard nearly doubled over their past five fiscal years, to nearly $23 billion for Visa, and about $17 billion for Mastercard, according to Refinitiv data. Adjusted earnings per share more than doubled for both companies over that period.
Visa reported quarterly revenue late on Thursday that slightly missed analyst estimates, a day after Mastercard beat quarterly profit estimates. About 43% of consumer purchases around the world excluding China are made using a digital form of payment, up from 28% in 2010, according to Lisa Ellis, senior analyst at MoffettNathanson. “Globally, we still have five to 10 years, at least, to go of penetration,” Ellis said. Visa holds a 60% share of the credit and debit card market, followed by Mastercard with 30%, according to Ellis, with  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) far behind at 8.5%. Despite their importance in finance, Visa and Mastercard are categorized as part of the S&P 500's information technology sector. While Apple, Microsoft and chip companies such as  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) often garner the lion's share of attention, Visa and Mastercard have been key contributors to the rally in technology shares. Their valuations have expanded to their most expensive in at least a decade. Visa trades at nearly 32 times forward 12 months' earnings estimates, while Mastercard trades at 35 times, according to Refinitiv Datastream. Both stocks are trading at a higher premium to the market than they have on average over the past five years.
(Graphic: Top U.S. market cap companies - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/USA-STOCKS/0H001R88DBP0/eikon.png) 
The big run for Visa and Mastercard shares has also come during an more than 10-year U.S. bull market, and gains could be more muted in any downturn. Stocks started 2020 strong but have pulled back amid concerns over the spread of a virus from China.
Risks to the companies, Ellis said, include greater competition in the payment sector from big tech companies, as well as tougher regulations from governments around the world that might hinder access.
The companies are not sitting still. Earlier this month, Visa agreed to buy privately held Plaid Inc in a $5.3 billion deal to boost access to financial technology, and in August Mastercard agreed to buy a majority of the corporate services businesses of Scandinavian payments group Nets for about $3.19 billion.

Investing.com -- Wall Street took another pummelling at the open on Friday as markets faced up to the prospect of a sharp dip in the Chinese economy due to the coronavirus – one that is likely to be felt around the world in the form of lower commodity demand and disrupted supply chains.
While the figures so far suggest that the disease will be less lethal than the SARS epidemic in 2003, total confirmed cases already top those of SARS, while China’s countermeasures – which include the extension of New Year holidays by another week for over two-thirds of the country’s factories – are sure to be felt across the globe, given that China’s share of the world economy has more than quadrupled since SARS.
By 10:24 AM ET (1524 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 280 points or 1.0%, while the S&P 500 was down 0.7% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.5%.
The Dow was on course for a weekly loss of some 1.3%, after disappointing earnings from the country’s two biggest oil and gas companies that hinted again at weakness in the broader economy.
  Exxon Mobil   (NYSE:XOM) stock fell 3.2% and   Chevron   (NYSE:CVX) fell 3.3%, after the former announced earnings that suffered from falling margins for refined products and chemicals. 
Chevron, meanwhile, became the second major in as many days to make big writedowns on projects that have been made uneconomic. The $10.4 billion in writedowns made the company swing to a big loss in the quarter, albeit not as big as some had feared.
U.S. crude futures fell another 0.6% to $51.92 a barrel on the prospect of ever-greater demand destruction as more airlines canceled flights to China and the broader outlook for the transport sector darkened.
The broad weakness in the market overshadowed a 9.4% surge by Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) – the biggest intraday rise in market cap in history according to Bloomberg – after it detailed the handsome payoff over the holiday period from investments into one-day delivery that had burdened the previous quarter’s earnings.
Elsewhere,   IBM   (NYSE:IBM) stock rose 4.6% after company said late on Thursday that long-serving CEO Ginni Rometty will step down, having finally broken a five-year streak of falling revenue in the last quarter of 2019.
The biggest gainer of note, however, was truckmaker Navistar, which rose 54% after Volkswagen’s truck unit Traton – which was spun off last year – offered $2.9 billion for the company.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.1% despite the general surge in risk aversion, while copper futures fell to their lowest in over three years at $2.51 a pound."

HOUSTON (Reuters) -  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) swung to a large fourth-quarter loss on weaker oil and gas prices and $10.4 billion in charges as it stepped up efforts to cull unprofitable assets, and shares of the No. 2 U.S. oil producer tumbled 3% in early trading. 
In December, Chevron warned it could take up to $11 billion in writedowns on properties that were no longer economical: Appalachian shale gas properties, a proposed Canadian liquefied natural gas project and a U.S. offshore field.
With oil prices weak, major oil companies including Chevron and  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM), have sought to raise cash and improve returns by putting properties on the market. 
Chevron shares were off 3% at $107.57 in early trading.
Its production rose in the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field, but results were hurt by sharply lower prices for its sales of oil and gas. Average prices for Chevron's oil fell 16% from a year earlier, and natural gas prices fell by nearly half. 
Excluding one-time items, per share profit was $1.49, slightly above Wall Street's estimate of $1.45. 
Analysts said weaker prices and margins hurt Chevron's cash flow from operations. It fell more than $1 billion from a year ago, to $5.3 billion. 
Still, the company generated enough cash for the full year to cover its capital spending and dividends.
""We expect robust cash returns to shareholders to continue,"" said Edward Jones analyst Jennifer Rowland in a note on Friday.
Chevron's quarterly loss including charges was $6.61 billion, or $3.51 per share, compared with a profit of $3.73 billion, or $1.95 per share, a year earlier. 
Results included a gain of $1.2 billion in the quarter on the sale of U.K. North Sea assets.
Chevron's net oil equivalent production was flat at 3.08 million barrels per day in the quarter as gains in its U.S. shale were offset by lower output elsewhere.
Its production in the Permian Basin rose 36% from the year ago quarter, to 514,000 barrels per day. 
Charges for shale and other write downs pushed operating profit in its U.S. oil and gas operations to a $7.4 billion loss, compared with a $964 million profit a year ago. Outside the U.S., production profits fell to $731 million from $2.3 billion a year ago. 

In refining and chemicals, the company posted a $672 million profit for the quarter, down from $859 million a year ago.

In a note titled ""Not-so-subtle Reminder Amazon is Still King"", Benchmark analysts said Amazon reminded the world of its ""size and capacity advantage,"" and raised his price target by $150 to $2,400.
Net sales jumped 21% to $87.4 billion, with sales from AWS - the business responsible for selling data storage and computing power in the cloud - growing 34%. Revenue from subscription fees surged 32% as more shoppers signed up for Prime services.
""Amazon is easily less than half-way through transforming retail by exploiting deep fulfillment moats established over many years,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Graham said.
J.P.Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth raised his price target on the stock to $2,525 from $2,200, and said Amazon remains one of the brokerage's top picks in its U.S. focus list.
""Overall, in our view Amazon's ability to re-accelerate revenue growth at such a large scale is evidence that its (Prime One Day) investments are paying off,"" Anmuth said.
""We're increasingly optimistic Amazon will continue to execute throughout 2020 on both the top and bottom line.""
Amazon has been in and around the $1 trillion club for a while now, accompanied by the other tech giants like Apple Inc (O:AAPL), Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) and  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT).
Investors and analysts are touting  Visa Inc  (N:V) and Mastercard Inc (N:MA) as the next companies in line to move in to the elite list.
At a time when Amazon has been trying to improve its delivery timings through in-house initiatives, the company's fortunes could be intertwined with that of its delivery partner  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS), which earns more than one-tenth of its revenue through its partnership with the Washington-based company.

LONDON (Reuters) - The coronavirus scare has wiped $1.2 trillion from global stock markets in the last two weeks as new cases of the deadly virus multiplied, stoking fears of an economic slowdown spreading from its Chinese epicenter to the rest of the world.
With the death toll rising to 213 despite travel restrictions, the impact was most evident in European equity markets in shares of companies which pocket the bulk of their revenues from China, the world's fastest-growing consumer market.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) is poised for its biggest weekly loss in four months, while among individual stocks Germany's Infineon (DE:IFXGn), which gets two-thirds of its revenue from China, has fallen 10% despite strong quarterly results from Apple (O:AAPL), its biggest customer.
The Goldman Sachs' ""China exposure"" basket of European stocks has slumped 5% this week alone.
Elsewhere Electrolux (ST:ELUXb) shares dropped on Friday after the group warned the outbreak would hit its sourcing of products and components from China. Supply chains are seen as among the key issues arising from the virus, with companies as diverse as Apple, Starbucks (O:SBUX) and Autoliv (N:ALV) warning of potential disruption.
Major names in travel, luxury and retail globally have also been hit as hundreds of millions of people who were preparing to travel for the Chinese holidays canceled their plans.
 Royal Caribbean  Cruises (N:RCL) shares for instance have lost 12% of their value since Jan. 17 and the company has warned that its 2020 earnings would be impacted by cancellations.
Yet the virus - which Chinese President Xi Jinping has described as a ""devil"" - has had a bigger impact on European companies than their U.S. peers due to their high exposure to China. 
Analysts have drawn comparisons with the deadly SARS outbreak in 2002-2003, but the read-across is limited as China's share of global gross domestic product has quadrupled since then to 16%.

LONDON (Reuters) - Widely blamed for volatile ""flash crashes"" in currencies and equities, high-frequency algorithms may also be why shock global events, including the current coronavirus, seem to have lost their power to spook markets for any length of time.
Whether stocks, bonds, currencies or commodities, asset prices seem less prone to any selloff for very long; the U.S. killing of an Iranian general and Iran's retaliatory missile attack are among potential catastrophes that triggered violent but surprisingly shortlived reactions just since the start of 2020.
In both cases, knee-jerk yen-buying and selling of equities faded within hours, allowing stocks to scale new record peaks.
Now even as China's coronavirus threatens to throttle economic growth, global stocks are not far off all-time highs.
Certainly, many factors are shaping the resilience, not least central bank money printing and rising global savings which boosted the value of world stocks by $25 trillion in the past decade.
Yet it is hard not to link the shift in reaction by financial markets to the rise of automated trading strategies. In the past six years, the share of algo-trading in the $6.6 trillion-a-day FX market has more than doubled to 27% among fund managers, a survey by Greenwich Associates found.
There is some reason to believe algos cause volatility, especially when trading thins and the humans overseeing them vanish, for instance during public holidays. That's what likely happened during the Wall Street flash crash of 2010 and dramatic but fleeting yen moves in Jan 2019.
But they also offer the advantage of being able to transact at lightening speed at any hour of the day or night, with razor-sharp accuracy and lower overall costs. Being machines, they are also alien to the common human impulses of fear and greed that tend to take over.
Algorithmic trading is dispassionate, said Scott Wacker, global head of fixed income, currency and commodity e-sales at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), one bank at the forefront of the algo revolution.
""As a result, the reaction function in currency markets to even major geopolitical news has considerably shortened which enables stability to return more quickly.""
In short, when left-field events hit, not only can algos scan and react swiftly to newsfeed, many now can gauge the potential asset price impact. The most sophisticated can be ""trained"" to learn from the experience before the next shock.
One currency trader familiar with algo use said a machine reading coronavirus cases would typically buy stocks if informed of ""500 new cases, 10 deaths"". ""If it's '3000 new cases, 200 deaths' they might sell. 
""The point being that as soon as a headline is out, the machine-led market is trading on it,"" the trader said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
But the machines had 'vol triggers', he said, meaning they can stop trading when the market moves beyond specified limits.

HOW IT WORKS
Simple first- and second-generation programmes merely broke down large buy/sell orders into chunks to minimise market impact. Now algos can be hooked up to sophisticated language processing technology, to ""read and analyse"" news feeds, then react accordingly, all in the space of seconds, said Antony Foster, head of G10 FX trading at Nomura.
However this can ""lead to overreaction in the first instance"", Foster warned.
The impact in fast-moving markets can be outsized if the models rapidly push prices towards existing buy/sell order levels, trip them and trigger other orders.
That's what happened when news broke of Iran's Jan. 8 attack, according to a quant fund manager, who said algos had bought yen with the aim of triggering larger buy orders once a key option barrier was tripped.
A plausible comparison may be the 0.6% plunge in the S&P 500 within the space of half an hour on Jan. 29. The move came after American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Lufthansa said they were suspending their China flights, but an hour later, the losses had been recouped.

Stephane Malrait, ING Bank's head of market structure and innovation, says in such instances algos are programmed to check if moves are in line with price trends.
If the swings are in response to the an incident, human traders can step in to smooth out the trade, Malrait added.
Next, the algos may gauge the seriousness of the incident based on patterns of investor behaviour and economic consequences that followed previous such episodes.
After the Iran missile attacks, the message from the specialised data-crunchers to the algos was: stand down.
One was Geoquant, a U.S. firm which monitors geopolitical events and models the asset price impact.
""We modelled our Iranian geopolitical indicator back to seven years... and put the current tensions against that backdrop,"" said Geoquant CEO Mark Rosenberg, who concluded the risk would subside, with minimal oil price impact.
Another firm, Predata, applied its machine-reading algorithm to last September's attacks on Saudi oil facilities, which had raised fears of a regional war.
To predict what might happen next, the programme compares interested parties' online attention to a subject, with the media coverage it receives, Predata CEO Hazem Dawani said. The Saudi event elicited little reaction from military officials and policymakers.
""The amount of news was far more than the amount of attention being devoted on the particular subject by investors, politicians, companies directly impacted by them,"" Dawani said.
He concluded - rightly - that there would be no escalation.
VIRUS UNKNOWNS
Executives at half a dozen firms providing risk analysis for algo strategies told Reuters their services were increasingly in demand, but declined to give figures.
But they acknowledged limitations.
Reactions to the coronavirus for instance could be hobbled because the only meaningful precedent is the 2003 SARS epidemic which also coincided with the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Second, the pathogen and its dangers are relatively unknown.
Rosenberg said Geoquant's China Health Risk index was at record highs. That has pushed up the firm's Social Instability Risk index for China, pressuring Chinese markets.
However, he said this correlation breaks down beyond short periods.
""The longer-term relationship between Chinese Health Risk and equities, Chinese or global, is basically zero,"" he said.

1006,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2020 09:50AM ET</span>","Exxon quarterly profit falls 5.2% on weak refining, chemical margins","By Jennifer Hiller
HOUSTON (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) on Friday reported a 5.2% drop in fourth-quarter profit on weakness in its refining and chemicals business and flat year-on-year oil and gas output, with asset sales helping to stem the decline.
Oil companies last quarter suffered from weaker prices for their products, and in Exxon's case it has been spending heavily to boost its oil output to reverse production declines.
Shares were down 2.3% to $63.30 in premarket trading. The stock is down about 29% since Chief Executive Darren Woods took over three years ago.
Its production in the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. shale field, was up 54% from a year ago. But quarterly profits on U.S. production were down 74% as the company spent heavily to boost output and suffered from lower natural gas prices.
Overall, the exploration and production business, its largest, benefited the most from the sale of production assets in Norway for $4.5 billion to Vår Energi AS. 
Analysts said the weakness across its businesses means Exxon will still have to borrow to cover its shareholder dividend. Investors have been pushing oil companies to improve their returns by increasing dividends or share buybacks. Exxon has frozen its share repurchases except for offsetting dilution for employee awards.
""Unlike its peers, the company is not generating free cash flow given its large capital spending program,"" said Jennifer Rowland, analyst with Edward Jones.
Exxon’s $355 million loss in chemicals mirrors that of rival Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), and was the first loss in that business in at least 13 years, said Biraj Borkhataria, analyst with RBC Capital Markets, adding “we do not expect a significant recovery,” in 2020.
Oil majors have added and expanded plants to boost plastics production, but now face a global chemicals glut and tariffs on U.S. exports to China. Exxon’s chemicals business regularly generated $1 billion in quarterly profits as recently as 2018.
Its refining business earned $898 million, down 67% from last year, on lower margins.
Net income attributable to Exxon fell to $5.69 billion, or $1.33 per share, in the three months ended Dec. 31, from $6 billion, or $1.41 per share, a year earlier. 
Excluding one-time items, per share earnings were 41 cents, below Wall Streets consensus expectation of 43 cents, according to Refinitiv. Analysts earlier this month had slashed estimates from 71 cents after the company warned of weakness in chemicals and refining.
The largest U.S. oil producer's oil and gas output rose less than 1% to 4.02 million barrels per day in the quarter, the sixth quarter in a row of year-over year gains.
Earlier this week, the company raised its Guyana oil estimates by 2 billion barrels, bringing total recoverable oil and gas resources from the discovery to more than 8 billion barrels.

GENOA (Reuters) - Italy's Banca Carige (MI:CRGI) appointed a new board on Friday to take the reins of the troubled regional lender, ending more than 12 months under a temporary special administration appointed last year to stem years of losses and mismanagement.
Since being placed under special administration by the European Central Bank at the beginning of last year, Carige has been kept afloat by other Italian banks, which shouldered the bulk of a 900 million euro ($1 billion) rescue.
After attempts to attract a buyer failed, a depositor protection fund (FITD) financed by Italian banks had to step in to rescue the Genoa-based lender and now holds an 80% stake in Carige after a 700 million euro ($782 million) capital increase.
The fund appointed the majority of administrators, including former UniCredit (MI:CRDI) deputy chairman Vincenzo Calandra Bonaura as Carige's chairman.
The newly-elected board will meet soon after Friday's shareholder meeting to appoint former  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) executive Francesco Guido as chief executive."

The largest U.S. e-commerce company saw its shares jump by more than 10% after Thursday’s earnings report crushed Wall Street estimates. If that gain stands through Friday’s close of trading, the company could see its market capitalization surge by more than $90 billion, and push the total value above $1 trillion -- a level the stock has flirted with intraday, but never held through the market close.
That’d be the biggest single-day gain on record for a U.S. company, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The previous record was $78 billion, set by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. on July 26, after its shares surged on its own strong results and a $25 billion share-buyback program.
To be sure, with markets near all-time highs, marks such as this are bound to be challenged. But it’s also not an everyday event when one of the largest companies in the world gains 10% or more in a single session. Over the last five years, the six companies in the S&P 500 Index with current market caps exceeding $500 billion have had just 10 such days combined. Today would be the 11th such occurrence, and the fourth time Amazon has done so, the most of any company in the group."
1014,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2020 09:10AM ET</span>","Pilots, flight attendants demand flights to China stop as virus fear mounts worldwide","By Tracy Rucinski and Laurence Frost
CHICAGO/PARIS (Reuters) - Pilots and flight attendants are demanding airlines stop flights to China as health officials declare a global emergency over the rapidly spreading coronavirus, with American Airlines' pilots filing a lawsuit seeking an immediate halt.
China has reported nearly 10,000 cases and 213 deaths, but the virus has spread to 18 countries, mostly, presumably, by airline passengers.
The United States has advised its citizens not to travel to China, raising its warning to the same level as those for Iraq and Afghanistan.
U.S. airlines, which have been reducing flights to China this week, were reassessing flying plans as a result, according to people familiar with the matter. 
It is possible the White House could opt to take further action to bar flights to China in coming days, but officials stressed that no decision has been made.
The Allied Pilots Association (APA), which represents American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) pilots, cited ""serious, and in many ways still unknown, health threats posed by the coronavirus"" in a lawsuit filed in Texas, where the airline is based.
American said it was taking precautions against the virus but had no immediate comment on the lawsuit. On Wednesday, it announced flight cancellations from Los Angeles to Beijing and Shanghai, but is continuing flights from Dallas.
APA President Eric Ferguson urged pilots assigned to U.S.-China flights to decline the assignment. In a statement, the American Airlines' flight attendants union said they supported the pilots' lawsuit and called on the company and the U.S. government to ""err on the side of caution and halt all flights to and from China.""
Pilots at United Airlines, the largest U.S. airline to China, concerned for their safety will be allowed to drop their trip without pay, according to a Wednesday memo from their union to members.
United announced on Thursday another 332 U.S.-China flight cancellations between February and March 28, though it will continue operating round trip flights from San Francisco to Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong.
The American Airlines pilot lawsuit came as an increasing number of airlines stopped their flights to mainland China, including Air France KLM SA, British Airways, Germany's Lufthansa and Virgin Atlantic.
Other major carriers have kept flying to China, but protective masks and shorter layovers designed to reduce exposure have done little to reassure crews.
'COUNTDOWN'
A U.S. flight attendant who recently landed from one major Chinese city said a big concern is catching the virus and spreading it to families, or getting quarantined while on a layover.""I didn't understand the gravity of the situation until I went there,"" she said on condition of anonymity, describing general paranoia on the return flight, with every passenger wearing a mask. 
""Now I feel like I'm on a 14-day countdown.""
Thai Airways is hosing its cabins with disinfectant spray between China flights and allowing crew to wear masks and gloves.
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) is operating fewer flights and offering food deliveries so crew can stay in their hotels. The carrier is also allowing pilots to drop China trips without pay, a memo from its union to members said.
Korean Air Lines Co Ltd and Singapore Airlines are sending additional crew to fly each plane straight back, avoiding overnight stays.
The South Korean carrier also said it was loading protective suits for flight attendants who might need to take care of suspected coronavirus cases in the air.
Airlines in Asia are seeing a big drop in bookings along with forced cancellations because of the coronavirus outbreak, the head of aircraft lessor Avolon Holdings Ltd said, adding the impact could last for some months.
The outbreak poses the biggest epidemic threat to the airline industry since the 2003 SARS crisis, which led to a 45% plunge in passenger demand in Asia at its peak in April of that year, analysts said.
Fitch Ratings said airlines with more moderate exposure to China and the Asia-Pacific region were likely to be able to re-deploy capacity to alternative routes to mitigate the effect on traffic, but that could increase competition on those routes and reduce airfares.
Air France, which maintained China flights throughout the SARS epidemic, suspended its Beijing and Shanghai flights on Thursday after cabin crews demanded an immediate halt. 

""When the staff see that other airlines have stopped flying there, their reaction is 'Why are we still going?',"" said Flore Arrighi, president of UNAC, one of the airline's four main flight attendants' unions.

9:10 AM ET: Navistar (NYSE:NAV) stock rose 54% after Volkswagen's truck unit Traton (DE:8TRA) offered to buy the company for $2.9 billion
9:05 AM ET:   Chevron   (NYSE:CVX) stock fell 1.9% after the oil company swung to a $6.6 billion loss in the fourth quarter, as impairments on assets in the Gulf of Mexico, Canada and Appalachia came out close to the top end of an earlier warning.
The company had in December warned of up to $11 billion in asset writedowns and said it was considering the sale of its stake in the Appalachian shale and in the proposed Kitmat LNG project in Canada. 
The news comes a day after Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) also took a hefty charge against its U.S. shale gas assets.
9:00 AM ET: Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) stock fell 2.7% after the company issued disappointing guidance for 2020. The biotech expects EPS of $14.85-$15.60, well below consensus forecasts of $15.98, due to growing pressure on margins from biosimilars.
8:55 AM ET: Honeywell (NYSE:HON) stock fell 1.5% after the company reported a drop in sales and earnings in the fourth quarter.
Adjusted for a string of asset disposals, sales rose 2% but were still slightly behind forecasts.
The company said underlying earnings will rise by between 5% and 10% this year, as its key aerospace division avoids significant damage from the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 issue.
8:48 AM ET:   Caterpillar   (NYSE:CAT) stock fell 1.0% after saying earnings per share this year would be between $8.50 and $10. Even the top end of that range was below market consensus.
The company’s fourth-quarter earnings, however, came in ahead of expectations thanks to some determined cost control.

8:40 AM ET: Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock rose 11.6% after its fourth-quarter profit raced past expectations, thanks to heavy investment in one-day shipping earlier in 2019, and to a rising contribution from its advertising business.

The surge takes Amazon's market capitalization over $1 trillion for the first time - the fourth U.S. company to do so after Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).
However, operating income growth from the vital cloud server business AWS slowed, and the company’s international operations continued to lose money.

  Exxon Mobil   (NYSE:XOM) stock fell 1.5% after the oil and gas major reported a 5.2% drop in fourth-quarter profit, citing weaker margins in its refining and chemical businesses.


   IBM    (NYSE:IBM) stock rose 3.8% after the company said late on Thursday that long-standing CEO Ginni Rometty will stand down. Rometty has overseen a long streak of falling revenue caused by the need to revamp IBM’s business model. That run was broken only in the last quarter.

Rometty will be succeeded by Arvand Krishna, the head of IBM’s Cloud business unit.

1016,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2020 08:59AM ET</span>",Global funds prefer stocks despite risks still at play: Reuters poll,"By Rahul Karunakar and Hari Kishan
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Funds increased their preference for stocks to a two-year high at the expense of bonds and cash holdings in their model global portfolio recommendations this month in a Reuters poll, despite world share markets struggling on the coronavirus breakout.
That cautious mood in markets lines up with responses to a separate question, which showed international long-term investors would either roughly maintain their current risk positioning or reduce their exposure to riskier assets and positions within the same asset class.
""We should consider that we are in a late (economic) cycle, and most of the cyclical acceleration in 2020 is expected in the first half. Therefore, we expect to reduce risk exposure at some point between Q2 and Q3,"" said Pascal Blanqué, chief investment officer at Europe's largest asset manager, Amundi, in Paris.
The latest Reuters poll was conducted amid mounting worries about the economic damage from a coronavirus outbreak in China that so far has led to more than 200 deaths, multiple travel bans, flight cancellations and factory shutdowns.
""While we acknowledge the increased risks represented by the coronavirus and rising Middle East tensions, the global economic landscape is notably more positive entering 2020,"" said Alan Gayle, president at Via Nova Investment Management.
""Moreover, earnings prospects are improving and central bankers intend to keep interest rates low, which supports a higher stock market. We plan to maintain our increased equity exposure at least over the near term.""
The Jan. 17-31 poll of 37 asset managers showed global investors in search of better returns increased their exposure to equities to the highest since January 2018, to an average 49.7% from 47.0% in December.
""Equities look most attractive from a cross-asset point of view and remain one of the highest-yielding assets,"" said Benjamin Seuss, director at UBS Asset Management.
Funds suggested a cut to bonds holdings to 40.3% from 42.1% and cash levels to the lowest in two years to 4.3% from 4.6% in December.
""It is likely that global equities will outperform bonds in 2020 as investors remain committed to risk assets for their total return strategies,"" said Peter Lowman, chief investment officer at Investment Quorum in London.
""Nonetheless, its a question of 'what you own rather than just owning the market' given valuation distortions in parts of the equity market.""
But many fund managers viewed the potential economic damage from the coronavirus and below-expectations earnings growth as the biggest risks to their current positioning.
""The hit to Chinese consumption from the coronavirus outbreak could delay or weaken the re-acceleration of global growth,"" said UBS's Seuss in Zurich.
""The market is priced for a sharp rebound in earnings over the next few months and any delay could cause some additional but modest volatility. Any pullback of around 5% or so will be a buying opportunity for equities,"" he added.
While equities in both developed and emerging markets were predicted to rise modestly this year, the conviction among fund managers was much stronger for developed markets equities, which had a banner year in 2019.
More than 80% of portfolio managers in response to an additional question said stocks in advanced economies would rise modestly.
But on emerging-market equities - which rallied late last month and earlier in January - they were more split, with around 60% predicting a rise and the remaining 40% expecting a decline in 2020.
The regional breakdown showed developed-market stocks broadly rose at the expense of the emerging markets.
""We need to see earnings growth come through in 2020 to support equity markets following the large re-rating in 2019. Liquidity provided by the Federal Reserve has also calmed markets,"" said Craig Hoyda, senior quantitative analyst at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Edinburgh.
""However, any withdrawal could reverberate through to emerging markets.""

1019,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2020 07:16AM ET</span>",Top U.S. fund firms split over new limits on shareholder votes,"By Ross Kerber
BOSTON (Reuters) - Pending U.S. securities rules that would limit shareholder proposals have divided passive and active U.S. fund firms as some take a harder line on issues like climate change.
A comment period ends Monday on proposed changes from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that investor activists say would weaken their ability to bring environmental or social issues to a shareholder vote.
Business groups back the changes to streamline their annual meetings, including by raising how much stock some individual investors must own to file a proposal.
Climate-related proposals have set the agenda at various annual gatherings lately, notably at  Exxon Mobil  Inc. (N:XOM)
A final SEC vote could come by March. The corporate lobby so far has faced little push-back from top index fund firms, which often do not support resolutions on climate and other issues.
But lately a group of firms known for actively managed funds has emerged in defense of smaller shareholders.
""It's a very healthy mechanism to have small shareholders with the ability to file resolutions and bring different ideas to the fore,"" said John Hoeppner, head of U.S. stewardship for Legal & General Investment Management America.
Legal & General, Wellington Management, MFS Investment Management and Neuberger Berman all have signed letters to the SEC raising concerns that its proposed changes could hinder shareholder engagement.
Their stances contrast with those of top index managers BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) and  State Street  Corp, (N:STT) both of which have vowed new attention on sustainability issues this year.
A BlackRock spokesman declined to comment on the SEC rule changes. Rakhi Kumar, who oversees State Street's stewardship efforts, said in an interview that the firm supports shareholder democracy but does not have a stance on the rule changes.
""I don't feel like I need to have a position on an issue that's not impacting us,"" she said.
Vanguard Group plans to file a comment letter soon ""in directional support of the SEC’s efforts,"" a spokeswoman said.
The SEC voted along partisan lines to propose the new rules Nov. 5. Lobbyists for and against the changes expect the SEC's Republican-appointed majority to put the new rules into place.
On Thursday SEC Commissioner Elad Roisman said in a speech he is open to changing his mind on the proposals but called some feedback about them misconceptions.
Sanford Lewis, an attorney representing filers of 20% of the 160 social and environmental proposals voted at S&P 1500 companies last year, said the index firms should oppose the rules to back up their tough climate talk. Other fund managers may have smaller stewardship staffs and may need the resolutions to pressure companies, he noted.
""They may not like every proposal. But the proposals are certainly advancing their investment strategy,"" Lewis said."
1020,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 31, 2020 07:12AM ET</span>",Stocks - U.S. Futures Lower; Virus Fears Weigh as Earnings Continue,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - U.S. stock markets are set to open lower, as the deadly coronavirus in China continues to weigh on sentiment, overshadowing strong earnings from retail giant Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).
At 7:10 AM ET (1210 GMT), futures for the S&P 500 traded 14 points, or 0.4%, lower, futures for the Nasdaqdown 36 points, or 0.4%, while theDJI futures contract fell 125 points, or 0.4%. These are on track for a second straight down week, but January is still likely to be a positive month, the fifth in a row.
The nationwide death toll in China's coronavirus outbreak has climbed above 200, with nearly 10,000 infected, prompting the World Health Organization to declare the coronavirus a global health emergency. 
The organization stopped short of recommending travel and trade restrictions with China, and also backed the efforts of the world’s second largest economy to contain the outbreak.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) has taken a stab at putting some estimates on the impact on growth from the efforts to control the spread of the virus. 
The investment banking giant revised down its estimate for China’s GDP growth in 2020 to 5.5% from 5.9% previously. It also estimated that U.S. GDP growth would be hit by 0.4% in the first quarter.
On Thursday official data showed the U.S. economy grew by 2.1% in the fourth quarter, resulting in full-year growth of 2.3% in 2019.
Looking at the corporate sector, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is set to be today’s standout performer after the e-commerce giant reported sales soared over the holiday season, rising 21% from the previous year. Shares traded over 8% higher premarket.
  IBM   (NYSE:IBM) will also be in the spotlight after the information technology company announced CEO Ginni Rometty will retire at the end of 2020 after almost 40 years with the company, to be replaced by Arvind Krishna.
Shares in Visa (NYSE:V) fell premarket after the world’s largest payment network posted disappointing numbers for its first quarter and said it sees muted revenue growth this year, while Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) shares also dropped after the biotech drug maker disappointed with its 2020 outlook.
  Caterpillar   (NYSE:CAT) reported better than expected fourth quarter earnings Friday, but this result was based largely on successful cost cutting as revenue fell short of expectations, as did 2020 guidance.
Economic data due for release Friday include core PCE price and personal spending data at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), Michigan consumer sentiment numbers at 10:00 AM ET (1500 GMT) and Baker Hughes total rig count at 1:00 PM ET (1800 GMT).
AT 07:10 AM ET (1210 GMT), U.S. crude futures rose 0.6% to $52.45 and the international benchmark Brent contract climbed 0.3% to $57.48.
Gold futures fell 0.3% and the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of developed market peers, fell 0.1%."

1025,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 31, 2020 06:33AM ET</span>",Caterpillar Earnings Beat on Cost Cutting; Revenues Slip,"
Investing.com -  Caterpillar  reported better than expected fourth quarter earnings  Friday, but the result was based largely on successful cost-cutting as revenue fell short of expectations.

 Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) announced earnings per share of $2.63 on revenue of $13.14 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com expected EPS of $2.38 on revenue of $13.49 billion. 

“In the fourth quarter, strong cost control more than offset lower-than-expected end-user demand,” said Chairman and CEO Jim Umpleby. “Our margin performance reflected our diligent focus on maintaining a flexible and competitive cost structure.”
Investors often look to the heavy machinery company to gauge the health of U.S. manufacturing. At the height of the U.S.-China trade war last year,  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) took a big hit from higher material costs including tariffs, while the reduced demand from China is likely to have hit sales.
The company also posted a gloomy outlook for 2020. It expects earnings of between $8.50 and $10 per share. Analysts had forecast $10.55 on average.
""It’s very tough for investors to see a bright spot in  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) earnings when manufacturing downturn seems to be worsening and there is considerable uncertainty regarding the economic impact of coronavirus on Chinese and global industrial activity,"" said Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar. ""The outbreak of virus could hurt the company’s largest customers, including miners and oil and gas producers, making it difficult for the company to deal with rising inventory levels and pass on planned price increases.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EssilorLuxottica's (PA:ESLX) 7.2 billion euro ($8 billion) bid for Dutch opticians group GrandVision (AS:GVNV) faces a full-scale EU antitrust investigation after it declined to offer concessions to address concerns, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
EssilorLuxottica, formed last year from the merger of French lens maker Essilor and Italian eyewear group Luxottica, gave up the chance to offer concessions on Thursday, the deadline for doing so, the European Commission website showed.
Last year's deal also triggered an investigation and feedback from nearly 4,000 opticians but was eventually cleared unconditionally. 
The new deal will give EssilorLuxottica control of more than 7,000 stores worldwide.
The Commission, which will open the full-scale probe following the end of its preliminary review on Feb. 6, and EssilorLuxottica declined to comment. Its shares dipped on the Reuters story and were down 0.8% in early trade.
GrandVision was not immediately available for comment.
The sources said retailers and rival lens makers had expressed concerns to the EU competition watchdog. EssilorLuxottica however has pointed to the growing market clout of independent and specialist lens makers.
GrandVision, whose chains include Vision Express in Britain and For Eyes in the United States, sells brands including Varilux lenses and Ray-Ban sunglasses.

EssilorLuxottica's retail brands include David Clulow opticians, Sunglass Hut and Spectacle Hut.

1027,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2020 06:02AM ET</span>",Billionaire Lawrence Stroll shifts Aston Martin into the fast lane,"By Costas Pitas
LONDON (Reuters) - Canadian billionaire Lawrence Stroll has agreed to buy up to 20% of Aston Martin and rename his Formula One team after the 107-year-old company famed for being fictional secret agent James Bond's car of choice.
A decline in sales of Aston Martin's luxury sports cars since it floated on the London Stock Exchange in October 2018 has put the company's shares and finances under sustained pressure, forcing it to seek help. 
Under the deal announced on Friday, Stroll will pay 182 million pounds for a 16.7% stake which could rise to 20% upon completion of the company's plan to raise a total of 500 million pounds, including a rights issue from exiting shareholders.
Aston Martin shares surged as much as 30% after the announcement and were 18% higher at 1038 GMT.
The brand, which is mainly owned by Italian and Kuwaiti private equity groups, has come late to the lucrative sports-utility vehicle (SUV) market and has struggled to keep up with rivals owned by major global carmakers.
Aston Martin had also held talks with Chinese carmaker Geely, which makes Volvos, but it wanted to instigate more fundamental change than the plan outlined on Friday, a person familiar with the talks told Reuters. 
Aston Martin Chief Executive Andy Palmer said the consortium led by Stroll, who is behind the Racing Point F1 team and owns a fleet of vintage Ferraris, will bring several benefits. 
""He brings with him his experiences and access to his Formula One team,"" Palmer told Reuters. 
""We've talked a lot in the past few years about wanting to be clearly rooted in luxury and obviously Mr Stroll knows an awful lot about luxury.""
Stroll will join Aston Martin's board as executive chairman, replacing Penny Hughes, who will step down. 
Under Friday's agreement, Racing Point will become the Aston Martin F1 works team from the 2021 season. Stroll's 21-year-old son Lance joined Mercedes-powered Racing Point last year from Williams (NYSE:WMB) and has Mexican Sergio Perez as team mate.
Stroll, who made his money through investing in fashion brands such as Tommy Hilfiger and Michael Kors, has been involved in Formula One and motor racing for years and also owns Canada's Mont-Tremblant circuit in Quebec.
'DEMAND OVER SUPPLY'
Carmakers of all sizes are using alliances, partnerships and mergers as ways to share the cost and challenge of meeting new emissions regulations, electrifying model ranges and competing on new technologies such as autonomous driving. 
The car sector has been hit by a decline in sales in China and a slump in diesel sales in Europe, prompting several automakers to post disappointing results, but Aston has also suffered as a small player. 
Rivals such as Bentley, which is owned by Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), and Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) Motor Cars, a subsidiary of BMW, benefit from being part of major carmaking companies as they can share costs and expertise. 
But despite more stringent emissions rules coming in over the next few years, Aston Martin said plans to invest in electric vehicles will now be delayed beyond 2025 as part of cost-cutting measures. 
The consortium led by Stroll is likely to include several other people such as JCB Chairman Anthony Bamford, entrepreneur Andre Desmarais, Michael de Picciotto, telecoms investor John McCaw and Hong Kong fashion sector investor Silas Chou, all of whom have worked with Stroll before.

""I look forward to working with the board and management team... to continue to invest in the development of new models and technologies and to start to rebalance production to prioritize demand over supply,"" said Stroll.

1028,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2020 05:51AM ET</span>",Lloyds issues memo on staff treatment after flurry of complaints,"By Sinead Cruise and Iain Withers
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's biggest domestic bank Lloyds (L:LLOY) has issued guidelines to branch managers on treating staff fairly, after a rise in complaints to one of its employee unions about working conditions across its dwindling retail network.
The memo was sent to managers on Tuesday, union Accord said. The union did not say what the memo advised but said it was in tune with advice to members published on Jan. 20 by the union, which represents around 20,000 Lloyds employees nationwide.
Examples of staff complaints included demands to work in their own time, asking junior staff to open and close branches, and long-distance commutes resulting from staff switching to new branches after their local one closed.
The union memo called for managers not to impose such demands on staff, for staff to know their rights, and for them to contact the union if necessary. Lloyds declined to comment.
Accord said problems had increased as Lloyds cuts back its branch network, putting pressure on branch managers and staff.
""There were a sufficient number of complaints for us to issue general guidance rather than just responding to the individuals who came to us,"" Ged Nichols, general secretary at Accord, told Reuters. He added he was satisfied with Lloyds' response so far.
On Wednesday Lloyds said it was planning to close a further 56 branches by October as more of its customers choose to bank online rather than over the counter.
The planned closures include 31 Lloyds, 10 Halifax and 15 Bank of Scotland branded branches and would likely result in around 80 job losses, the union said, adding that many staff were likely to be redeployed.
Lloyds has shut 569 branches over the past four years, according to consumer group Which? that tracks branch closures.
Britain's banks have made deep cuts to their branch networks in recent years, sparking a backlash from politicians and small business groups criticizing the cuts for harming local businesses and vulnerable customers.
Lloyds has said it is committed to retaining the largest branch network in Britain and says customers can use alternatives such as online services and accessing some bank services at Post Offices."

1030,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 31, 2020 05:21AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Aston Martin Eyes F1 Future After Stroll's Rescue,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com --   Aston Martin   Lagonda (LON:AML) is bringing in new shareholders and tapping old ones for fresh cash to stave off a liquidity crisis, after the global slowdown last year threatened to put it back into bankruptcy.
As a result, the company is pushing further than ever into the rarefied world of Formula 1 racing, a move that will add extra spice to the financial outlook for anyone who thinks the stock hasn’t been volatile enough since it listed two years ago.
The company intends to raise a total of 500 million pounds ($626 million), of which 182 million will be injected a consortium led by Canadian billionaire Lawrence Stroll, a co-owner of the Racing Point Formula 1 team and all-round petrolhead. The consortium is also providing an extra 55 million pounds in short-term working capital.
Stroll is also putting the Aston Martin name on the Racing Point F1 team that he co-owns (and where his son Lance happens to be one of the drivers) from next season. As such it will end sponsorship of Red Bull, which had collaborated with AML on the Valhalla and other cars. AML will get a stake in the team under the agreement, which will run initially for 10 years.
The rest of the cash will come through a one-for-five rights issue priced at 4 pounds per share. For the existing private equity owners, who will still control over 50% of the company after the deal, this represents little more than putting back some of the money they took out through the IPO process. For free shareholders, already nursing losses of some 75% on their investment, it adds insult to injury.
Among other things, the money will save AML having to draw down a 100 million-pound credit line at loan-shark rates that it had agreed late last year.
Aston Martin shares, which were pricing in a high probability of bankruptcy, leaped 25% on the news.
Talks with Stroll had been widely trailed in recent weeks and aren’t the surprise that the share price reaction would suggest. However, what is interesting is the terms Stroll has exacted. The company is pushing back development of electric vehicles under the Lagonda brand to 2025 (having failed to persuade China’s Geely to join the party) and will also defer launch of its Valhalla model to 2022. Those moves will also take the near-term strain off the company’s cash flow, allowing it to focus on the launch of the DBX SUV – which is still slated to go ahead in the second quarter.
Stroll will replace Penny Hughes as chairman.
Somewhat lost in the noise of the deal was the update that the fourth quarter of 2019 didn’t get any better for the company, which noted that it had continued to experience “lower sales, higher selling costs and lower margins versus expectations.”
The road ahead may be more glamorous, and the chance of getting there in one piece slightly higher, but you still wouldn’t want to be starting the journey from here."
1031,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2020 05:17AM ET</span>",'Frost on top of snowfall': Virus piles pressure on China's industrial machine,"By Josh Horwitz and Muyu Xu
SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - The coronavirus is threatening to disrupt large parts of China's manufacturing machine and its global supply chains as the spread of infection and strict public health measures force companies and workers to remain idle.
China's most important holiday was due to end on Friday, when many companies planned to get back to work after a week-long vacation, but authorities have ordered businesses in many areas to stay shut longer in a bid to contain the disease.
Widespread travel restrictions, meanwhile, mean millions of migrant workers may be unable to return to what has often been called the world's factory floor.
The World Health Organization on Thursday declared the outbreak a global health emergency as the death toll in China reached more than 200, with over 9,000 infected.
Brian Miller, 32, owner of Easy China Warehouse and a bluetooth speaker company in the southern city of Shenzhen, said labor and production disruptions could ripple through supply chains, from raw materials to final assembly. 
""If we can't get back to production quick enough, I'll run out of inventory, and I'll have a few months where we won't be able to sell anything. And that's the catastrophe that we all don't want,"" Miller told Reuters. 
In Eastern China's Suzhou, one of the country's largest manufacturing hubs, companies have been told to stay shut until at least Feb. 8 and in Shanghai until Feb. 9. Factories in the southern manufacturing hub of Dongguan in export-oriented Guangdong province have also been told not to open before Feb. 10.
The threat of significant disruptions comes as China was already undergoing the biggest supply chain shift in a generation as companies grappled with the impact of the Sino-U.S. trade war and an economic slowdown.
A woman surnamed Chen, who co-owns a garment factory in Huizhou in Guangdong province, described the virus and shutdowns as being like ""frost on top of snowfall.""
Her domestic focused factory already had to lay off almost half its workers from over 70 to around 40 due to the slowing economy, and she fears more jobs may be lost in coming months. 
""The outbreak is definitely causing great damage to our business, as everyone will worry about a resurgence in the virus even if it is curbed,"" she said.
The risk of a shock to business and consumer activity prompted one Chinese government economist to forecast economic growth may drop to 5%, or lower, from 6.1% in 2019. During the SARS epidemic in 2002-03, growth fell two percentage points but rebounded quickly once that outbreak was brought under control. 
""The worst thing is the uncertainty ... Whole parts of the supply chain could stop,"" said Nicole Peng, vice president of mobility at Canalys, an IT research firm. 
PATCHY RESTARTS
Extended closures are rippling across China. 
Coal mines in Inner Mongolia and Shanxi, the top two coal producing areas, have been told not to resume full-scale production until at least Feb. 9, though some workers believe the shutdown could last longer.
A liquefied gas trader in Tangshan in northeast Hebei province said truck drivers were due back on Thursday, but none had returned. 
While some steel mills in Hebei, China's top steelmaking hub, were still operating due to the hefty cost of shutting and restarting, some workers were advised to stay home until Feb. 9, as ""no one wants to take the risk,"" a purchasing manager at a mid-sized mill said. 
A growing number of multinational companies have warned of a hit to their businesses, with firms such as  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) and Levi Strauss (N:LEVI) shutting many China stores.
Scores of airlines have also suspended or reduced flights to China, which Miller said could disrupt air freight.
Some industry veterans said the virus could be the last straw for companies doing business in China. Labor and operating costs had already been steadily rising before the trade war brought higher tariffs.

""You don't know how many (workers) are going to come back and you don't know how many of the suppliers in your supply chain are affected,"" said Larry Sloven, president of Capstone International HK Ltd, who has been doing business in China for more than three decades supplying big-box U.S. retailers.

Danske Bank declined to comment, but said it was cooperating with all relevant authorities. 
Danske is currently being investigated by the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and the U.S. Department of Justice. 
Fines from U.S. authorities tend to worry investors, because they are usually much larger than those of European counterparts. 
Shares in Danske have lost more than half of their value since money-laundering allegations and the threat of a hefty fine gained pace in 2018. 
Danske shares were up 5.5% in early trade, which analysts said could reflect a delayed reaction to the report published on Wednesday. 

""I think this is the first time we have seen in an actual article that legal experts are saying this,"" said Jyske Bank analyst Anders Haulund Vollesen.

1033,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2020 04:43AM ET</span>",Shares struggle for footing after virus-battered week,"By Marc Jones and Wayne Cole
LONDON/SYDNEY (Reuters) - World share markets fought to regain their footing on Friday as investors clutched at hopes that China could contain the coronavirus, even as headlines spoke of more cases and deaths, travel bans, evacuations and factory shutdowns.
Europe opened 0.3% higher (EU) following a bounce in Tokyo, but did little to repair what has been the most turbulent and costly week for many markets since August. 
The World Health Organization on Thursday labeled the virus a global emergency.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, said the greatest worry was the potential for the virus to infect countries with weaker health systems, though his praise for China's response seemed to steady markets.
MSCI's broadest index of world shares got back to flat. Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan extended their fall, however, dropping 0.4%, and appeared set for their worst weekly loss in a year, of 4.6%. Thursday's 2.3% dive was the sharpest one-day loss in six months.
Japan's Nikkei bounced 1%, but was off 2.6% for the week. Hong Kong's Hang Seng drifted 0.3% lower and has shed 9% in two weeks. Korea's Kospi had its worst week in 15 months, losing 5.6%.
""The coronavirus is outweighing everything else,"" said Francesca Fornasari, head of currency solutions at Insight Investments. 
""We have seen quite a position unwind and ... whatever is coming out in terms of data is for the period when the virus hadn't become quite such a big issue."" 
WALL STREET SET TO SLIP
Wall Street's S&P 500 futures turned red again in Europe, having rebounded as much 0.5% overnight. 
It had been supported by surveys showing Chinese manufacturing activity came in much as expected in January while services actually firmed, though this was likely before the virus took full hold.
Indeed, reports that some Chinese provinces were asking companies not to re-start until Feb. 10 after the New Year holiday suggested activity would take a hard knock this month. 
""Some shorts covered after the director gave the WHO's stamp of approval to China's aggressive containment effort,"" said Stephen Innes, Asia Pacific market strategist at AxiCorp.
""For now, the market's risk lights have shifted from flickering on red to a steady shade of amber.""
Sentiment received a boost when Amazon's sales blew past forecasts and sent its stock soaring 11% after hours, adding over $100 billion in market value. 
Still, the flow of news on the virus remained bleak with China's Hubei province reporting deaths from the disease had risen by 42 to 204 as of the end of Jan. 30.
More airlines curtailed flights into and out of China and companies temporarily closed operations, while Washington told citizens not to travel to any part of China.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) shaved its forecast for global growth by 0.3% points for this quarter.
""Based on the patterns observed from other epidemics, we assume that the outbreak will likely run its course over 2-3 months, meaning the hit to activity happens in the current quarter,"" JPMorgan analysts said in a note. 
""Also in line with historical experience, we expect a full recovery to follow.""
STERLING RISING 
Safe-haven bonds were well bid, with yields on U.S. 10-year Treasuries down 9 basis points for the week so far and near four-month lows.
The yield curve between three-month bills and 10-year notes has inverted twice this week, a bearish economic signal.
In currencies, sterling extended gains after jumping on Thursday when the Bank of England confounded market expectations by not getting anywhere near an interest rate cut. 
The pound was last at $1.313898, a relatively solid performance given that Friday is the day the UK officially leaves the European Union after years of political turmoil.
The dollar took a knock overnight when data showed the U.S. economy had grown at its slowest annual pace in three years and personal consumption weakened sharply.
Yet it was up a fraction on the yen on Friday at 109.03 and stronger on the euro at $1.1016.
Most of the action this week has been nervous investors selling emerging currencies for dollars and yen, leaving the majors little changed against each other. 
Spot gold was only just up for the week at $1,573.72 per ounce, having failed to get much of a safe-haven bid as a range of other commodities, from copper to soy beans, were hammered by worries over Chinese demand.
Oil bounced on short covering, after hitting its lowest in three months as the global spread of the coronavirus threatened to curb demand for fuel. [O/R]
U.S. crude regained 89 cents to $53.03 a barrel, while Brent crude futures rose 83 cents to $59.12.

They are down almost 10% on the month though, despite the spike at the start of the month caused by the U.S. killing of Iran's top military commander.

Its crosstown rival  Ssangyong Motor  (KS:003620) also said it will idle its plant in the South Korean city of Pyeongtaek from Feb. 4 to Feb. 12, as China's factory suspension had disrupted parts supplies.
The suspension illustrates that China's extended factory closures ripple through supply chains across China and beyond.
A coronavirus outbreak that began in Wuhan, the capital of China's central province of Hubei, has spread to more than 9,320 people globally, killing over 200 people.
Many firms scale back operations or close for long periods around the holidays, which began on Jan. 24 this year. This year, China's government extended the Lunar New Year holidays to limit the spread of the virus.

1036,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 31, 2020 04:26AM ET</span>",Stocks - Europe Higher Despite Weak GDP Data; Deutsche Extends Gains,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets pushed higher early Friday, reversing early losses, amid growing confidence coronavirus outbreak in China can be contained. However, gains are likely to be limited as the latest economic data suggest the euro zone's economy weakened ahead of the U.K.'s departure from the EU. 
At 04:25 ET (09:25 GMT), the DAX gained 25 points, or 0.2, France's CAC 40 was up 5 points, or 0.1%, while the FTSE 100 in the U.K. underperformed, down 23 points, or 0.3%. The Euro Stoxx 50 index, which measures the movement of blue chip stocks in the eurozone, rose 2 points, 0.1%.
The nationwide death toll in China's coronavirus outbreak has risen to 213, with nearly 10,000 infected, but the market breathed a sigh of relief that World Health Organization stopped short of travel and trade restrictions with China, even as it declared the virus outbreak a global emergency.
""I have seen the capacity and I believe (China) will control this outbreak as soon as possible,"" said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
The sectors worst hit after the virus outbreak in China have tended to outperform Friday, including the airlines, luxury stocks, travel and leisure as well as miners.
Also helping is Germany’s largest bank, Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB), which rose almost 4% Friday, extending gains after a better-than-expected fourth-quarter report from the bank raised hopes that CEO Christian Sewing's restructuring of the bank is gaining traction. The stock, which has more than halved over the last couple of years as it has struggled with a major overhaul, still reported a third straight annual loss of 5.3 billion euros ($5.8 billion) in 2019. 
The overall tone hasn't been helped by the latest economic data out of the euro zone. German retail sales slumped 3.3% in December, while the French economy unexpectedly contracted in the final quarter of last year, with GDP shrinking 0.1%. Italy's economy also surprisingly contracted by 0.3%.
Preliminary data for eurozone GDP are due at 1000 GMT. The French and Italian numbers may be partly offset by better-than-expected ones out of Spain, where GDP grew 0.5% rather than the 0.4% expected.
Eyes will soon turn to U.S. corporate news for guidance, particularly after Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) posted bumper numbers for the fourth quarter late Thursday.
The confidence of the WHO that the outbreak of the deadly coronavirus can be dealt with helped the oil market rebound from three month lows.
AT 04:30 AM ET (0930 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 0.9% higher at $52.65 and the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.7% to $57.72. Gold futures for February delivery on New York’s COMEX, by contrast, were 0.4% lower at $1,578.00."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian magistrate processing a criminal cartel case against investment bank giants  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) repeatedly professed to being ""lost"" as an early hearing ground its way through a Sydney court on Friday.
Some 20 months after authorities charged the banks and their former executives in Australia's biggest white collar criminal case, the prosecution is still in its early stages.
The large number of defendants - the two banks, their client, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (AX:ANZ), and six of their former staff - has meant that pre-trial hearings have run longer than the five days scheduled last December as lawyers haggle over parameters of the case.
Defense lawyers have argued with prosecutors about which witnesses they can question and which parts of what documents they can see.
""I'm sorry, I'm not trying to seem stupid, I just keep getting lost,"" magistrate Jennifer Giles told the court during an argument about whether lawyers for ANZ, Australia's fourth-largest retail bank, could get un-redacted versions of some documents.
In an argument about redacted records of a phonecall pertinent to the case, details of which were not disclosed to the court, Giles told the court, ""I'm sorry, I've just been completely spun on one spot and I have no idea what the upshot is of that. I'm sorry. I'm lost. I'm so lost.""
The banks and their former staff have been charged over a A$2.5 billion capital raising for ANZ in 2015 in which the investment banks jointly ran the bookbuild. They are accused of colluding, during two conference calls, to withhold some of their shares to prop up the after-market stock price.
A third investment bank which worked on the capital raising, JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), is testifying against the others in exchange for immunity from criminal charges.
None of the accused has entered a formal plea against the charges which carry hefty fines and prison time. Once they enter a plea of not guilty, the matter proceeds to trial, probably in the Federal court, lawyers have told the court previously.
Giles, the magistrate, said the time overrun had twice delayed a separate criminal hearing for a man in custody that was scheduled for the same courtroom.
The hearings continue on Feb. 7."

1041,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2020 03:16AM ET</span>",Special Report: When Ana ditched Andrea - The saga of Santander,"By Pamela Barbaglia, Rachel Armstrong and Alessandra Galloni
LONDON (Reuters) - In September 2018, Santander, one of Europe's biggest banks, tweeted a video of its incoming new chief executive, an Italian investment banker named Andrea Orcel. Depicting a meeting with the bank's boss, Ana Botin, the clip showed the silver-haired Italian cutting the air with a decisive gesture.
A few months later, the bank shot a new video, intended for investors and the media, at its Madrid headquarters. It shows Botin, who heads a 150-year-old banking dynasty, saying she has withdrawn the offer because the new man's pay would be too high for the bank, according to two people with direct knowledge of the sequence. In the video, Orcel is shown appearing to agree with the outcome.
That clip was never released; in fact, the Italian now says he was misled. The rupture that followed the meeting has turned into one of the bitterest and highest-profile employment disputes in recent European history, yielding a lawsuit that is due later this year in a Spanish civil court. This account of the Botin-Orcel clash, the most comprehensive yet assembled, offers a rare glimpse inside the top level of one of the world's largest banks, a family-led giant with a culture all its own. It is also a story of how, a decade after bankers were blamed for a crippling global financial crisis, the reality of austerity has been slow to fully sink in.
In May, Orcel sued Santander, demanding that the bank honor its offer or pay him 112 million euros ($123 million) in damages - equivalent to equivalent to about 1% of the bank's profits in 2018.
In his suit, Orcel says a letter laying out his pay was a binding contract and that the video showing him accepting its withdrawal was shot on a false pretext, according to documents he submitted in court. In response, Santander said that under Spanish law, an offer letter is not a contract and that Orcel's behavior during negotiations led the bank to lose confidence in him.
Whatever the court decides, a rich body of evidence - texts and online messages between the pair and their family members, extracts from court documents, and interviews with eight people involved - shows a cosy relationship corroding. The messages - some reported here for the first time - suggest the hiring process for one of Europe's most important financial jobs went awry partly because old ties between powerful people led to hasty assurances and false assumptions.
Ana Botin, now 59, was a senior banker who had been named executive chairman of the group to succeed her late father, Emilio, a legendary patriarch who had built Santander into a global business through savvy acquisitions. Orcel, 56, a widely respected banker who according to some media looks like 'the George Clooney of investment banking,' had been Botin's go-to investment banker for advice on deal-making and strategy.
""What is most important to me is your energy and enthusiasm; and I know that both for you personally and for your family this will be a good thing!""
July 25, message from Ana Botin to Andrea Orcel
(This and other reproductions of text messages are based on original texts or submissions to court seen by Reuters. Some were originally written, in whole or part, in Spanish and have been translated. Some were redacted, and Reuters has edited two to preserve the anonymity of people with incidental roles in the story.)
When the wooing began in mid-2018, Botin and Orcel's Portuguese wife, Clara Batalim-Orcel, chatted about the Orcel family's plans to swap its mansion in Holland Park, London, for a nice place in Madrid, sources with knowledge of the matter said.
But for all its promise, terms of the September, 2018 offer to hire Orcel, reviewed by Reuters, were not clear. Crucially, Santander promised to pay ""up to"" 35 million euros of a 55 million euro package that Orcel was due to receive in future years from his employer at the time, Swiss bank UBS. The letter said Orcel would make his ""best efforts"" to cap that cost for Santander by getting the Swiss bank to contribute some of it.
UBS refused, and Orcel would not accept less than 35 million euros. By the end, the bankers and their spouses would have a frosty encounter in a coffee shop near London's Mayfair. And Santander's board had issued a statement questioning what it called Orcel's ""dubious ethical and moral behavior,"" alleging he was secretly taping private conversations - which a source close to Orcel told Reuters he had done on legal advice.
The fallout has gripped Europe's investment banking industry, where Orcel is one of the best-known dealmakers. It also raised questions about how one of Europe's most important banks - Santander has 144 million customers worldwide - could name a new CEO without first finalizing his pay.
Santander, founded by Royal Decree in 1857, has been run by the Botins for four generations. Its style has long been to move swiftly when needed, said Mauro Guillen, a management professor at Wharton School in Pennsylvania, who has written a book on Santander's development into a global bank.
""The bank is always very nimble when it comes to making bold decisions,"" he said, adding that in a rapidly changing environment, this made it popular with investors. But the way Orcel's appointment was handled shows Santander's speediness does not always pay off. ""If the bank wants to hire, not just a CEO but top executives, a lot of people may think twice"" in the wake of the Orcel debacle.
Invited to comment on the details of its rupture with Orcel, the bank referred to a statement it made last year in response to Orcel’s suit and media reports, saying it had followed a robust appointment process that met the highest standards of corporate governance and giving its reasons not to proceed with his appointment. Orcel declined to comment ahead of the court hearing, and UBS declined to comment.
""GLADIATOR""
Orcel knows Santander better than any other investment banker. Over nearly three decades as a dealmaker at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) and UBS, he worked on dozens of transactions that helped Emilio Botin transform the bank. The biggest of these was when Santander joined a consortium and bought parts of ABN Amro, a major Dutch bank, in 2007.
Orcel is a driven and talented banker, interviews with former colleagues show. Having run investment banking at UBS since 2012, he had also made clear his desire for a CEO post, telling the Financial Times in 2015 that ""of course"" he wanted to run a bank some day, and if he could choose, UBS would be a good place to start.
When Emilio Botin died suddenly in September 2014, Ana, the eldest of his six children, was swiftly named to follow him. She would continue the family line in a bank whose shares are now mostly owned by institutional investors and funds. By appointing her, Santander followed a Spanish tradition of banks controlled by a single head, rather than a separate chairman and CEO, as the European Central Bank has said should be the norm.
The Botin family is part of Spain's aristocracy - the King of Spain made Botin's mother a marchioness in 2008. Ana, whose full name is Ana Patricia Botin-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea, was made an honorary Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Britain's queen for services to the British financial sector in 2015.
A keen golfer who describes herself as highly competitive, Botin was ranked by Forbes as one of the world's most powerful women; she told Spanish TV in January the special thing about her job is the power it gives to change lives for many people. She started her career at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), successfully turned around Santander's Spanish subsidiary Banesto, and ran its business in the UK, one of the bank's largest.
In Santander's top slot, she faced a challenge to sustain the growth rate her father had achieved.
Emilio's strategy of swallowing businesses in emerging markets had won plaudits for shielding Santander from the worst of the 2008 financial crisis, even as its home market was in deep recession. But when Emilio died, growth in Latin America was slowing and Santander's business in Britain and the United States faced strong headwinds. Like other banks, it was under pressure to bolster its capital. In September 2015, a year after Emilio's death, Santander's share price was down around 30% from when Ana had started.
Orcel the adviser was on hand. Four months after Ana Botin's elevation, he helped arrange a massive 7.5 billion euro capital increase, which took place overnight and was called ""ballsy"" by trade magazine Euromoney. Again, in 2017, Orcel advised when Santander picked up an ailing domestic rival, Banco Popular, for one euro. He arranged a 7 billion euro capital boost for Santander to cover Popular's bad debts.
In early 2018, with Santander's stock still lagging, Botin asked Orcel to outline a strategic plan to help lift the bank's share price, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. That July, when the two met for dinner at the Loews (NYSE:L) Regency hotel on Park Avenue in New York, she had a proposal: Join the bank as CEO and implement the plan.
One idea they discussed was that Santander could sell its underperforming U.S. and British units - a task Orcel would execute. People familiar with the discussions said Orcel pledged loyalty to Botin. He compared his new role to that of the fighter Maximus, played by Russell Crowe in the 2000 movie ""Gladiator,"" leading the troops into battle for his emperor.
For Orcel, Santander would be a radical switch. Investment bankers deal with big corporations and investment funds, while commercial ones serve small companies and individuals. He would be leaving the relationship-driven world of investment banking - which he has likened to selling designer handbags such as Louis Vuitton - to a hands-on role in a major commercial bank, which he has said is more ""potatoes and tomatoes,"" comparable to Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT).
""WORKING ON DETAILS €""
With the offer in place, the next topic was pay. Orcel was used to big money. While working at Merrill Lynch, he had made headlines after receiving a $33.8 million bonus from the Wall Street investment bank for 2008, a year when Merrill's net loss swelled to $27.6 billion.
UBS had granted him a compensation package due to be paid out over several years, including roughly 55 million euros worth of stock to be paid in future, four sources familiar with the matter said.
Such deferred pay is one of the ways investment bankers in the European Union, where bonuses have been capped since 2014, have found to keep up their incomes, said Anna Marietta, co-founder and managing partner of London-based headhunting firm Vici Advisory, which specializes in investment banking.
It is meant as an incentive to lock executives into a bank: If they leave, executives in theory forfeit pay they've accumulated.
In practice, it doesn't work like that. When investment bankers move jobs, the new employer usually 'makes them whole' by paying their deferred compensation. In the investment banking world, this is seldom a point of contention. UBS had done it for Orcel when he joined from Bank of America in 2012. The Swiss bank topped up his $7 million in base salary with $26 million in deferred compensation carried over from his former employer, its annual report showed.
""It is very rare that compensation over deferred pay becomes a problem,"" said Marietta. ""In fact, none of my clients has ever experienced issues with it.""
It's also very rare for a top investment banker to go directly into a top position in commercial banking. Usually they take a break between posts.
In September 2018, Ana Botin messaged Orcel to say colleagues at Santander were on board with his appointment and a staffing committee was working on financial details.
""Andrea. Nomco (nominations committee) 100pc supportive and working on details €. Regards.""
Sept. 10, message from Botin to Orcel
Orcel had told his boss at UBS about Botin's approach on the sidelines of an internal meeting in Zurich. There is no record of exactly how the CEO, Sergio Ermotti, responded, and UBS declined to comment. Orcel later messaged Botin saying his boss had said that if the Italian was moving on, it would be good to announce this before a planned investor day in October.
But there was a problem. As Spain's biggest lender, Santander needed to be mindful of the public mood – as well as the reaction of its 200,000 staff around the world. This was particularly true in the summer of 2018. The country was still recovering from a devastating recession. A Socialist government had just taken power, and some people thought it would impose a new bank tax. Santander was negotiating a large round of job cuts - trade unions said it cut 1,100 staff in Spain in 2018, a figure Santander did not dispute.
Botin saw room to maneuver, thanks to Santander's relationship with UBS.
Her father's dealings with Orcel had turned Santander into a big client for the Swiss bank: In each year the Spanish bank did a major deal, it brought UBS more than 50 million euros in fees, according to people familiar with their relationship. The banks declined to comment.
Botin saw a chance that UBS Chairman Axel Weber would want to keep that business going, the messages show. UBS itself might stump up some of the deferred compensation that Orcel stood to lose. If Weber decided not to, Botin told Orcel in a message, Santander would threaten to pull their business.
""There is a line I had reserved for Axel: if they decide not to pay you anything because we are their competitors, then it is good to know this, that they will not act as our strategic advisors – this is irrefutable and an ""elegant"" way of not beating around the bush.""
Sept. 10, Message from Botin to Orcel
A few days later, Botin approached UBS to pave the way for discussions with its chairman, Axel Weber.
The Swiss bank's executives were all meeting in Singapore, where Orcel spoke to its CEO, Sergio Ermotti, and another UBS board member. ""They are helping us,"" he messaged to Botin.
""I have the green light from Sergio. Can you send me Axel's mobile for me to call him? Sergio has already given me the green light. I'll call you later and tell you about it. Un abrazo. Ana""
Sept. 17, message from Botin to Orcel
But when Santander's boss got to speak to UBS chairman Weber, she found out he was not on board. He wanted Orcel to stay.
Weber wrote an email to Orcel's wife, Clara - whom Orcel consults closely on major career moves - saying the Swiss bank wanted to offer her husband a more senior role at UBS, that could pave the way to him succeeding Ermotti.
""Dear Clara, we have tried to offer him a way to stay at UBS with the same job perspective as outside UBS. The board is unanimous on this and committed to facilitating an orderly transition. It is now his choice and his decision. I appreciate it is a difficult choice. I have also talked to Ana and I was clear to her so that she does not base her actions and her offers on assumptions. I am aware that this will have consequences down the road but everything we do or don't do has. But as long as what we do is the right thing in our mind we will have to be happy to live with these consequences.""
Sept. 19, email from UBS Chairman Axel Weber to Clara Batalim-Orcel
Weber said in the message that he had spoken to Botin, ""and I was clear to her so that she does not base her actions and her offers on assumptions.""
Orcel messaged Botin later about UBS's offer.
""Board made a counter offer... Sergio promised he'll talk to board today and ask them to put me in a fair position.""
Sept. 20, 2018 – Message from Orcel to Botin
On Sunday, Sept. 23, Orcel decided not to take up the counter-offer, and to quit UBS. Meanwhile, Botin was still trying to persuade UBS's Weber to stump up some of Orcel's deferred pay. Without success.
""No se mueve (he is not budging). Says none of it at all.""
Sept. 23, message from Botin to Orcel
""THE NUMBERS HAVE GONE UP""
Despite this lack of movement from UBS, on Sept. 24 Santander's board went ahead with an offer letter for Orcel.
Orcel's wife, Clara, was keen. She messaged Botin the same day to express support for what she called an agreement - it was not clear exactly what she meant - saying Orcel had told her that Botin's word was ""worth more than a thousand contracts.""
""Cara Ana, I am super happy that you have finally reached an agreement for Andrea to join ... He has told me that your word is worth more than a thousand contracts, and I know that Andrea will give his best to deliver what you need. You know I am backing him up 150% in this change... thanks for your trust. Regards, Clara.""
Sept. 24, message from Clara Batalim-Orcel to Ana Botin
Santander's offer was signed by Santander's General Secretary Jaime Renovales. It would make Orcel the highest-paid bank CEO in the euro-zone – and put his annual pay on par with Botin, who was paid almost 10.6 million euros in 2017. Her pension pot is worth about 46 million euros, according to Santander's annual report.
Santander promised Orcel a sign-on bonus of 17 million euros, annual salary including bonus of 10 million euros, and deferred compensation in the form of shares. But the details on that were vague.
"" Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) expects that you will do your best efforts to ensure that your current employer will continue to pay the long-term incentive plans of which you are a beneficiary under the same conditions as if you were employed. Should your current employer pay only partially your long-term incentives or an amount lower than the one you would have received remaining in the company, we will pay a buyout of a maximum of 35 million gross euros.""
Sept. 24, letter from Santander to Orcel
The next day, Orcel was appointed CEO, with the paperwork still to be finalised. He was invited to join discussions with Santander executives and a month later, made a member of an internal WhatsApp group called Promontorio, court documents show. Santander released the first video, where he was pictured gesticulating in a meeting with Botin and the man he was due to replace, Jose Antonio Alvarez.
Behind the scenes, negotiations on Orcel's pay were intense. Rather than letting the Italian go quickly, his Swiss employer insisted Orcel take a full six-month ""gardening leave,"" the gap top financiers usually take between jobs with a competing institution. This meant he would not be able to join Santander until April 2019.
Financially for Santander this could be good news - it meant part of Orcel's deferred pay would fall due while he was still on UBS's payroll.
Santander figured, therefore, that its costs would be reduced. Its board calculated the reduction at around 13.7 million euros, it said in a later statement.
But Orcel saw it differently. He did not think Santander should deduct pay from his deferred package while he was still a UBS employee. Some of it was a straight bonus for the previous year. And in his view, taking into account that his deferred package at UBS was worth about 55 million euros, he had already agreed to an effective pay cut of roughly 20 million euros, said sources familiar with his thinking.
His last day at UBS was Sept. 30. But by October, things with Santander were going nowhere.
Orcel apologized to Botin, reminding her that UBS had stumped up people's deferred pay in the past, and hinting at a possible legal response.
""I am very sorry to have to put you in this position. It seems like we are begging when it's something that they have done before. If he doesn't move we'll have to take legal steps.""
Oct. 19, 2018 – Message from Orcel to Botin
Botin asked a Santander board member to speak to a counterpart in UBS, who refused to discuss the matter, saying UBS's board was united behind Weber's position, she told Orcel.
""I understand then you must stay until the end gardening period which includes the vesting period for February. Let's talk next week, let's not keep going around on this. Un abrazo.""
Oct. 20, message from Botin to Orcel
The next month, Orcel's figures changed. He told Santander that his original pay calculations had missed a few million euros that were due to him in dividends. This, according to a statement from the bank last July, would add more than 3 million euros to Santander's bill.
""It seems that we have missed a piece.""
Dec. 10, Message from Orcel to a Santander HR executive
""For numbers ... they have gone up.""
Dec. 15, message from Orcel a Santander HR executive
""THE NECESSARY EMPOWERMENT""
On Dec. 17, Santander's remuneration committee met.
It noted ""a degree of discomfort"" at the revised claim from Orcel. It noted as well the fact that UBS was not paying up as much as it said Orcel had predicted, and the ""reputational risk"" of failing to cap his buyout.
Board Secretary Renovales called Orcel - who by then was on a family holiday in Machu Pichu, Peru.
But Orcel said he would only discuss the matter with Ana Botin. He typed her a long message on Dec. 20.
He said any buyout of less than 35 million euros would no longer make sense for him, insisting he had already suffered a significant pay cut from his UBS package. He also asserted his need to ""subordinate"" other executives in the bank, using the image of a cascade system, in which he would be their boss; as chairman, she would have the opportunity to redirect him, as well as the final word.
""I realize that we must motivate and empower the execs and country heads but also subordinate them to the group objectives, to a discipline of execution of our decisions and to the necessary empowerment that I need to have so we can achieve the objectives of the group and my mandate.""
Dec. 20, message from Orcel to Botin from Peru
In the Spanish banking world to date, the executive chairman has been the one with all the power - all the other executives defer to them. Orcel's call for ""the necessary empowerment"" received a curt response.
""We need to stop and see where we are at,"" Botin said, suggesting a meeting in Madrid.
""Andrea. We need to stop and see where we are at. To do this, we need to meet up and have a quiet and down-to-earth conversation, in person. Tuesday, 8th January, in Madrid?""...
Dec. 20 message from Botin to Orcel
Santander's board was uncomfortable with the money, and with UBS not budging, Ana Botin was no longer sure her new right-hand man was putting enough pressure on Weber.
""...On the issue of compensation, Axel is not budging. Basically 0. It is important that you continue to put pressure on your side. Regards. Ana.""
Dec. 20 message from Botin to Orcel
The pair met a day earlier than she first suggested, on Jan. 7, in Santander's headquarters. Botin told Orcel she was withdrawing her offer: The Spanish political climate meant they couldn't meet his pay demands.
He was shocked, believing everything was still under negotiation, documents he submitted in court show. But she said there was no scope for further negotiation, because all the relevant authorities had been informed.
At this point, a source close to him said, he started recording their conversations, a practice which is legal in Spain.
On Jan. 15, Santander issued a statement saying Orcel would not be joining the bank, and its CEO Alvarez would remain in post.
Orcel wrote to Renovales withdrawing his permission for Santander to use the second video, in which he had been filmed accepting Botin's decision. He said he had agreed to film the video on the understanding that he and Santander could resolve the issue in a friendly way, but as this was not possible, he considered it to have been made on a false premise and so withdrew his permission for the bank to use it. ""If you proceed, you do so without any agreement with all the possible consequences of the case,"" he wrote.
""You have destroyed my career, my reputation and have inflicted huge economic loss.""
Jan. 15, Orcel to Renovales
Ana Botin tried to smooth things over. She made various suggestions to Orcel, including possible financial backing to set up his own advisory boutique firm or private equity fund, or a top job in a Santander subsidiary, according to court documents.
""I promise you that there are many ways of doing this; obviously, I will presume that UBS has said no to everything, and I want to know that, but I have companies in Spain where I could appoint you CEO or President tomorrow, listed real estate companies, I mean this cannot be part of (...), in other words, I have many options to compensate you, in areas that you are also qualified for (...).""
Jan. 15, message from Botin to Orcel
But no agreement could be found. The bankers' last meeting was in early February, in a coffee shop in Belgravia, one of London's most affluent areas, with Orcel's wife Clara. They discussed other possible roles that Orcel could take, but he did not accept any, according to two people familiar with the events. Botin's husband, Guillermo Morenés, dropped in on them while he was jogging past.
In May, Orcel sued Santander for the job. The case is due to start being heard in April and could run well beyond a year unless the parties settle.
For its most recent corporate deal, Santander turned to UBS's arch-rival,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN). Santander's shares are around half the price when Botin started.
Orcel remains in London. He has yet to take another post."
1042,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2020 03:13AM ET</span>",China banks borrow from SARS playbook in preparation for market reopening,"SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese financial firms will deploy measures used during the SARS outbreak nearly two decades ago to combat the new virus when markets reopen next week, with traders set to work shifts and sales staff restricted to online-only pitches, sources said.
Banks and brokers will also be paying double next week for the essential staff in financial capital Shanghai who will be working from Monday when markets reopen after the extended Lunar New Year holiday, they said.
China's stock and bond markets are the second-largest in the world, with equities trading in Shanghai averaging 222.9 billion yuan ($32.29 billion) a day in 2019 and the interbank bond market averaging 836 billion yuan, according to the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the central bank, respectively. 
Mainland markets were due to reopen on Friday following a week-long break but the holiday was extended to Monday by central government officials in an effort to limit the spread of the coronavirus that has so far killed more than 200.
Bank compliance rules mean that while staff such as analysts can work from home, traders must work from the office using secure internal systems.
The Shanghai government has told companies not to allow workers back before Feb. 9. Banks, however, are deemed to be providing an essential service and are required to re-open nationwide on Monday, and staff called to work must be paid double on holidays.
China Construction Bank (CCB) (SS:601939), the country's second largest lender, and Hang Seng Bank (HK:0011) are among those planning to split their trading teams and alternate their working days, according to three sources. 
HSBC (L:HSBA) is also considering a shift system for trading teams that have to be in the office, according to one source. 
CCB and HSBC did not respond to requests for comment specifically on their trading plans. Hang Seng bank confirmed it would arrange trading shifts and would tell other staff where possible to work from home. 
The People's Bank of China and the Shanghai Stock Exchange did not respond immediately to a request for comment due to the holiday.
China's new virus belongs to the same coronavirus family as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which also originated in China, and killed nearly 800 people globally in 2002 and 2003. 
A fund manager at the investment arm of the People's Insurance Company (Group) of China (SS:601319) said the virus wouldn't deter people from trading when the market opens. 
""People in the market are eager to trade,"" he said. ""It's about money. You're disadvantaged if others trade but you don't.""
China Asset Management Co Ltd said its fund managers are required to work from the office to meet compliance rules. One member of its marketing team said the company would use online marketing rather than physical roadshows to promote new products in the near-term.

""Even if you want to meet investors in flesh, they don't necessarily want to meet you,"" he said.

In November, the engineering company warned that revenue would be lower, although it did not mention by how much. It believed at the time that margins would remain at same levels in the second half of the year.
""With Boeing's temporary halt in production, the assumptions around reduced production rates and the slower ramp up, the board currently expects aerospace revenue in 2020 to be around 20% below 2019 levels, before returning to growth in 2021,"" Senior said in a statement.
The company has been in talks with several customers, who are exposed to the MAX program, as each customer may have different needs depending on inventory levels and other factors, it said.
However, it said group revenue is expected to be in line with expectations and adjusted earnings per share to be ahead of forecast due to one-off benefits from lower costs."

The investigation also followed the completion of an independent forensic review commissioned by M&C's board, the company said.
An accounting review started in August had found several units of the company's UK business overstating income and receivables and M&C had said it would restructure its UK operations.
Since then, M&C has seen its co-founder Maurice Saatchi step down from the board and has issued two profit warnings.
The advertising agency, founded in 1995 by brothers and advertising moguls Maurice and Charles Saatchi after they were ousted from Saatchi & Saatchi, said it would co-operate with the Financial Conduct Authority.
The company has started a process to reconstruct its board with new independent directors, with a mandate to conduct a full review of all aspects of its governance.
The original Saatchi business, led by the Saatchi brothers, made a name for itself with its ""Labour isn't working"" campaign poster for Margaret Thatcher showing a queue of people snaking out from an unemployment office and disappearing into the distance.
M&C Saatchi has created advertising campaigns for a number of Conservative elections including the ""demon eyes"" advertisements that ran in 1997 showing Tony Blair with glowing red eyes."
1045,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 31, 2020 02:36AM ET</span>",Stocks - Europe Seen Lower Amid Economic and Virus Concerns,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are set to open lower Friday as weak economic numbers out of France and Germany add to concerns about the coronavirus, whose death toll topped 200 overnight.
At 02:20 ET (0720 GMT), the DAX futures contract traded 62 points, or 0.5% lower. France's CAC 40 futures were down 6 points, or 0.1%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 20 points, or 0.3%. Futures on the pan-eurozone index, the Euro Stoxx 50, dropped 6 points, or 0.2%.
The French economy, the euro zone’s second largest, unexpectedly contracted in the final quarter of last year. Gross domestic product dropped 0.1% from the previous three months, when it grew 0.3%. Meanwhile in Germany, the region's largest economy, the news wasn’t healthy either. Its retail sales slumped 3.3% on the month in December, after jumping by 1.6% in November.
The nationwide death toll in China's coronavirus outbreak has risen to 213, with nearly 10,000 infected, according to official figures released on Friday.
The extent of the outbreak has prompted the World Health Organization to declare the coronavirus a global health emergency, but it also backed China's efforts to contain the outbreak, calming fears of a global pandemic.
""I have seen the capacity and I believe (China) will control this outbreak as soon as possible,"" said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, on the heels of the global health emergency declaration.
The WHO has money set aside for these kinds of emergencies, but additional funding may now be secured to treat and prevent the spread of the virus. The decision is also likely to result in a more coordinated response.
This all comes on the day that the U.K. leaves the European Union after 47 years, an event whose significance is admittedly more emotional than economic in the near term. 
Turning to corporate news, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) posted bumper numbers for the fourth quarter late Thursday, as the e-commerce giant’s sales soared over the Christmas season, rising 21% from the previous year. Its share price jumped more than 10% in after-hours trade.
The confidence of the WHO that the outbreak of the deadly coronavirus can be dealt with also helped the oil market rebound from three-month lows.

The Japanese industrial conglomerate is realigning its group portfolio as the government has pointed to corporate governance issues regarding dual listings of parents and subsidiaries.
Hitachi will offer 8,000 yen a share for the firm, in which it now owns a stake of 51.73%. Shares of Hitachi High-Technologies closed at 7,920 yen on Friday before the news.
The tender offer will run from Feb. 17 through April 6.
Hitachi said the takeover would benefit the unit's industrial equipment business by stirring in the group's knowhow in digital technologies.
Hitachi High-Technologies said in a statement that its board approved the takeover and recommended its shareholders tender their shares to Hitachi.
Hitachi has been among the most aggressive of Japan's conglomerates in reorganizing.

Fourteen provinces and cities have said businesses need not start operations until at least the second week of February. They accounted for almost 69% of China’s gross domestic product in 2019, according to Bloomberg calculations.
All the key eastern manufacturing provinces have extended the holiday.

Henan in central China, which has a large Foxconn plant making iPhones, also announced the extended break.
The extended holidays come on top of other measures including quarantining whole cities that are set to disrupt supply chains and logistics, prompting economists to expect that this virus will deal a more severe blow to China’s﻿ economy in the near term than the effect of the SARS outbreak in 2003.

1050,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2020 01:21AM ET</span>",Indian investors eschew equity funds as economy falters,"By Patturaja Murugaboopathy and Chandini Monnappa
(Reuters) - Indian retail and institutional investors shied away from domestic equity markets last year as a slowing economy ate into stock valuations and earnings. Their purchases of equity mutual funds in 2019 were the lowest in three years.
Data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) showed local investors bought a net 712.7 billion rupees ($10.03 billion) in equity funds last year, a 36% fall from 2018, and the lowest net purchase since 2016.
(GRAPHIC: Domestic flows - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1626/1601/domestic%20flows1.jpg)
The drop in domestic investment was due to worries over the economy which is forecast to grow at its slowest pace in 11 years in the current fiscal year ending March, analysts said.
""The economy is slowing down and earnings are not coming. When investors' confidence on the overall economy goes low and they are not seeing returns on their investments in the past, generally the pace of flows slows down,"" said Akhil Chaturvedi, head of sales at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Company.
Purchases of mutual funds by domestic investors have traditionally been a support for the Indian stock market, particularly in recent years as concerns over the country's accelerating consumer prices, rising global yields and a falling rupee caused overseas investments to turn fickle.
Foreigners made cumulative purchases of 2.97 trillion rupees worth of Indian stocks in the last five years, less than the 3.5 trillion rupees bought by domestic investors, data from Refinitiv Eikon and Central Depository Services Ltd showed.
Investors who normally conduct large transactions in equity mutual funds have been taking out their money in recent months, said Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities Ltd.
The redeemed money ""is instead being used to buy debt products or used for individual business needs,"" he said.
The AMFI data showed debt funds witnessed an inflow of 696.9 billion rupees last year, compared with outflows worth 349.9 billion rupees in 2018.
India's NSE Nifty 50 index (NSEI) has fallen more than 1% so far this year, however, some analysts said government reforms and lower interest rates could lift the market.
The Nifty index gained 12% last year, helped by a rally after the government cut the corporate tax rate in September.
The government is likely to cut tax on long-term capital gains from equity investments in it next budget, in an attempt to boost economic growth, Reuters reported in December.
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the budget for the 2020/21 fiscal year on Feb. 1.
""Going forward, the pace of flows will be a function of the revival of the economy, markets sustaining their positive momentum, and confidence in the market over the next one or two years,"" said Motilal Oswal's Chaturvedi.

1054,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2020 12:26AM ET</span>",China car sector to take hefty first quarter hit from virus but 2020 outlook not necessarily grim,"By Yilei Sun and Norihiko Shirouzu
SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - The new coronavirus epidemic is likely to wreak havoc on China auto sales and production in the first quarter, but it is too early to push panic buttons as ground could be made up later in the year, industry executives said.
Showroom traffic is expected to be sparse when extended Lunar New Year holidays end as much of the population is steering clear of public spaces, while output is set to plunge in the short-term.
That is particularly true of Hubei province, the center of the outbreak, a major automotive industrial hub that accounts for nearly 9% of China's vehicle production and home to factories for many car makers including  Dongfeng Motor Group  (HK:0489) and its partners Honda Motor (T:7267),  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) and PSA (PA:PEUP).
""We expect (China) vehicle production to decline 3% for the full year, with production down 15% in the first quarter, including the extended new year shutdown,"" Joseph Massaro, CFO for auto technology supplier Aptiv (N:APTV), told an earnings conference call.
But he said delayed production could be made up in the second quarter. ""We don't view this as a full year issue at the moment.""
Seeking to rein in the epidemic, which has killed more than 200 people with nearly 9,700 confirmed cases of infection in China, authorities have extended Lunar New Year holidays by three days to Feb. 2 although many areas and companies are telling workers not to come back before Feb. 10.
Prior to the outbreak, forecasts for the world's largest auto market this year had ranged from mild sales growth to small declines after two painful years of contraction due to a slowing economy, the U.S.-China trade war and the chaotic introduction of new emission rules.
Cui Dongshu, secretary general at the China Passenger Car Association, said his prediction for industry-wide sales growth of 1% this year now ""under some pressure"".
The holiday extension has discouraged dealers from ordering new cars from manufacturers at the end of the month as is their usual practice, virtually guaranteeing a decline in wholesale auto sales figures for January.
""Although sales volumes in the first three weeks of January were okay, there was no 'sales sprint' at the end of the month. So it is inevitable that we will see a significant sales drop,"" Cui said in a blog post.
The big unknown is, however, just how far the outbreak, which authorities have said they expect to peak in February, will ravage Chinese consumer spending.
Industry officials and analysts agree car sales will be hit in the short-term but also say the impact might not be too bad over the whole year.
The outbreak could even change the mindset of the Chinese consumer towards car ownership, given that many are suffering in areas where public transport has been suspended, said Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consultancy AutoForesight.
""It is hard to predict its impact in the longer term. Customers who do not have their own car might realize they need one which might help sales this year,"" he said.
Automakers with plants in Hubei, particularly in its capital Wuhan, which has seen its transport links cut off as part of a lock down to curb the virus, will have the most work to do in rejigging production plans. Production delays can often be made up later with extra shifts on weekends and at night.
Honda, which has three assembly plants in Wuhan with Dongfeng, said it was assessing how transport disruptions were affecting the supply of parts and that no decision had been made on when its factories will restart.
PSA's venture with Dongfeng said in a statement it will extend the Lunar New Year holidays for its workers but has not decided on a precise date. 
Renault plans to adjust its Wuhan production plans in line with guidance from local authorities, a company representative said. A Dongfeng representative said the company's decision on when to resume work will depend on the situation of the virus outbreak."

WASHINGTON/LONDON (Reuters) - The United States will likely lift sanctions within days on units of Chinese tanker company COSCO that Washington accused of transporting Iranian oil, two industry sources said.
A source with a major Chinese oil company said they had received indications that COSCO had been taken off the U.S. sanctions list. The Chinese energy industry was waiting for official communications from Washington, the source said.
Another energy industry source in London said that Washington had indicated it would soon lift the sanctions.
The U.S. Treasury Department declined comment. The State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Zhang Zheng, a Shanghai-based investor relations manager at COSCO Shipping Energy Transportation Co Ltd (SS:600026), parent of COSCO Shipping Tanker Dalian, said the company has yet to be informed of any change in its sanctions status.
""The company will make the necessary announcement as and when there are big developments,"" Zhang said.
The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump blacklisted the Dalian units of COSCO on Sept. 25 in a move that pushed global freight costs to record highs and disrupted shipping markets.
The Dalian COSCO units only have about 40 tankers, but Washington's move led to confusion about whether sanctions applied to the parent company's fleet of more than 1,000 ships.
The Treasury Department had twice issued waivers to allow companies to wind down dealings with the COSCO units, the latest of which is set to expire on Feb. 4, but shipping markets were still unnerved.
The removal of sanctions will be bearish for tanker freight rates globally, with more than 25 very large crude carriers (VLCCs) owned by COSCO Dalian having been out of the market for the past three months, said Anoop Singh, head of tanker research in Asia at Braemar ACM Shipbroking.
""Their absence was key to the soaring freight rates seen in Q4 and early January,"" he said.
China is the lone major importer of Iranian oil despite Trump's ""maximum pressure"" campaign on Tehran that includes cutting Iran's oil revenue to zero. Trump began re-imposing sanctions on Iran's vital oil exports after he unilaterally pulled the United States from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018.
It was unclear whether any lifting of the sanctions would mean that China or COSCO had agreed to the Trump administration's urgings to stop taking Iranian oil.
Chinese customs data showed on Friday that China took in 14.77 million tonnes, or 295,400 barrels per day, of Iranian oil in 2019, about half the imports of 2018.
Most of the oil likely went into Chinese government stockpiles, according to Refinitiv Research.
Tensions between Washington and Beijing are thawing amid the signing of an initial trade deal this month, defusing an 18-month trade war that hurt global growth.
A top Chinese official had raised the COSCO issue in the trade talks, said one source who advises COSCO and is familiar with the Chinese government's position.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Fox News earlier in January that he met with Chinese officials to talk about purchases of Iranian oil.
""They've cut off all of the state companies from buying oil, and we're working closely with them to make sure that they cease all additional oil activities,"" Mnuchin said.
Mnuchin said last week he expects to begin negotiations on a so-called Phase 2 trade deal soon, with both countries on the same page."

Investing.com – Gaming Company Nintendo Co Ltd (T:7974) saw its shares slumping 4.7% on Friday in Asia after CEO Shuntaro Furukawa said there is no plans to launch a new Switch model in 2020. 
Reuters’ tech reporter Sam Nussey, who attended a briefing in Tokyo, tweeted out Furukawa's words on a new Switch model. The news contradicted previous reports that suggested a Switch Pro was set to launch this year.
Markets were expecting the new Switch model to be equipped with 4K support and new cartridges. Nintendo upgraded its Switch sales forecast for the year ending March to 19.5 million units on Thursday.The company also reported operating income of 168.7 billion yen ($1.5 billion) in the three months ended December, but that underwhelmed versus the 175.4 billion yen average projection."
1057,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2020 11:01PM ET</span>",Nintendo CEO says no new Switch model this year,"By Sam Nussey
TOKYO (Reuters) - Nintendo Co Ltd (T:7974) CEO Shuntaro Furukawa said on Friday the gaming company has no plans to launch a fresh Switch model this year, dampening rumors it will offer an upgraded version of the hit device.
Nintendo launched a handheld-only version of its console in September, driving demand for the Switch through the year-end shopping season.
The Kyoto-based company has long been rumored to be preparing an upgraded version of the hybrid home-portable Switch as it nears the end of its third year in the market.
The company's shares were trading down nearly 5% in Tokyo, their lowest since early November. The benchmark index was up 1.4%.
Furukawa's comments came a day after the company upgraded its Switch sales forecast for the year ending March to 19.5 million units from an earlier outlook of 18 million units, with the new number seen as conservative by many analysts.
Nintendo has already sold 17.7 million units in the nine months ended December, taking total Switch sales to more than 52 million units, with the launch of an Animal Crossing title in late March likely to help boost sales.
Mobile games remain a small proportion of Nintendo's sales and are slow to come to the market with little of the aggressive in-game monetization often found in titles from rivals.
The mobile business is fulfilling the function of increasing user interaction with Nintendo's roster of characters, Furukawa said, using language that leaves some investors concerned that this is a greater priority than increasing sales.
""We do not know how Nintendo sees this business. Does it want to continue? There is zero visibility,"" wrote Jefferies analyst Atul Goyal of the mobile business in a note ahead of the briefing."

CHICAGO (Reuters) - American Airlines Holdings Inc (O:AAL) and its mechanics union announced tentative joint collective bargaining agreements on Thursday covering five maintenance and fleet service groups after more than four years of often bitter negotiations.
The agreements are worth $4.2 billion and offer more than 30,000 employees industry-leading wages, benefits, work rules, job security and retirement income, the union, the TWU-IAM Association, said on its website. They are still subject to ratification by union members.
American's chief executive, Doug Parker, said in a statement that the maintenance and fleet service employees ""deserve contracts that include meaningful improvements in pay, quality of life and job protections.""
""The tentative agreements deliver on all of these — and more,"" Parker said.
Parker has been under pressure to reach contract deals with the airline's pilots, flight attendants and mechanics. The talks with mechanics were acrimonious at times, with the airline filing a lawsuit against the union in May accusing it of staging illegal slowdowns after stalled contract negotiations before a federal mediator.
The union denied the accusations in court, and the parties returned to federal mediation in September.
One major sticking point had been a push by American to outsource future maintenance work, something the union said will be protected under the new agreements.
With the mechanics' deal under way, American can now turn its full attention to negotiations with its pilots and flight attendants. Talks with those two groups began at the start of 2019.
Hundreds of members of the Allied Pilots Association (APA), which represents 15,000 American Airlines pilots, picketed at the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport on Wednesday, expressing their frustration at the lack of a new contract.
In an escalation of tension, the pilots union filed a lawsuit against American on Thursday, demanding that the airline stop flights to China as health officials declare a global emergency over the rapidly spreading coronavirus.

American on Wednesday said it would suspend flights from Los Angeles to Beijing and Shanghai from Feb. 9 to March 27, but it is still flying to China from Dallas.

Fears about the impact of the new coronavirus on Taiwan's top trading partner prompted Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen on Thursday to say the government would act to stabilize the stock and foreign exchange markets.
Some 40% of Taiwan exports go to China, meaning it is vulnerable to any slowdown in the Chinese economy due to the spread of the coronavirus. More than 200 people in China have died, and the World Health Organization has declared a global emergency.
Taiwan's main stock index (TWII) was up 0.50% at 10.30 a.m. (0230 GMT), off earlier highs.
Su said the fund can meet at any time to react to market turbulence, though described market fundamentals as sound.
""If there are large outflow from foreign investors which cause disorder in the financial markets then the National Stabilisation Fund will hold an ad hoc meeting. It's on stand-by for any time,"" he said.
Taiwan's economy is also on good footing, Su added, pointing to previous government expectations of 2.72% growth this year and Taiwanese investment returning to the island from China, a trend Taipei has encouraged amid the China-U.S. trade war.
The fund will continue to play close attention to movements in both the stock and foreign exchange markets, Su said, calling on investors not to be overly concerned by recent market fluctuations.
On Thursday, Tsai said the government will look at helping companies who have been affected, including in the tourism and travel industry, and may consider whether a special budget is needed depending on how the virus situation develops.
Analysts at ANZ this week named Taiwan and Vietnam as the two economies most exposed to potential impacts on growth and trade from the virus outbreak.
Taiwan has so far reported nine cases of the virus, and has taken a series of strong measures to prevent its spread, including stopping most Chinese visitors from coming to the island."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A top official at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday defended an agency shareholder voting proposal amid ""misconception"" received from the SEC's public consultation process over new limits to vote on thorny issues like climate change disclosure and executive pay. 
SEC Commissioner Elad Roisman, the lead commissioner on the agency's long-awaited proxy proposal that seeks to change how investors hold companies accountable, said that he is ""open to changing his mind"" on the direction of the corporate governance measure, but after addressing what he sees as unhelpful comments. 
""I have seen many generalities, recycled comment letters...suggesting dissatisfaction based entirely on misinformation,"" Roisman, the Republican-appointed commissioner, told a law school audience in Washington.
Some of the so-called misconceptions included the view that the SEC is ""suppressing shareholder votes"" and that the agency's rules may ""compromise the independence of proxy firms,"" Roisman said.
Roisman said it is a myth to say the agency's effort on proxy modernization agenda is driven by corporate interests.
""No one commenter or group of market participants dictates the agency's agenda or approach to an issue. We receive input from and listened to the concerns of all market participants and the public,"" Roisman said.
The SEC official's Thursday comments come after the agency voted in November 2019 to end shareholder proposals that appear on corporate ballots with diminishing levels of support.
Democrat Commissioner Rob Jackson said on Thursday: ""Our proposals in this area are just that—proposals—and Commissioner Roisman’s commitment to continued deep, thoughtful engagement on these difficult policy questions is in the best tradition of the SEC and shows how important the market’s input will be to any final rules in this area.""
The proposal, which was subject to a period of public consultation, also required proxy adviser firms to give companies two chances to review their recommendations before they are sent to shareholders.
Industry groups, like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, praised the SEC's move to propose rules in this space.
Earlier in August, the SEC issued a related but separate guidance that aimed to clarify how investors and firms that vote on their behalf should cast their ballots in corporate elections.
Proxy adviser ISS said it worried that this related measure may diminish investors' voting rights and constrain shareholders' ability to hold corporations accountable.
""I have aimed to dispel myths...and I remain hopeful that, as we progress through the comment period, we will receive feedback on the specifics of the proposals which will help us to determine how--not if--to move forward,"" Roisman said.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. farm bankruptcy rates jumped 20% in 2019 - to an eight-year high - as financial woes in the U.S. agricultural economy continued in spite of massive federal bail-out funding, according to federal court data. 
According to data released this week by the United States Courts, family farmers filed 595 Chapter 12 bankruptcies in 2019, up from 498 filings a year earlier. The data also shows that such filings - known as ""family farmer"" bankruptcies - have steadily increased every year for the past five years.
Farmers across the nation also have retired or sold their farms because of the financial strains, changing the face of Midwestern towns and concentrating the business in fewer hands.
""I just had a farmer contact me last week, telling me he can't get financing for his inputs this year and he doesn't know what to do,"" said Charles E. Covey, a bankruptcy attorney based in Peoria, Illinois.
Chapter 12 is a part of the federal bankruptcy code that is designed for family farmers and fishermen to restructure their debts. It was created during the 1980s farm crisis as a simple court procedure to let family farmers keep operating while working out a plan to repay lenders.
The increase in cases had been somewhat expected, bankruptcy experts and agricultural economists said, as farmers face trade battles, ever-mounting farm debt, prolonged low commodity prices, volatile weather patterns and a fatal pig disease that has decimated China's herd.
Even billions of dollars spent over the past two years in government agricultural assistance has not stemmed the bleeding.
Nearly one-third of projected U.S. net farm income in 2019 came from government aid and taxpayer-subsidized commodity insurance payments, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The court data indicates those supports did help prevent a more serious economic fallout, said John Newton, chief economist for the American Farm Bureau Federation.
Some of the biggest bankruptcy rate increases were seen in regions, such as apple growers in the Pacific Northwest, that did not receive much or any of the latest round of trade aid from the Trump administration.

The bankruptcy data ""signals that things have not turned around,"" said John Newton, chief economist for the American Farm Bureau Federation. ""We still have supply and demand uncertainty. If we see prolonged low prices, I wouldn't expect this trend to slow down.""

WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - Directors of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc settled a shareholder lawsuit over the company's 2016 acquisition of SolarCity Corp, leaving Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk as the lone defendant facing claims that Tesla paid $2.6 billion for a worthless solar energy system installer, according to court documents.
The $60 million settlement comes as a 10-day trial is scheduled to start on March 16 in Delaware in which shareholders seek $2.6 billion in damages, the entire cost of the SolarCity deal.
A lawyer for Musk and a spokesman for Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Tesla shareholders have alleged Musk breached his fiduciary duties, squandered Tesla's assets and unjustly enriched himself by pushing to buy the money-losing solar company in which he was the biggest investor.
The settlement covered five current directors: Robyn Denholm, Ira Ehrenpreis, Antonio Gracias, Stephen Jurvetson and Kimbal Musk. Brad Buss, who was a director at the time of the SolarCity deal, was also part of the settlement, which was paid from insurance policies, according to court documents.
""Plaintiffs probably think they have a cleaner shot on the merits if the only issues they have to raise are with Elon Musk and Elon Musk's actions,"" said Brian Quinn, a professor at Boston College Law School.
The case was brought in the Court of Chancery in Delaware, where Tesla is incorporated, by an individual investor and five investment funds.
Tesla said in a statement to Reuters in September the allegations were ""based on the claims of plaintiff's lawyers looking for a payday, and are not representative of our shareholders.""
The suit represents another legal headache for Musk, who in the past two years has settled a lawsuit by securities regulators over his use of Twitter and won a defamation trial brought by a British cave explorer.
Musk and the Tesla board also are scheduled to defend Musk's pay package at a trial in Delaware next year.
At the heart of the current case are allegations that Musk and the other board members did not fully disclose the depth of SolarCity's problems, or their own conflicts.
SolarCity was founded in 2006 by Musk and his cousins, Lyndon Rive and Peter Rive, who were the company's CEO and chief technology officer as well as directors. Musk was SolarCity's chairman and largest shareholder, and five of Tesla's directors were direct or indirect owners of SolarCity stock.
Entering 2016, SolarCity's stock was on a sharp downward trajectory and the company was slashing its workforce and bleeding cash.
Tesla touted synergies of combining the companies in the all-stock deal, which was approved by Tesla shareholders.
After the deal closed, Tesla slashed its solar sales force and ended a solar marketing deal with  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD). Quarterly solar installations plummeted and are well below levels SolarCity enjoyed in its heyday.
Tesla has said Musk's involvement in deal discussions and all other material information were accurately described to shareholders in public filings before the deal closed.
On Wednesday, Tesla reported its second straight quarterly profit, sending its stock surging to an all-time high."

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) on Thursday posted holiday quarter results well above expectations as the expansion of its one-day shipping program came under budget and membership in its Prime loyalty club notched a 50% rise in two years.
Shares soared as much as 13% in after-hours trade, putting the online retailer back in the $1 trillion market capitalization club. If the share gain holds on Friday, it will be the biggest daily jump for Amazon since October 2017.
Amazon also forecast operating income of up to $4.2 billion in the current quarter, down from $4.4 billion the year prior. Still, that appeared to assuage investor concerns about Amazon's continued spending on fast delivery, which could have erased windfalls from e-commerce, advertising and cloud computing sales.
""We’re past the worst in terms of the margin pressure from the one-day shipping initiative,"" said Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell. That and the ""massively overstated"" concerns about cloud competition rebutted some of the biggest arguments against buying the stock, he said.
Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky told reporters that additional investment in one-day shipping came slightly under the $1.5 billion the company had forecast for the fourth quarter, despite more customer orders. Extra costs in the current period will be about $1 billion for the delivery effort, he said.
Olsavsky added that spending on video would rise going forward, but the company was still determining its overall level of investment for 2020.
Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, said in a statement that the world's biggest online retailer now has more than 150 million paid members in its loyalty club Prime, a 50% increase from its last disclosure in April 2018.
Subscribers keep returning to Amazon to benefit from perks like fast delivery, television and music streaming. Its suite of voice-controlled Echo speakers has prompted still more engagement from customers, and grocery orders more than doubled in the holiday quarter in a vote of confidence for Amazon's 2017 bet to buy Whole Foods Market.
This formula has helped make Bezos the richest person in the world.
Amazon is hoping that cutting delivery times to one day for Prime members will let it outmaneuver rivals such as Walmart Inc (N:WMT) that have marketed two-day shipping without subscription fees. The company made progress in the holiday season, reporting that it quadrupled one-day and same-day deliveries over the year-ago quarter.
Revenue from subscription fees grew 32% to $5.2 billion for the quarter ended Dec. 31, Amazon said, as more shoppers signed up for Prime than in any period prior.
WATCHING CORONAVIRUS
Net sales rose 21% to $87.4 billion while net income rose 8% to $3.3 billion - each over $1 billion more than analysts had expected, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The profit rise reflects the evolving nature of Amazon's business. The company has been moving away from low-margin retail toward a marketplace model where it takes lucrative fees for shipping and advertising the products of other merchants on its platform.
This has helped weather massive spending at Amazon, a company that has long passed up short-term results in favor of bets that could reap it future profit.
For instance, faster delivery has meant a surge in hiring and related costs. The company said its full-time and part-time headcount rose 23% to 798,000 in the quarter, as it expanded both fulfillment and corporate software roles.
Expenses similarly grew as the company moved inventory closer to customers and built out its last-mile delivery network, which now handles the biggest share of Amazon-ordered packages in the United States. Amazon said worldwide shipping costs rose 43% to $12.9 billion.
Amazon Web Services (AWS) also has seen infrastructure and marketing costs rise. The unit responsible for selling data storage and computing power in the cloud lost out to  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) in a high-profile deal last quarter to sell technology to the U.S. Department of Defense, in what could have netted the company $10 billion over a decade. Amazon is contesting the contract decision.
Microsoft on Wednesday reported a 62% quarterly rise in sales for its Azure cloud computing service. Yet Amazon posted better results than feared, growing revenue 34% to $9.95 billion, similar to its third-quarter increase.
""This is important because it ends six quarters of measurable decline in AWS growth, reassuring investors that the segment has signs of stability,"" Gene Munster, managing partner at Loup Ventures, said in a research note.
Amazon's international business also narrowed losses to $617 million in the fourth quarter. The company has less exposure to China than Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and other technology industry peers, which may help it weather economic uncertainty surrounding the outbreak of the coronavirus.
Olsavsky said Amazon is watching the situation very carefully and is starting to put China travel restrictions on employees. The company considers China to be a far less strategic market than India, which CEO Bezos visited earlier this month partly to announce a new $1 billion investment in the country.

1067,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2020 07:29PM ET</span>","EA's tepid forecast overshadows quarterly beat, shares slip","(Reuters) -  Electronic Arts Inc  (NASDAQ:EA) forecast fourth-quarter adjusted revenue below analysts' estimates, weighed down by the delayed launch of its basketball title ""NBA Live"", while its ""Apex Legends"" battles ""Fortnite"" and ""PUBG"" to attract young gamers.
Shares of the Redwood, California-based company fell about 2% after the bell on Thursday. 
EA is working with a partner in China to bring its battle-royale title ""Apex Legends"" to PC and mobile in the country, Chief Financial Officer Blake Jorgensen told Reuters. 
Earlier in 2019, EA revealed plans to launch the title, which had attracted 70 million players as of October, in China and also on mobile.
""The biggest unknown is how long does it take to get approval in China,"" Jorgensen added. 
China, which stopped approving the monetization of new video game titles in March 2018, resumed processing applications in December that year, with a huge backlog of games awaiting approval.
The videogame publisher behind franchises like ""FIFA"" and ""Battlefield"" said it expects current-quarter adjusted revenue to be about $1.15 billion, below analysts' expectations of $1.20 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
The tepid forecast comes at a time when the dominance of console-based game franchises, including rivals Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) and Take-Two (NASDAQ:TTWO) Interactive Software Inc, is being threatened by mobile-based, free-to-play games with engaging formats.
EA has pushed back the release of ""NBA Live"" last quarter to coincide with the launch of new gaming consoles from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Sony at the end of 2020. 
The strong launch of ""Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order"" during the crucial holiday season helped the company beat third-quarter adjusted revenue estimates.
The title, released in November, climbed its way to become the second best-selling game of December, according to data from research firm NPD.
Revenue from live services, the largest chunk of its sales, rose 41% to $677 million. The company expects growth for this unit to accelerate in fiscal 2022, led by a new Battlefield title. 
EA raised its full-year adjusted revenue forecast to $5.15 billion from $5.13 billion, but was below analysts' expectations of $5.21 billion.
On an adjusted basis, the company's revenue jumped 22.9% to $1.98 billion, beating the analysts' expectation of $1.97 billion.

Net income for the third quarter ended Dec. 31 rose to $346 million, or $1.18 per share, from $262 million, 86 cents per share, a year earlier.

1068,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 30, 2020 07:28PM ET</span>",Third Point Gains 17% in 2019 After Betting on Soup and Sony,"(Bloomberg) -- Dan Loeb’s Third Point LLC gained 17.1% last year boosted by a wager on Campbell Soup Co.
Third Point was able to overcome skepticism that it could turnaround “what most thought was a moribund and declining business,” the firm said in a letter dated Jan. 30.
Campbell shares rose 50% last year, prompting the hedge fund to take some profits and reduce its position to below 5% of the company. Third Point though remains bullish. The business has been stabilized, and a compelling turnaround is underway, Third Point said.
The fund also made money on Sony Corp (T:6758)., betting on its collection of media assets, including its giant video game platform, Hollywood studio and an underappreciated semiconductor business, the firm said.
The fund was punished by an outsized position in Argentine government debt after failing to predict the politics.
“We realize in hindsight that we took our guard down a bit too much and did a poor job of calculating both the political risk and the reflexive reaction of the dollar-denominated debt to the collapse of the local currency,” the letter said.
Third Point was also hit by its short positions, something many hedge funds struggled with as the S&P 500 Index rallied almost 29% -- its best year since 2013. Hedge funds broadly gained 7.8% in 2019, according to Hedge Fund Research.
The new year has kicked off positively as friendly monetary conditions and a “benign” economic backdrop drove the market higher, Third Point said in the letter. The firm remains wary of a number of factors that could upset this, including the spread of the coronavirus, derailment of trade negotiations with China, and the U.S. election.

(Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp (N:IBM) Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty will hand over the reins to the head of the company's cloud business, as the pioneer tech company continues its efforts to rejuvenate itself.
The company was a late entrant to the business of cloud services, a segment now dominated by Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT), and Rometty, a 40-year  IBM  veteran and one of the highest profile women in U.S. business, bet on acquisitions to cut the lead.
During her eight years at the helm, the Big Blue completed 65 acquisitions, culminating in the $34 billion deal for Red Hat last year - the biggest purchase in its 108-year history - while selling some of its legacy businesses.
She leaves on a recent high note, days after IBM reported its first revenue growth in six quarters, but shares have lost about a quarter in value since she took charge, and the turnaround she began remains a work in progress.
Arvind Krishna, 57, who spearheaded the Red Hat deal, will take over in April.
IBM will likely continue its trajectory under Krishna, but may pursue more small acquisitions in the cloud and analytics space, said Tim Hubbard, assistant professor at the University of Notre Dame and a former IBM consultant.
Shares of the company were up nearly 5% in extended trading.
IBM also said Red Hat CEO James Whitehurst will become its president.
Rometty, 62, will continue as executive chairman and will retire at the end of the year.
""Arvind is the right CEO for the next era at IBM,"" Rometty said in a statement.

1070,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 30, 2020 07:01PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch for Jan. 30,"By Kim Khan 
Investing.com - Here are three things that could rock the market tomorrow.
1. Caterpillar, Exxon and Chevron to Report
Tech makes way for energy and industrials in the earnings spotlight on Friday, with all the day’s reports coming before the opening bell.
Dow component   Caterpillar   (NYSE:CAT) is expected to report a profit of $2.38 per share on revenue of about $13.5 billion, both down from the year-ago period, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
But investors will likely be much more interested in comments about the current quarter and the impact of the coronavirus.
“The virus could hurt the company’s largest customers, including miners and oil and gas producers, making it further difficult for Cat to deal with its rising inventory levels and pass on some price increases, which it has already planned,” Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar said.
But last week Daiwa Securities upgraded the stock to outperform from neutral, with a price target of $165, saying some unfavorable factors from 2019 like tariffs may “subside or reverse.”
Two oil Dow components will also weigh in with results.
Exxon (NYSE:XOM) is seen reporting quarterly earnings of 48 cents per share on revenue of about $64 billion.
  Chevron   (NYSE:CVX) is expected to deliver a profit of $1.45 a share and revenue about $38 billion.
Consumer products giant Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) will also issue numbers.
2. Amazon's Looking at All-Time Highs
Without some major market-moving tech earnings Friday, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) could drive the sector after its blowout earnings report postmarket today.
Shares jumped more than 10% in after-hours trading, pushing the price well above $2,000 and on the way to beating its all-time high of $2039.51 if it can hold gains through tomorrow’s close.
As well as beating on the top and bottom lines, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced it had more than 150 million Amazon Prime customers worldwide.
Growth was led by strong performance in its North American retail business as the rollout of its one-day shipping program boosted sales. 
“In a nutshell, this report should be enough to help Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock to break its sluggish cycle and end its underperformance when compared to other tech giants,” Anwar said.
3. Income, Spending and the Fed’s Inflation Favorite on Tap
Personal income and spending will be of most interest on the economic front Friday.
The Commerce Department will report the December figures at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).
Personal spending is forecast to have risen 0.3% last month, with income posting the same gain, according to economists polled by Investing.com
Both figures would be down from November.
The Federal Reserve’s favorite inflation gauge, personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, also arrives with the numbers.
The core PCE price index is seen posting a rise of 0.1%, with a annual rate of 1.6% for December, the same as the month before.
At 10:00 AM ET, the University of Michigan releases its final figure of January consumer sentiment, which is expected to stay at its preliminary measure of 99.1."
1071,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2020 06:49PM ET</span>","Visa sees muted revenue growth in 2020, shares fall 3%","By C Nivedita
(Reuters) -  Visa Inc  (N:V) on Thursday fell short of analysts' estimate for first-quarter revenue and said revenue this year would be crimped by incentives it provide to banking clients, sending its shares down nearly 3%.
The world's largest payments network said it now expects client incentives as a percentage of revenue to be in the high-end of its forecast range of 22.5% to 23.5% in 2020.
Client incentives are what Visa pays out to their issuing bank partners to increase its total payments volume (TPV), and when a partner renews, Visa's TPV goes up.
In October, Visa said about 15-20% of its TPV is slated to be renewed in the first half of 2020. 
""Since then (the fourth quarter), it has become apparent that renewal activity in fiscal year 2020 could be even higher,"" Chief Financial Officer Vasant Prabhu said on a post-earnings conference call on Thursday.
Total payments volume rose about 8% to $2.36 trillion in the quarter. 
Visa has been spending more on rewards and perks such as airport lounge access, roadside assistance programs and travel insurance which pushed operating expenses up by 14% to $2.04 billion in the first quarter.
Payments processors have also leaned on acquisitions to fend off competition from digital rivals.
Earlier this month, Visa said it would buy fintech startup Plaid for $5.3 billion, as it seeks to expand into the digital economy.
The company's net revenue rose 10% to $6.05 billion in the first quarter, but missed analysts' estimates of $6.08 billion, according to IBES estimates from Refinitiv. 
For the quarter, the company's client incentives rose 20% to $1.75 billion.
The company's net income rose 10% to $3.27 billion, or $1.46 per Class A share.
On an adjusted basis, Visa earned $1.46 per share, in line with analysts' estimate.

Visa shares, which have risen 51% in the past 12 months, were down at $201.85 in extended trading.

(Reuters) -  Amgen Inc  (O:AMGN) on Thursday forecast 2020 earnings well short of current Wall Street estimates, sending shares of the largest U.S. biotechnology company down 3%.
For the full year, the company forecast earnings of $14.85 to $15.60 per share on revenue as high as $25.6 billion. Analysts had estimated 2020 adjusted earnings of $16.14 on revenue of $25.5 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
A company official attributed the difference to lower interest income and Amgen's recently acquired 20.5% stake in China's  BeiGene Ltd  (HK:6160), which is not yet profitable.
For the fourth quarter of last year, Amgen said its sales fell 2% from a year earlier due to competition from lower-cost generic drugs and biosimilars, but share buybacks enabled the company to post a profit that topped Wall Street estimates.
Sales for the quarter totaled $5.88 billion. Total revenue fell 1% to $6.2 billion, which was ahead of the average analyst estimate of $6.06 billion.
Quarterly adjusted earnings per share rose 6% to $3.64, beating the average Wall Street estimate of $3.48.
Net earnings fell 5% to $2.85 per share due to higher operating costs partially offset by a lower share count.
Sales of older drugs such as white blood cell booster Neulasta and kidney drug Sensipar fell sharply due to competition from cheaper versions. Neulasta was down 43% at $665 million and Sensipar sales were off by 76% at $107 million.
Sales of newer drugs like cholesterol fighter Repatha and migraine drug Aimovig rose. Repatha was up by 26% to $200 million, while Aimovig rose 3% to $98 million in the quarter.
Amgen said it bought back around 6% of its outstanding shares last year.

This comes a few months after Levi's opened its largest store in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus epidemic which has killed about 170 people, marring its plans to tap into the city's 11-million strong population.
""It will put a dampener on our growth objectives in the near term,"" Singh told Reuters in an interview.
The flu-like virus has set-off alarm bells across the globe with companies such as  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) closing stores and warning of a financial hit from slowing business in the world's most populous country.
Levi's has also stopped all employee travel in and out of China.
Singh said the coronavirus impact was not baked into the company's full year forecast, but will be quantified when it reports first quarter results in April.
Levi's, which gets about 3% of its revenue from China, forecast 2020 earnings on Thursday above estimates, boosted by demand for women's apparel in its own stores and online.
With foot traffic at malls and department stores shrinking, Levi's has been investing more in its e-commerce business, adding features designed to attract millennial and Gen Z consumers.
A new customization option on Levi's website lets shoppers personalize their pair of jeans with custom prints and patches, helping the near 170-year old company pull in more customers looking to add a personal touch to their denim.

The stock soared nearly 12% in after-hours trading, pushing shares above $2,000.
 
Amazon announced earnings per share of $6.47 on revenue of $87.44 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $4.05 on revenue of $85.97B.

Growth was led by strong performance in its North American retail business as the rollout of its one-day shipping program boosted sales. 
""Today’s report is good enough to address all those concerns that have kept the Amazon’s shares under pressure over the past few months,” Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar said. “Higher spending on expediting shipments have paid off quite handsomely, with strong growth in the company’s e-commerce business. The other big push is coming from the high-margin AWS (cloud) business where Amazon is sustaining a high level of growth.”
“Strong performance for seller services and other services business also gave a boost to Amazon's gross margin, which was recently under pressure by the escalating shipping costs,” Anwar said.
“In a nutshell, this report should be enough to help Amazon stock to break its sluggish cycle and end its underperformance when compared to other tech giants.”

Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud business, generated revenue of $9.95 billion, above estimates of $9.84 billion. The beat in cloud services comes despite concerns that competition from cloud rivals like Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure would dent AWS growth.

""If Amazon is succeeding in expanding its sales, investors shouldn’t worry about costs and a light hit on margins, in our opinion. Amazon's e-commerce business continues to show a blistering growth trajectory and its earnings momentum from AWS and digital advertising remains robust. These strengths make the stock attractive even at a time when cost escalation is temporarily hurting margins,"" said Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar.

Investing.com – Wall Street finished solidly higher Thursday, coming back from a day of mostly sharp losses, after the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a global health emergency, but backed China's efforts to contain the outbreak, calming fears of a global pandemic.
The S&P 500 rose 0.31%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.26% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.43%.
""I have seen the capacity and I believe (China) will control this outbreak as soon as possible,"" said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on the heels of declaring the virus outbreak a global health emergency.
The apparent vote of confidence in China's ability to contain the outbreak calmed contagion fears, which had intensified after the death toll in China rose to 170, with as many as 8,200 cases confirmed so far.
Casino stocks with exposure to China's gambling capital Macau caught a bid, with Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN),   Las Vegas Sands   (NYSE:LVS) and MLCO ended more than 2% higher.
While casino operators in Macau are expected to ""see a significant cash flow impact as a result of the spread of coronavirus, their strong credits profiles will likely shelter them from widespread downgrades,"" Fitch Ratings said.
The swing from lows in the broader market capped a day awash with mixed quarterly results.
Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) reported quarterly revenue that topped estimates as the launch of new products underpinned growth, sending its shares up 3%.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), meanwhile, surged about 10% after the electric automaker topped earnings estimates and pledged to deliver over 500,000 cars for the year, well above consensus of about 475,000.
In tech, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) climbed 2.7% as strong growth in its cloud business boosted sales to record levels, above Wall Street estimates.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) pared some of its losses to end the day down 6% as its earnings beat was overshadowed by worries over slowing revenue and user growth.
But some on Wall Street said weakness in the social media giant is a buying opportunity.
""Healthy user engagement, the ongoing transition to Stories monetization, and focus on other under- monetized properties within the platform (Marketplace, Explore) could add upside to estimates later this year, and we view near-term stock volatility as a buying opportunity,"" Canaccord said in a note."

1085,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2020 04:07PM ET</span>",December bump in oil prices not enough to salvage energy earnings,"By Chuck Mikolajczak
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors hoping a late-2019 rise in oil prices will buoy energy stocks are likely to be disappointed when a raft of companies report results in coming weeks.
Energy stocks were among the S&P 500's worst performers over the last decade, as concerns over an oversupply of oil hurt earnings and share prices.
December saw a brief reversal, as optimism over a U.S.-China trade deal boosted prices for WTI crude by 10% to over $60 a barrel. Rising oil prices helped the energy sector rise more than 6% for December, its best monthly performance since June.
Still, the sector is expected to show a 41.2% decline in earnings growth from a year earlier, according to Refinitiv data.
The relationship between energy stocks and oil prices has been weak over the last few decades: the 90-day correlation between the Select Sector Energy ETF (P:XLE) and WTI crude going back to 1999 stands at 0.49, according to DataTrek Research.
Correlation is measured from minus one to plus one: minus one implies the prices of two assets are moving in opposite directions, while a 1 shows them moving in lockstep.
""History very clearly shows this industry doesn't really move with oil prices,"" said Nicholas Colas, co-founder at DataTrek Research in New York.
Many oil companies are unlikely to fully benefit from the oil price bump because they had curtailed production, said Stewart Glickman, energy analyst at CFRA in New York.
""To the degree that they had spot exposure, yeah that will probably help, but it won’t be a huge impact,"" he said.
In a sign of the sector's challenges, oilfield service company Halliburton (N:HAL) shares are down 31.2% in the past year. The company disclosed a $2.2 billion charge when it announced earnings this month and said in its conference call that U.S. gas prices remain below breakeven levels.
ExxonMobil (N:XOM),  Chevron  (N:CVX) and Phillips 66 (N:PSX) are to report on Friday, with ConocoPhillips (N:COP) due next week.
Some analysts believe underperformance has made the sector attractively valued. The sector is ""cheap on cash flow, cheap on dividend yield, it is cheap on book value,"" said Stephen Massocca, Senior Vice President at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco.
(Graphic: 20-yr Energy sector relative to S&P vs crude, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1609/1584/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
For oil prices to climb much higher, there would have to be a stronger global economy or a supply shock.
""For energy to outperform, typically, you need to have a global economy that is growing at a decent rate, which is not the case,"" said Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute in St. Louis, Missouri.

1088,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2020 03:58PM ET</span>",Pompeo urges EU to exclude 'high-risk suppliers' from 5G networks,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday urged the European Union to exclude ""high-risk"" suppliers from all parts of 5G networks.
The EU on Wednesday followed Britain's example, allowing members to decide what part China's Huawei Technologies can play in its 5G telecoms networks and resisting pressure from Washington for an outright ban.
The United States wants the world to ban Huawei from the West's next-generation 5G networks on fears that its gear could be used by China for spying, allegations which the company has strongly rejected.
EU countries can either restrict or exclude high-risk 5G vendors like Huawei from core parts of their telecoms networks, according to the new guidelines, which seek to address the cybersecurity risks to the bloc's 28 countries at a national and EU level.
Pompeo praised the EU's Network Information Security Cooperation Group recommended measures to mitigate security risks in 5G networks. The group acknowledged suppliers with high risk profiles should face additional restrictions, Pompeo said.
""It is misguided to think that the risks associated with installing equipment from suppliers subject to control by authoritarian regimes with a track record of malign cyber behavior can be mitigated,"" Pompeo said.
Britain granted Huawei a limited role in its 5G mobile network on Tuesday, frustrating an attempt by the United States to exclude the Chinese telecoms giant from the West's next-generation communications.
Huawei is the world's biggest producer of telecoms equipment, competing with Sweden's Ericsson (ST:ERICb) and Finland's Nokia (HE:NOKIA).
The European Union sees 5G as key to boosting economic growth and competing with the United States and China, and its recommendations, agreed by EU members, are that individual countries assess the risks and decide whether to exclude suppliers from core infrastructure, confirming a Reuters report on Jan. 22.
Huawei welcomed the guidelines, describing them as non-biased and fact-based.
The commission said it was ready to bolster the bloc's 5G cybersecurity by using trade defense tools against dumping or foreign subsidies.
Lobbying group ETNO, whose members include Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn), Orange (PA:ORAN) and  Telefonica  (MC:TEF), which all use Huawei equipment, had warned against disproportionate actions which may affect their investments.
EU countries have until April to implement the guidelines and June to report on their progress."

""As a result, some team members will be leaving our bank in the coming months.""
The move is expected to lower the bank's non-interest expense ratio, which measures such expenses as a percentage of revenue.
Other Canadian lenders have also been taking on restructuring charges as they turn to controlling costs to drive earnings growth in what is expected to be a tough year.
During their fourth quarter results, Canada's fourth-largest lender, Bank of Montreal, took a restructuring charge of C$357 million ($268.40 million), which also included some real-estate costs.
The bank cut about 810 jobs, and is targeting a total reduction of 5%, or about 2,300 employees."

The sources said 23 people including the former head of UBS in Italy, Fabio Innocenzi, had been probed, as well as UBS Europe and Sofia SGR. Under Italian laws the two companies can be held responsible for the actions of their employees.
A spokesman for Innocenzi declined to comment. UBS said in a statement it did not comment on ongoing legal proceedings.
Prosecutors have looked in to whether Sofia committed fraud by applying higher-than-average fees to 117 clients and by failing to disclose conflicts of interest on deals that generated losses for customers.
UBS Europe, part of UBS Group AG (S:UBSG), was under investigation because Sofia SGR negotiated its products through the bank.

Investing.com – Las Vegas Sands has come under siege recently as the spread of the coronavirus has turned China's gambling capital Macau into a ghost town, threatening the casino operator's growth. But one analyst sees the weakness as an opportunity to bag a bargain.
""While there could still be some additional downward pressure on LVS and the other Macau-related equities stemming from the outbreak, we continue to believe the issue is transitory,"" said Union Gaming analyst John DeCree.
Earlier this week, the local government in the Chinese territory of Macau introduced measures to limit visitors to the gambling mecca just days after it canceled already-suspended inbound package tours.
The measures are expected to exacerbate the slowdown in arrivals, which fell 80% on Sunday, the third day of the holiday, compared with the same day during last year’s Lunar New Year break, according to the city’s tourism office.
The fall in arrivals has wreaked havoc on the growth of casino operators like Las Vegas Sands as Macau generates more than half of the company's cash flow.
But following a sharp slide recently in Las Vegas Sands, Union Gaming suggested that the casino operator now boasts an attractive valuation as much of the weakness has seemingly been priced into the stock.
""Ultimately, we like the valuation here for LVS given its growth pipeline in both Macau and Singapore and view the near-term issue as a buying opportunity,"" Union Gaming said."

Shares of the social media giant (O:FB) slumped 5.82% after the company warned of slowing growth as its business matured and it reported a surge in quarterly expenses.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the first U.S. incident of person-to-person spread of the virus.
""The question in this case is after it runs its course than what are you left with?"" said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. 
""You are left with yields that have moved lower, earnings that are struggling to deliver and an increasingly widespread view the Fed is going to have to come in and cut rates again this year.""

Earnings expectations have been slowly improving for S&P 500 companies, with Refinitiv data showing a 0.7% rise in fourth-quarter profit, compared with a 0.6% decline estimated at the start of the season. But the growth remains modest with the S&P 500 roughly 2% off its record high.
 Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) gained 2.31% after it beat expectations for quarterly earnings, driven by Azure cloud computing revenue growth.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - As travel and casino stocks reel from concerns over the coronavirus outbreak, some value-focused investors are betting the declines will not last.
British Airways has suspended flights to mainland China and economists have warned of a major impact to the world's second-largest economy, as deaths from the flu-like virus stood at around 170 Thursday. The number of visitors to Macau, the world's largest casino hub, has fallen by 69% since Friday, according to the local government data released this week.
Fund managers say outbreak concerns have only exacerbated pressure on these stocks, which had already been hit by the trade war between the United States and China. Fears of a widening health crisis have sent shares of companies such as Las Vegas Sands Corp and Booking (NASDAQ:BKNG) Holdings Inc down more than 8% since the start of the month. Short interest in both companies is well below their 52-week highs, a sign that fewer investors see deeper declines ahead.
""They really are a slave to headline risk right now,"" said Charles Norton, a co-manager of the Vitium Global Fund. ""We think there's a lot of value here.""
Norton is increasing his position in companies with high exposure to Macau, such as MGM Resorts International due to the rising consumer class in China and infrastructure improvements that will make it easier for mainland Chinese to travel to the region.
Shares of the company are down 7.6% since the start of the year and trade at a forward price to earnings ratio of 21, slightly below that of the broad S&P 500, according to Refinitiv data.
Bryan Engler, a senior equity analyst at Kovitz Investment Group in Chicago, said his firm is bullish on online travel sites such as  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE) Group Inc and Booking Holdings, which have faltered on concerns that worldwide travel will slow yet have strong balance sheets and high returns on capital.
""There's a piece of me that hopes there is a little more volatility. These are the type of businesses we love and we would love to buy them cheaper,"" Engler said.
Eric Marshall, a portfolio manager at Dallas-based Hodges Capital, said that his firm is increasing its position in Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd . Shares of Delta are down 4.7% for the month and trade at a trailing price to earnings ratio of 7.8, about half of that of the S&P 500 as a whole. Norwegian, meanwhile, is down 9.1% for the month and trades at a trailing P/E of 12.6.

1097,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2020 01:32PM ET</span>",U.S. LNG producers fear more price drops as they await China buys under Phase 1 deal,"By Arathy S Nair
HOUSTON (Reuters) - China has restarted talks with U.S. liquefied natural gas marketers to buy more LNG, several industry executives told Reuters, but they are worried that any purchases may come too late to keep natural gas prices from falling further due to a glut of global supply.
China pledged this month to buy an additional $18.5 billion in U.S. energy products this year, but the U.S.-China trade agreement left tariffs in place, including a 25% levy on LNG imports that puts U.S. LNG at a disadvantage, producers said. 
""The U.S. doesn't have a margin that would allow any country to charge 25%"" above global prices, said Michael Smith, chief executive of Freeport LNG, referring to the tariff. Until that tax is removed, ""it's a non-starter,"" he said.
Exports of liquefied natural gas are the fastest growing source of U.S. gas consumption, more than doubling since 2017 largely on Asian demand. Prices have tumbled due to rising global supply, and the glut is expected to grow. This situation will pressure LNG producers to cut output, and adding to hurdles for developers looking to finance multibillion-dollar projects.
The Phase 1 accord between the United States and China has a two-year term, making it harder for buyers and sellers to enter long-term agreements, executives said. Phase 1 should be viewed as a ""ceasefire"" as opposed to an accord, said Jason Feer, head of business intelligence at LNG shipbroker and consultancy Poten & Partners.
LNG buyers in China will avoid long-term U.S. deals as long as there is a chance that the Phase 1 accord lapses without a real end to the trade dispute, he said. They risk having to sell off U.S. purchases or absorb the hefty tariff if the current deal expires without a replacement.
Near-full LNG stocks recently sent fuel prices to a near decade low: $3.43 per million British Thermal Units (BTUs) in Asia and $4 per million BTUs in Europe. U.S. capacity has increased about 22 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) since the start of 2019, and another 17.2 MTPA is projected in 2020.
Chinese state oil firm Sinopec was near an agreement with top U.S. exporter  Cheniere Energy Inc  (A:LNG) when the trade dispute erupted. If Sinopec agrees to terms on a long-term purchase, it could signal new agreements are possible, Smith said. Cheniere and Sinopec are revisiting supply terms in the wake of the Phase 1 deal. 
Cheniere declined to comment. Sinopec did not reply to requests for comment.

Dozens of new LNG processing units are planned for the United States, with a capacity that would have exceeded 2018's worldwide consumption. Many of those projects are unlikely to be built, analysts say.
Currently operating U.S. plants are still boosting capacity. Freeport expects to have 1.5 MTPA in unreserved capacity this summer and up to 3 MTPA by fall, Smith said. It has marketers ready to sell the new supply. 
Rival  Kinder Morgan  Inc (NYSE:KMI) is starting seven additional processing units that would bring its capacity to 2.5 MTPA this year. It began first exports in December. 
""We're cheering for every LNG project to go forward,"" said Langtry Meyer, co-founder of Texas LNG. His company has talked with Chinese state-owned enterprises, electric power producers and trading firms about supporting its proposed 4 MTPA project, he said. 
Since the signing of the trade deal, ""we have seen a flood of inquiries from Chinese companies coming in,"" said Meg Gentle, Tellurian Inc's CEO. ""Some are from companies we have already engaged with previously and some are from companies we have not spoken to before."" 
However, David Lang, a partner at law firm King & Spalding LLC who represents U.S. LNG producers, described the resumption of talks broadly as in early stages.

""Working up a real discussion will take some time,"" he said.

Investing.com – The S&P remained near session lows Thursday as investor sentiment was soured on rising fears over the potential impact of the coronavirus on global growth and weakness in tech stocks, led by a slump in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
The S&P 500 fell 0.70%, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.75% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.53%.
More than 8,200 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed worldwide and the death toll in China rose to 170 individuals, raising fears that a further spread of the virus will weigh on economic growth in China, which makes up about 10% of global growth.
Also, the Centers for Disease Control reported the first person-to-person transmission of the coronavirus in the U.S., which now has six confirmed cases.
Stocks sensitive to growth in China and tourism continue to give up gains. 
Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) fell 1.6%, Booking (NASDAQ:BKNG) slipped 1% and Carnival (NYSE:CCL) fell 4%.
Corporate earnings provided a sliver of respite for stocks, with Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) impressing, but Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) coming under pressure amid worries about slowing growth.
Coca-Cola reported quarterly revenue that topped estimates as the launch of new products underpinned growth, sending its shares up 2%.
Tesla, meanwhile, surged about 10% after the electric automaker topped earnings estimates and pledged to deliver over 500,000 cars for the year, well above consensus of about 475,000.
In tech, Microsoft climbed about 2% as strong growth in its cloud business boosted sales to record levels, above Wall Street estimates.
But gains in tech were kept in check by a plunge in Facebook as the social media giant's beat on the bottom and top lines were overshadowed by a 51% surge in costs and worries about slowing growth as the company ramps up efforts to bolster security on its platforms."

1101,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2020 12:58PM ET</span>",Companies Trump said would create thousands of jobs have failed to deliver,"By Tim McLaughlin
BOSTON (Reuters) - In his first address to the U.S. Congress, President Donald Trump hailed General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Harley-Davidson Inc (NYSE:HOG),  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) and seven other companies as innovators and job creators, predicting they would be among those producing ""tens of thousands of new American jobs"" and investing ""billions and billions of dollars.""
Nearly three years later, with unemployment at the lowest in half a century, that first presidential portfolio has stumbled to fulfill that forecast. While Trump's 10 companies have spent billions on new factories and upgrades, they failed to keep pace with new hires, according to a Reuters analysis of the group's capital expenditures and headcount since 2017.
Collective employment at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, GM, Harley, Intel,  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT), Sprint Corp, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and small biotech Amicus Therapeutics has remained flat at about 2 million workers, the analysis shows. In the same period, total U.S. employment has risen by 4.5%.
(Graphic: Jobs boom? https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1575/1550/Pasted%20Image.jpg) 
Wall Street has not smiled extensively on Trump's selected companies either.
Most of the companies’ total shareholder return has trailed the S&P 500's 47% advance and sector benchmarks since Trump’s February 2017 speech. Only four of the 10 have outperformed the broad benchmark while five have lagged the wider market by 35 points or more, as of Jan. 28.
White House Deputy Press Secretary Judd Deere declined to comment about the individual companies, but noted more Americans are coming off the sidelines and finding work, and U.S. wages and consumer confidence are rising.
""Despite headwinds from severe monetary tightening and a global recession, President Trump's agenda of fair and reciprocal trade, lower taxes and deregulation has created the strongest economy we've ever seen,"" he added.
Still, struggles within the Trump portfolio underscore how the president's economic and immigration policies have produced uneven results as he seeks another term in the White House.
Since he took office, only Fiat Chrysler and defense contractor Lockheed Martin have added a meaningful number of net new workers.
Lockheed's U.S. headcount is up about 15%. Fiat's employment is up about 11%, with some gains coming from broader North American operations. The net gain of jobs at the two companies is about 22,800 since the end of 2016, according to company disclosures.
""What a great brand Jeep is,"" Trump said in a shoutout to Fiat Chrysler's hot-selling vehicle, before signing a tariff agreement with China. 
By contrast, the combined overall U.S. headcount at Ford and GM has declined by about 10,000, or 5%, to 184,000, despite investing billions of dollars in their automotive plants. (For a graphic click https://tmsnrt.rs/315LHzh)
For a broader picture, the U.S. economy has produced an average of 193,000 new jobs per month, over the past three years. But even with the benefit of Trump's 2017 massive corporate tax rate cut, that is 14% less than the 224,000 jobs per month created during the last three years of Barack Obama's administration, according to U.S. Department of Labor figures.
“Trump wins some, loses some when compared to Obama,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at financial research firm Moody's Analytics, referring to various economic indicators like stock market gains (more under Trump), federal budget deficit (less under Obama), fixed mortgage rates (lower under Obama) and household net worth (higher growth rate under Trump).
(Graphic: Obama vs Trump, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1582/1557/Pasted%20Image.jpg) 
But Zandi and four other economists interviewed for this story said Trump sets himself apart with a restrictive immigration policy that is exacerbating labor shortages across jobs that pay low wages and top-end salaries.
“This is going to become a very severe impediment to growth,” Zandi said. “We're used to seeing 200,000 new jobs created every month, but it will be one-fourth of that a few years from now.”
The U.S. labor force has grown at an annual rate of 0.5% in the 10 years since the Great Recession ended. But in the other four recent recoveries, annualized labor force growth was more than doubled, exceeding 1%, according to economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.
Meanwhile, a key plank in Trump's agenda - rebuilding the country's manufacturing base - recently took a hit when the sector fell into its deepest slump in more than a decade.
But there are plenty of bright spots, big and small.
U.S. headcount at defense contractor Lockheed Martin, for example, has surged 15% to about 102,300 employees since the end of 2016 as it seeks full-rate production of its F-35 fighter jet, according to company. 
Lockheed shares have climbed, too, producing a total return of 76% since Trump’s 2017 speech, easily outpacing the S&P 500’s total return of 47% during that time.
Amicus Therapeutics Inc, which Trump hailed for treating rare metabolic disorders, has nearly doubled its U.S. headcount to more than 500 people, according to U.S. Department of Labor disclosures. Its shares are up 39% since Trump's speech, boosting its market value to more than $2 billion. The Nasdaq US Small Cap Biotech Index is up 61% during that time.

SPENDING BILLIONS
In 2018, the Trump portfolio of companies collectively used about $60 billion from their cash flows on capital expenditures to make new products and to remain competitive, according to their financial statements. Intel, for example, plowed $29.6 billion into research and development and capital investments during 2019, up 33% from 2016 levels. It plans to invest more than $7 billion to complete a chip plant in Arizona, one of the largest construction projects in the country.
“We anticipate it will create 3,000 Intel jobs,” company spokeswoman Chelsea Hughes said. Intel's total return is 99% since Trump highlighted the company in his first address to congress.
After a recent surge in its stock price, Intel is beating the 91% total return of the S&P 500 Semiconductor Index. The benchmark includes high-flying rivals like Nvidia Corp, whose shares are up 147% since Trump's address.
Japan’s Softbank Corp is also investing billions of dollars in U.S. startups, and has created thousands of jobs, with help from American venture capital firms and mutual funds.
But as seen by the WeWork saga, and other troubled investments like the dog walking company, Wag Labs Inc, a lot of those jobs could disappear overnight.
Other companies Trump touted that have kept payrolls inline are getting mixed reviews from investors.
Shares of Harley-Davidson have dropped 34% since the president hailed the “magnificent motorcycles” in his first address to congress. Trump's trade tensions, however, have hurt the Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based company, which last year struck a deal to build a smaller motorcycle in a venture with a Chinese company. Harley-Davidson’s latest available headcount of 5,900 is down slightly from 6,000 at the end of 2016, according to company disclosures.
Trump has criticized the company for moving some of its production offshore. Harley Davidson did not return messages seeking comment.
The economists Reuters spoke with applaud the investments, but they say big chunks of capital go toward upgrades and automation, not necessarily net gains in workers.

“There's not a lot of trickle down to the local economy,” said Sarah Low, a University of Missouri-Columbia economics professor who focuses on employment in rural areas.

The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has called a news conference on Friday to present the outcome of the talks this week at its Paris headquarters.
""They are probably going to put out a statement focusing on points of convergence. But there is still huge divergence of views,"" one delegate told Reuters during a break from meeting.
Another delegate concurred, saying that although the Paris meeting would yield a consensus to push ahead, there was little assurance technical details could be hammered out in the coming months.
""It's really a case where the devil is in the details,"" the second delegate said.
Following the green light at the Paris meeting, governments will have to dive into negotiations on issues like specific thresholds for a company's taxable presence in a country and whether to include an opt-in/opt-out mechanism.
The emergence of big tech companies like Amazon Inc (O:AMZN),  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and Alphabet Inc's Google (O:GOOGL) has pushed existing international tax law to the limits, because companies can book profits in low-tax countries like Ireland regardless where their clients are located.
With a number of countries preparing national digital services taxes in reaction, pressure is building to resolve the hugely complex technical issues within a matter of months, possibly as soon as by mid-year.
The delegates said that would overcome differences not only over how to allocate tax rights to governments but whether certain industries like the financial sector should benefit from a carve-out from the future rules. The OECD has proposed that only extractive and commodity companies should be out of the scope of future rules.
The delegates also said that there was widespread opposition to a U.S. proposal to give companies the liberty of deciding whether to operate under existing rules or the future framework.
Meanwhile, many developing countries voiced concern in Paris that the whole process is being rushed because of the pressure to avoid disputes over countries' national digital taxes.
France and the United States agreed a fragile truce last week to set aside a row over France's digital tax until the end of the year to allow time for the redrafting of international tax rules this year."

Southwest shares slid 2.2%, hit by concerns about the coronavirus outbreak along with findings of U.S. Department of Transportation, reported https://www.wsj.com/articles/southwest-flew-millions-on-jets-with-unconfirmed-maintenance-records-government-report-says-11580380201?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=7 by the Wall Street Journal, which also criticized the FAA's oversight of the airline's safety procedures.
""We have communicated our disappointment in the draft audit report to the Office of Inspector General and will continue to communicate any concerns directly with its office,"" Southwest said in a statement. ""Any implication that we would tolerate a relaxing of standards is absolutely unfounded.""
The report said also that in 2019, a Southwest jet smashed both wingtips on a runway while repeatedly trying to land amid gale-force winds.
The report said Southwest flew more than 17 million passengers over two years on planes with unconfirmed maintenance documentation on numerous Boeing 737 planes it had acquired from foreign carriers, the newspaper reported.
Southwest said Thursday that all of the 88 (N:BA) 737 used planes cited in the inspector general's report ""have either completed a comprehensive physical inspection, from nose to tail, or are currently in the inspection phase.""
Southwest added it ""has completed a thorough review of 75 aircraft and we are in the process of inspecting the remaining 13 aircraft which are currently in heavy checks.""
Southwest said some repairs by prior owners ""had been performed but not properly classified by the previous owners due to differences in language and repair criteria."" The FAA said in November inspections of 39 used planes turned up previously undisclosed repairs and incorrectly completed fixes.
An FAA spokesman told Reuters Thursday the agency would respond directly to the inspector general's office. The inspector general is still awaiting the FAA's written response to the draft report and anticipates releasing the report within a few weeks, an official briefed on the matter told Reuters.
The planes were bought between 2013 and 2017 from 16 foreign carriers.

Southwest chief executive Gary Kelly met with Inspector General Calvin Scovel in September at the airline's request as the audit investigation was underway, the official confirmed.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Earnings for S&P 500 (SPX) companies are seen increasing for the fourth quarter over a year earlier, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Earnings for the quarter are now expected to have risen 0.7% from the year-ago quarter, based on results from 193 S&P 500 companies and estimates for the rest.
At the start of the month, analysts had been expecting a 0.3% year-over-year decline in fourth-quarter earnings, per Refinitiv's data. 
Investors have been keeping a close eye on fourth-quarter results following a slight fall in third-quarter earnings, the first year-over-year decline for the S&P 500 since 2016.
Stronger-than-expected results recently from top technology names Microsoft (O:MSFT), Apple (O:AAPL) and Intel (O:INTC) contributed the most to the improvement so far in the fourth-quarter forecast, while Boeing Co's (N:BA) results were a drag, said David Aurelio, senior manager of equity markets research at Refinitiv.
With the fourth-quarter results, major U.S. corporations are closing the books on a lackluster year of profit growth. But bullish investors have been hoping companies can shore up confidence that 2020 will show significant profit improvement in order to keep the stock market's rally going.

1107,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2020 11:47AM ET</span>","Altria takes another $4 billion hit on Juul investment, revises deal terms","By Aishwarya Venugopal
(Reuters) -  Altria Group  Inc (N:MO) took another $4 billion charge on its investment in Juul Labs Inc and said it had reworked its deal terms with the embattled e-cigarette maker, which is facing increased regulatory scrutiny amid a backlash against vaping.
The Marlboro maker said on Thursday the fourth-quarter charge was mainly due to the increased number of legal cases pending against Juul and the expectation that the number would continue to grow.
Overall, Altria has recorded $8.6 billion in impairment charges after it took a 35% stake in Juul for $12.8 billion in December 2018. Those charges brought down the value of its investment to $4.2 billion as of the end of 2019, Altria said.
""I'm highly disappointed in the financial performance of the Juul investment,"" Altria Chief Executive Officer Howard Willard said on a post-earnings call.
""(The valuation) is substantially below what we had expected."" 
Shares of Altria fell 6% in after the charges pushed the company to post a fourth-quarter loss of $1.81 billion, compared with a profit $1.25 billion a year earlier. 
The company also said it does not expect to receive earnings contributions from Juul over the next three years.
""It's a major black eye for the management. It's a major strategic mistake in hindsight,"" CFRA Research analyst Garrett Nelson said.
With the Juul deal, Altria had set its sights on re-entering the market for vaping in the face of declining smoking rates and cigarette sales in the United States. 
But a string of vaping-related deaths, coupled with increased bans following a surge in teenage vaping, has clouded the prospects of e-cigarette makers, including Juul.
E-cigarette companies are also facing a May deadline to submit applications to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, proving that their products provide a net benefit to public health. 
If a company fails to make its case, the FDA has the power to order its products off the market.
As part of the revised deal, Altria said it would continue to help Juul with regulatory services including the submission of its products for approval by the FDA. 
""Right now, our primary focus is on helping Juul file a compelling and complete PMTA (premarket tobacco product application),"" Altria CEO said.
Willard added he was ""optimistic"" that data from a federal youth tobacco survey would be released before the FDA made its decision on the applications and that it shows a reduction in youth usage of e-vapor products.
Juul's new chief executive officer and former Altria executive, K.C. Crosthwaite, has made the FDA application process his central goal and restructured the company to focus on regulatory approval.
Altria will stop providing services including logistics, distribution and access to retail shelf space to Juul, it said, adding that the e-cigarette maker will rejig its board to include two directors designated by Altria. 

""This agreement is a continuation of the reset initiated by Juul's leadership team,"" Willard said.

Investing.com - Sometimes doing good enough is more than enough for Wall Street.

Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ) shares rose 6%.
The maker of Oreos, Toblerone and Tang reported a fourth-quarter profit of 61 cents per share and sales of $6.91 billion.

The restaurant on Moscow' central Pushkin Square (NYSE:SQ), was due on Friday to sell the Big Mac for just three roubles ($0.0474) instead of its usual price of 135 roubles, and expected to draw tens of thousands of people. But on Thursday it ditched the plan after Moscow authorities issued a city-wide warning against mass public events.
""Yesterday the Moscow government announced precautionary measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus,"" McDonald's (N:MCD) said in a statement.
""(It) recommended refraining from holding public events in the near future in places where citizens gather en masse in order to minimize risks of infection.""
There have been no confirmed cases of the virus in Russia.
Nonetheless the country has limited rail connections and partially closed its land border with China, and announced it would temporarily stop issuing electronic visas to Chinese nationals.
The virus, which began in Wuhan, the capital of China's central province of Hubei, has killed 170 people in China and infected more than 7,800 globally.
HISTORIC OPENING
The Big Mac cost 3 roubles on Jan. 31, 1990, when the opening of the first McDonald's in the final months of the Soviet Union drew international attention and was considered of huge significance.
That day over 30,000 people queued around the block for a first taste of American fast food, Manu Steijaert, a vice president at McDonald's, said, adding it was a global record at the time. 
The branch, located 1.5 km (0.93 miles) from the Kremlin, has since seen over 140 million visits and last year was the busiest branch of McDonald's globally. 

McDonald's has 735 restaurants in Russia and plans to cross the 800 mark in 2020, investing over $100 million in its expansion.

(Reuters) -  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ) shares fell about 1% on Thursday as quarterly profits missed estimates even though the company added more monthly mobile phone subscribers than expected as adding the Disney+ streaming service helped some of its plans.
The largest U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers has cut prices and made its offerings more attractive by bundling services such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Music to battle intense competition in the industry.
The company said that in the fourth quarter, it added 790,000 phone customers who pay a monthly bill, well above the average analysts' estimate of 525,000 subscribers, according to research firm FactSet. 
Verizon's reported post-paid phone churn of 1.13% for the fourth quarter, the seventh consecutive quarterly increase. Analysts at New Street Research said lowering churn would be more difficult with shift in the wireless market.
Total operating revenue rose to $34.78 billion from $34.28 billion, beating the estimate of $34.60 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
In October, Verizon said it would offer a year-long subscription to Walt  Disney  Co's (N:DIS) Disney+ with its unlimited plans, a move aimed at rival AT&T Inc (N:T), which is expected to launch its own streaming platform HBO Max in May. 
Revenue in Verizon's media unit, which includes Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA), HuffPost and TechCrunch, was nearly flat at $2.1 billion from a year earlier. The company said it wrote down $236 million during the fourth quarter for the media business, which has struggled to grow as ad revenue moved to larger digital players like Alphabet's Google (O:GOOGL).
Net income rose to $5.22 billion, or $1.23 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31 from $2.07 billion, or 47 cents per share, a year earlier. The company also recorded a $2.2 billion tax benefit related to the sale of preferred shares in a foreign affiliate.
The company built out its network of 5G in Kansas City, Little Rock and Cincinnati, rolling out the next generation of wireless in 34 cities in 2019. Verizon said it expects to spend $17 billion to $18 billion in expanding 5G, ramping up its 4G and building out more fiber. 
Verizon said that building out its own multi-use fiber will help increase revenue for its business segment. 
""I think this is one of the most critical assets in a network today -- in today's world, especially as we build a Verizon intelligent network,"" Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg said during a conference call. 
Verizon reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.13, missing Wall Street estimates of $1.14.

At 10:40 a.m. EST, Verizon shares were down 0.96% at $58.96.

1113,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2020 10:49AM ET</span>","Exclusive: In break from past, Louis Dreyfus boss is open to selling stake","By Dmitry Zhdannikov
LONDON (Reuters) - After 169 years of keeping the business in the family, agricultural commodity giant Louis Dreyfus Company (LDC) is open to selling a large non-controlling stake to an external stakeholder, its chairwoman told Reuters.
Margarita Louis-Dreyfus, who assumed control of the company in 2009, stressed she was in no rush and that an investor would have to strengthen the business.
Last year, the billionaire businesswoman completed consolidating Louis Dreyfus Company Holdings B.V. (LDHBV) - the structure that holds the family's shares in LDC - via her Akira family trust which now controls over 96% of the holding firm.
She has spent a decade negotiating costly and acrimonious buyouts of minority family shareholders, while profits at LDC declined in increasingly tough agricultural markets.
""It is the first time in our almost 170-year history that we are prepared to open our capital to an external shareholder,"" the 57-year-old said in an interview.
""But we are not under pressure. We want to keep majority control. Everything else depends on the quality of offers.""
The group has previously indicated it could bring ""regional players"" into the business to help strengthen its positions in areas where it seeks expansion, such as China.
Akira's consolidation of LDC's ownership has come at a cost: it borrowed $1 billion from  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) last year to buy out the minority shareholders, pledging its shares in LDC as collateral, its filing showed.
Credit Suisse declined to comment.
This comes at a time when LDC, like its rivals, faces a challenging business environment - with swine fever in China, which could hit economic growth and protein demand in the world's largest consumer of pork, as well as the coronavirus outbreak.
'NOW COMPANY IS FREE'
LDC, also known as Dreyfus, is the ""D"" of the ""ABCD"" quartet of global agri-traders that also includes Archer Daniels Midland (N:ADM),  Bunge  (N:BG) and Cargill (UL:CARG).
Like its peers, LDC has restructured operations, exiting activities including dairy and metals trading while focusing more on food processing, notably in Asia.
The company's top priority was to develop its business, said Louis-Dreyfus, a Russian-born Swiss citizen.
""Until 2018 we were in a process of consolidating the company's shareholder structure. Now the company is free of that issue and can fully focus on the business.""
A new investor should bring value to strengthen the company, she said.
""It is not only about size. It is also about quality.""
Speculation about consolidation has been rife in the industry since takeover approaches for U.S.-based Bunge.
Commodity group  Glencore  (L:GLEN) made an approach for Bunge two years ago and has said the sector needs consolidating. China's COFCO International has also been seen as a potential bidder for other trading firms as it expands overseas.
'ADAPTING TO NEW REALITY'
In October 2019, Dreyfus reported a first-half net profit from continuing operations of $73 million, down from $91 million a year earlier, and said international trade tensions and the swine disease epidemic would weigh on its annual profit.
Full-year 2019 results will be published later this year. Louis-Dreyfus said it would show a ""resilient"" bottom line despite a challenging backdrop of swine fever and trade tensions, which depressed U.S. soybean imports into China.
""We are adapting to a new reality of higher volatility and political unpredictability,"" Louis-Dreyfus said, adding that a recovery of crush margins -- the profits made from processing soybeans -- and cost savings should help 2020 results.
A cost-cutting programme announced internally in November is being led by new Chief Operating Officer Michael Gelchie, whose appointment was part of a recent management reshuffle, the latest in a series of changes.
""We are cautiously optimistic that we shall see a rebound in 2020,"" she said.
Over the past decade, Louis-Dreyfus has bought the shares of minority family members wishing to sell under a long-term arrangement established by her late husband, Robert. Akira increased its ownership in LDHBV to over 96% from 50.1%.
""In fact, all we have been doing these years is following Robert's guidance to develop the company's strategy,"" she said."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. banks would be able to take large ownership stakes in venture capital funds under proposed rules unveiled on Thursday by the Federal Reserve. 
The potential rewrite would ease restrictions aimed at limiting bank exposure to riskier business investments that were originally ordered as part of the ""Volcker Rule.""
Banks are already permitted to invest in startups while meeting certain requirements, and agency officials said the rule inadvertently prevented banks from investing in such endeavors through funds. 
The overhaul also would simplify other aspects of the so-called ""covered funds"" portion of the rule. For example, the proposal would exempt funds that foreign banks offer to clients outside the United States from the rule's requirements.
The proposal would also clarify that credit exposures by a bank to a particular fund would not constitute an ownership interest, nor would a bank have a stake in a fund if it happened to make the same direct investments as that fund.
The Volcker Rule was aimed at curbing risky bank activity in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis, but Thursday's proposal marks the second time regulators under the Trump administration have sought to relax those standards in response to industry complaints it is too complex and restrictive.
The Fed shares responsibility for the Volcker Rule with four other agencies: the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Those other agencies are expected to also sign off on the proposal, which could be finalized later this year.
Fed Governor Lael Brainard, a Democrat, opposed Thursday's proposal, arguing in a statement that it would ""weaken core protections"" established after the crisis.
The proposal comes after regulators eased requirements around another portion of the Volcker Rule in August, which simplified standards around what sort of trading activity by banks is prohibited.

The Fed also is set to finalize a rule on Thursday that would create a framework for determining when a company has taken control of a bank and must face more rigorous oversight and restrictions. The rule marks the first time the Fed has laid out a blueprint for when investments made by or in banks is consider controlling, which carries with it additional requirements. Fed officials said that clarity could make it simpler for banks to attract investors or make investments of their own into companies.

1115,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2020 10:41AM ET</span>",EasyJet partner starts developing engine for electric plane,"LONDON (Reuters) - British airline easyJet (LON:EZJ) has moved a step closer to commercial electric flying on short-haul routes after its partner said it would begin development of engines for its electric narrow-body aircraft.
Fully electric planes will only be able to fly relatively short distances, but could be a key part of the aviation industry's bid to cut its carbon emissions.
Wright Electric said on Thursday it was working to develop electrical systems that were big enough for a commercial flight of its 186-seat electric aircraft, and would build a 1.5 megawatt electric motor.
EasyJet wants electric planes to fly routes of about 500 km, which means it could use the aircraft on London to Amsterdam, Europe’s second-busiest route.
It partnered with Wright Electric in 2017 to explore the prospects for short-haul electric commercial flying. Wright said it intended to conduct ground tests of its motor in 2021 and flight tests in 2023.
""This is another crucial step for our partner Wright Electric to move towards the introduction of commercial electric aircraft and it is exciting to see their ambitious timeline for testing and entry into service,"" easyJet Chief Executive Johan Lundgren said.
The aviation industry is under pressure to find more sustainable ways of operating as environmental groups encourage people not to fly and seek greener alternatives.
The Swedish-born ""flight shaming"" movement, led by activists including teenager Greta Thunberg, has weakened demand for air travel in Europe over the last year.
Lundgren, who is also from Sweden, announced last year that easyJet would pay for carbon-offsetting of all its flights but said that such measures were only an interim solution until new technologies were developed.
""We know it is important to our customers that we operate as sustainably as possible,"" he said.
""We can see more clearly than ever a future that is not exclusively reliant on jet fuel."""

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets pared early losses on Thursday after pockets of strength in U.S. corporate results help restrain fears about the spread of the coronavirus and its impact on the world economy.
By 10:25 AM ET (1525 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 89 points or 0.3%, having earlier been indicated much lower. The S&P 500 was down 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.4%.
The market drew some comfort from preliminary U.S. GDP figures, which showed annualized growth steady at 2.1% in the fourth quarter. That meant that overall growth in 2019 slowed to 2.3%, its slowest since 2016.
“Essentially demand for US made goods and services (largely services) continued to increase at a pace sufficient to generate growth of around 2% even as overall demand slowed, as the fall in demand for goods was concentrated in imports,” said Brad Setser, a senior fellow with the Council for Foreign Relations.
A bigger than expected slowdown in personal consumer expenditures put the issue of sub-target inflation – at which Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell expressed his displeasure during Wednesday’s press conference – firmly back on the radar, a potential early indicator of a shift to a clearer easing bias at the central bank in the coming months.
Among individual stocks, the coronavirus claimed Carnival (NYSE:CCL) as its latest victim, falling 3.3% as a cruise ship operated by the company was blocked from leaving Civitavecchia outside Rome after a passenger fell ill with suspected symptoms of the disease. The virus has an incubation period of as much as 14 days, according to Chinese officials.
Elsewhere, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) surged 11% to a new record high after beating forecasts for the fourth quarter and predicting at least a 35% increase in deliveries this year. The company also moved to address looming constraints on battery supplies, entering a partnership with China’s CATL and South Korea’s LG Chem.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) fell 5.9% after the company announced a 51% rise in operating costs in the fourth quarter, mainly related to tighter regulatory demands on privacy. This contributed to a sharp contraction in its profit margin in the quarter, raising fears that profitability could be permanently squeezed.
Chemicals company DuPont (NYSE:DD) fell 7.4% after issuing disappointing guidance for the coming year, while Altria (NYSE:MO) fell 7.1% after taking another $4.1 billion writedown against its investment in vaping products maker Juul Labs.
Oil and gas stocks continued to underperform as the coronavirus led to more airlines cancelling flights into and out of China. Chinese airlines alone are now cancelling nearly 1,000 flights a day. Sentiment was further soured by Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), which cut back its running stock repurchases by 60% after reporting a slump in profits and rise in its net debt ratio in the fourth quarter. U.S. crude futures were down 1.8% at $52.38 a barrel.

(Reuters) - Spirit AeroSystems (N:SPR) on Thursday said its chief financial officer had resigned after the company identified some accounting irregularities, adding to the woes of the aero-parts maker as it grapples with the 737 MAX crisis.
Spirit shares fell almost 7% in premarket trade after the company said its accounts did not comply with standard protocol related to certain potential contingent liabilities in the third quarter last year. 
Mark Suchinski, vice president of quality and former principal accounting officer at the company, has replaced Jose Garcia as chief financial officer (CFO). 
The company said both its CFO as well as its current principal accounting officer, John Gilson, have handed in their resignations.
The matter is not expected to materially affect the company's financial statements for the year ended Dec. 31, 2019, Spirit said.
""However, the review is ongoing and no final conclusion has been made,"" Spirit said, adding that it would cooperate with any inquiries the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission may have.
Separately, the company said it reached a deal with its largest customer, Boeing (NYSE:BA), to gradually restart production of 737 MAX parts and deliver 216 shipsets in 2020. 
Spirit, which had halted production of the MAX parts on Jan. 1, did not specify a date for restarting production.
Boeing on Wednesday said it was expecting to resume MAX production ahead of a regulatory approval for the jet's return to service by mid-2020.
Spirit will produce an average 18 shipsets — a complete set of parts for each aircraft — per month for the full-year, down from 52 in 2019.
""Spirit does not expect to achieve a production rate of 52 shipsets per month until late 2022,"" the company said in statement.
Boeing halted the MAX's production this month, which has been grounded for more than 10 months following two fatal crashes that killed 346 people. 
Spirit builds the fuselage, thrust reversers, engine pylons and wing components for the 737 MAX, which account for more than 50% of its over $7 billion annual revenue.

Tesla shares have been on a tear for the last six months and the company's market value now is more than Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) combined and second to only Japan's Toyota Motor Corp.
At least nine analysts raised their price targets on the stock, with Canaccord Genuity's analyst Jed Dorsheimer more than tripling his price target to $750.
The higher delivery forecast suggests Tesla is looking at a steadier chapter after years of steep losses, production troubles and clashes between Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and U.S. regulators.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Dan Levy said that Tesla checks a number of boxes for investors and noted that the key takeaway from the quarter was the company's promise of comfortably delivering over 500,000 units this year.
Tesla, which was infamous for not keeping up with production targets, has been looking to broaden its manufacturing capability with its new $2 billion factory in Shanghai.
The electric vehicle maker said its new Shanghai factory, which started delivering Model 3 sedans a month ago, was running as expected and that it would increase production of the mass-market cars because of strong demand in China."

YOKOHAMA, Japan (Reuters) -  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Nissan (T:7201) can improve their alliance without altering their ownership structure, the chairman of the Franco-Japanese partnership said on Thursday, rolling back a previous push toward a full-blown merger that rankled Nissan. 
The comments from Jean-Dominique Senard point to an emphasis on more cooperation and operational efficiency as the automakers and junior partner Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211) strive to rebuild profits, which have slumped in the wake of former chairman Carlos Ghosn's arrest in 2018.
Renault and Nissan (T:7201) have struggled to repair a relationship badly strained after the arrest of Ghosn, who fled Japan to his childhood home of Lebanon at the end of last year. He has been charged with financial misconduct, which he denies.
""We all share a sense of urgency,"" Senard told reporters in Yokohama, after he and the heads of the three automakers met. He said there was ""no other option"" but to change, but added reforms could be made without a shift in the capital structure.
""The priority as clearly stated was to increase significantly the efficiency of the alliance,"" he said. 
Renault SA, which is part-owned by the French state, owns 43% of Nissan Motor Co, while the Japanese firm has 15% of the French carmaker, with no voting rights - a structure that has caused friction in Japan, given Nissan is the larger of the two.
Renault has previously indicated a desire to move toward a full merger, something Ghosn is said to have championed and which Nissan has strongly opposed. 
Nissan CEO Makoto Uchida told reporters that in order to leverage their respective strengths, Nissan would take an operational lead in China, where it leads its partners in sales, Renault on its home turf in Europe and Mitsubishi in southeast Asia, an area it dominates.
A similar model will be taken for engineering, where one company will lead in developing a key technology that would then be shared among the partners, the companies said in a statement.
Fuel economy credits would be pooled by the three in Europe, they added.
The three companies, which together sold nearly 11 million vehicles in 2018, will announce revised mid-term plans by May, Uchida said.
The automakers need to improve profitability to compete with global rivals, which are investing heavily to develop electric vehicles, self-driving cars and other new technologies that are transforming the industry.

Reuters reported this week that Nissan was set to eliminate at least 4,300 white-collar jobs and shut two manufacturing sites as part of broader plans to add at least 480 billion yen ($4.4 billion) to its bottom line by 2023.

The Atlanta-based company has been pushing to launch more coffee, teas and low-sugar beverages to expand its offer of in-demand products as consumers move away from sugary drinks.
Earlier this month, Coke added dairy company Fairlife to its range of brands, giving Coca-Cola access to fastest-growing categories in the United States ranging from lactose-free to ultra-filtered milk. 
The company said fourth-quarter revenue growth was led by its trademark Coca-Cola, that included products such as its caffeinated beverage Plus Coffee and Zero Sugar soda.
Organic revenue, a keenly watched metric that excludes currency fluctuations and acquisitions, climbed 7% during the quarter. 
Volumes, a key indicator of demand, grew 3%, spurred by its Coca-Cola soda, with growth across all geographies. Volumes grew 4% for teas and coffee and 3% for sparkling soft drinks.
At the same time, rival PepsiCo (O:PEP) is preparing for the launch of its own coffee-cola beverage that has double the caffeine punch as regular soda.
Coca-Cola's shares were up about 2% in trading before the bell. The stock rose about 17% last year, compared with the broader S&P 500 Consumer Staples index (SPLRCS) and rival PepsiCo (O:PEP) which have each gained about 24%.
Net revenue grew 16% to $9.07 billion, beating analysts' estimate of $8.89 billion. 
Coke projected 2020 organic revenues to grow about 5%, compared with the 6% rise it reported in 2019 and said it would continue to expand into new categories through acquisitions in 2020. 
""That's a pretty good indication that they feel good about the year so far... this would be seen as setting up a strong year,"" industry expert and executive editor of Beverage-Digest, Duane Stanford, said. 
For the year, Coca-Cola expects to record adjusted profit of $2.25 per share, a cent below analysts' forecast, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Excluding one-time items, Coca-Cola earned 44 cents per share in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, meeting Wall Street expectations. 

Net income attributable to the company's shareholders rose to $2.04 billion, or 47 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $870 million, or 20 cents per share, a year earlier.

8:55 AM ET: Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) stock rose 0.9% after the company reported quarterly sales ahead of expectations, but pared earlier gains after forecasting that organic sales growth will slow slightly to 5% from 6% last year.
9 AM ET: Hershey (NYSE:HSY) stock rose 3.5% after posting earnings around 3% higher than forecast in the fourth quarter. Revenue was roughly in line with consensus. The company also had to absorb a $108 million writedown on Krave Foods, which it bought five years ago in a move to reduce its exposure to the confectionary business.
The company’s forecast for underlying earnings per share also fell marginally short of expectations.

The company also had to absorb a $108 million writedown on Krave Foods, which it bought five years ago in a move to reduce its exposure to the confectionary business.

8:40 AM ET: Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) stock rose 1.8% after the pharma reported fourth-quarter earnings well ahead of expectations, thanks largely to strong sales of its diabetes drug Trulicity.

8:30 AM ET: Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) stock fell 3.0% after The Wall Street Journal reported that it had been running services for nearly two years without fully complying with safety regulations.


Royal Dutch Shell's (NYSE:RDSa) ADRs fell 3.2% to their lowest in four months after the company said it would slow the pace of share buybacks by 60% to conserve cash.

Shell’s fourth-quarter earnings were hit by nearly $3 billion of impairments, the largest of which was due to its U.S. shale gas assets (following similar moves by   Chevron   (NYSE:CVX) and   BP   (LON:BP)). The group’s debt-to-equity ratio rose further above its medium-term target of 25%.
8:23 AM ET:   United Parcel   Service (NYSE:UPS) stock fell 0.9% after the company’s operating margin fell in the fourth quarter due to its increased reliance on Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Amazon had cut ties with FedEx (NYSE:FDX) at the end of last year.
UPS’s fourth-quarter earnings met expectations of $2.11 a share but revenue fell slightly short.
UPS also announced it has ordered 10,000 electric delivery vans from U.K.-based Arrival Ltd, and will team up with Google’s self-driving technology unit Waymo to take shipments between its own locations.
8:15 AM ET: Spirit Aerosystems (NYSE:SPR) stock fell 6.4% after the company set out a painfully slow schedule for resuming production of parts for the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX.
Spirit said it will produce an average 18 shipsets — that is, a complete set of parts for each aircraft — per month this year, down from 52 in 2019. It said it doesn’t expect to return to last year’s production rates until late 2022.
8:11 AM ET: Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock surged as much as 11% to a new record high, before retreating to be up 9.8%, after posting earnings and revenue ahead of expectations in the fourth quarter.
Founder Elon Musk promised deliveries would rise to well above 500,000 this year, an implicit gain of 35%, and said profit and positive cash flow would be the exception rather than the rule in future.
The company also signed up new partners to supply batteries, in the shape of China’s CATL and South Korea’s LG Chem.
8:06 AM ET: Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock slumped 7.5%, erasing gains for the year to date, after it posted its first ever drop in annual profit after the bell on Wednesday. A 51% rise in costs, due largely to the growing need to satisfy regulators' concerns over privacy, pushed its operating margin down to 34% in 2019 from 45% only a year earlier. Fourth-quarter revenue and earnings both came in slightly ahead of expectations, however.
Verizon (NYSE:VZ) stock fell 0.7% after the company predicted only modest underlying earnings growth of between 2% and 4% this year, due in part to the need to roll out expensive 5G networks. It estimated capex spending at between $17 and $18 billion.
Fourth-quarter earnings missed expectations by less than 1% but revenues were ahead of forecasts as the company had its best quarter in six years for adding mobile phone subscribers.
Blackstone (NYSE:BX) stock rose 1.3% after the asset manager said fourth-quarter distributable earnings rose 27 percent year-on-year, helped by its real estate and hedge funds businesses. That offset declines in its equity and credit businesses."
1126,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2020 08:37AM ET</span>",Turnaround costs push Deutsche Bank to bigger than expected loss,"By Tom Sims and Patricia Uhlig
FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) plunged to a bigger than expected loss of 5.7 billion euros ($6.3 billion) last year, its fifth in a row, as the cost of its latest turnaround attempt hit earnings.
Misconduct scandals, a failed attempt to take on Wall Street heavyweights and, more recently, an aborted merger with Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) mean Germany's biggest bank is still in recovery mode more than a decade on from the global financial crisis.
The latest attempt, under CEO Christian Sewing, is a 7.4-billion euro drive to cut 18,000 jobs, shrink its investment bank and focus on corporate as well as private banking.
But its efforts are being hindered by a faltering global economy and ultra-low euro zone interest rates.
""Our new strategy is gaining traction,"" Sewing said on Thursday, noting revenues had stabilized in the second half of 2019, cost cutting was on track, the bank's capital position had improved and the net loss was entirely down to revamp costs.
But the 1.6 billion euros loss in the fourth quarter was larger than analysts' mean forecast of 1 billion, leading the full-year result to miss expectations of a 5 billion euros loss.
""While capital was a positive surprise, weak core operating trends could lead to further Core Bank downgrades, leaving Deutsche Bank's share price vulnerable after a good start to the year,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts wrote in a note, referring to the businesses seen as central to Deutsche's future.
The bank's shares fell almost 3% in early trade, but had recovered to trade a fraction higher at 0920 GMT.
The results conclude a turbulent decade for Deutsche, including a cumulative loss of 15 billion euros over the last five years and an 82% plunge in the shares over the decade.
In contrast, U.S. rival JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. posted its biggest-ever profit last year as its bond trading business bounced back in the last quarter of the year.

'ON THE OFFENSIVE'
For analysts and investors, Deutsche's ability to generate revenue has been a major concern. The bank has repeatedly trimmed its forecasts.
Revenue fell 4% in the fourth quarter to 5.3 billion euros and was down 8% for the year to 23.2 billion euros.
The quarterly figure included a 5% drop in corporate banking and a 4% decline at the private bank. The investment bank's cash-cow bond trading arm saw a 31% jump, a big improvement on recent quarterly falls, but less than gains at some U.S. banks.
""For us Deutsche Bank remains a 'show me' stock on revenues and we need evidence in future quarters to give credit on revenue turnaround,"" JP Morgan Cazenove analysts said in a note.
Deutsche is aiming for annual revenue of 24.5 billion euros by 2022.
Sewing said the bank was feeling the benefits of its restructuring plan this month, and was bullish about 2020.
""We will shift our focus over to growth. We don’t just want to defend our market position; we want to build on it,"" he said.
""We’re going on the offensive and we intend to sustain it. But not everywhere, just in those areas where we are relevant and have a leading position.""
Deutsche said it was making good progress on reducing costs, another focus for investors, with global employee numbers down by more than 4,100 last year to 87,597 full-time equivalents.
The bank said on Wednesday it would halve 2019 bonuses for individual board members, and told staff this week it would delay salary raises by a few months.
Now in its 150th year, Deutsche is considered one of the global financial system's most important banks, but has been hit by a string of misconduct scandals.
Seeking to repair relations with Berlin and the general public, it last week appointed to its supervisory board former German government minister Sigmar Gabriel, who once criticized the bank for a business model built on speculation."

LONDON (Reuters) - Stocks across the world tumbled on Thursday as the death toll from a virus spreading in China reached 170, forcing airlines to cut flights and stores to close as the potential economic hit from the outbreak came into focus. 
The MSCI world equity index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 49 countries, fell 0.5% as European shares followed Asian indexes into the red, stoking demand for the perceived security of safe-haven assets from bonds to gold and pushing oil down 2%.
Europe's broad STOXX 600 (STOXX) fell 0.9%, with indexes in Frankfurt (GDAXI) and Paris (FCHI) down 1.2% and 1.4% respectively. 
Shares in London (FTSE) fell 1.2%, extending losses as the pound climbed against the dollar after the Bank of England kept interest rates unchanged. 
Disappointing earnings and trading updates weighed further on blue-chip stocks, adding to the gloom. Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) fell 4.8% before clawing back some losses after fourth-quarter profit halved to its lowest in more than three years.
U.S. stock futures (ESc1) pointed to a negative open on Wall Street.
The number of confirmed deaths from the virus in China has climbed to 170 with 7,711 people infected, and more cases are being reported around the world.
Chinese factories have extended holidays, global airlines cut flights and Sweden's IKEA said it would shut all stores in China.
Investors started to gauge the impact of the travel and trade restrictions, with one Chinese government economist saying first-quarter growth in the world's No.2 economy could be reduced by one point to 5% or lower and that sectors from mining to luxury goods would be hit.
Investment banks also started to put figures on what the damage could be. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and ING said they expected China’s 2020 growth rate to slow to 5.6% from 6.1% last year. Citi has said it expects growth to slow to 5.5% from its previous prediction of 5.8%, with the sharpest slowdown this quarter. 
Others cautioned that estimates were hard to make. 
""The economic impact will be determined by the extent to which it spreads,"" said Michael Bell, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, adding that hard evidence of a hit to economic data was needed before the impact of the virus could be judged. 
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged on Wednesday the risks from any slowdown in the Chinese economy, but said it was too early to judge the impact on the United States. 
Benchmark U.S. and German government bond yields fell sharply, with 10-year German bund yields dropping to a three-month low. 
U.S. 10-year Treasuries also fell 3 basis points to 1.5600%, their lowest since October (US10YT=RR). The yield curve - as measured by the gap between 10-year and three-month note and a closely watched indicator of looming recession - fell again into negative territory.
Gold edged 0.2% higher . 
Oil prices, seen a barometer of the expected impact of the virus on the world's economy, fell 2.4%. By shortly after noon, Brent crude (LCOc1) was down 95 cents, or $58.39 a barrel. [O/R] 
The World Health Organization's Emergency Committee was due to reconvene later in the day to decide whether the rapid spread of the virus now constitutes a global emergency. 
Chris Weston, head of research at Melbourne brokerage Pepperstone, said: ""The fear is that they might raise the alarm bells.""
Earlier, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) fell 2.1% to a seven-week low and has now dropped for six straight sessions. Indexes in Japan (N225), Hong Kong (HSI) and Taiwan all fell. 
STEADY RATES 
In Europe, the pound  jumped 0.5% after the Bank of England kept interest rates on hold.
The central bank said signs that Britain's economy had picked up since December's parliamentary election, and of a more stable global economy, meant more stimulus was not needed now.
The BOE had appeared close to cutting rates for the first time in more than three years, with investors pricing in a 45% chance that the BOE would cut rates to 0.5% from 0.75%.
Sterling was last at $1.3082 against the dollar, and up 0.3% against the euro at 84.31 pence.
Elsewhere in currencies, there was a risk-averse mood, with exposed Asian currencies and commodities sensitive to Chinese demand extending losses as economists made deep cuts to their China growth forecasts. 
The Chinese yuan  reversed Wednesday's gains to fall 0.4% to its lowest level since Dec. 30, breaking through the key level of 7 against the dollar. 
The Australian dollar  and the kiwi dollar  both lost 0.3%.
The Japanese yen  rose 0.2% against the dollar, while the Swiss franc , also seen as a safe haven, also gained.
The dollar against a basket of six major currencies (DXY) was flat.

Investing.com - Verizon (NYSE:VZ) said it expects underlying earnings this year to grow by between 2% and 4%, as the company plows the revenue from a growing user base back into upgrading its mobile and fiber networks.

The company reported earnings per share of $1.13 for the fourth quarter, just shy of consensus estimates for $1.14, on revenue of $34.78 billion, a figure boosted by the highest net growth in wireless subscribers in six years. The figures were still only flat compared to last year, due to impairments of $2.8 billion that weren't quite offset by a $2.2 billion tax benefit from asset disposals. 
Verizon (NYSE:VZ) said it gained a net 1.2 million retail customers in the quarter, including 790,000 phone net additions, the highest fourth-quarter phone net additions in six years. The 969,000 net increase in postpaid smartphone subscribers was up 11% on the year.

Investing.com - U.S. stock markets are set to open lower, following on from losses in Asia and Europe with investor sentiment remaining weak as the deadly coronavirus continues to spread beyond China, prompting more countermeasures from governments and companies that are likely to weigh on the economy in the near term.
At 7:20 AM ET (1220 GMT), futures for the S&P 500 traded 22 points, or 0.7%, lower, futures for the Nasdaq 100 down 53 points, or 0.6%, while the Dow Jones 30 Futures contract fell 198 points, or 0.7%.
Earlier Thursday, Japan’s Nikkei closed 1.7% lower, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong dropped 2.6%, while the KOSPI index in South Korea fell 1.7%. Stock markets are still closed in China. The major European indexes all traded sharply in the red.
The death toll from the coronavirus outbreak has now risen to 170, with 7,711 confirmed cases, according to the Chinese health authorities, affecting every region in mainland China. Infections have also spread to at least 15 other countries.
""In the last few days the progress of the virus, especially in some countries, especially human-to-human transmission, worries us,"" World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said late Wednesday. 
The group meets Thursday to consider once more whether the virus constitutes a global health emergency.
Against this backdrop, the Federal Reserve decided to keep its interest rates unchanged late Wednesday, with Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledging the likely impact on growth on the region during his press conference.
In corporate news, Telsa will be in the spotlight after the electric car maker posted upbeat fourth-quarter numbers, beating estimates for both profit and revenue. The company has become the second most valuable auto manufacturer behind Toyota, overtaking Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p). It also announced a new partnership with battery suppliers CATL and LG Chem earlier on Thursday, although Japan's Panasonic is expected to remain its main supplier.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock dropped sharply after hours after the social media giant reported its first drop in annual profits on the back of increased spending to beef up privacy protections.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) also offered up fourth-quarter figures late Wednesday, posting record sales and a hefty jump in quarterly profit. Fellow tech giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) follows with its earnings due after the close Thursday.
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) fell 3.1% after The Wall Street Journal reported that it failed to respect safety regulations properly over a two-year period, raising further questions over the effectiveness of the Federal Aviation Agency's supervision.
Verizon (NYSE:VZ) will also be in focus after it posted its best quarter for subscriber growth in six years. It still expects underlying earnings growth of only 2%-4% this year, due partly to an expected $17.5 billion capital spending requirement.
The highlight of the economic data slate Thursday is the release of the fourth quarter U.S. GDP figure, at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT). The U.S. economy grew by an annualized 2.1% in the third quarter, and the growth rate is expected to stay unchanged. However, the trade spat with China and Boeing’s 737 MAX woes could have an impact.

1134,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2020 06:53AM ET</span>",Uniper to shut down German hard-coal power plants by 2025,"By Christoph Steitz, Tom Käckenhoff and Vera Eckert
FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF, Germany (Reuters) - Uniper aims to close most of its German hard coal-fired power plants over the next five years, accounting for half its European coal capacity, the utility said on Thursday.
The German cabinet on Wednesday backed plans to exit coal as an energy source by 2038 as part of efforts by Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling coalition to protect the climate and restore its green credentials.
Uniper, formed in 2016 after being spun off from E.ON, has drawn up plans to shut down about 1.5 gigawatts of capacity involving three blocks at its Scholven plant plus the Wilhelmshaven power station by the end of 2022, it said.
It will then shut a further 1.4 GW at its Staudinger and Heyden sites by end-2025, the group added, confirming an earlier Reuters story.
Uniper shares were up 1% at 1120 GMT, giving it a market value of 11.1 billion euros ($12.3 billion).
""We're setting Uniper on a decisive course for the future: our actions will provide planning security to our employees at the facilities affected and give our company the financial and structural flexibility to focus on important, sustainable projects,"" CEO Andreas Schierenbeck said.
The planned closures represent about half of Uniper's total hard coal-fired capacity in Europe and come as investors and governments demand sustainable business models that do not rely on fossil fuels.
COMPENSATION
The planned closures would cut Uniper's carbon emissions by about 18 million metric tonnes per year, it said.
Schierenbeck told Reuters last week that the group planned to significantly slash its CO2 emissions, which stood at 59.5 million metric tonnes in 2018, half that of larger peer RWE, Europe's biggest polluter.
In return for the closures Uniper will likely qualify for government compensation payments.
Based on compensation terms announced by the government this week, Uniper could receive 365 million euros if it succeeds in planned auctions that will allocate closure permits to the least expensive bidders.
Uniper has said it plans to develop former plant sites to help preserve jobs. The government wants former coal sites to be used for facilities such as gas-fired combined heat and power plants.
The plans do note affect Datteln 4, Uniper's new 1.5 billion euro state-of-the-art coal-fired power plant which is scheduled to go on-line in mid-2020.

1135,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2020 06:51AM ET</span>",Mike Ashley's Frasers cleared over bulk of Belgian tax case,"LONDON (Reuters) - British sportswear retailer Frasers (L:FRAS), formerly  Sports Direct , said the Belgian Tax Authority will no longer pursue 491 million euros ($545 million) of its potential 674 million euros sales tax claim, removing a major uncertainty in the business.
The tax issue first came to light when Frasers, which is majority owned by Mike Ashley, reported 2018-19 results in July.
Shares in the group were up 1% at 1048 GMT on Thursday, extending gains over the last year to 79% and valuing the group at 2.55 billion pounds. Ashley owns 63.3% of its equity, according to Refinitiv data.
""This update is a clear positive, removing to a large degree a significant uncertainty that has been in place since the prelims,"" said analysts at Liberum.
Frasers said the Belgian Tax Authority confirmed in writing it had completed its review of ""Matter 1"" - which accounts for 73% of the possible claim - and was satisfied with the explanation provided.
The group, which made core earnings of 288 million pounds in 2018-19, said it is not required to make any payment to the authority regarding this part of the review.
""Our view at the time (July) was that this VAT bill was without merit so I am delighted we have so far been vindicated in that view with the extinguishment of the main part of the proces-verbal"", said Frasers' finance chief Chris Wootton.
The group said it had however made some historical clerical reporting errors and would continue to fully engage with the tax authority in order to resolve ""the smaller remaining matters"".
""Frasers Group management still believe that it is less than probable that material VAT and penalties will be due in Belgium as a result of the tax audit,"" it added.

Last month the group forecast core earnings growth of as much as 15% in 2019-20, helped by a nascent turnaround at department store chain House of Fraser, which it bought out of administration in 2018.

1138,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 30, 2020 06:27AM ET</span>",Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Thursday,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The death toll from the coronavirus jumped again, although there were tentative signs of a slowdown in reports of new cases. Global stock and oil prices tumbled, and Wall Street is also set for a lower opening as a result. Tesla is set to surge to new record highs after a better-than-expected fourth quarter, while the U.S. will get its first reading of fourth-quarter GDP at 8:30 AM ET. And Mark Carney may do what Jerome Powell chose not to do and cut interest rates at the Bank of England, in what will be the Canadian's last meeting before giving up the governorship. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, 30th January.
1. Coronavirus death toll rises as virus spreads further
China reported its biggest single-day jump in coronavirus deaths, the toll rising to 170 from 132 on Wednesday. The number of confirmed cases in China now stands at 7,711, up from 5,974 a day earlier.
The rate of growth in confirmed cases appears to be slowing to around 30% from 50% earlier in the week. Also, the fatality ratio remains well below that for the SARS epidemic, with only 2.2% of reported cases leading to death so far.
However, the disease continues to spread, with India reporting its first confirmed case. Elsewhere, Russia said it would close its (highly-porous) border with China. The World Health Organization is meeting again on Thursday to review its decision not to declare the outbreak a matter of global concern.
2. Q4 GDP reading to cast light on Fed inaction
The U.S. gets its first reading of gross domestic product in the fourth quarter of last year at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT).
Analysts expect the annualized rate of growth to have stayed at the relatively modest 2.1%, as the slowdown caused by trade conflicts with China and others continues to drag.
The update comes a day after the Federal Reserve gave little sign of easing monetary policy further in the near term, even though Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated that the central bank wasn’t happy with inflation still below target and remains alert to the risk of global disinflationary trends – trends that seem likely to be reinforced in the near term due to the impact of the coronavirus on the Chinese economy.
3. Stocks, oil tumble on virus fears again
U.S. stock markets are set to open sharply lower as the rising death toll from the coronavirus once again rattled confidence around the world, with participants also conscious that the Fed is not in any hurry to come and bail them out again.
By 6:30 AM ET (1130 GMT), Dow 30 futures were down 227 points or 0.8%, while S&P 500 futures were down 0.8% and Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.7%. 
That’s despite support from better-than-expected earnings late on Wednesday from large-caps Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ) and PayPal.
U.S. crude oil futures also suffered, falling below $52 a barrel for the first time in three months.
The earnings stream out of Europe was mixed on Thursday, with Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) stock hitting a three-year low after heavy writedowns and falling margins forced it to slow its mammoth buyback program.   Deutsche Bank   (DE:DBKGn), by contrast, beat expectations, although its numbers were flattered by windfall gains in bond trading.
4. Carney to cut before leaving Bank of England? 
The Bank of England will decide at 7 AM ET (1200 GMT) whether or not to cut its own official interest rates, a day before the U.K. formally ends its 46-year membership of the European Union. 
The decision is set to be a close one, with analysts polled by Investing.com seeing a 6-3 vote in favor of keeping the bank’s key rate unchanged at 0.75%, despite a flurry of comments from policy-makers suggesting they were inclined to ease policy to shield it from a slowdown caused by Brexit uncertainty and the spillovers from the U.S.-China trade dispute.
Recent data – from house prices to the Markit Purchasing Managers’ Index – have produced more upside than downside surprises, which may incline the Monetary Policy Committee to wait until it sees the new government’s spending plans in March before taking the plunge.
The GBP/USD was rangebound around the $1.3000 level ahead of the decision, the last to be overseen by Governor Mark Carney before he departs.
5. Tesla's Q4 sets it up for surge to new record high
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock is set to hit new records at the opening after surging 11% in after-hours trading on the back of a stronger-than-expected quarterly report.
CEO and founder Elon Musk predicted that deliveries will “comfortably exceed” 500,000 this year, an increase of 35%, and also said he expected positive profit and cash flow figures to be the rule, rather than the exception, in future.
Both revenue and profit beat expectations in the fourth quarter, although revenue grew only 2% and the profit margin fell as the higher-volume, lower-margin Model 3 increasingly dominated the sales mix.
Elsewhere on Thursday, the company said it had entered into a partnership with CATL and LG Chem , the biggest makers of electric vehicle batteries in China and South Korea, to supply batteries for its electric cars. It has so far depended on Japan’s Panasonic."

1144,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2020 05:47AM ET</span>",EU court sets criteria for GSK case on 'pay-for-delay' drug deals,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's top court set criteria on Thursday to resolve a dispute in Britain over deals GlaxoSmithKline (L:GSK) struck with rival drugmakers to delay the launch of generic drugs.
The court said these deals in themselves do not constitute a breach of competition rules but their impact needed to be assessed because they could harm competition.
The case was brought before the court by GSK after Britain's competition watchdog fined the drugmaker 37.6 million pounds ($49 million) in 2016 for its so-called ""pay-for-delay"" deals that postponed the launch of cheaper copies of an anti-depressant.
""It is necessary to determine how the market will probably operate and be structured in the absence of the concerted practice,"" the court said in its assessment of the potential harm to competition caused by such deals.
The British Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) had said that between 2001 and 2004 GSK paid generic drug companies over 50 million pounds with the intention of delaying the release of cheap generic versions of its former blockbuster Seroxat after its patent expired in 1999. 
The EU court said on Thursday that the ability of each generic manufacturer to access the market had to be assessed in deciding whether the deals were unlawful. 
If generic drugmakers were not in a position to sell their cheaper copy of Seroxat there would have been no harm to competition, the court concluded, effectively leaving a British appeal tribunal to settle the dispute. 

""We do not yet have the final ruling in this case, which relates to agreements from nearly 20 years ago, and so will not be commenting further while proceedings are ongoing,"" a spokesman for GSK said in a statement.

1147,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 30, 2020 05:10AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Shell Hits the Buyback Brakes After Big Shale Writedown,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) shares tumbled to their lowest in nearly three years on Thursday after the company unveiled a wretched set of figures for the fourth quarter of 2019, hit by falling operating margins and big writedowns on investments in North American shale gas and elsewhere.
The hit was so severe that the Anglo-Dutch giant said it would slow the pace of share buybacks to only $1 billion in the current quarter, from an average of $2.5 billion a quarter over the last 18 months. 
In the three months to December, it had bought $2.8 billion, but that had only been made possible by allowing the debt reduction target to slip. Gearing, the ratio of debt to equity, rose to 29.3% from 27.9% three months earlier – drifting further away from its medium-term target of 25%.
Gearing, of course, depends on the value of the company’s equity as well as its debt, and that was hit by some painful writedowns, notably $1.65 billion mainly related to U.S. shale gas assets. The company joins an ever-growing list of majors forced to admitted their bet on shale has turned sour:   Chevron   (NYSE:CVX),   BP   (LON:BP) and Equinor (OL:EQNR) have all already taken similar hits, unable to escape the glut caused by associated gas coming out of new oil fields in the Permian and other shale basins.
Other impairments, notably in Australia and Singapore, took the total value of writedowns in the quarter to $2.94 billion, although the company was also able to soften the blow by booking some non-cash gains on derivatives and deferred tax positions.
It would be nice to think that Shell (LON:RDSa) will be able to move on after putting the writedowns behind it. Unfortunately, that looks like wishful thinking. Margins in refining and marketing, and in chemicals, all weakened against a backdrop of soft Chinese demand in the fourth quarter, and the increasingly obvious impact of the coronavirus on the Chinese economy leaves little scope for an improvement any time soon.
The risk is that the coronavirus, having infected the Chinese economy, will force Shell (LON:RDSa) to choose between higher leverage or suspending buybacks altogether. In an extreme case, it may even be forced to resort to a scrip dividend again to avoid any further rise in debt levels, a tactic it last used to keep shareholders happy for a couple of years after the BG Group acquisition. The only safe bet would seem to be that the dividend -- one of the most important for European pension funds -- will continue to be paid at its current level in one form or another. At a yield of 6.86%, that is no small consolation to long-term investors.
Shell (LON:RDSa) CEO Ben van Beurden said on Thursday that the company’s intentions to complete the $25 billion program remains unchanged. But that language is intentionally and justifiably vague. With Brent now trading below $60 a barrel and with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies seemingly not in any hurry to make any further cuts to their own production, to promise anything more would be folly."
1148,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2020 05:00AM ET</span>",Sweden's AB Volvo plans big shareholder payout as profit beats,"By Niklas Pollard and Johannes Hellstrom
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Swedish truck maker AB Volvo (ST:VOLVb) reported a smaller than expected fall in fourth-quarter earnings in the face of slowing demand and announced plans on Thursday for a payout to shareholders that exceeded market expectations. 
The downturn in the volatile truck cycle that will be a test of Volvo's resilience with CEO Martin Lundstedt having spent his four years at the helm boosting flexibility across the group. 
With forecast-beating earnings and shareholder payout, analysts saw clear signs Lundstedt's work is paying off. 
""This is really what people have been waiting for,"" Handelsbanken Capital Markets analyst Hampus Engellau said. 
""The first quarter will be weaker. But if it is weaker from these levels, that still makes for very strong figures."" 
Operating profit at the maker of trucks, construction equipment and buses fell to 9.2 billion crowns ($969 million) from a year-ago adjusted 10.6 billion, beating an analysts' mean forecast of 8.4 billion, according to Refinitiv estimates.
The rival of Germany's  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and newly listed Traton (DE:8TRA) said it was focused on adapting to lower volumes and while its production in Europe was well aligned with demand in Europe, further cuts were needed in North America.
""Our increased profitability and strong financial position allow us to invest in our future as well as return cash to our shareholders,"" Lundstedt said in a statement. 
Strong truck sales ahead of the current slump have helped drive cash generation at Volvo in recent years, allowing it to give an extraordinary payout to shareholders a year ago and fuelling analysts' expectations for more of the same.
Volvo proposed raising its ordinary dividend to 5.5 crowns per share from a year-ago 5.0 crowns and said it planned an extra dividend of 7.5 crowns per share, up from the 5.0 crown per share bonus payout last year.
Analysts had on average forecast a total payout of 10.36 crowns per share for 2019, Refinitiv estimates showed.
The Gothenburg-based company maintained its forecast for heavy truck markets to contract just under 15% in Europe and nearly 30% in North America this year, an outlook broadly in line with that delivered by U.S. rival Paccar (O:PCAR) earlier this week.

Order intake of its trucks, which includes brands such as Mack and  Renault  (PA:RENA), was down 10 percent year-on-year in final quarter of last year, a far milder slump than the 45 percent decline recorded in the preceding quarter.

1149,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2020 04:41AM ET</span>",French state lender to launch multi-billion euro fund to boost firms,"PARIS (Reuters) - French public investment bank Bpifrance has raised several billion euros from private and sovereign investors for a new fund that can be used to fend off activist investors targeting French companies, its head said.
Sovereign wealth funds, French insurers, big companies and wealthy families are among the first investors to commit money to the new fund, which is being called Silverlake.
""The aim is to eventually raise a bit more than 10 billion euros when the (capital) raising is done,"" Bpifrance Chief Executive Nicolas Dufourcq said.
""We're doing a first closing that should be several billion,"" Dufourcq told a journalists, declining to give names of the initial investors.
The new fund would give extra financial firepower to Bpifrance, which already manages a 15 billion euro portfolio of state shareholdings.
Its investments include some of France's biggest companies such as carmaker PSA (PA:PEUP), chapmaker STMicrolectronics (BN:STM), telecoms group Orange (PA:ORAN) and car parts maker  Valeo  (PA:VLOF).
Silverlake would bring in outside capital that could be used to help shore up the equity structure of French companies destabilized by activist investor campaigns or in the midst of a tricky business or shareholder transitions requiring a long-term investor commitment.
""France doesn't have any pension funds, so we're doing the job,"" Dufourcq said.
The fund, which is to be formerly presented by Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire in the coming weeks, aims to make about 15 investments with a time horizon of about 10 years and offer investors dividends for putting in their capital.
While Bpifrance builds up Silverlake, it would also continue selling down assets to optimize its portfolio, Dufourcq said.

Investing.com - European stock markets moved sharply lower Thursday, weighed by weakness in Asia as the death toll from the coronavirus continues to mount, and amid reports that the virus has now spread to India. 
At 03:55 ET (08:55 GMT), the U.K.'s FTSE index was trading 51 points, or 0.7%, lower, France's CAC 40 was down 75 points, or 1.3%, while the DAX lost 155 points, or 1.2%. The Euro Stoxx 50 index dropped 43 points, or 1.2%.
Overnight China's National Health Commission said the total number of confirmed deaths had reached 170 as of late Wednesday, with the number of infected patients approaching 8,000. Infections have been reported in at least 15 other countries and in every province of mainland China.
The efforts to curtail the growth of this virus are likely to have a significant negative shock on growth in the second largest economy in the world, something Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged during his press conference late Wednesday. The central bank decided to keep its interest rates on hold nonetheless.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) economists on Thursday said these events could knock China's growth in this quarter from a previously-forecast 6.3% to 4.9%, for a year-on-year figure of 5.6%.
Turning back to Europe, the earnings season continues at a pace with a number of heavyweight companies reporting their latest figures.
Shares in Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) dropped 4% after the Anglo-Dutch energy giant reported a sharp fall in full-year net profit on Thursday, citing challenging macroeconomic conditions and lower oil and gas prices. The company also made heavy writedowns on various investments in North American gas, Australia and Trinidad & Tobago.
BT Group (LON:BT) slumped over 4% after the telecoms giant reported a drop in sales and underlying profit for the nine months to December. CEO Philip Jansen also stated that the U.K.’s decision to allow Chinese firm Huawei limited access to the U.K.’s 5G phone network infrastructure would have “an impact of around 500 million pounds over the next five years.”
  Deutsche Bank   (DE:DBKGn) posted a hefty full-year net loss of 5.3 billion euros ($5.8 billion) as part of its huge restructuring. That said, this news is largely baked in and the company’s shares were the top performer in the DAX, thanks to a windfall from bond trading in the fourth quarter. 
  Unilever   (LON:ULVR) said pretax profits for its full year fell by one-third, citing a significant slowdown in its South Asian markets. That said, its shares rose around 1% as the consumer goods company weighed up the sale of its tea business.
Shares in   Diageo   (LON:DGE) climbed 0.5% after the alcoholic beverages company reported 6% organic sales growth in the first half of its fiscal year in both North America and Asia Pacific.
Eyes will also be on the Bank of England, with an announcement from its rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee due at 07:00 AM ET (1200 GMT). There is a degree of uncertainty surrounding this meeting. A series of dovish comments by MPC members had stoked up expectations of a rate cut, but the economic data which have followed have generally been positive.
Elsewhere, German unemployment figures for January came in marginally better than expected, but not by enough to change the outlook for ECB policy."

Ola Kaellenius, vice president of Germany's VDA auto industry association, said the European Commission wants to reopen discussions about climate goals for the sector, even though emissions targets for 2025 and 2030 were only set a year ago.
""What we need for the successful transformation of our industry is security for planning. And that is why our association would welcome it if the EU Commission were to ensure reliable framework conditions,"" Kaellenius told a reception.
Kaellenius, new chief executive officer of Mercedes-maker Daimler, said the sector needed binding emissions limits, but also urged for the transport sector to be included in the European emissions trading system in future.
""This market-based approach could further promote technical innovations in our industry,"" he said."

The VDA said it has decided to continue talks with Berlin, Hamburg and Munich, and would pick one of the cities in the coming weeks.

Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc slowed the pace of share buybacks as profit missed expectations, underscoring the pressure on Big Oil due to slumping natural gas prices and weaker refining.
The results set a gloomy tone for what is expected to be a broadly weaker set of quarterly results for the industry. The final months of last year saw gas trade at historic lows, while slowing economic growth shrank margins from making fuel and chemicals.
The Anglo-Dutch company first warned investors last quarter that it might not achieve its target of buying back $25 billion shares by the end of 2020. It reiterated that warning on Thursday and said the next tranche of share repurchases won’t exceed $1 billion, compared with $2.75 billion in the prior quarter.
“We remain committed to prudent capital discipline,” Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden said. “Our intention to complete the $25 billion share buyback program is unchanged, but the pace remains subject to macro conditions and further debt reduction.”
Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter was $2.93 billion, down 48% from a year earlier and falling short of the average analyst estimate of $3.15 billion.
Shell’s American peers  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). and  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX) are due to report results on Friday. Exxon has already warned that earnings will be weaker than expected, while Chevron has flagged up a write-down of as much as $11 billion.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Two Australian regulators may have agreed not to pursue JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) over its role in a criminal cartel case in exchange for its help in prosecuting the other banks involved, a lawyer for another bank told a court on Thursday.
The investment bank and two rivals,  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn), worked on a A$2.5 billion stock issue for retail lender Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (AX:ANZ) in 2015.
Those banks and their former executives - but not JPMorgan - have been charged with criminal cartel behavior. Regulators say they agreed to keep some of the stock to prop up its price, and a pre-trial hearing has heard JPMorgan cooperated with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) in exchange for immunity.
A lawyer for ANZ told the court on Thursday his client was seeking documents detailing contact between the ACCC and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), a corporate regulator that was not directly involved in bringing the charges.
""It would ... be an abuse of power if ASIC had decided not to bring (separate) proceedings against JPMorgan for the reason that the ACCC had successfully put pressure on them to do so,"" said ANZ's lawyer, Tim Game.
Game later told the court he was not alleging misconduct by either regulator, but rather that he wanted to see their communications. The regulators have resisted handing over some of the documents the defense has sought.
""There is no evidence whatsoever suggesting that ASIC is engaging in any of that conduct,"" ASIC lawyer Sue McNicol told the court.
The case is being closely watched by investment bankers around the world because it could influence how they are allowed to conduct joint capital raisings.
A year and half after the charges were brought, no trial date has been set and none of the accused - Citi, Deutsche, ANZ and several of their staff and ex-staff - have entered a formal plea. All have said they will fight the charges, which carry prison terms.
The pre-trial hearings will resume in Sydney's Downing Centre Local Court on Friday."

Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa)'s (LON:RDSa) profit slumped in the fourth quarter, raising doubts over the company’s ability to keep up with its share buyback program.
Our intention to complete the $25 billion share buyback programme is unchanged, but the pace remains subject to macro conditions and further debt reduction,"" CEO Ben van Beurden said in the company’s earnings release.
The company’s preferred measure of underlying profit fell to $2.93 billion dollars, while a net $2.06 billion in additional charges meant that reported net income fell to only $965 million. All of the company’s major divisions except LNG trading suffered declines in profit.
The biggest writedowns affected its north American shale gas portfolio, along with projects in Australia and Trinidad & Tobago. The writedowns were partially offset by gains on disposals of other assets.
BT Group (LON:BT) said its results for the third quarter were below expectations, but the financial outlook for the full year remained on track.
The telecoms group said its outlook for the year remained unchanged but would be in the lower half of expectations, between 1.9 billion pounds and 2.1 billion pounds.
BT said costs relating to regulation, competition and investment in products affected its overall revenue and profits. Profits were down 3% to 5.9 billion pounds as a result of 2% fall in revenue to 17.1 billion pounds.
""BT delivered results slightly below our expectations for the third quarter of the year, but we remain on track to meet our outlook for the full year”. said CEO Philip Jansen.
   Diageo   (LON:DGE) said organic sales grew 4.2% in the first half of its fiscal year ending in June, with growth reported across all geographic regions, with the U.S. growing 6%.
Underlying earnings per share also rose 4% but net income fell 6% on a combination of exchange rate, tax and other financial factors.
The drinks maker raised its dividend 5% to 27.41 pence a share.
Net inflows at asset manager St. James’s Place (LON:SJP) slowed down marginally in the fourth quarter, a development it blamed on “continued macro-economic and political uncertainty.”
Gross inflows were up fractionally from a year ago, but higher outflows left the net number down at 2.44 billion pounds, despite an 8% rise in the number of advisors.
The group said it had seen “improved investor sentiment and activity” since the General Election in December, which it said “gives us confidence that we are well placed to continue to grow.”
  Foxtons   Group (LON:FOXT)said revenue for the year was down 4% to 107 million pounds, citing political uncertainty in 2019 and a generally weaker sales market with ‘fierce’ competition that dented revenues. 
The estate agents said the improved political situation following the general election could improve sales in 2020.
 “Looking forward, with the uncertainty of the general election removed, early signs are that the sales market may improve during 2020 and our sales pipeline is ahead of last year” said CEO Nic Budden."

1166,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2020 01:44AM ET</span>","Tesla extends profit run, promises record production, driving stock up 13%","By Akanksha Rana and Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) posted its second quarterly profit in a row as vehicle deliveries hit a record and the company said it would comfortably make more than half a million units this year, pushing its shares to new highs.
The delivery forecast, higher by more than a third than last year's production, suggests Tesla is looking at a steadier chapter after years of steep losses, production troubles and clashes between chief executive Elon Musk and U.S. regulators.
The electric carmaker's stock, which has nearly doubled in the past year, jumped 13% after hours on Wednesday, cracking the $600 mark for the first time.
Tesla said that the manufacturing process at its new Shanghai factory, which started delivering Model 3 sedans a month ago, was running as expected and that it would increase production of the mass-market cars because of strong demand in China.
The $2 billion Shanghai factory is key to Tesla's growth strategy. There it aims to produce 150,000 Model 3 sedans and later increase output to 250,000 a year, including the Model Y.
But the company warned of a 1-1.5 week delay in the ramp of Shanghai-built Model 3 cars because China ordered a shutdown of the factory after a new coronavirus breakout that has killed 170 people and infected thousands.
""This may slightly impact profitability for the quarter but is limited as the profit contribution from Model 3 Shanghai remains in the early stages,"" Tesla's chief financial officer Zachary Kirkhorn said on a post-earnings call.
The company is evaluating whether it will be hurt by the virus and whether the supply chain for cars built in its Fremont, California plant will be affected, he said.
Tesla said it started production of the new electric crossover utility vehicle Model Y at the Fremont factory this month and plans to deliver the first cars by the end of March, ahead of schedule.
Tesla already starting Model Y production was the most notable item in the release, Roth Capital Partners analyst Craig Irwin wrote in a note.
""For a company that has always been late, this is a big improvement,"" he said.
Tesla initially did not expect to make the Model Y until late 2020 and then moved up the forecast to this summer, finally beating that deadline by several months.
COST CONTROL
The results indicate that Tesla is controlling costs better, a metric that investors have questioned Musk on before and that he was quick to talk about on the call.
""In 2019, we managed to generate more than $1 billion of free cash flow while building a factory in Shanghai in record time and while building parts of Model Y production,"" he said.
Tesla's cash balance increased to $6.3 billion and total operating expenses rose less than 1% to $1.03 billion in the December quarter.
And while its revenue per unit delivered rose by only 3% in the fourth quarter, operating profits per vehicle rose by roughly 19%.

Tesla, which last week overtook Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) as the second-most valuable carmaker behind Japan's Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), still trails luxury carmaker rivals on steady profits per vehicle, a key metric.
(Graphic: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/TESLA-RESULTS/0H001R87WBMF/index.html)
Some analysts have questioned the more than $104 billion valuation, but investors are betting that Tesla has overcome its many struggles and can compete with larger, better capitalized rivals to lead the industry in technological innovation for next-generation cars.
The company's debt pile is high as well, amounting to $13.42 billion at the end of 2019.
Tesla reported a 4.9% operating margin in the fourth quarter and said Model Y production and the Shanghai factory ramp-up were likely to weigh on margins temporarily.
Its new initiatives, which also include the construction of its first European factory in Germany, an electric pickup truck, a new generation of the Tesla Roadster and automated driving features, are also likely to put a strain on its cash pile.
Net income attributable to common shareholders fell to $105 million, or 56 cents per share, for the three months ended Dec. 31, from $140 million, or 78 cents per share, a year earlier.
 Revenue rose to $7.38 billion from $7.23 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected revenue of $7.02 billion. (https://

While Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has ordered the suspension of the high-speed rail service between the city and mainland China from midnight on Thursday and all cross-border ferry services, the unions said it was not enough.
""Front-line colleagues are in a panic as they are exposed to high risk of getting the virus while at work,"" said Railway Power, which represents about 500 workers from metro operator MTR Corp.
The Hospital Authority Employees Alliance (HAEA) said it welcomed the steps the government had taken but wanted it to close the entire border and would meet on Saturday to discuss what more action it could take.
""There is still a considerable distance from our goal of full-scale preventive measures of infection control,"" the union said in a statement.
Chris Cheung, treasurer of the HAEA, which has more than 18,000 members, said many of them planned to begin phased strike action next week unless their demands were met.
The former British colony has confirmed 10 cases of the coronavirus, with one person in critical condition. The epicentre of the outbreak is the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where it is believed to have jumped to humans from an animal in an illegal wildlife market.
The health scare comes after months of at times violent anti-government protests in Hong Kong sparked by fears its autonomy, guaranteed under a ""one country, two systems"" formula, is being eroded by Beijing.
Protesters frustrated by the city government's refusal to make concessions on demands for full democracy have in recent months formed about 40 unions as a way to press their campaign and at least a dozen of them have come out in support of the HAEA's proposed strike. 
Lam has said it is ""inappropriate and impractical"" to close the entire border. 
The threat of strike action comes as Hong Kong residents have been scouring shops for face masks and joining long queues as supplies dwindle.
Berry So, a waiter, said he had queued up from 2 a.m. outside one shop.
""I've been waiting six to seven hours,"" said So, who failed to get a mask.
China's National Health Commission said on Thursday the total number of confirmed deaths from the coronavirus in the country climbed to 170, as the number of infected patients rose to 7,711.

The facility at Katunga in Victoria state is the first of its kind in Australia, the company said in a media statement, converting organic waste materials such as cereal straw into electricity, renewable diesel and jet fuel, and fertilizer.
“All agricultural land used to supply biomass to the facility will also be used to cultivate food crops,” said Program Director Lubey Lozevski. “It is a priority for AgBioEn that no agricultural land is taken away from food cultivation to create fuels.”
About 75,000 hectares of land will be used by 2023 to supply biomass to the facility, while hydroponic tomato grower Katunga Fresh will take power from the project to add more glasshouses to its operation.
Australia is gradually waking up to the potential of bio-energy generation with three major projects in development across the country using household waste as a feedstock."

Global corporations are grappling with a rapidly spreading SARS-like coronavirus that has killed at least 170 people and is threatening a key growth market.
Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus that has infected more than 7,000 people, is a manufacturing, shipping and business hub. While supply-chain disruptions have been limited so far because many facilities already were idle for the Lunar New Year holiday, that may change as employers stay shut longer than normal. Local officials, including the municipal government in Shanghai, are extending the holiday until Feb. 9 or 10 in various parts of the country.
The reopening of some Apple suppliers following the Lunar New Year’s break was pushed to Feb. 10 from the end of January, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said. Toyota on Wednesday suspended operations in its China plants through Feb. 9.
Here is a summary of how some of the biggest companies are responding to the health crisis:
Business Impact
McDonald’s has closed several hundred restaurants in Hubei province, whose capital is Wuhan. The fast-food chain still has about 3,000 locations open in the country, executives said during a Jan. 29 call with analysts. China accounts for about 9% of the Chicago-based company’s global restaurants but makes up just 3% of operating income.Tesla expects a one- to one-and-a-half-week delay in the production ramp-up at its new Shanghai plant -- its first outside the U.S. -- due to a government required shutdown. Chief Financial Officer Zach Kirkhorn said Jan. 29 the delay “may slightly impact profitability for the quarter” and Tesla is monitoring whether there will be supply-chain interruptions for cars built in California.Apple provided a wider-than-usual forecast range for the current quarter because of the uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus. CEO Cook addressed the virus during a conference call with analysts on Jan. 28, saying Apple is following developments. Virtually all iPhones are made by Foxconn’s Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. in Zhengzhou, China, and by Pegatron Corp. at an assembly site near Shanghai. Apple also closed some stores.Starbucks has closed more than half of its coffee shops in mainland China -- about 2,000 of them. The company maintained its 2020 forecast but said it doesn’t include the impact of closing half of the mainland stores because it can’t yet calculate it. Compared with McDonald’s and Domino’s Pizza Inc., Starbucks is the most exposed to the outbreak, as measured by percentage of worldwide revenue and operating income, according to Guggenheim analyst Matthew DiFrisco.Robert Bosch GmbH CEO Volkmar Denner said the two factories the world’s largest car-parts maker operates in Wuhan are currently idle because of the Chinese New Year. The German manufacturer employs 800 people at the sites that make steering components and thermal systems. “We’re monitoring how the situation develops to see if production might be down for longer,” Denner told reporters on Jan. 28 in Stuttgart, Germany. “We’re concerned.” Denner said it might take until February or even March before the virus peaks.Toyota Motor Corp. is halting production in China through at least Feb. 9, as are General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. Ford also has ceased all China-related business travel into and out of the country. Ford employees who traveled to Wuhan and other affected areas are being asked to self-quarantine for 14 days upon their return.LVMH, the world’s largest luxury-goods maker, signaled it expects the crisis may already start easing near the end of the first quarter. Chairman Bernard Arnault said that information from his advisers suggests that the peak should be reached over the coming weeks and the crisis may be partially resolved by the end of March. He cautioned that that outlook may be inaccurate.The world’s biggest glovemaker, Top Glove Corp Bhd., expects sales of that product to increase about 25% due to coronavirus outbreak, from its initial full-year target of 10%-15%, Executive Chairman Lim Wee Chai said in emailed response to questions.Tesla, NIO Inc.: About 8 million cars were sold last year in the roughly 40 Chinese cities that have 10 or more diagnosed coronavirus cases, or 36.8% of total retail volumes in the country, Bernstein analysts estimate. Those cities accounted for 82.5% of Tesla’s retail volumes, and 68% of NIO’s, the analysts wrote in a note. “The latter looks especially vulnerable to a prolonged slump in EV sales,” they said.Imax Corp., the Mississauga, Ontario-based company, known for its large-format screen technology, has said it’s delaying movie releases at its theaters in China in the wake of the outbreak. The impact of lost revenue from the Chinese New Year will cost Imax at least $60 million in global box office sales, according to MKM Partners. If the epidemic lasts for a few more weeks, “it is not unreasonable to project” a shortfall of $200 million in the first quarter, MKM Partners analysts said in a note.Aeon Co., Japan’s largest supermarket operator, expects sales from Wuhan area stores to drop by half, spokesman Makoto Sueyoshi said Monday. Aeon shuttered the three malls it operates in Wuhan, but its five general supermarkets were operating on a limited basis to sell daily goods and food.Travel, Work From Home
Airlines across the globe suspended more flights to China as governments clamped down on travel to help contain the virus. British Airways halted daily routes to Beijing and Shanghai from London’s Heathrow airport, after U.K. officials advised against non-essential travel. The U.K. flag carrier said it would reassess over the next few days.Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. said it would cut capacity to China by 50% or more starting Jan. 30 while Lufthansa suspended service to China until Feb. 9. In the U.S., American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc. is suspending flights between Los Angeles and Shanghai and Beijing from Feb. 9 through March 27, while United Airlines Holdings Inc. is reducing service to Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong. Hormel Foods Corp  (NYSE:HRL)., the U.S. maker of Spam canned meat and Skippy peanut butter, asked China-based staff to work from home until Feb. 10. For now there are no production disruptions because the China sites are closed for the holiday until Feb. 3, the company said Jan. 29 by email.Cargill Inc., America’s biggest privately owned company and top agricultural commodities trader, asked employees in its Chinese offices to work from home from Feb. 3 to Feb. 9.Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG is asking about 3,500 employees in Beijing to work from home for two weeks, starting the first day following the city’s Chinese New Year Holiday, from Feb. 3 to Feb. 17.Nvidia Corp., the biggest maker of computer graphics chips, told its workers in China to stay home and any others returning from the country to work from home for two weeks, people with knowledge of the matter said. Travel to China should be postponed, Nvidia told employees.  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). has also implemented similar policies. UBS Group AG and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). are among financial firms that have imposed travel restrictions to the mainland.  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) suspended business travel to Hong Kong until Feb. 11. Some including  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Plc are providing staff with face masks and hand sanitizers, along with guidance on hygiene and how to avoid getting sick.PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP: The accounting firm has suspended all business travel to Wuhan and employees returning from the city are required to work at home for two weeks before coming to the office. The company extended Chinese New Year holidays for staff in Hong Kong and Macau to Jan. 31 and asked employees to work remotely where feasible following the holiday.Closing Locations
Yum China Holdings Inc. temporarily closed most of its KFC and Pizza Hut stores in Hubei province until further notice.Fast Retailing Co.: The operator of the Uniqlo casual clothing chain has temporarily shut 130 of its China stores, a spokeswoman said. That’s equal to about a fifth of its mainland locations.Ryohin Keikaku Co.: Owner of the Muji clothing and housewares brand has closed some stores in Wuhan, according to a spokesman.Wuhan, the epicenter, has more than 500 factories and other facilities, placing it 13th among 2,000 Chinese cities in Bloomberg’s supply chain database. It’s the capital of Hubei province, which has 1,016 facilities, making it seventh of 32 such jurisdictions. Many plants are in the auto and transportation industries."
1171,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 30, 2020 12:47AM ET</span>","When China’s Market Reopens, the Wild Guessing Games Begin","(Bloomberg Opinion) -- 7,000 or 40,000? 3% or 7%? As the Chinese hunker down for an extended Lunar New Year break, forced upon them by a raging epidemic, they’re turning to wild guessing games over two crucial figures: How many more will be infected by the SARS-like coronavirus, and how big a selloff we will see when the mainland market reopens Monday.
So far, China has confirmed about 7,000 cases, but the actual number — including those in the incubation stage — could have already exceeded 44,000. As for the stock market, the world has turned upside down since its last trading day on Jan. 23, when only 830 infected cases were confirmed. The 3.1% correction of the benchmark Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 Index that day could just be the beginning of a long way down. 
Unlike the U.S., China is prone to deeply bearish slides. In 2015, its blue-chip index lost more than 40% of its market value in just three months. In 2018, it tanked 25%. Seen in that light, last year’s 36% gain, propelled in part by record foreign portfolio inflows, is fragile. By comparison, the U.S. has endured only eight bear markets since 1926, and quickly rebounded after a dip in December 2018.
To avert another rout, Beijing needs to prove its sprawling bureaucracy still works. In 2003, China entered the SARS episode with full economic steam, so it was easy for investors to forgive any hiccups once the number of infections plateaued. But this time, with the economy in a sharp slowdown, all eyes will be on Beijing, and whether it can muster the resources to quarantine those infected and control the disease.
The government is flexing its muscles. Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, is frantically building hospitals that will open in just days; thousands of doctors — a scarce resource in China — have been dispatched. Municipal governments have set aside more than 20 billion yuan ($2.9 billion) to combat the virus, according to local reports, on top of billions the Ministry of Finance is spending. If any country can fight a health crisis, China’s strong-armed approach puts it at an advantage. 
But how about the rest of the machine? The People’s Bank of China was noticeably unwilling to cut interest rates last year and only pledged liquidity for next week in one terse sentence, buried in a short notice. 
When China reopens Monday, trading won’t be for the fainthearted. For starters, how many major markets close for more than one week at a time? Don’t be surprised if margin calls, which in turn propel further selloffs, will once again confound officials. 
Often, a stock market’s performance has little to do with how fast an economy grows — just look at the world’s top performer, the U.S. Chinese investors have already come to terms with a broad-based slowdown, and have been piling into companies that are industry consolidators or could benefit from American export curbs. But they’re not prepared for an epidemic and the system shutdown that could ensue. More than ever, China’s bureaucratic system matters for financial markets."

The SEC investigation on Nike was confirmed by Scott Wilson, a former lawyer who represented Nike, on the witness stand, Bloomberg said.
The investigation was disclosed at the extortion case of Avenatti, who is charged with threatening to publicize accusations that Nike illegally paid families of college basketball recruits unless the apparel company paid him and another lawyer $15 million to $25 million to conduct an internal probe.
He is also charged with defrauding his client Gary Franklin, a coach in a Nike-sponsored youth basketball league, by concealing a settlement offer made by Nike, and using the coach's accusations to extract riches for himself.
Nike and the U.S. SEC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Avenatti became famous for representing adult film actress Stormy Daniels in lawsuits against U.S. President Donald Trump.
Avenatti's lawyer, Howard Srebnick, said the Justice Department, which started an earlier investigation of Nike and competitor Adidas AG (DE:ADSGN), had handed over evidence to the U.S. SEC, according to the Bloomberg report.
In the opening argument at the extortion trial, Srebnick countered federal prosecutor's claims that Avenatti was bent on a big payday when he demanded millions of dollars for himself from Nike.
He said that Avenatti was simply fighting for ""a client who wanted justice"" by exposing corruption in youth basketball, and who wanted a high-profile lawyer to help him.
The trial could last 2-1/2 weeks, and Avenatti could face more than 40 years in prison if convicted.

(Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) said on Wednesday that growth would continue to slow as its business matured and it reported a surge in quarterly expenses, disappointing Wall Street expectations that the costs of improving privacy would level off.
The news raised concerns that Facebook's days of astronomical growth were firmly in the rearview mirror, and shares of the world's biggest social network dropped 7.2% in extended trading.
Facebook reported its slowest-ever revenue growth for the fourth quarter, at 25%, and Facebook's chief financial officer, David Wehner, said on a call with investors that the pace of expansion will slow further in the first quarter of 2020. Wehner forecast a percentage point decline in the growth rate in the low- to mid-single digits, citing Facebook's maturing business, the impact of global privacy regulation and concerns about ad targeting.
""We have experienced some modest impact from these headwinds to date. The majority of the impact lies in front of us,"" Wehner said. 
He specifically noted changes made by Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google, which have both announced new restrictions on browser cookies used to track users online.
Facebook, the world's second-biggest seller of online ads, has been under fierce scrutiny worldwide in recent years over its privacy practices. It is also facing heat over how its services have been manipulated to spread misinformation.
The company addressed those issues starting in mid-2018 following repeated scandals, causing growth in expenses to surge by more than 100% for several quarters as it hired privacy staff and invested in content moderation.
That investment began declining last year, leading analysts to believe Facebook was largely finished building out its new systems and beginning to find efficiencies that could whittle costs further.
But the company reported total costs and expenses increased 34% to $12.22 billion in the fourth quarter, more than double the 14% that analysts had forecast and dragging down operating margins to 42% from 46% a year earlier.
It also announced it had reached a $550 million settlement in principle of an Illinois lawsuit that claimed it illegally collected and stored biometric data for millions of users without their consent.
The fourth-quarter revenue growth https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/FACEBOOK-RESULTS/0H001R885BN9/index.html of 25% did beat analysts' expectations of a dip to 23%. But it is the company's fourth straight quarter of revenue growth less than 30%, playing to concerns that Facebook is struggling to restore its pre-2018 momentum when sales regularly grew upwards of 40%.
Still, Facebook's shares rose more than 50% over the last year, raising pressure for a strong performance.
""FB stock had made a big run-up in anticipation of the report ...so the room for error was low,"" said Daniel Morgan, a portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Co.
The company continued to add users, beating estimates. Monthly users of Facebook's core social network climbed 8% to 2.5 billion, while 2.9 billion people used one of its apps - Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram or Messenger - each month.
That unique reach keeps advertisers dependent on Facebook's apps and online ad network. Facebook has also been trying to build out e-commerce offerings in the last year like Instagram Checkout, which make shopping more convenient by allowing users to complete transactions from within Facebook's apps.
Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said in the investor call that the company is moving ""very slowly and very, very carefully"" with those products.
Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, who has come under fire over Facebook's decision to permit political ads that include false information and lies, said he would also focus the company on communicating Facebook's values more clearly.
The company had generated ""positive but shallow sentiment"" by trying to be liked and avoid causing offense over the past decade, he said. ""My goal for this next decade isn't to be liked, but to be understood.""

WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The California Institute of Technology said on Wednesday that it won a $1.1 billion jury verdict in a patent case against Apple (O:AAPL) and Broadcom (O:AVGO).
In a case filed in federal court in Los Angeles in 2016, the Pasadena, California-based research university alleged that Broadcom wi-fi chips used in hundreds of millions of Apple iPhones infringed patents relating to data transmission technology.
""While we thank the members of the jury for their service, we disagree with the factual and legal bases for the verdict and intend to appeal,"" Broadcom said in a statement.
Apple said it plans to appeal the verdict, but declined further comment. The company had said in court filings that it believed all of the university's claims against it resulted from its using Broadcom's chips in its devices, calling itself ""merely an indirect downstream party.""
Broadcom is a major Apple supplier, deriving about a fifth of its sales from the iPhone maker in its fiscal 2019. Last week Broadcom said it had signed deals to sell as much as $15 billion worth of chips to Apple.
The verdict awarded CalTech $837.8 million from Apple and $270.2 million from Broadcom.

1177,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2020 07:28PM ET</span>","Microsoft cloud revenue regains momentum, sending profit above Street estimates","By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) -  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) on Wednesday reported quarterly sales and profit that beat Wall Street expectations, driven by the first acceleration of Azure cloud computing revenue growth in eight quarters amid a pitched battle with Amazon.com Inc’s (O:AMZN) cloud unit.
Shares of the world's largest software company hit an all-time high in after-hours trading. The results reflected the approach of Chief Executive Satya Nadella, who for five years has re-centered Microsoft around the cloud, renting out its computing power and technology to large businesses.
Microsoft said Azure, its primary competitor to Amazon's cloud, grew 62% in the fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 31, down from a 76% revenue growth rate the year before but up from 59% in the fiscal first quarter.
Microsoft's chief financial officer, Amy Hood, said increased consumption of Azure services, which include offerings such as computing power to run applications and data storage services, drove the revenue growth.
""We did have good usage, which matters a ton to that number,"" Hood told Reuters. ""The core thing that we focused on - which is consumption growth - was quite good.""
Microsoft said revenue for its ""commercial cloud"" - a combination of Azure and the cloud-based versions of software such as Office - reached $12.5 billion, up from $9 billion the year before.
The commercial cloud gross profit margin - a key measure of cloud profitability that Microsoft has told investors it expects to improve - was 67%, versus 62% the year before.
Microsoft shares rose as much as 4.58% to $175.74 in after-hours trading.
""This quarter was an absolute 'blow out quarter' across the board with no blemishes and in our opinion speaks to an inflection point in deal flow as more enterprises pick Redmond for the cloud,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note, referring to Microsoft's headquarters location in Redmond, Washington.
Hood said the company was working to improve margins on its core Azure services, which rely on data centers that can cost billions of dollars to build. She cited ""hardware improvements and taking advantage of those hardware improvements.""
Microsoft's revenue and profit for the second quarter were $36.9 billion and $1.51 per share, respectively, compared with analyst estimates of $35.7 billion and $1.32 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Microsoft has focused on hybrid cloud computing – in which a business can use a mix of Microsoft’s data centers and its own – as well as on delivering its longstanding productivity programs such as Office via the cloud.
The shift to the cloud has driven Microsoft's shares up more than 50% in the past year, as it gains ground against market leader Amazon and also parries the threats to its classic software programs from newer entrants like Alphabet Inc’s (O:GOOGL) Google.
In 2019, Microsoft had 22% share of the cloud computing infrastructure market, compared with 45% at Amazon and 5% from Google, according to data from Forrester Research.
""Azure’s renewed growth doesn’t yet pose a threat to AWS’s supremacy in the cloud market, but it does present an opportunity to further close the gap on Amazon and increase its lead over other cloud providers,"" said Andrew MacMillen of Nucleus Research.
The company’s Intelligent Cloud unit, which includes Azure, reported revenue that rose 27% to $11.9 billion in the quarter, versus expectations of $11.4 billion. For the fiscal third quarter ending in March, Microsoft forecast revenue with a midpoint of $11.9 billion for the unit, compared with analyst expectations of $11.4 billion.
Its Productivity and Business Process unit, which contains the LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) social network, reported $11.8 billion in revenue compared with estimates of $11.4 billion. 
Revenue in the unit that contains Windows was $13.2 billion, compared with estimates of $12.8 billion. Over the past year, Windows sales were hampered by shortages of PC chips from  Intel Corp  (O:INTC), but the chipmaker said last week it had alleviated most of those supply concerns.

Microsoft forecast revenue of between $10.75 billion and $11.15 billion for the unit containing Windows in the fiscal third quarter, a wider-than-normal forecast range that the company said was because of uncertainty surrounding the spread of the coronavirus in China.

Production fell by an annual 14.2% to 1.3 million cars in 2019, the third consecutive fall, also hit by some automakers closing factories for additional days in case of Brexit-related disruption, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). Output fell by nearly a third in 2009.
""It is essential we re-establish our global competitiveness and that starts with an ambitious free trade agreement with Europe,"" said SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes.
The global sector has been hit by declining sales in key countries such as China, the world's biggest autos market, and the need to invest billions in electric models.
In Britain, exports were worst hit with demand down 26.4% from China and 17.7% from Japan.
The UK's biggest exporter of goods is now seeking the closest possible relationship with the EU, its largest market where over half of auto exports are sent, avoiding tariffs and customs barriers.
When Britain leaves the EU on Jan. 31, a transition period comes into force for the rest of the year during which time little will change, but politicians need to then negotiate the future partnership to take effect from 2021.
Whilst output is forecast to fall only marginally in 2020, a series of investments are due which will affect future levels.
 Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) warned last year that a decision to keep open its Ellesmere Port car plant in Cheshire is dependent on Britain's future relationship with the EU. Production there dropped 20% in 2019.
Nissan (T:7201) is due to begin making its new Qashqai vehicle at its Sunderland factory, where output dropped 22%, but has warned that any duties would put its entire European business model in jeopardy.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson is keen to use Brexit as an opportunity to improve trade with the United States, to which 19% of exported cars are sent, but the industry is focused on maintaining frictionless trade with the Europe.
""The U.S. is not our priority compared to the EU,"" said Hawes.
Thorny issues remain over whether British and EU components can continue to be counted together in trade deals and the sector has warned that regulatory divergence could cost billions and lead to some models not being sold in Britain.
""If the cost of compliance can't be met by the margin you are going to make on total sales in the UK then you say 'I can't afford to engineer that model for the UK market,'"" said Hawes."
1179,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 29, 2020 07:19PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch for Jan. 29,"Investing.com - Here are three things that could rock the market tomorrow.
1. Amazon Keeps Earnings Assembly Line Rolling
As earnings season rolls on, another of the famed FAANG stocks reports numbers tomorrow.
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) will issues earnings after the bell Thursday, reporting on its all-important holiday quarter with investors curious for more updates on how one-day shipping is shaking out.
On average, analysts expect that the retail giant will report a profit of $4.05 per share on sales of nearly $86 billion.
Earlier this week, Benchmark raised its target on Amazon to $2,300 from $2,100, while keepings its buy rating.
“We expect another record revenue holiday quarter, which could eclipse the high end of guidance thanks to share gains from the impressive, aggressive, one-day shipping rollout,” analyst Daniel Kurnos wrote, according to Barron’s.
The stock is up just a little more than 5% in the last three months, trailing the S&P.
Also reporting tomorrow postmarket is Dow component Visa (NYSE:V).
Visa (NYSE:V) is expected to post earnings of $1.46 a share on revenue of about $6 billion.
Fellow Dow component   Verizon Communications   (NYSE:VZ) issues numbers before the bell, with consensus estimates for profit at $1.14 per share on revenue of nearly $35 billion.
Another blue-chip index member, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), reports ahead of trading, too.
Analysts are looking for earnings of 44 cents per share on revenue of nearly $8.9 billion.
2. First 4Q GDP Numbers Arrive
Just like there’s no let-up in earnings there’s no let-up on the economic front either on Thursday.
The market gets the first numbers of fourth-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) from the Commerce Department at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).
The advance measure of GDP is expected to come in at an annual rate of 2.1%, the same as the final measure of fourth-quarter economic growth, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
At the same time there will be the weekly initial jobless claims numbers.
Claims for first-time unemployment benefits are forecast to have ticked up to 215,00 last week.
3. BoE up in the Air
The Fed decision today lived up to its billing as a foregone conclusion, with rates staying on hold and a very neutral statement.
The Bank of England looks to be the opposite tomorrow, with a lot of uncertainty about what the decision will be at 07:00 GMT.
Interest rates are expected to be kept at 0.75%, according to economist forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
But the derivatives markets are pricing in about a 50% chance of a cut to 0.5%, according to the FT.
If the BoE holds, it will leave the door open for further easing later in the year, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) said today.
""Any relief rally in sterling will prove short-lived as we believe markets are likely to roll out their rate cut expectations into the coming months,"" BofA said."

LONDON (Reuters) - The ability to buy and sell foreign exchange whenever needed with minimal market impact is seen by currency traders as the biggest challenge for 2020, according to an annual client survey by JP Morgan published on Thursday.
In a year when broader market volatility has fallen to record lows thanks to abundant central bank liquidity in global markets, worries about the availability of market liquidity topped the list of issues facing FX traders for a second consecutive year in the U.S. bank's annual survey.
The views of the biggest 650 institutional trader clients, mostly focused on the $6.6 trillion a day foreign exchange markets, polled by JP Morgan point to a tricky year ahead for investors. (N:JPM)
While market liquidity can appear plentiful in calm periods it can also dry up suddenly, especially in volatile times, after years of cost-cutting and rising competition that has pushed down the number of market participants.
Perhaps the biggest factor is the drop in market volatility, with an index measuring currency market swings near record lows, squeezing the spreads that banks charge when quoting currencies.
""Margin compression, increased competition, high execution costs, and tech advances has caused forced a few market makers to exit the space and for liquidity to appear more plentiful than it is in reality,"" said Scott Wacker, global head of fixed-income, currencies and commodities e-sales at the bank.
Among concerns about the year ahead, the availability of market liquidity was picked by 33% of respondents, receiving nearly twice as many votes as the next issue about workflow efficiency that FX markets will face in 2020.
For a link to the survey, see https:// Currency markets have seen more episodes of sudden market swings in market prices in recent years, with the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc swinging wildly in the opening months of 2019 followed by the Turkish lira in August.
That volatility has increased the usage by investors of banks' trading platforms as they offer the relative anonymity of protecting their trades and other value-added services including pricing feeds, according to George Bollenbacher, head of fixed income research at capital markets consultancy Tabb Group.
A December 2019 report by the Bank of International Settlements found that multi-dealer platforms have ceded market share to single-dealer banks.
The survey also found that traders expect to see the amount of trading volume via electronic channels increase to as much as 84% of their total compared with 74% in 2019."

(Reuters) -  Mondelez International Inc  (O:MDLZ), the maker of Oreos and Chips Ahoy cookies, on Wednesday said it expects first-quarter revenue will be impacted by the coronavirus spreading across China, and it has temporarily closed two factories.
The company reported quarterly revenue that beat estimates, helped by higher demand for its snacks in developing markets. Shares in Mondelez were up 2.6% after the bell.
Mondezlez's chief executive, Dirk Van de Put, said the coronavirus is expected to have only a short-term impact. China accounts for nearly 4.5% of the company's sales.
""It's really too early to quantify for us at this point,"" Van de Put said of the expected impact. ""We are monitoring the situation closely."" Mondelez will update the market as needed, he added. 
""We now have to see in the coming weeks what has happened with the sell-out during Chinese New Year,"" Van de Put said. The Chinese government has asked Mondelez to keep two factories closed for 10 days to minimize the risk of infection, he said. Wuhan, China, is the epicenter of the virus, which has killed more than 160 people.
""We also have voluntarily put some travel restrictions to our own people to travel less within China and also for our global people to travel less to China,"" Van de Put said. 
Van de Put also said Brexit is a risk to the company, but he does not expect to see an impact this year. ""If there is no deal near the end of the year, that would possibly be a disruptor,"" he said.
Emerging markets like China - where incomes and demand for e-commerce are rising - have become increasingly important to Mondelez as the consumer goods industry grapples with slowing demand in developed countries.
Mondelez has been pushing hard on investments and can still be in more stores, Van de Put said. He singled out growth in the company's biscuit businesses in India and China, as well as strong chocolate and gum sales in each country, respectively.
The Illinois-based company has invested heavily in both countries in recent years, spending more on marketing and creating products. In China, for instance, Mondelez has been working for years with Alibaba's (N:BABA) online marketplace Tmall to expand its reach, creating novelties like wasabi- or hot chicken-flavored Oreos. 
The company reported fourth-quarter revenue on Wednesday that beat estimates, helped by a 4.5% rise in sales from the Asia, Middle East and Africa business.
Net earnings attributable to the company fell to $726 million, or 50 cents per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31. Excluding items, Mondelez earned 61 cents per share, a cent above analysts' estimates, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Net revenue rose 2.1% to $6.91 billion, beating analysts' expectations of $6.84 billion.

CHICAGO/BENGALURU (Reuters) - U.S. grains trader Archer Daniels Midland Co's (N:ADM) fourth quarter profit topped Wall Street expectations on Wednesday, driven by its nutrition business and refined products unit, which includes biodiesel and food oils.
ADM released earnings results after the market closed and its stock rose 3.15%, to $45.06 a share, in after-hours trading. 
The company said it got a boost from the passage by U.S. lawmakers of a retroactive biodiesel tax credit late last year, which allowed for a $1-per-gallon subsidy for fuel made from cooking oil, soybean oil and animal fats.
Even absent the tax credit, results were strong due to global demand for those products, the Chicago-based firm said.
Its biggest segment in terms of revenue, Ag Services and Oilseeds, performed better but faced numerous challenges, including a delayed corn and soybean harvest in the United States which led to lower export volumes and tighter margins during the peak U.S. export season.
ADM's bioproducts segment posted a $159 million loss in 2019, as its struggling ethanol business continued to face tough industry margins, the company said. ADM is moving some dry ethanol mills into a wholly-owned subsidiary while the company evaluates strategic alternatives.
Oilseed crushing margins, too, were lower than the prior year's near-record levels due to problems with Argentina's 2018 soybean crop - as many Wall Street analysts had expected.
But it was the nearly 65% jump in quarterly revenues in ADM's nutrition unit - particularly its Wild Flavors & Specialty Ingredients group - that officials highlighted. 
ADM and its peers, hit by a years-long crop supply glut, have been seeking to shed poor-performing assets and invest in businesses with the potential for higher profit margins, such as specialty food ingredients and flavorings.
Earlier this month, ADM unveiled a new corporate logo, and Chief Executive Juan Luciano on Wednesday touted how the 118-year firm was focusing on developing products for fast-growing consumer trends, ""from alternative proteins, to foods and beverages that enhance health, to unique products for pets.""
ADM, which took a $133 million asset impairment and restructuring charge in the quarter, is one of the so-called ""ABCD"" quartet of grain traders, alongside Louis Dreyfus Co ,  Bunge  Ltd (N:BG) and Cargill Inc (UL:CARG).
Net earnings rose 60% to $504 million, or 90 cents per share, for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31. On adjusted basis, the company earned 81 cents, beating analyst estimates of 69 cents, according to Refinitiv IBES.

Total revenue rose 2.4% to $16.33 billion.

The lender has been grappling with rising costs related to its fake-account scandal that erupted more than three years ago.
Earlier this month, new boss Charles Scharf set aside an additional $1.5 billion for legal costs, and said the bank's cost structure is simply too high.
The company had total long-term debt of $230 billion as of Dec. 31.
Its problems began to unfold in September 2016, when the bank revealed that employees had opened potentially millions of bogus accounts in customers' names without their permission to hit sales targets set by management.
Since then, Wells Fargo has found other problematic practices that cost customers money or otherwise harmed their financial well-being.
The mixed shelf will include securities warrants, debt securities and purchase contracts.
Under a shelf registration, a company may sell securities in one or more separate offerings with the size, price and terms to be determined at the time of sale."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Communications Commission plans to move ahead in February with a planned public auction to free up spectrum in the key C-band and could endorse ""low single-digit billion-dollar"" incentive payments to shift existing satellite users, a person familiar with the matter said.
The C-band is a block of spectrum used by satellite company customers to deliver video and radio programming to 120 million U.S. households. It is seen as the most likely short-term source of available spectrum for next-generation 5G use.
FCC officials briefed congressional staff last week that the commission believes it could cost about $4 billion to $5 billion to relocate satellite firms and is considering proposing ""low-single-digit billions"" in incentive payments to speed the transition.
The FCC does not think it needs new congressional legislation to move forward, the person said, and is considering funding the payments with a surcharge paid by winners of the spectrum action.
The FCC declined to comment.
Experts believe the C-band spectrum can be divided to maintain existing service and deliver 5G service. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said in November he supported a public auction of 280 megahertz of the C-band.
The FCC is expected to move forward on the auction at its February meeting and decide next week whether it will endorse incentive payments, the person said.
The FCC plans to finalize auction procedures in the coming months as it aims to launch the auction by year end.
Major satellite service providers including Intelsat SA (N:I), Telesat and SES SA, which form the ""C-Band Alliance,"" said last week they were seeking ""fair compensation"" to quickly clear the spectrum. They argue that without their cooperation, ""this critical 5G spectrum will not be made available for at least 10 years.""
They previously proposed selling the spectrum privately to wireless carriers, arguing a private sale would make the spectrum available faster for 5G. A spokesman for the C-Band Alliance said low-single-digit-billion incentive payments ""is not going to do it.""
Another satellite company, Eutelsat SA (PA:ETL), in a letter last Thursday to the FCC, proposed up to $7 billion in transition funds to ""quickly"" make spectrum available for 5G, including $4.5 billion in relocation costs.
Democratic U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell said in December a Republican bill approved by the Commerce Committee to set C-Band auction rules could give the satellite companies a ""windfall of up to $20-30 billion of the spectrum auction proceeds.""
A bill sponsored by Cantwell would limit payments to providers for costs they incur in relocating at up to $5 billion. "

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Michael Avenatti was bent on a big payday when he demanded millions of dollars for himself from  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE), a federal prosecutor told jurors on Wednesday in his opening argument at the extortion trial of the celebrity lawyer and prominent critic of U.S. President Donald Trump.
But a lawyer for Avenatti countered that the request was simply part of negotiations on behalf of Avenatti's client, Gary Franklin, a basketball coach in a Nike-sponsored youth basketball league, and that Avenatti could not be held criminally liable.
""It's true. Mr. Avenatti is brash,"" his lawyer Howard Srebnick told the six-man, six-woman jury in Manhattan federal court. ""Tenacious, bullish, hard charging ... At times he may be offensive. But that's not what we put people in prison for.""
Avenatti was charged with threatening to publicize his client's accusations that Nike illegally paid families of college basketball recruits, unless the apparel company paid $15 million to $25 million for him and celebrity lawyer Mark Geragos to conduct an internal probe, and paid Franklin $1.5 million.
Prosecutors also charged Avenatti with defrauding Franklin by concealing a settlement offer from Nike, so that Avenatti could seek millions for himself.
Nike has denied wrongdoing. The trial could last 2-1/2 weeks, and Avenatti could face more than 40 years in prison if convicted.
Avenatti became famous representing adult film actress Stormy Daniels in lawsuits against Trump, and Srebnick and Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Sobelman mentioned both in their opening arguments.
Sobelman told jurors that Avenatti leveraged his fame to ""shake down"" Nike and ""line his own pockets,"" in part because he had large debts and his law firm was struggling financially.
The prosecutor told jurors they would hear recordings made at Nike's behest of Avenatti making his demands.
""Why did the defendant do what he did? Simple. Money,"" Sobelman said.
Srebnick countered that Avenatti was simply fighting for ""a client who wanted justice"" by exposing corruption in youth basketball, and who wanted a high-profile lawyer to help him.
""He had a platform to expose what happened at Nike,"" Srebnick said, pointing several times at his client.
Avenatti looked in jurors' direction for nearly all of Srebnick's argument. Most focused on Srebnick.
Later this year, Avenatti faces separate criminal trials in Manhattan for allegedly defrauding Daniels out of book contract proceeds, and in California for defrauding other clients.
Avenatti was jailed and had bail revoked after his Jan. 14 arrest for an alleged bail violation in the California case. He is appealing the revocation."

(Reuters) -  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS) said it aims to more than double weekend deliveries in 2020 as package carriers look for ways to satisfy the always-on demands of e-commerce customers, including rising rival Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN). The world's biggest online retailer pioneered seven-day delivery in 2013, in partnership with the U.S. Postal Service (USPS), and is now spending billions of dollars to speed up its free shipping.
UPS added Sunday to its weekend services at the start of this year, following FedEx Corp (N:FDX), which did the same late last year.
""E-commerce spikes on the weekends, and retailers want those orders delivered sooner,"" UPS Chief Marketing Officer Kevin Warren said in a statement ahead of UPS and Amazon's quarterly reports on Thursday.
UPS said it aimed to expand its year-round Saturday service, which started in 2017, to 40 million more U.S. customers. The company declined to disclose its current weekend volume.
The average volume of overall U.S. weekend deliveries doubled to 13.5 million units between 2013 to 2019, consultancy ShipMatrix said. That was fueled by online retail sales, which surged 127% to almost $591 billion in 2019, according to research firm eMarketer.
UPS aims to attract more retailers that want to keep pace with Amazon shipping speeds, while holding on to its Amazon business, which accounts for almost 20% of company volume.
LensDirect.com Chief Executive Ryan Alovis said UPS's expanded weekend service means sunglass and contact lens orders that ship on Thursday or Friday hit customer doorsteps on Saturday instead of Monday, helping online retailers compete against Amazon.
""It has leveled the playing field,"" Alovis told Reuters.
EXPENSIVE
Weekend operations are more expensive because they skew toward one-off, far-flung residential deliveries - so UPS is attacking the costs, industry experts said.
Amazon, which itself delivered 3.5 billion packages globally last year, has cherry-picked desirable urban deliveries and left the costlier rural business to UPS, USPS and other providers.
The top hourly wage for UPS's unionized weekend drivers is around $32 per hour, about 15% less than weekday drivers' top rate but still well above the roughly $15 per hour that Amazon delivery drivers make.
UPS and FedEx need to add more packages per delivery to boost profits on residential shipments, said Dean Maciuba, a director at Logistics Trends & Insights. ""The thing preventing that from happening more quickly is Amazon,"" Maciuba said. Recent results from FedEx offered a cautionary tale.
The Memphis company in December slashed its 2020 profit forecast, blaming in part higher-than-expected startup costs for its residential service that delivered nearly 8 million packages on Sundays between Black Friday, which last year fell on November 29, and Christmas."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union wants to create a single market in data aimed at challenging the dominance of tech giants such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), according to a European Commission proposal seen by Reuters.
The proposal, which includes reining in big online platforms and could still be tweaked ahead of their presentation on Feb. 19, underlines the EU's determination to break U.S. tech giants' stranglehold on vast troves of data and better compete with Chinese rivals.
""Currently a small number of big tech firms hold a large part of the world's data. This is a major weakness for data-driven businesses to emerge, grow and innovate today, including in Europe, but huge opportunities lie ahead,"" a paper laying out the proposal said.
The 25-page document also underlined the urgency of the task ahead.
""Competitors such as China and the U.S. are already innovating quickly and projecting their concepts of data access and use across the globe,"" it said.
By capitalizing on Europe's vast quantities of industrial and professional data and technological innovation, the bloc can surge ahead, the document said.
""The winners of today will not necessarily be the winners of tomorrow,"" according to the paper.
It said the objective is ""to create a single European data space, a genuine single market for data"".
Measures to achieve that goal include an array of new rules covering cross-border data use, data interoperability and standards related to manufacturing, climate change, the auto industry, healthcare, financial services, agriculture and energy.
Other rules in the coming months will open up more public data on geospatial, the environment, meteorology, statistics and companies' data across the bloc for companies to use for free.
The document also proposed scraping relevant competition rules which hinder data sharing and possibly introducing rules to prevent large online platforms from unilaterally imposing conditions for access and use of data or benefiting in a disproportionate manner.
The European Commission and an expert group set up last year to assist it are now looking into the vast amount of data collected by big tech companies and the way they use and share the data.
""On the basis of this fact finding, the Commission will consider how best to address more systemic issues, including by ex ante regulation if appropriate, to ensure that markets stay open and fair,"" the paper said."

Investing.com - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results, but its share came under pressure amid slowing revenue growth in the wake of increased regulatory scrutiny. 

Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) announced earnings per share of $2.56 on revenue of $21.08 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $2.52 on revenue of $20.88 billion.
That compares to to EPS of $2.38 on revenue of $16.91 billion in the same period a year before. Facebook had reported EPS of $2.12 on revenue of $17.65 billion in the previous quarter.
Facebook's revenue was up 25% for the quarter, thanks to better-than-expected revenue per user. But this marked the slowest annual pace of revenue growth rate in its history.
The stock fell 6.4% postmarket.
Daily active users (DAUs), one of the key metrics that analysts use to gauge the health of the company, increased 9% from the year-ago period to 1.66 billion, slightly above estimates 1.65 billion. Monthly active users rose 8% to 2.5 billion, in line with estimates.
Family daily active people (DAP) rose 11% to 2.26 billion year on year on average for December 2019, and family monthly active rose 2.89 billion 9% year on year.
“We had a good quarter and a strong end to the year as our community and business continue to grow,” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement. “We remain focused on building services that help people stay connected to those they care about.”
Facebook has strived to maintain user growth at a time when regulatory scrutiny on social media platforms intensifies. But Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar maintains a positive view on the social media giant. 
""There's no sign the challenges for the world’s largest social media platform will disappear any time soon. However, despite this tough operating environment and the company’s cautionary tone, the reality is that there is no other platform for advertisers as powerful or as global as Facebook is. We don’t see that that power diminishing anytime soon, which is one of the main reasons we continue to like Facebook stock, notwithstanding the ups and downs,"" Anwar said
The company also announced the launch of a $10 billion stock buyback program. 

Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) shares are up 8% from the beginning of the year and are trading at $207.56, still down 0.41% from its 52 week high of $224.20 set on Jan. 29. They are outperforming the Nasdaq which is up 2.61% year to date.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended slightly lower on Wednesday, as an initial boost from the likes of Apple, Boeing and  General Electric  following their quarterly results faded in the wake of a policy announcement from the Federal Reserve.
Stocks initially showed little reaction to the Fed's policy statement but steadily lost ground on the heels of a news conference by chairman Jerome Powell. The Fed held rates steady as expected while offering no new guidance on its balance sheet, but Powell noted ""uncertainties about the outlook remain"" and noted the coronavirus outbreak in China.
Since the Fed's last rate cut in October, its third reduction of 2019, policymakers have agreed to keep their target policy rate in the current range of 1.50% and 1.75%. 
Apple Inc (O:AAPL) gained 2.09% after the iPhone maker late on Tuesday reported earnings for the holiday shopping quarter that topped analysts' expectations, even as it braced for more disruptions in virus-hit China.
 Boeing Co  (N:BA) rose 1.72% after the planemaker forecast nearly $19 billion in costs related to the grounding of its 737 MAX jets, smaller than what many analysts had expected, and helping offset the company's report of its first annual loss since 1997.
Several companies have warned of disruption to their operations due to the coronavirus outbreak, and a Chinese government economist was quoted as saying the country's economic growth may drop to 5% or even lower.
""I don’t mean to minimize the human impact of the virus but what is more concerning to me is not that the market has not responded to the virus but rather that it was up so strongly in the first 2-1/2 weeks of January after a very, very strong 2019,"" said Ellen Hazen, portfolio manager at F.L.Putnam Investment Management in Wellesley, Massachusetts. 
""The market does seem to have gotten ahead of itself."" 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 11.6 points, or 0.04%, to 28,734.45, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 2.84 points, or 0.09%, to 3,273.4 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 5.48 points, or 0.06%, to 9,275.16.
As earnings gather pace, analysts expect profit for S&P 500 companies to be flat in the fourth quarter, an improvement over the 0.6% decline estimated at the start of the season, according to Refinitiv data.
General Electric (N:GE) jumped 10.32% after the industrial conglomerate set a higher cash target for 2020.
 Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) dropped 2.12% after warning of a financial hit as it closed thousands of restaurants and adjusted operating hours in China.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.01-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.62-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 46 new 52-week highs and 8 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 80 new highs and 65 new lows. 

About 6.88 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 7.45 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Shares rose 6.75% in after-hours trading.
“Tesla is back on track after ramping up its production and building a factory in China that could prove a game-changer for the company’s long-term profitability,” Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar said.
It’s now “in a comfortable position to pursue its growth plans in 2020 after producing very strong numbers for the previous quarter,” he said. “The company's forecast for positive cash flows and its ability to sustain growth going forward offer substantive reasons for investors to feel bullish about Tesla stock. Barring any negative surprises down the road, Tesla is set for a smooth ride this year.""
The company said deliveries in 2020 should “comfortably exceed” 500,000 units, which is higher than estimates of around 475,000. Production will likely outpace deliveries this year.
Production of the Model Y crossover utility vehicle in the Fremont plant has begun and is ahead of schedule, Tesla said.
One concern may be that auto gross margin fell 30 basis points quarter over quarter to 22.5%.
The company has been trying to keep a tight lid on costs but has also been investing in initiatives such as a new factory in Shanghai, a Semi truck, an electric pickup truck, a new generation of the Tesla Roadster and automated driving features.
Total operating expenses rose less than 1% to $1.03 billion

Tesla shares are up 38% from the beginning of the year and are trading at $590.00, still down 2.29% from its 52-week high of $594.50 set on Jan. 22. They are outperforming the Nasdaq, which is up 2.61% year to date.

1209,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2020 02:23PM ET</span>","GE shares jump 10% on profit beat, higher 2020 cash target","By Alwyn Scott and Rachit Vats
(Reuters) -  General Electric  Co (N:GE) sold more investors on its turnaround story on Wednesday, sending shares 10% higher on its quarterly profit and cash results that beat forecasts, and its bullish cash target for 2020. 
The results marked a fourth consecutive quarter that GE beat its forecasts, reinforcing a view that Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp was making progress in rescuing the ailing maker of jet engines, power plants, medical imaging equipment and other industrial goods.
""It's still in a turnaround, but with each quarter of solid results, more people are getting on board with the turnaround story,"" said RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray.
Shares surged 10.2% to $12.92 in afternoon trading.
GE on Wednesday also said it would slash 737 MAX engine deliveries to  Boeing Co  (N:BA) roughly in half this year. But it still set a higher cash target for 2020 of $2 billion to $4 billion - above the $3 billion analysts expect on average. That helped fuel the share rise, said William Baird analyst Nick Heymann, who said the new target marked a confident step up from GE's 2019 target of $0 to $2 billion in cash.
GE's 2020 adjusted profit forecast, at 50 cents to 60 cents a share, was less than the 66-cent Wall Street average forecast. But much of the future depends on how events play out with the 737 MAX, the company said.
Culp said on a conference call that GE will slow production of its LEAP 1-B engine for the 737 MAX, but will keep its line running to protect suppliers and prepare for increasing engine output in the second half of the year. 
Boeing plans on the jet going back in service at airlines in the second half of 2020, and GE's forecasts rest on that timing, Culp said. GE plans a deeper outlook discussion for March 4. 
Meanwhile, GE is trying to tackle its problems by increasing ""operational rigor"" and lean manufacturing, Culp stressed on the call, suggesting simple measures such as calling on customers and collecting bills will improve performance. 
GE's power division has made progress in these areas, he said, but still needs work: It ""will be better next year from a cash perspective but still not positive.""
BEATS FORECASTS
GE's adjusted earnings totaled 21 cents a share, topping analyst estimates of 18 cents, according to data from Refinitiv.
Free cash flow from industrial operations was $3.9 billion in the fourth quarter, beating analysts estimates of $3.4 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
GE's cash flow typically surges in the fourth quarter as workers rush to ship units and book orders by year-end. 
Culp has vowed to smooth cash more evenly across the year, but ""the expectation was that this will still be an outsized cash flow quarter,"" said RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray.
In GE's power division, revenue fell 16% in the year and orders fell 25%, mainly due to the ""non-repeat"" of large orders last year, GE said. 
In aviation, GE's largest unit by revenue, orders rose 3% and revenue rose 8% in the year. The unit was, ironically, helped by the MAX grounding since its engines earn little or no profit and not delivering them improves margins, analysts said.
GE reported $2.3 billion in organic industrial free cash flow for 2019, topping its 2019 target. More than $800 million of the cash came from spending only $1.2 billion on restructuring last year, after originally planning to spend more than $2 billion.
""Technically, cash is getting better, but much of the gains come from reducing earlier guidance on costs,"" said John Inch, analyst at Gordon Haskett in New York. 
GE's total revenue fell about 1% to $26.24 billion.

Earnings from continuing operations attributable to GE shareholders rose to $663 million, or 7 cents a share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31 from $509 million, or 6 cents, a year earlier, GE said.

1213,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2020 01:55PM ET</span>",Boeing posts first annual loss in two decades as 737 MAX costs near $19 billion,"By Ankit Ajmera and David Shepardson
(Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) on Wednesday swung to its first annual loss since 1997 as 737 MAX costs doubled to nearly $19 billion, and the plane manufacturer indicated it would again cut production of its bigger 787 Dreamliner aircraft, currently its main source of cash.
Boeing, struggling to restore public confidence and recover from the biggest crisis in company history, has halted production of the once fast-selling 737 MAX which was grounded in March following two deadly crashes. The company is immersed in compensation talks with airline customers and dealing with lawsuits from victims' families and a criminal probe. 
Boeing shares were 1.2% higher, as some analysts had expected an even larger charge for 737 MAX costs. The stock has lost about a quarter of its value since early March 2019.
Deliveries of hundreds of jets remain frozen while Boeing updates the flight control system and software to address issues involved in both crashes.
President and CEO David Calhoun said he believes Boeing can win regulatory approval for the planes to fly again by mid-year. Boeing had initially targeted 737 MAX approval in 2019. That overly optimistic timeline, coupled with criticism that company culture valued profits over safety, contributed to former CEO Dennis Muilenburg's departure.
Calhoun, who served on Boeing's board for 10 years, dismissed suggestions that he was an ""insider"" ill-suited to introducing radical change and pledged to overhaul the culture.
""I think I watched the same movie you did,"" he told reporters.
Costs related to the 737 MAX grounding reached $14.6 billion in 2019 and the planemaker warned of another $4 billion in charges in 2020 due to the expense of slowly re-starting production. Boeing had estimated a $9.2 billion price tag for the MAX fallout in the third quarter. 
The amount does not include potential settlements or damages from more than 100 lawsuits the company faces from victims' families in both crashes, which together killed 346 people. Boeing is also the target of a U.S. criminal investigation into matters related to the 737 MAX.
It also remains to be seen whether passengers will be willing to fly in the 737 MAX once regulators approve Boeing's fixes.
""I can't market it or merchandise it or hang banners on it or change the name of it. That won't convince anybody. But when they see it operating and they see it flown and they see pilots getting on, I think we're gonna be okay,"" Calhoun said.
Boeing's core operating loss was $2.53 billion, or $2.33 per share, compared with a profit of $3.87 billion, or $5.48 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts on average expected Boeing to post earnings per share of $1.47 in the quarter, though several had predicted a loss amid a wide range of forecasts due to uncertainties over the cost of the 737 MAX crisis.
The company also booked more charges on its military tanker and space programs.
JETS AND CASH
Adding to Boeing's pain, demand for its bigger and more profitable jet - the 787 Dreamliner - has waned in the face of the U.S.-China trade war.
Boeing had already announced in October plans to lower the production rate for its 787 Dreamliner to 12 per month in late 2020 from 14 and now expects to cut the rate to 10 per month in early 2021, hurting cash flow at a time when its debt is mounting.
Boeing reported negative free cash flow of $2.67 billion for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a positive free cash flow of $2.45 billion a year earlier.
Cash flow recovery is not expected to start until 2021, Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith said on the call.
The MAX charges include $8.3 billion to compensate airline customers that are canceling flights and scaling back growth plans in a hit to profits while their MAX jets remain grounded.
U.S. airlines have taken the MAX off their schedules until early June and have said they need at least 30 days after regulatory approval to prepare their jets and train pilots. Boeing is recommending both simulator and computer-based training.
Calhoun said it would take about 18 months to work through its 737 MAX inventory once deliveries resume.
 General Electric  Co (N:GE) plans to slash 737 MAX engine deliveries to Boeing roughly in half this year. 
In a respite from the crisis over the MAX, Boeing successfully staged the first flight of a larger jet, the 777X, on Saturday. 
But Calhoun has sent the aerospace giant back to the drawing board on proposals for a new mid-market aircraft, effectively shelving in their current form plans worth $15 billion-$20 billion.
He told analysts the decision was not about him ""not wanting to do new airplanes. We'll do one.""

""But honestly right now it's all about the MAX.""

Investing.com - The S&P eased from highs Wednesday, as coronavirus fears kept a lid on gains, but investor sentiment was supported by a surge in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to record highs on bullish quarterly earnings.
The S&P 500 rose 0.27%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.27% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.38%.
Apple's better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter results released Tuesday saw its shares climb to record highs intraday, setting a positive tone for corporate earnings amid a slew of reports from blue chips like McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD),   General Electric   (NYSE:GE) and Boeing (NYSE:BA).
McDonald's rose 2% after its quarterly results and U.S. comparable-store sales topped Wall Street estimates, driven by price hikes at its U.S. stores.
GE surged 10% after its quarterly results beat on both the top and bottom lines, led by strength in its aviation business. The company also reported free cash flow of $3.9 billion, exceeding its target for the full year.
Boeing shrugged off weaker-than-expected results, rising about 3%, as the aircraft maker posted its first annual loss in more than a decade, owing to losses from the grounding of its 737 Max jets.
Chip stocks, however, gave up some gains from a day earlier, pressured by a slump in Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) as the chipmaker's earnings beat was overshadowed by signs of weakness in its gaming business ahead of the launch of new consoles.
Media stocks also suffered losses, led by a slump in AT&T (NYSE:T) following its quarterly earnings miss amid a loss in cable subscriptions as the cord-cutting phenomenon continued.
Bullish sentiment on stocks has been kept in check by signs that the coronavirus continues to spread, with the death toll in China rising to 132 and the number of infected topping 6,000.
Energy also stifled upside, as losses in oil prices fell in the wake of data showing a larger-than-expected build in weekly U.S. crude supplies at a time when many fear the virus outbreak in China will hamper travel, leading to lower oil demand.
The second-straight day of gains for the broader market following a rout on Monday comes just hours before the Federal Reserve is set to reveal its interest rate decision st 2 PM ET.
Investor attention will likely be drawn to Jerome Powell's press conference at 2.30 PM ET as the U.S. central bank is expected to keep rates steady."

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) said on Wednesday it will supply plant-based ""fried chicken"" to several KFC stores in Tennessee and North Carolina, after a test conducted last year showed strong consumer demand.
Fast-food chains including McDonald's, Burger King, and Dunkin Brands have raced to add imitation meat products to their menus as Americans cut down on animal protein consumption. While those companies have rolled out imitation pork or beef patties, Yum Brands Inc's KFC is the first to launch plant-based ""chicken.""
The product is 80 calories per piece and looks a bit like a fried chicken nugget, with a sinewy texture designed to feel like chicken. It will be available next month in dozens of stores in and around Nashville, Tennessee, and Charlotte, North Carolina, the companies said.
KFC said it would take what it learns from those markets to better understand how offering the imitation chicken will play out nationally.
Creating a muscle-like, fibrous texture is very important when imitating chicken, because that's what people have come to expect when they bite into a piece of meat, Beyond Meat Chief Executive Ethan Brown said in an interview.
Louisville, Kentucky-based KFC has over 23,000 stores in more than 140 countries, but traces its roots to a roadside restaurant and service station founder Colonel Harland Sanders ran in the 1940s.
A strong relationship with KFC could benefit Beyond Meat, which aims to work with the same fast-food chains globally and is expanding outside the United States. Beyond Meat's products are already sold in several Asian countries, and the company is eyeing entry into China, where KFC is the No. 1 fast-food chain.
YUM Brands shares were up 1.5% on Wednesday. Beyond Meat's stock rose as much as 3%, with gains dampened by Canadian coffee chain Tim Hortons saying late on Tuesday it had pulled Beyond Meat products from stores in Ontario and British Columbia.
Both companies said they expect strong demand for imitation chicken, given that last year's one-day test in Atlanta sold out in less than five hours. Several plant-based meat makers have had capacity issues due to unexpectedly high demand. The category is expected to be worth $140 billion over the next decade.
""Our intention is to not run out,"" said Andrea Zahumensky, KFC's chief marketing officer.
Los Angeles-based Beyond Meat, valued at about $5 billion after its May IPO, is planning facilities in the Netherlands and Canada. It previously told Reuters it hopes to be producing in Asia by the end of 2020."

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Wall Street investment banks JPMorgan (N:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) have been placed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange's ""named and shamed"" list after the $300 million initial public offering (IPO) of Chinese biotech company Akeso Inc. was sent back for not meeting the correct regulatory requirements.
A notice published on the Hong Kong exchange's website on Wednesday showed the IPO submission, which was sponsored by JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley, had been rejected and progress on its plans to list would now be delayed.
The New York legal firm, Davis Polk & Wardwell, had been hired to carry out the legal work on the deal.
Bankers and lawyers working in Hong Kong refer to the returned list as a ""named and shamed"" file because of the rarity of IPO submissions being sent back by the exchange.
The exchange's website shows just 11 IPOs have been sent back in the past six years, out of thousands lodged in that time, on Hong Kong's main while on the GEM board, a secondary index, only 10 have been returned during the same period.
In Hong Kong, sponsoring banks must conduct due diligence to assess the company being listed, and are responsible for assuring potential investors that its IPO prospectus is accurate.
Coincidentally, before Akeso was returned, JPMorgan was the only Western bank to have had an IPO returned after Shenhua Health was sent back by regulators in 2016. 
JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley declined to comment on the Akeso matter.
A Davis Polk spokeswoman did not immediately respond to Reuters.
Akeso, a clinical stage biotech company based in Guangdong that specialises in oncology and immunology, had filed its IPO documents last year to start trading on the Hong Kong market.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange did not publish reasons for the IPO having been returned and a spokesman declined to comment on Wednesday.
A source with direct knowledge of the matter said Akeso had submitted financial accounts with the exchange to meet its requirements for a listing in March.
However, the date was then changed to an April listing which meant the 2019 second half results should have been included in the submission but were left out.
Akeso is expected to lodge a new listing application shortly, however, under the Hong Kong Stock Exchange's rules the company must wait two months from when the issue was first raised which was Dec. 5.

1224,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2020 12:27PM ET</span>",Apple's iPhone strength is back and analysts say it is here to stay,"(Reuters) - Wall Street analysts were smitten by a rebound in sales of Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) iPhones after a year of decline and said strong demand for new models, spurred by trade-in programs and heavy discounts on older models, will drive growth this year.
At least 15 brokerages raised their price targets on the company's stock on Wednesday, with D.A. Davidson setting the most bullish price target of $385, well above the stock's current median price target of $325.
Sales were boosted by the first full quarter of iPhone 11, which is priced $50 less than its iPhone XR predecessor, said Gene Munster, a longtime Apple watcher and managing partner at Loup Ventures.
Shares of the company rose 3% to a record high of $327.25 in early trading, providing the biggest boost to the benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) index.
""We see Apple's December 2019 quarter as a microcosm for its calendar 2020 performance, with the iPhone, once again, returning to the front and center,"" D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte said.
Forte attributed part of the iPhone sales bounce to Apple's new credit initiatives, which enable consumers to purchase a phone and pay for it in monthly installments without paying interest.
Investors have fretted over the long-term growth prospects of Apple's phone business, which has been facing increased competition from cheaper phones from Samsung (KS:005930) and Huawei.
Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer said the widely touted release of a 5G iPhone later this year would likely boost demand.
Robust demand for iPhones and wearables, including AirPod wireless headphones, during the holiday season helped the company make up for weakness in its services revenue in the company's fiscal first quarter of 2020 reported on Tuesday.
The services business, which includes the Apple TV+ streaming service, iCloud storage and fees from app developers, has consistently grown over the past two years, reaching $12.7 billion in revenue in the quarter.
Cowen and Co analyst Krish Sankar noted that the services segment reached its $50 billion run rate target ahead of schedule, saying that the company's pivot to a content-focused recurring revenue model is a powerful long-term earnings driver.
Investors have become excited about services because they believe they will lead to durable profits: the services are sold as a subscription billed each month or year, with most consumers leaving them on autopilot, while a new phone or laptop is often a sporadic purchase every few years, subject to the whims of consumer sentiment."
1225,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2020 12:26PM ET</span>",AT&T revenue falls short ahead of HBO Max launch,"By Arriana McLymore and Neha Malara
(Reuters) - AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) missed fourth-quarter revenue estimates on Wednesday as another decline in subscriptions to satellite TV provider DirecTV overshadowed an increase in monthly phone customers.
AT&T has spent a combined $134 billion on DirecTV and Time Warner to transform itself into a media company, but is struggling to stem the loss of valuable satellite subscribers as audiences switch to streaming services. 
Analysts at New Street Research said in a note that although AT&T's wireless subscriber growth was strong, ""everything else"" was worse than expected. 
AT&T shares were down 3.1% to $37.37 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Revenue from the entertainment segment, which includes DirecTV, fell 6.1% from the year-ago quarter to $11.23 billion. 
AT&T said it lost 945,000 ""premium"" TV subscribers during the fourth quarter, including from DirecTV, and a smaller number of cable TV subscribers. Analysts at Cowen had estimated AT&T would lose a net 1 million premium TV customers, leaving the company with 19.4 million. 
To counter the loss of customers to streaming platforms like Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc's Prime, AT&T plans to launch its own HBO Max streaming platform in May. 
It said it added a net 229,000 new mobile phone customers in the quarter. Analysts had estimated an additional 145,000 phone subscribers, according to research firm FactSet.
AT&T reaffirmed its 2020 guidance, with plans to invest $1.5 billion to $2 billion on streaming content in 2020, and an additional $1 billion in 2021 and 2022. 
Total operating revenue in the quarter ended Dec. 31 fell 2.4% to $46.82 billion. Analysts were expecting $46.96 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
The WarnerMedia segment, which includes HBO, reported revenue of $8.92 billion, missing analysts' estimates of $9.03 billion. 
The company said it stopped licensing content, including the popular sitcom ""Friends,"" to other streaming services like Netflix as the launch of HBO Max nears. 
Although the licensing decision cut WarnerMedia's revenue, Chief Financial Officer John Stephens said the investment ""will make HBO Max even stronger, and pay off in the long term.""
Net income attributable to AT&T fell to $2.39 billion, or 33 cents per share, from $4.86 billion, or 66 cents per share, a year earlier.
AT&T reported a profit of 89 cents per share, beating Wall Street estimates of 87 cents per share. 

AT&T paid down $7.6 billion in debt during the fourth quarter, leaving $151 billion of net debt.

1226,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 29, 2020 12:17PM ET</span>","Trump Signs USMCA, Sealing Political Win With Bipartisan Deal","(Bloomberg) - President Donald Trump signed into law a new trade pact with Canada and Mexico on Wednesday, sealing a political victory that will help neutralize Democratic attacks on his economic record.
The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, delivers on one of Trump’s core campaign promises: to replace the Clinton-era North American Free Trade agreement that the president said has drained the U.S. of jobs.
“We are finally ending the Nafta nightmare,” Trump said Wednesday at a signing ceremony on the White House South Lawn. He then read through an extensive list of Republican lawmakers, thanking them for their help passing the deal.
The trade accord marks a rare moment of bipartisanship, but the two sides aren’t sharing the glory. The White House attendance list for the event included 71 Republican lawmakers but no Democrats, who say they weren’t invited. Representative Collin Peterson, the only remaining Democrat to vote against both articles of impeachment against Trump, said through a spokesman that he was invited but couldn’t attend. A White House spokesman didn’t immediately respond to questions on the invitations.
Democrats have taken aim at Trump’s economic policies -- including tax cuts that benefited corporations and the wealthy -- but attacking his approach to trade has proved more complicated as they compete for votes in swing states that have seen manufacturing jobs disappear.
Trump is scheduled to travel Thursday to Michigan and Iowa -- where he’s expected to tout the agreement just as Democrats try to win over voters in next week’s Iowa caucuses.
The White House was able to garner bipartisan support for the USMCA by adding labor safeguards and altering protections for drug patents. The pact provides expanded access for U.S. agricultural exports, new rules of origin for auto parts and additional protections for internet companies.
White House aides argue that the deal shows that Trump is continuing to get work done despite the ongoing Senate impeachment trial over his efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a chief 2020 rival for the White House.
“He’s talked about USMCA, and he talked about the pro-growth initiatives and the economy that has boomed under him. So he keeps working -- that’s fine,” White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said in an interview with Fox News last Friday. “They’ll continue to scream impeachment -- that’s fine.”
Economic Optimism
The new trade provisions are projected to add about 0.35% to the economy after six years. But the accord’s passage has had a more immediate effect on investors, easing concerns that Trump could disrupt the economy by pulling out of Nafta without a new deal in place.
Since Dec. 10 -- when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that she had struck a deal with the White House to pass the USMCA -- the S&P 500 Index has gained about 4.6% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average has improved more than 3%. Markets were also bolstered during that period by a “phase one” trade deal with China.
Speaking before the signing, Pelosi said Democrats only agreed to support the deal after the White House caved to their demands for greater protections for American workers and the environment.
“What the president is signing is quite different than what the president sent us,” Pelosi said at a press conference on Capitol Hill.
House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat, said “the only reason the president is having the signing is because of the work House Democrats” did to improve labor and environmental protections.
A record 56% of Americans approve of Trump’s handling of the economy, according to a Washington Post and ABC News poll released this week. That’s a 10 percentage point improvement from September. And optimism about the economy appears to be off-setting the political damage from impeachment. The president’s overall approval rating matched his record high of 44% in the same survey.At the same time, just 5% of Americans say they disapprove of the USMCA, according to a Monmouth University poll released Tuesday.
Those trends -- along with bipartisan congressional support for the pact -- have effectively made USMCA a non-issue in the Democratic primaries.
Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont was the only Democratic presidential candidate to oppose the deal. He said it was an improvement over Nafta but fell short of adequately protecting American jobs: “It is not going to stop outsourcing, it is not going to stop corporations from moving to Mexico.”
Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, initially joined Sanders in criticizing the deal. During a 2018 speech on foreign policy at American University in Washington, she said the agreement, as written, wouldn’t halt outsourcing, raise wages or create jobs. But in January, she announced she would vote for it. Her campaign said the revised deal dropped a provision that would make it harder to bring down prescription drug prices, and offered stronger labor standards and more certainty for farmers.
Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who is running as a centrist alternative to the progressive Sanders, said in December she would vote for the pact. A day later, her moderate rival, Joe Biden, joined in support, emphasizing the elimination of loopholes for drug companies and strengthening enforcement for labor and environmental standards.
“What I’ve seen change is that the vast majority of the labor movement supported it,” Biden told reporters in Los Angeles.
Swing State Impact
Trump is looking to press his advantage on the campaign trail Thursday. The president will speak first at a Michigan auto parts facility in Macomb County, where the largest employers are three major automakers -- General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)., Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. During Trump’s last visit to Michigan in December, he touted USMCA as “great for the automobile business.”
Later Thursday, the president will head to Iowa before that state’s first-in-the-nation presidential caucuses. He is expected to tout the trade deal’s benefits for farmers in the region.
While companies across the country could benefit from the pact, many of the advantages appear clustered in swing states that could prove pivotal in November’s presidential election.
Stricter rules for auto manufacturing are intended to bolster production in the U.S. as well as the use of American steel and aluminum, which could help states including Michigan and Pennsylvania.
According to the administration, the deal would create 76,000 auto jobs and result in $34 billion in new automotive manufacturing investments. It also opens Canada’s market to U.S. dairy producers, an important issue for Wisconsin, and is expected to create 176,000 new jobs.
The president’s victory tour begins with Wednesday’s ceremony at the White House, but his signature won’t finalize the agreement. Canada still must ratify the deal, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau -- who lost his parliamentary majority in October elections -- may need to broker deals with his political rivals to ensure passage."

(Reuters) - McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) beat quarterly sales forecasts on Wednesday and said it would spend more on technology and research in 2020, as the world's largest burger chain bets on revamped stores and menu additions to lure diners and gain market share.
McDonald's Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski, who took charge in November after the former CEO was dismissed, said global comparable sales growth in 2019 was the chain's highest in more than 10 years.
But the company continues to battle lower U.S. store traffic and faces stiff competition in breakfast against rivals including  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) and Dunkin' Brands Group Inc (O:DNKN), as well as the Wendy's Co (O:WEN) impending launch into morning menu items.
""Breakfast remains the area of focus to further improve U.S. traffic,"" Guggenheim analyst Matthew DiFrisco said. 
Over the past few years, McDonald's has added kiosks, digital displays and delivery partners, as well as new burgers, beverages and breakfast foods. 
It also began modernizing stores across the globe and bought two smaller technology firms that focus on digitizing stores and drive-thru menus.
Sales in U.S. restaurants open for more than 13 months rose 5.1% for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, slightly above the estimate of a 4.67% increase.
Still, the number of customers at its U.S. restaurants fell 1.9% in the quarter, though that was better than the 2.2% decline for 2018.
""Returning to guest count growth in the U.S. remains our top priority,"" Chief Financial Officer Kevin Ozan said in a post-earnings conference call. 
McDonald's reported a 5.9% rise in global comparable sales, both for the full year and the fourth quarter, beating analysts' forecast for a 5.23% growth, according to IBES Refinitiv.
The stock gained 11.3% in 2019, lagging the broader S&P 500 restaurants index <.SPLRCREST> that rose nearly 22% last year. Shares were up 2.7% at $216.12 on Wednesday morning.
CHINA CORONAVIRUS IMPACT The deadly coronavirus in China led McDonald's to close all of its restaurants - several hundred - in the Hubei province, where the outbreak is centered.
Remaining McDonald's stores - about 3,000 - in the rest of China are still open, Kempczinski said.
The virus, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has spread across the world and prompted companies to close stores and restrict travel.
Starbucks on Tuesday said it expected a material, though temporary, impact to its 2020 finances as the virus led it to close about 2,000 stores there.
However, for McDonald's, China makes up only about 4% to 5% of systemwide sales and 3% of operating income. In early 2017 it sold 80% of its business there, though it still collects royalty fees and considers China important for potential growth.
In the United States, about 70% of its 14,000 stores have finished upgrading to more modern counters and dining areas.
This year, it expects to spend about $2.4 billion on capital expenditures, about the same amount as last year. About half of that will be in the United States. 

It also plans to open about 1,400 new restaurants in 2020, mostly outside the United States.

1229,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2020 11:43AM ET</span>",Goldman Sachs sets growth targets but urges investor patience,"By Elizabeth Dilts Marshall and Matt Scuffham
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) on Wednesday set targets to grow its fledgling consumer unit and transaction banking business while improving efficiency and returns to shareholders, but urged patience at its first-ever investor day presentation.
""We are planting seeds that will take time to mature and grow,"" Chief Executive Officer David Solomon said in an address to investors, some of whom have complained that the Wall Street powerhouse has been too slow to shift its focus away from volatile trading into the more stable consumer area. Solomon succeeded Lloyd Blankfein in October 2018.
Goldman Sachs shares, which have underperformed rivals, gave up early gains and slid 0.6 percent in mid-morning trade.
Goldman has been slower than its Wall Street rivals to develop retail banking and respond to the changing trading environment. Wednesday was an opportunity to present plans bank executives say will grow deposit balances at its consumer bank to $125 billion or more over the next five years. It targeted increasing consumer loans and card balances to more than $20 billion during the same period.
Goldman also unveiled financial targets and details on its other multibillion-dollar businesses. Its decision to hold an investor day and to set broad goals was an effort to address investor grievances about a lack of transparency.
""We believe investor patience will be important as these targets will likely be (met) toward the end of the three-year period due to the investments in and ramping (up) of ... consumer banking and transaction services,"" said Glenn Schorr, analyst at  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) ISI. 
Goldman said it is aiming for a 60% efficiency ratio over the next three years, while it projected an over 13% return on equity (ROE) and over 14% return on tangible equity, which are key measures of profitability. A lower efficiency ratio means a bank is better at managing its costs relative to revenue.
Analysts noted that Goldman's improved shareholder returns target was still short of the 17 percent medium term target set by rival JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM).
In the longer term, defined as five years or more, Goldman said it was aiming for ""mid-teen returns"" of newer businesses such as transaction banking and the consumer bank.
Goldman also plans to pull in $1 billion in revenue through lower interest expenses, according to its presentation. 
""We view these targets as approximating expectations,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts Jason Goldberg said in a research note.
Solomon said the bank's third-party alternatives investment business could add $100 billion in net inflows over time.
Trading revenues still make up roughly 40% of Goldman's revenues, but securities division executives said they are ""acutely aware"" the market for trading is shrinking and growing more competitive with the trend toward passive investing. 
Chief Operating Officer and President John Waldron said the bank was taking a ""patient, methodical, long term approach"".
Investors had been eager to hear more about the consumer bank, which consists of Goldman's online bank Marcus and its credit card with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). 
Marcus is a central pillar of Solomon's vision for Goldman, whose 151-year history has had very little to do with Main Street. Analysts believe it will take at least a decade for the consumer bank to become as substantial as other major businesses.
In the year ended Dec. 31, Goldman's consumer deposits stood at $60 billion and it issued $7 billion in loans and credit card balances during the fourth quarter. 

At the moment, the consumer bank generates just 2.4% of Goldman's annual revenue.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Interior Department is grounding its fleet of about 800 Chinese-made drones but will allow their use for emergency situations, the department said on Wednesday.
U.S. Interior Secretary David Bernhardt issued an order affirming a temporary cessation of non-emergency operations adopted in October as it ensures ""cybersecurity, technology and domestic production concerns are adequately addressed,"" the department said.
The order allows for approved situations for emergency purposes, such as fighting wildfires, search and rescue, and dealing with natural disasters that may threaten life or property."" It also allows for training operations.
Bernhardt in October also ordered a halt to additional Interior department purchases of Chinese-made drones.
China's SZ DJI Technology Co Ltd, the world’s largest maker of consumer drones, said in a statement on Wednesday it is ""extremely disappointed"" in the Interior order that ""inappropriately treats a technology's country of origin as a litmus test for its performance, security and reliability.""
The company added that the concerns have ""little to do with security and are instead part of a politically-motivated agenda to reduce market competition and support domestically produced drone technology, regardless of its merits.""
In May 2019, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security warned U.S. firms of the risks to company data from Chinese-made drones. In a notice, DHS said U.S. officials have ""strong concerns about any technology product that takes American data into the territory of an authoritarian state that permits its intelligence services to have unfettered access to that data or otherwise abuses that access.""
Bernhardt's order said the department will issue implementing guidance within 30 days.
The order noted that Interior uses drones for ""assessing, collecting, and maintaining information that relates to our critical American energy, transportation, and defense infrastructure.""
Some information collected during drone operations ""has the potential to be valuable to foreign entities, organizations, and governments,"" it added.
In June, U.S. President Donald Trump said that ""domestic production capability for small unmanned aerial systems is essential to the national defense."""

""I want the EU and the UK to stay good friends and good partners,"" she said. ""We will always love you and we will never be far, long live Europe."""
1232,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2020 11:12AM ET</span>",Warren Buffett gives up on newspapers; Berkshire sells unit to Lee Enterprises,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) agreed to sell its newspaper business to  Lee Enterprises  Inc (N:LEE) for $140 million in cash, abandoning an industry the billionaire investor had long defended even as its financial prospects deteriorated.
The transaction includes 31 daily newspapers and 49 weeklies including the daily Omaha World-Herald in Berkshire's hometown in Nebraska, Buffalo News in New York, Richmond Times-Dispatch in Virginia and Tulsa World in Oklahoma.
Lee owns 50 daily newspapers including the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, and has since July 2018 managed Berkshire's papers other than the Buffalo News, which Berkshire bought in 1977.
As part of the transaction, Berkshire will also become Lee's sole lender, refinancing the Davenport, Iowa-based company's existing debt and lending $576 million at a 9% interest rate.
A closing is expected in mid-March. Lee shares more than doubled in early trading on Wednesday and were last up 67 percent at $2.10.
Berkshire has more than 90 operating businesses such as the BNSF railroad and Geico auto insurer, and bought most of its newspapers in the last decade.
While newspapers are a small part of the conglomerate, it nonetheless remains unusual for Buffett, who delivered newspapers as a teenager, to sell an entire operating business.
Berkshire did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Buffett tells shareholders on Berkshire's website that he has ""no interest at all"" in selling good businesses, and is ""very reluctant to sell sub-par businesses"" expected to generate cash, be run well and have good labor relations.
But he has lamented the newspaper industry's decline, as the Internet deprives traditional newspapers of revenue streams.
He told Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) Finance last April that the industry was ""toast,"" and told Berkshire shareholders in May 2018 that only the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times and perhaps the Washington Post had digital models strong enough to offset declining print circulation and ad revenue.
Buffett invested in the Washington Post's former publisher for four decades and sat on its board, and was a confidant of one-time chief executive Katharine Graham.
Employment in Berkshire's newspaper units fell 23% to 3,685 at the end of 2018 from 4,761 three years earlier.
The World-Herald was not spared. Dozens of jobs have been eliminated, including nearly all its business reporters, and the newspaper no longer covers Berkshire frequently. Journalists there voted to unionize in October 2018.
In a statement, Buffett said Berkshire had ""zero interest"" in selling to anyone other than Lee.

""No organization is more committed to serving the vital role of high-quality local news, however delivered, as Lee,"" he said.

In large part, that was due to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which rose 1.6% after posting better-than-expected results for its fiscal first quarter after the closing bell on Tuesday. The news still wasn’t quite enough to push it to a new all-time high, but strong sales at its core iPhone division, along with wearables and accessories such as its AirPods ear buds, overshadowed any concerns about possible supply disruptions at its China-based suppliers.
Mastercard fell 0.4% despite posting a 12% increase in gross dollar volume for purchases made with its cards over the holiday period. Sales rose a particularly strong 29% in Europe, despite the sustained weakness of domestic consumption in key markets.
Fallen giants Boeing (NYSE:BA) and   General Electric   (NYSE:GE) also contributed to the advance. Boeing stock rose 2.6% after saying it took a total of $19 billion in charges due to the 737 MAX affair last year. While they pushed the compay to its worst annual result in over two decades, it was still less than some analysts had estimated.
For its part, GE stock rose 9.8% to its highest since October after the company announced a big increase in industrial cash flow at the end of the year. That outweighed a forecast that suggested cash flow and underlying earnings will fall in 2020, even though operating margins are set to expand further.
One underperformer was Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), which unveiled a medium-term target of a 14% return on tangible equity at its first-ever investor day. That’s some way below JPMorgan’s target of 17% and only just in line with Morgan Stanley’s 13%-15%. Goldman Sachs stock was down 0.7%.
Other stocks struggling included chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX). AMD stock fell 7.8% to an eight-week low after disappointing fourth-quarter sales at the unit that makes chips for data centers. Investors have been betting on AMD challenging Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) for supremacy in that lucrative and fast-growing business. Meanwhile, Xilinx stock fell 9.4% after its quarterly update exposed the damage to it from U.S. government restrictions on sales to Huawei, previously one of Xilinx’s biggest customers.
Elsewhere, futures on the dollar index breached 98.00 for the first time since early December but retreated slightly to 97.895, up less than 0.1% on the day. U.S. crude oil futures fell 0.4% to $53.28 while gold futures edged 0.1% higher to $1,571.75 a troy ounce."

MILAN (Reuters) - Luxury eyewear group Italia Independent (MI:IINT) is hoping to borrow some of Cristiano Ronaldo's star appeal.
On Wednesday it announced a five-year licensing agreement with the Portuguese forward as it strives to boost revenues after heavy losses last year.
Under the deal, Ronaldo is to design a sunglass collection under his CR7 brand, known for luxury underwear.
The market received the news enthusiastically. Shares were automatically suspended on Milan's AIM platform for smaller companies on Wednesday after excessive pre-session trading.
Founded by Lapo Elkann, grandson of the late Fiat patriarch Gianni Agnelli, Italia Independent in September reported a 4.4 million euros ($4.9 million) core operating loss in the first half of 2019.
In response, it launched a four-year turnaround plan aiming to more than double its revenue to 42 million euros by 2023.
Elkann, famed for his flamboyant fashion sense, said in a statement the licensing deal had ""extraordinary importance"" for the company's growth plans.
Ronaldo's playing prowess as well as his established marketing appeal helped revenue at his side Juventus (MI:JUVE), also controlled by the Agnelli family, to grow by 16.5% last year, according to data from consultancy firm Deloitte."

1236,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2020 09:06AM ET</span>",Factbox: Electric vehicle subsidies under pressure in some Tesla core markets,"(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's has steadily increased the sale of its electric vehicles, boosted by demand for its mass-produced Model 3 sedans as overseas sales pick up, and delivering more than 360,000 vehicles last year.
But analysts say demand for electric vehicles may sour as some governments around the world dial back subsidies. 
Below is a summary of electric vehicle subsidy policies in Tesla's core countries ranked by market size, according to analyst estimates and country vehicle registration data.
USA
The U.S. federal government is subsidizing electric cars with a $7,500 consumer tax break for the first 200,000 vehicles an automaker sells. Once the threshold is met, the tax credit is cut by half for all vehicles sold over the next six months and is then halved again for another six months before running out completely.
The U.S. Congress at the end of 2019 declined to extend the cap to 600,000 electric vehicles per carmaker. 
So far, only Tesla and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) have hit the cap. Subsidies for Tesla finished at the end of 2019, while those for GM will run out on March 31. 
NORWAY
Tesla has seen soaring demand from Norway, where electric cars made up more than 40% in sales last year, a global record. 
The country has exempted battery-powered vehicles from the 25% value-added tax imposed on petrol and diesel engines, as well as other taxes levied on car purchases. 
The government originally considered phasing out some of those incentives by the end of 2019, but has since agreed to extend all tax exemptions until the end of 2021. Some political parties have called for a gradual reduction of incentives from 2022 onwards, although no plans are yet in place.
CHINA
Beijing has been slowly rolling back a generous five-year subsidy program for so-called new energy vehicles (NEVs), which began in 2016. It plans to phase out subsidies after 2020 amid criticism that some firms have become overly reliant on the funds. But China said it would not cut subsidies again this summer, an approach cheered by automakers.
Tesla's China-built Model 3 cars will still receive subsidies as part of the government's NEV program, the company said in December.
Sales of electric and hybrid vehicles in 2019 dropped for the first time in more than two years as the subsidy cuts reached new levels and have continued falling since. 
CANADA
The Canadian government last year passed a zero-emission incentive program under which buyers could receive as much as $5,000 in rebates for electric cars, and up to $2,500 in plug-in hybrids.
While those rebates only apply to cars below a purchase price of $45,000, the government has issued exemptions for some models up to $55,000.
The Model 3, starting at $35,000, is currently the only Tesla vehicle receiving a rebate of $5,000, according to government information.
NETHERLANDS
The Dutch government has extended an exemption for electric cars on purchase and motor vehicle taxes until 2025.
But the country in September decided to dial back income tax incentives for the private use of company cars beginning in 2020. 
Under the new plan, those rates will steadily increase to be even with conventional cars in 2026. At the same time, the price for eligible electric company cars is dropping to 45,000 euros ($49,923) this year and 40,000 euros in 2021.
The Tesla Model 3, which retails for nearly 49,000 euros in the Netherlands, is therefore no longer eligible for company car benefits. Model 3 sales spiked significantly ahead of the incentive phase out, according to data from the Netherlands Vehicle Authority.
UNITED KINGDOM
The British government reduced its subsidies for electric cars at the end of 2018, but still offers rebates of up to 3,500 pounds ($4,600) for 31 vehicle models.
The UK is one of the few European countries, where all Tesla models are eligible for the rebate, according to the government. 
GERMANY
Electric vehicles in Germany are currently subsidized with a 4,000 euro ($4,437) grant while buyers of plug-in hybrids receive 3,000 euros – if the vehicle costs less than 60,000 euros. 
That puts Tesla's pricier Model S (which starts retailing for 86,800 euros in Germany) out of reach, but at a starting price of 44,400 euros the Model 3 is eligible. 
The subsidies are split evenly between the German federal government and the carmaker.
The government in November made plans to increase the grants by half over the five years from 2020. 

But the German government said it is still awaiting approval by the European Commission on those increases.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Large options trades some people have attributed to the mysterious investor known as ""50 Cent"" have become more profitable in recent days, as fears of the economic impact of the coronavirus injected volatility back into stock markets.
Earlier this month, at least one investor bought large blocks of February calls on the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) at a price of around 50 cents each. 
The calls, which increase in value when the VIX rises, would be redeemable should the VIX hit 22 by late February. Known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” the index typically rises when markets grow turbulent.
The VIX ended Tuesday's session at 16.28, down 2.74 points from yesterday's three-month high.
In total, there were last about 331,000 contracts open on those calls, most of which were purchased around the same price, according to options analytics provider Trade Alert.
Pravit Chintawongvanich, equity derivatives strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), said the transaction resembles past moves by an enigmatic investor some market participants have dubbed “50 Cent,” known for purchasing large blocks of VIX options at prices near 50 cents. 
A trader believed to be 50 Cent made similar big purchases last summer and in the months leading up to a market selloff in February 2018.
According to Trade Alert, the VIX calls traded as high as $1.15 on Monday, so in total they could have generated some $21 million in profit if the calls were sold. However, there was ""no sign of liquidation,"" Trade Alert founder Henry Schwartz wrote. The calls were trading between 70 and 80 cents late Tuesday, as U.S. stock markets rebounded.
""They would basically need a much bigger market reaction to make any meaningful profit on those trades,"" Chintawongvanich said. The block trades are likely a portfolio hedge rather than a bet on a spike in volatility, he added.
On Monday and Tuesday, at least one investor bought large blocks of March VIX calls, at 57.5 cents and 59 cents, which would require the index to reach 28 before they could be redeemed. Outside of those trades, it was not evident that investors are loading up on downside protection at this point.

""When the VIX stays below 17, that's pretty sedate,"" said Jim Carney, CEO of hedge fund Parplus Partners.

Investing.com - The full cost for Boeing (NYSE:BA) due to the grounding of its best selling plane, the 737 Max, was laid bare in its fourth quarterly results Wednesday, with the company posting its first annual loss in more than two decades.

Boeing (NYSE:BA) announced a loss per share of $2.33 in the fourth quarter, on revenue of $17.91 billion, a drop of 37%. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated earnings per share of $0.6 on revenue of $21.65 billion. The company also detailed the costs associated with the grounding of the series, taking a total charge of $18.6 billion. This resulted in an annual net loss of $3.47 a share, the first since 1997.

Boeing (NYSE:BA) shares bounced after early losses. At 08:10 AM ET (1310 GMT) the shares stood 2.5% higher at $324, still quite a bit lower than its 52 week high of $446.01 set on March 1, 2019, just before the second fatal crash involving the 737 MAX.
""We recognize we have a lot of work to do,"" said Boeing (NYSE:BA) President and Chief Executive Officer David Calhoun. ""We are focused on returning the 737 MAX to service safely and restoring the long-standing trust that the Boeing brand represents with the flying public.""
Calhoun took the helm earlier this month after previous chief Dennis Mullenburg was ousted for his handling of the Max crisis late last year.

And while these figures are horrendous, there could be more to come.
""We don't think Boeing (NYSE:BA) can reach full operational normalcy in the near-term — and one of the main impediments in this process is regaining public trust,"" said Haris Anwar, an analyst at Investing,com ""Boeing is certainly capable of solving the technical issues required to make the MAX a viable revenue generator again, but that process is also closely tied with winning back public confidence.""

The 737 MAX series has been grounded since March following two fatal crashes. The company is suggesting a return to service in the summer, but has already been forced more than once to push back its timeline after a series of embarrassing disclosures about how it treated regulatory approval process in the past.

Boeing's report follows an earnings beat by United Technologies on Tuesday, who reported EPS of $1.94 on revenue of $19.55B, compared to forecasts EPS of $1.84 on revenue of $19.4B.
ASML ADR had missed expectations on January 22 with fourth quarter EPS of $2.99 on revenue of $4.47B, compared to forecast for EPS of $3.01 on revenue of $4.35B.

1242,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2020 08:16AM ET</span>",European insurers may need to beef up protection for policyholders: EU,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Insurers in Europe may need to put aside money to protect their policyholders should they become insolvent, and regulators should be able to be shut them down swiftly without the need for taxpayer bailouts, a top EU official said on Wednesday.
However the European insurance industry body said it opposed such moves, saying there were already safeguards in place and that the new requirements could hit the sector's global competitiveness.
Valdis Dombrovskis, vice president of the European Commission and responsible for financial services, said the 11-trillion-euro ($12.2 trillion) European insurance sector faced growing cyber and climate risks.
The European Union is about to review its four-year old capital rules for insurers known as Solvency II, and Dombrovskis said a gap may need plugging.
""There is no EU-wide resolution regime for the insurance sector in the event of distress, and no minimum EU rules on insurance guarantee schemes,"" he said in a speech in Brussels.
The bloc introduced a ""recovery and resolution"" regime for banks after the 2007-09 financial crisis, a set of requirements that enable regulators to close down ailing lenders in a quick and orderly way without taxpayer bailouts.
An insurance guarantee scheme, already available in some EU states, provides last-resort protection to consumers when an insurer becomes insolvent and unable to pay out on a policy.
""If every EU country had insurance guarantee schemes, it would benefit policyholders, taxpayers and the insurance sector as a whole,"" Dombrovskis said.
EU states and the European Parliament are already looking at this concept as they finalise new rules for car insurance, he said. The bloc's insurance regulator EIOPA has been asked for advice on creating a resolution system.
However trade body Insurance Europe said there was already a global framework for dealing with systemic risks and EIOPA wanted to ""gold plate"" it.
""Given all the protection already offered by Solvency II, this makes no sense and is definitely not helpful to EU insurers' global competitiveness,"" Insurance Europe president Andreas Brandstetter said.
The review will also look at whether requirements on insurers to report data on their activities could be lightened.
But Dombrovskis said he will ask an EU advisory body on accounting to work on new standards requiring insurers and other companies to give ""sufficient and reliable"" information on sustainability issues.
The EU will assess how insurers integrate climate and environmental risks, and how to strengthen the sector's resilience to natural disasters, Dombrovskis said.
Insurance Europe says Solvency II is too punitive in capital requirements on long-term savings and investments, and Dombrovskis said these issues would be looked at.
The European Commission has powers to propose changes to Solvency II that would need approval from EU states and the European Parliament, a process that would take several years."

Shares of the company jumped 13% in premarket trading.
The discussions are ongoing and could result in a full or partial sale of Victoria's Secret, the WSJ reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
Wexner, 82, has been leading the company since 1963.
More recently Wexner was in focus for his association with the late financier Jeffrey Epstein, who was entrusted with managing the billionaire's personal finances and served as trustee of his charitable foundation.
Epstein was arrested and charged last year with trafficking dozens of underage girls as young as 14 from at least 2002 to 2005.
L Brands did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.
Sales at Victoria's secret have fallen for at least four quarters as it grappled with rising competition and struggled to maintain a strong brand image.

Victoria's Secret accounted for nearly half of the company's revenue of $13.24 billion in 2019.

9:00 AM ET: Mastercard (NYSE:MA) stock rose 0.9% after the company reported a 12% increase in gross dollar sales volumes in the fourth quarter to $1.73 trillion. Sales rose 28% in Europe and 9% in the U.S. Adjusted earnings and revenue both came in slightly ahead of market forecasts.
8:56 AM ET: Dow's (NYSE:DOW) stock rose 3.4% after the chemicals and plastics company said earnings and revenue fell by less than expected in the fourth quarter.
CEO Jim Fitterling said the company would continue to cut costs in the current year, while prioritizing consumer-facing sectors for investment after declines in sales at its wholesale plastics and polymers operations in the final quarter.
8:47 AM ET: Anthem (NYSE:ANTM) stock fell 3.6% after the health insurer gave disappointing guidance for the current year. It forecast adjusted profit to be “above $22.30” per share, compared to consensus estimates of $22.71.
The outlook overshadowed fourth-quarter results that were ahead of market expectations, thanks to a rapid rollout of its pharmacy benefits management business IngenioRx.
8:43 AM ET: AT&T (NYSE:T) stock fell 1.5% after its fourth-quarter earnings were hit by a big drop in its PayTV subscribers – further evidence (after Comcast's update last week) that the proliferation of video streaming services is cannibalizing legacy TV businesses faster than the industry expected. 
Earnings per share were 1c ahead of consensus forecasts, but revenue missed expectations and the company’s guidance gave no indication that it would be able to improve the speed at which it’s cutting its debt burden. Net debt is forecast in a range of 2 to 2.25 times EBITDA by 2022.
8:15 AM ET: L Brands (NYSE:LB) stock rose 9.9% to a five-month high after The Wall Street Journal reported that founder Leslie Wexner is in talks to step down as CEO and find a buyer for the company that owns struggling lingerie chain Victoria’s Secret.
8:11 AM ET: Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) stock fell 8.0% to an eight-week low after the chipmaker posted a sharper-than-expected decline in sales in the fourth quarter, something it blamed on a slowdown in 5G investments and government restrictions on its business with China’s Huawei. Profit fell 32%, less than feared.
Analysts estimate Huawei had accounted for as much as 8% of Xilinx’s total revenue before U.S. restrictions forced it to source chips from companies outside the U.S.
8:03 AM ET: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock rose 1.7% to within touching distance of its record-high level of $323.32, after posting earnings for its fiscal first quarter that were 10% ahead of expectations. The company also beat on revenue after strong performances from its app store as well as its wireless AirPods and its core smartphone business.
CEO Tim Cook acknowledged the impact of the coronavirus but said the company has alternatives to its suppliers in Wuhan, the city at the center of the outbreak. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) expects revenue for the current quarter to be between $63 and $67 billion, an unusually wide range that reflects the uncertainties created by the virus.
7:56 AM ET: Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock rose 1.6% after an otherwise dismal quarterly report at least included no further delays to the expected timeline for the 737 MAX’s return to service. The company lost $636 million in 2019, its worst financial result in some 20 years, while net debt rose 10% and operating cash flow turned negative to the tune of $2.4 billion. Revenue at the defense and space division also declined.
“We recognize we have a lot of work to do,"" said Boeing (NYSE:BA) President and Chief Executive Officer David Calhoun, who took over after the ousting of Dennis Muilenberg on Christmas Eve. “Fortunately, the strength of our overall Boeing portfolio of businesses provides the financial liquidity to follow a thorough and disciplined recovery process.”
The stock is still down 29% from its peak in February last year.
7:49 AM ET: Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock fell 4.6% after the chipmaker disappointed hopes that it will challenge Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) for primacy in the high-margin business of selling chips to data centers. The company said quarterly sales at the unit that includes data center chips were well short of expectations, and also predicted a drop in unit sales in the current quarter.
7:42 AM ET: McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) stock fell 0.2% despite reporting comparable sales growth of 5.9% in the three months through December, above expectations of 5.2% and the highest global sales growth in more than 10 years.
7:34 AM ET (1234 GMT):   General Electric   (NYSE:GE) stock rose 6.8% after the company’s fourth-quarter earnings beat expectations, helped by a strong performance by its aviation business. The company said it expected underlying earnings per share to fall this year to around 55c from 65c in 2019, although it said operating margins would improve again. It also predicted a wide range of $2 billion to $4 billion for industrial cash flow, a measure that analysts use to track the health of its individual businesses.

A pan-European equity index rose 0.5%, extending Tuesday's 0.8% rise. Bank shares gained almost 1%, thanks to upbeat results from Spain's Santander (MC:SAN), and Swedbank a day earlier.

Equity futures suggest a stronger open for U.S. shares, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq up 0.5%.
Tuesday's rise was aided by robust earnings from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Of the 104 U.S.companies to report results so far, 68.3% have exceeded expectations, and earnings expectations for the quarter have been upgraded.
""The numbers look pretty solid at the start of the earnings season,"" said Neil Campling, an equity analyst at Mirabaud. ""But there is obviously caution as further news comes out of China regarding the coronavirus.""
The S&P 500 remains 3% below record highs. Investors are looking for earnings from 47 S&P 500 firms on Wednesday, including Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Boeing (NYSE:BA),  General Electric  (NYSE:GE), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), McDonald’s and AT&T (NYSE:T).
Earlier, Chinese equity futures traded in Singapore rebounded from two days of losses to rise 1.79%, the biggest gain in almost seven weeks. Mainland markets remained shut. 
""There appears to be more transparency, communication in terms of the virus, and that makes it easier to start assessing the economic fallout. So the markets have taken some comfort from that,"" said Rainer Guntermann, a rates strategist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Frankfurt.
He was comparing the coronavirus response with Beijing's secretive stance during the 2003 outbreak of the SARS virus, which enabled it to spread faster and claim more victims. 
FEARS STILL LINGER
Risk aversion has not completely lifted. With the number of coronavirus fatalities https://tmsnrt.rs/3aIRuz7 now at 132 and 6,000 cases reported worldwide, there are fears the outbreak could inflict serious damage on Chinese growth, already at three-decade lows. 
A Reuters poll predicts Chinese manufacturing stalled in January, after some recovery towards the end of 2019. Several Hong Kong-listed firms warned of damage to profits, and Apple CEO Tim Cook warned of supply chain disruptions.
In currencies, the offshore-traded yuan was little changed at 6.9620 per dollar but held off a one-month low reached earlier this week. Australia's dollar, which fell to three-month lows this week because of its trade and investment links with China, rose 0.2%. 
The safe-haven yen was flat but stayed below two-week highs touched on Monday. The U.S. dollar index edged off two-month highs.
The U.S. Federal Reserve meets later on Wednesday. No change in rates is expected, but speculation has risen that the coronavirus could lead the Fed to abandon its dovish stance. Money markets predict a quarter-point rate cut this year and a small chance of a second.
Fears of economic damage are reflected also in the U.S. Treasury yield curve. Three-month yields briefly rose on Tuesday above 10-year borrowing costs -- the curve inversion that sends a fairly reliable recession signal.
As calm returns to markets, the curve has returned to normal, however. Commerzbank's Guntermann said pricing rate cuts at this stage was ""ambitious"".
Treasury 10-year yields were around 1.63%, off Tuesday's three-month lows around 1.57% hit. German Bund yields also inched higher. 
On commodity markets, crude oil futures rose for the second day, after falling amid fears over economic growth and declines in travel demand, with Brent crude up 1% on the day. Gold, which had surged towards $1,600 an ounce on Monday, subsided to around $1,560

The chain had been serving the Beyond Burger and a Beyond Meat breakfast sandwich made with the company’s imitation sausage products. After an initial launch starting in June at nearly 4,000 Canadian locations, the items were scaled back to the provinces of Ontario and British Columbia in September.
“We introduced Beyond Meat as a limited time offer. We are always listening to our guests and testing new products that align to our core menu offerings. We may offer Beyond Meat again in the future,” Tim Hortons said in an e-mailed statement.
Beyond shares sank as much as 3.9% to $115.40 in early trading Wednesday after Bloomberg’s report. The stock had tumbled almost 4% in New York trading Tuesday after it was downgraded to neutral by JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM). Beyond Meat has soared more than fourfold since it went public last year.
The rollback marks a rare setback for the plant-based meat maker, which currently has partnerships with Carl’s Jr., Hardee’s and Dunkin’ Donuts in the U.S., and recently announced an expansion of its partnership with Subway in Canada to begin serving meatball subs nationwide.
A Beyond Meat spokesperson confirmed this was a limited time offer and the companies may work together in the future. Restaurant Brands International Inc., the parent company of Tim Hortons, didn’t respond.

1248,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 29, 2020 07:28AM ET</span>",General Electric Stock Surges After Q4 Earnings Top Forecasts,"
Investing.com -  General Electric 's turnaround under CEO Lawrence Culp advanced a step further on Wednesday, as the company reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that topped expectations, and forecast another strong increase in underlying earnings in 2020.
GE stock rose 6.8% to a 15-month high of $12.50 in response.
""We met or exceeded our full-year financial targets and are on a positive trajectory for 2020,"" Culp said in a statement.

GE said earnings per share rose 31% to 21c, while revenue fell to $26.24 billion from $33.28 billion a year earlier, due largely to the disposals undertaken by Culp. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $0.17 on revenue of $25.51 billion.
Industrial cash flow, the metric most closely followed by analysts to gauge the underlying strength of GE's businesses, surged to $3.9 billion, giving a total of $2.3 billion for the year, but the company underlined the uncertain outlook facing it by predicting cash flow in a wide range between $2 billion and $4 billion in the current year. It also said it expects adjusted earnings per share to fall to a range of 50c-60c from 65c in 2019.
The current year's figures will be affected by the sale of GE's BioPharma, which contributed $1.5 billion in profit last year, and by the continued sell-down of GE's stake in oilfield services company Baker Hughes.
However, the company said it expects operating margins to expand by as much as 75 basis points, the expansion slowing from a more dramatic 460 basis-point increase in 2019 to 6.4%.

 General Electric  (NYSE:GE) shares are up 5% from the beginning of the year and closed Tuesday at $11.73, but they're still worth less than one-third of their value four years ago, when the scale of problems at its electrical engineering and other units became clear. 
""GE’s restructuring remains very much a work-in-progress, with some signs that Culp’s turnaround is taking hold,"" said Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar. ""If demand for its power turbines doesn’t pick up, or the 737 MAX aircraft, whose engines are made by a Franco-U.S. consortium headed by GE, remains grounded for an extended period of time, the gains that GE stock have delivered could evaporate quickly.""
The company said its outlook ""is also dependent on the 737 MAX's return to service, which GE is planning for in mid-2020, in line with Boeing (NYSE:BA).""

General Electric's report follows an earnings beat by United Technologies on Tuesday, who reported EPS of $1.94 on revenue of $19.55B, compared to forecasts EPS of $1.84 on revenue of $19.4B.
ASML ADR had missed expectations on January 22 with fourth quarter EPS of $2.99 on revenue of $4.47B, compared to forecast for EPS of $3.01 on revenue of $4.35B.

1249,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2020 07:21AM ET</span>","Many global firms, excluded from epidemic insurance, face heavy coronavirus costs","By Noor Zainab Hussain, Carolyn Cohn and Sumeet Chatterjee
LONDON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Many global companies from hotels and airlines to industrial houses are expected to have to foot the bill for disruptions caused by a new coronavirus in China, with epidemics usually excluded from insurance cover, experts said. 
With 132 deaths in China and new cases being reported around the world, companies are set to face billions of dollars in losses linked to events and travel cancellations and closure of businesses, they said. 
The virus originated in the city of Wuhan, forcing airlines to cancel flights and companies including Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and HSBC to suspend travel to China.
""For insurers, the bulk of the claims from this outbreak will come from businesses, mainly travel, hospitality and event firms, followed by mortality and healthcare costs,"" said a Hong Kong-based insurance sector lawyer with a global law firm.
Risk modeling firm RMS said it was too early to estimate insured losses. 
While some large global firms buy coverage for communicable diseases, most ""standard insurance policies"" exclude such outbreaks to keep costs low, said the lawyer, declining to be identified as he was not authorized to speak to the media.
Global insurers typically cover risks such as earthquakes and plane crashes, but have been paring back exposure to certain risks, such as shipping, to avoid huge losses.
Previous viruses, such as SARS, Ebola and Zika, have also led insurers to be more cautious about exposure, with specific virus exclusions added to most basic coverage policies, industry insiders said.
The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome pandemic which spread to 37 countries in 2003 caused $4 billion worth of economic losses in Hong Kong, $3-$6 billion in Canada, and $5 billion in Singapore, according to insurance broker Marsh.
Insurance experts also told Reuters that most event cancellation policies would not cover the new virus.
""A lot of these airlines and hotels are offering refunds to their customers,"" said Richard Coyle, London-based head of risk financing and non-standard solutions at Miller Insurance. ""Without adequate insurance in place, the airlines and hotels are absorbing the financial losses themselves.""
A standard event cancellation policy issued by firms in the 99-member Lloyd's of London [SOLYD.UL] insurance market and elsewhere has a ""communicable disease"" exclusion, two underwriters said.
Interactive graphic https://tmsnrt.rs/2U6I2Q3 on human cost of virus outbreaks 
EXCLUSION
Companies buy business interruption policies with their property insurance to cover loss of revenue if they are forced to close temporarily, but those policies are also likely to exclude communicable diseases, an underwriter in London and insurance executives said. 
""The Asian hospitality industry is an obvious example of an industry already affected. For many lines of business ... it is common market practice to have epidemic outbreak risk excluded,"" a Munich Re spokesman said.
While some firms including Munich Re have developed specific insurance products and policies for infectious diseases, not many firms have bought them, insurers said.
The impact on tourism and transport is also likely to hit supply chains in Asia, Narges Dorratoltaj, senior scientist at catastrophe risk modeling firm AIR, said.
 Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) on Tuesday became the first major U.S. company to warn of a financial hit from the virus.
The Shanghai government announcement that all companies in the city would not be allowed to start work before Feb. 9 will affect companies including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p).
While most travel insurers are likely to reimburse costs associated with trip cancellations and medical expenses for policies bought before the spread of the virus, some are excluding the coverage for select destinations now, industry officials said.

Insurers  Aviva  (LON:AV), Allianz (DE:ALVG) and AXA said individual policyholders would be covered if they are impacted by the virus, provided they follow travel advisories from governments.

1250,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2020 07:16AM ET</span>",Where the Purdue Pharma-Sackler legal saga stands,"By Tom Hals and Mike Spector
(Reuters) - OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP and its controlling Sackler family have been negotiating with cities, counties and states on a proposed settlement worth an estimated $10 billion to resolve more than 2,600 lawsuits alleging they helped fuel the U.S. opioid crisis.
Those negotiations could be complicated by a Reuters report on Tuesday that Purdue is the unidentified company that was involved in an alleged kickback scheme aimed at improperly boosting prescriptions of opioid medications, though it was not charged with wrongdoing and has said it is cooperating with Justice Department investigations.
The following is the state of legal woes facing Purdue and the Sacklers:
BANKRUPTCY
Purdue filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in September in White Plains, New York, to put thousands of lawsuits on hold and give it time to broaden support for its wide-ranging settlement proposal.
Purdue Chairman Steve Miller said in a September interview that continued litigation would deplete the company's assets. Purdue has projected spending hundreds of millions of dollars on legal and professional fees, much of it devoted to opioid litigation, according to bankruptcy court records.
The company is also working to resolve Justice Department probes.
Supporters of Purdue's settlement plan when it filed for bankruptcy included 24 states and five U.S. territories, as well as lead lawyers for thousands of counties and other plaintiffs suing the company and, in some cases, the Sacklers.
Two dozen states led by Massachusetts, New York and Connecticut were opposed or uncommitted to the settlement plan, setting the stage for contentious legal battles over who bears responsibility for a public health crisis that has claimed the lives of some 400,000 people between 1999 and 2017, according to U.S. data.
Purdue and the Sacklers have denied the allegations in the lawsuits that allege they aggressively marketed addictive prescription painkillers while misleading doctors and patients about their abuse and overdose risks.
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain agreed to put the lawsuits by various states on hold at least until April to give negotiators more time to reach a settlement.
Purdue still faces U.S. Justice Department criminal and civil investigations over its handling of OxyContin. Any financial penalty emerging from those cases could eat into funds that might go to U.S. communities to help mitigate the crisis in a broad settlement.
Purdue has responded to subpoenas and other investigative demands from federal prosecutors and is engaged in discussions with U.S. officials to resolve the probes, the company has said in bankruptcy court papers.
THE SACKLERS
Purdue also convinced Drain to temporarily halt lawsuits against the Sacklers. Many states have vowed to extract more money from the family, which has not budged from a proposal to pay $3 billion over seven years and at least an additional $1.5 billion through a sale of another business they own called Mundipharma.
The Sacklers could attempt to use bankruptcy proceedings to largely shield themselves from future legal exposure and the possible financial liabilities associated with it. Settlements approved in bankruptcy court often come with legal releases. Some states would be expected to fight that.
New York Attorney General Letitia James has subpoenaed Wall Street banks, Purdue corporate entities and family offices for records related to the Sacklers' finances.
In October, states opposed to the settlement said court records showed Purdue steered up to $13 billion to the Sackler family over an unspecified time frame. A lawyer for the Sacklers said the transfers reflect tax payments and investments in businesses that will soon be sold for the benefit of the states suing the company.
In September, James highlighted wire transfers made by former Purdue board member Mortimer D.A. Sackler, including some made through Swiss bank accounts. A Sackler representative said the decade-old transfers were legal and appropriate.
'PHARMA CO. X'
Reuters on Tuesday identified Purdue as the drugmaker referred to by Vermont federal prosecutors as ""Pharma Co. X"" in court filings on Monday. The unnamed company is described as paying kickbacks to Practice Fusion, now a unit of Allscripts Healthcare Solutions Inc (O:MDRX), to develop an alert used in physicians' software with the goal of boosting its opioid product sales."

1253,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2020 06:47AM ET</span>",Investors find some Unilever foods hard to swallow,"By Siddharth Cavale
(Reuters) - Six months after Unilever's (L:ULVR) (AS:UNc) Alan Jope suggested he may get rid of brands without ""purpose"", investors are wondering when he will deliver.
Their sights have long been set on the Anglo-Dutch firm's foods business, which has lagged growth in the rest of the consumer goods giant for most of the past decade.
The CEO's definition of ""purpose"" is not focused on growth, although he says brands that ""communicate a strong environmental or social purpose"" also expand faster than the rest.
 Unilever  listed four food brands - Knorr Soups, Lipton Tea, Hellman's sauces and Walls ice cream in June among 28 ""purpose-led"" brands it said were growing 69% more quickly than the other parts of the business.
At the time, Jope said he would explore the idea of selling brands without such purpose, hinting at Marmite, Magnum and Pot Noodle when questioned over which. He did not set a time frame.
Yet there is no sign of divestiture activity from Jope ahead of Thursday's release of full-year results, a banking source who has worked with Unilever said. A tightening M&A environment means the time for such deals may have passed, he added.
Unilever declined to comment on its performance or strategic plans ahead of Thursday's earnings report.
Its peers, Nestle (S:NESN) and ABInBev (BR:ABI), have sold food operations worth billions of dollars each over the past year so they can refocus on their core businesses.
Kraft Heinz (O:KHC) was reported early last year as looking to sell its Maxwell House coffee and Ore-Ida tater tots businesses; Kraft declined to comment.
Unilever has long emphasized the high adjusted operating margins in its foods brands - 17.5%. This compares with 15% at Swiss group Nestle, although the two companies do not compete head to head in many categories.
Unilever also notes the role of foods in securing access to fragmented emerging markets, including India.
But it tested investors' patience when it warned last month it would just miss its 3-5% underlying sales growth target. Rivals Procter & Gamble (N:PG) and Nestle are bullish about achieving their own targets of 4%-5% and 3.5%, respectively.
""Actions speak louder than words,"" said Knut Gezelius, a portfolio manager at Norway's SKAGEN Global, which owns 1.8 million of Unilever's Netherlands-listed shares.
""Tangible signs of a get-it-done attitude may quickly take Unilever out of investors' penalty box."" 
London-listed Unilever shares were down 0.3% at 4,485 pence at 1115 GMT on Wednesday, when the broader blue-chip FTSE (FTSE) was up by the same amount. The company's stock is down 3% since its shock sales warning in mid-December.

CALL TO ACTION
Unilever’s food unit, which contributes 40% to total sales, has underperformed the company's two other divisions - Beauty & Personal Care and Home Care - on an organic sales basis in 38 out of 43 quarters since 2009, according to Jefferies.
Four investors told Reuters it should hive off slow growing brands or buy in hot categories like plant-based foods to lift growth, without splashing out just to make an impression.
Analysts say center-store categories like tea, bouillon, mayo and condiments have fallen out of favor with shoppers in search of niche brands and healthier options.
Analysts at Liberum estimate three of the food division's seven big brands – Knorr, Lipton tea and Hellmann’s sauces – are growing in the low single-digit rate at best, making them good disposal candidates.
Freddie Lait, founder of boutique investment firm Latitude Investment Management, which holds shares worth 7.6 million pounds in Unilever, said he was looking for a meaningful action plan.
""The time is now to lay out the hard decisions in front of them and to set an ambition to get back to a medium growth rate in line with their peers,” he said.
For a graphic on Unilever share price performance, click https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1525/1500/unidata.png
ENTANGLED
Jope's predecessor Paul Polman focused on margin growth rather than reinvestment in foods after seeing off a shock takeover offer from Kraft Heinz in 2017.
It was far from easy to disentangle underperforming brands from others and sell them off, the banking source said, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of his position.
Getting the right price is also a challenge.
Unilever did sell its spreads business, including Becel and Flora, to KKR for 6.8 billion pounds in 2017. But the valuation of 10 times earnings, before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) was viewed as disappointing at the time.
And making up for the selling, general and administrative costs that the business was supporting contributed to a surprise 7% earnings dilution in the year after the deal’s close. 
For a graphic on Possible EPS dilution from selling Unilever F&R businesses, click https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1524/1499/EPS%20dilution.jpg 
Based on Unilever's current enterprise value, its mayo and dressings business, tea business in developed markets or total developed market foods could each command a valuation of 13 times EBITDA, Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo said. A clean exit from food would be easier to implement, but would also significantly weaken Unilever’s business in emerging countries like India where scale helps win fragmented markets.
""Unilever are in something of a pickle in Foods: a pickle that isn’t going to be easy to get out of,"" Deboo said.

""At the end of 2019, intelligence was passed to us by the U.S., according to which Huawei is proven to have been cooperating with China's security authorities,"" the newspaper quoted a confidential foreign ministry document as saying.
No comment was immediately available from the German government or from Huawei on the Handelsblatt report.
Chancellor Angela Merkel's government and her conservative ruling party are split on whether Huawei's equipment poses a security threat to Europe's largest economy, where the three mobile network operators are all customers of the Chinese firm.
The Foreign Ministry is among the sceptics, with Handelsblatt citing the document as saying that the U.S. evidence amounted to a ""smoking gun"" that meant Chinese companies could not be trusted to help build new 5G networks.
""Chinese companies cannot be considered trustworthy enough to meet the security standards needed to build 5G networks,"" the document stated further.
Britain on Tuesday decided to bar Huawei from the sensitive 'core' of mobile networks, exclude it from strategically important sites, and cap its share in the network periphery at 35%.

The European Union is due on Wednesday to publish a so-called toolbox that will provide recommendations on how to deal with vendors considered to be high risk, but is expected to stop short of imposing up-front bans on any one network vendor.

The company is also taking steps to make up for production shortages, particularly in Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the coronavirus originated and home to some of the company’s suppliers, Cook said on a conference call discussing recent results. Sales in the current period will be $63 billion to $67 billion. While that’s higher than analysts predicted, it’s also a wider range than the company tends to forecast.
“We do have some suppliers in the Wuhan area. All of the suppliers there are alternate sources and we’re obviously working on mitigation plans to make up any expected production loss,” Cook said. “We factored our best thinking in the guidance that we provided you. With respect to supply sources that are outside the Wuhan area, the impact is less clear at this time.”
The CEO has led Apple to a remarkable comeback in the past year, reviving iPhone sales, dodging the worst of a U.S.-China trade war and creating a new gadget hit with AirPods.

However, the deadly, spreading coronavirus is a new challenge for the company, which has most of its hardware made in China. Discussion of the virus was one of the few dour notes during an otherwise upbeat earnings call with analysts on Tuesday. Authorities have placed strict limits on travel, and airlines are suspending flights to China, taking a toll on businesses across the region. Almost 6,000 people have been infected in mainland China, and at least 132 have died.
“For now, supply chains for smartphones seem OK, but that can change in a flash,” said Neil Mawston, executive director of the global wireless practice at Strategy Analytics. “If any lockdown spreads and extends well into February or even March, then supply chains could start to get tight.”

Smartphone factories typically hold two to eight weeks of component or device inventory, so there will be some buffer, at least in the short-term, he added.
After an extended Chinese Lunar New Year Holiday, Cook said factories are reopening on Feb. 10, rather than at the end of January. Apple has tried to account for this “delayed start up” through its wider sales forecast, the CEO said. On Wednesday, main iPhone assembler Foxconn Technology Group confirmed all of its facilities will resume full-scale production starting Feb. 10.
Beyond potential production disruptions, the outbreak threatens to dampen sales in its largest market outside of the U.S. just as iPhone shipments globally are bouncing back. Apple has closed one retail store in China and some that are still open have reduced operating hours. The company is “deep cleaning” stores and has begun checking employees’ temperatures, Cook said. Last week, it also began limiting employee travel in affected areas to business-critical situations, he added.
Revenue from greater China, which includes Taiwan and Hong Kong, climbed about 3% to $13.6 billion in the holiday quarter. The company ended the year ranked fourth among smartphone makers in the mainland overall, up one notch after reversing a decline in market share, according to research firm Canalys.
“Given the industry is heading full speed to displace 4G with 5G phones, consumers are likely to pause phone replacement to future-proof devices,” said Nicole Peng, Canalys’ vice president of mobility. “The iPhone 11 series is bucking the trend and was the best-selling 4G device in the China market.”

Analysts were particularly positive on growth in China, as well as the outlook for the second quarter, even as the performance of the services division disappointed. Analysts at Cowen also cautioned of the potential impact of the coronavirus outbreak on demand in the all-important Asian region.
The shares rose 2.2% in the U.S. pre-market and are poised to open at a record high. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has gained this year as analysts have become increasingly positive on the potential boost from 5G iPhone upgrades.

“A lot to like,” with growth in China following four quarters of year-on-year declines. While service revenue was slightly below consensus, it still grew at an “impressive” 17% rate.
Notes 75% of Watch purchases were new customers, which should further lock customers in the ecosystem and thus be positive for future iPhone sales.
Report more than justified renewed optimism surrounding the core iPhone business with results “well ahead” of expectations ahead of the start of a potential 5G super cycle.

A “blow out print” that will “put more high octane fuel in the bull thesis,” as iPhone 11 strength continues both domestically and internationally, with China a “clear star of the show.”
Main highlight is second-quarter guidance of $63.0 billion to $67.0 billion versus consensus $62.5 billion, amid pent-up demand within the installed iPhone base.
“A major feather in the cap for the bulls that should drive the stock higher over the coming weeks and months.”
Cowen, Krish Sankar

1260,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2020 05:43AM ET</span>","World may have hit peak car output, says auto-parts supplier Bosch","By Edward Taylor
STUTTGART, Germany (Reuters) - Global automotive production may have peaked, auto supplier Robert Bosch said on Wednesday, announcing job cuts and a review of its business to cope with a 44% drop in full-year operating profit and a downturn in demand for cars.
Global automotive production is expected to fall for the third consecutive year, by 2.6% to 89 million vehicles in 2020, following a drop in demand in China, Europe and the United States, the Stuttgart-based car parts supplier said.
""It could well be that we have passed the peak of automotive production,"" Bosch CEO Volkmar Denner said.
He also said he assumed the low level would remain constant and did not expected an increase in global automotive production before 2025, while the market would shrink by 10 million units in 2020 compared with 2017.
Bosch said its full-year earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) fell to 3 billion euros ($3.33 billion) in 2019, a 44% drop from 5.4 billion euros in the year-earlier period and its EBIT margin contracted to 4% from 7% because of lower demand in China and India.
Total revenue was stable last year, at 77.9 billion euros, as Bosch benefited from increased complexity in vehicles, which allowed it to sell more components and systems per vehicle produced.
A shift to electric cars is expected to create opportunities longer term, but will impact jobs in the near term, Denner said.
Ten workers are needed to make a diesel injection system, three for a gasoline system, and one to produce an electric motor, he said.
As a result, Bosch has said staff adjustments will be made where necessary, including shorter working hours, voluntary redundancy and severance packages, although Bosch declined to provide a global figure for headcount reductions.
Already last year, Bosch reduced its headcount by 6,800 to 402,800, with 2,000 jobs cut in Germany and 3,600 positions reduced in Asia Pacific.
Bosch hopes to exceed 1 billion euros in sales from electric car components this year, and has set aside 500 million euros for investments in electromobility for 2020, Denner said.
Bosch will also start production of long-range LIDAR, a new sensor category, and begin production of hydrogen fuel cells in 2022."
1261,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 29, 2020 05:25AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Santander Defies the Skeptics, For Now","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com --   Banco Santander   (MC:SAN) stock rose 3.5% on Wednesday after showing that it is – despite all the evidence to the contrary - possible to be a European bank and still turn a decent profit.
The bank had a banner year in Brazil and Mexico, defying the largely negative publicity that dogged new populist governments (left-wing in the latter, right-wing in the former). It also had a good year in the U.S., where its consumer financing business profited from the sustained strength in consumer spending.
At first glance, the figures appear to be a resounding vindication of the bank’s strategy of regional diversification, which it says is the best way to lower its overall risk profile: the bank generated a record amount of capital through retained earnings, enough to allow another modest increase in the dividend.
Ana Botin, the group’s executive chair, said the bank’s common equity tier 1 ratio – a key measure of financial strength – will be at the top end of its 11%-12% target range by the end of next year. 
At home in Spain, where growth is admittedly slowing, the bank has cemented its position by integrating Banco Popular, while its digital offerings continue to pick up market share quietly in the Netherlands and Germany.
So why is Santander (MC:SAN) stock so unloved? A price-earnings ratio of 9.7, according to data compiled by Investing.com, is not only below the broader market, but below the average for European banks, which is a pretty low bar already.
The same discount exists on a price-to-book ratio: the market values Santander’s assets at 66c cents on the euro, less than the 88c sector – even though the bank’s underlying return on equity is (by regional standards) a handsome 11.8%. Dividends, too, are edging up, a sign of what Botin called the management’s confidence in further improvement – the bank forecasts a “high single-digit growth” in underlying profit every year through 2022.
But Santander (MC:SAN) shares have fallen by 35% in the last two years and are still not meaningfully above their 2012 low, posted in the heat of Spain’s bailout crisis.
A skeptic would argue that the dependence on Mexico and Brazil is already starting to look like a potential liability – credit booms are a common feature of the early years of populist governments, but rarely end well. A cynic would make the same argument for its U.S. business, where it is getting into the car loans business at the end of a cycle that common wisdom says is on its last legs.
If one or more of those businesses turns down at the same time, the CET1 ratio could quickly return to more worrying levels.
Additionally, the sustained underperformance of its U.K. business – where profits have fallen for the last three years and where it took a 1.5 billion hit against goodwill last year – is now a seemingly permanent drag on returns, one that is already testing the patience of shareholders.
After today's numbers, it's hard to deny that regional diversification has served Santander (MC:SAN) well. The problem is, it's a strategy that can never satisfy all of the people all of the time."
1262,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 29, 2020 04:22AM ET</span>",Stocks - Europe Posts Gains; Earnings and Economic Data Impress,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets headed higher Wednesday, helped by a strong close on Wall Street overnight, and some better-than-expected earnings and economic data both in Europe and stateside.
At 04:15 ET (09:15 GMT), the U.K.'s FTSE index was trading 10 points, or 0.1%, higher, France's CAC 40 was up 16 points, or 0.3%, while the DAX gained 2 points, or 0.1%. The Euro Stoxx 50 index rose 8 points, or 0.2%.
Leading the way in Europe has been the banking sector, helped by strong numbers from Santander (MC:SAN). The Spanish lender took a hit from payment protection claims in the U.K. but posted a higher quarterly net profit, boosted by a solid underlying performance in its main market Brazil.
Santander’s shares climbed 4%, pushing the banks index up 0.5%, the most among the main European subsectors.
Shares in   Novartis   AG (SIX:NOVN) rose 1.4% after the Swiss multinational pharmaceutical company guided for growth in both sales and profit in 2020, citing new medicines. 
LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (PA:LVMH) also pushed higher, gaining 1.7% after recording strong revenue growth. The luxury sector has been hard hit by the outbreak of the coronavirus in China as well as the civil unrest in Hong Kong, with Asia one of the biggest markets.
On top of these solid earnings releases, economic data also surprised to the upside. French consumer confidence rose unexpectedly in January despite major strikes against pension reform, and there was a similar result in Germany. Meanwhile in the U.K., house prices rose 1.9% from a year earlier, the most since November 2018, according to Nationwide Building Society. 
Overnight the death toll from the outbreak of the coronavirus in China reached 132 people, with close to 6,000 infected. Chinese authorities have closed transport systems in and out of Wuhan, where the virus was first noticed, and at least 10 other cities, effectively quarantining millions of people.
That said, the S&P 500 rose 1%, the NASDAQ Composite 1.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.7%, rebounding from the worst daily decline in four months on Monday.
In the U.S., most eyes will be on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). The online social media and social networking service is expected to post earnings growth of 6.2%. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) will also be in the spotlight as the banking giant offers up its first-ever investor day, while Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is also due to report earnings.
The Federal Reserve concludes its two-day policy setting meeting Wednesday, and will announce its decision in a policy statement at 2 PM ET (1900 GMT), with the chairman holding a press conference 30 minutes later.

""We are naturally concerned, but on the basis of the facts today, we have no disruption to our business or supply chain,"" Chief Executive Volkmar Denner said at a meeting with journalists in Fellbach, Stuttgart on Tuesday, in remarks which were embargoed for Wednesday.
Bosch is relying on China as a global manufacturing base for exporting electric motors, transmission and power electronics for electric cars.
""We need to wait to see how things develop. If this situation continues, supply chains will be disrupted. There are forecasts that predict the peak for infections will drag on until February or March,"" Denner said.
""In Wuhan Bosch has two plants making steering systems and thermotechnologies, with around 800 employees. There have been no reports of infections,"" Denner said.
Bosch's China plants have been shut for Chinese new year and the holiday has been extended to February 3, an extension which will not disrupt Bosch's global business, Denner explained.
Bosch has been in China since 1909 and has 23 automotive manufacturing facilities in more than 60 locations in the world's largest auto market, which is home to the largest Bosch workforce outside of Germany.  
Bosch employs 403,000 people globally.
Bosch makes multimedia infotainment systems in Wuhu, brake booster systems in Nanjing, automotive electronics for use in connected and automated driving in Wujin, 48-volt battery systems in Wuxi and builds electric vehicle motors, transmissions, and power electronics in Taicang.
Bosch sales in Asia Pacific reached 22.5 billion euros last year, of which more than 10 billion euros came from China.
Bosch expects global automotive production to fall 2.6% to 89 million cars in 2020 due to a decline in demand in China, the United States and Europe."

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to edge higher at the open Wednesday, helped by the strong close on Wall Street overnight. However, gains are likely to be limited as worries over the spread of the deadly coronavirus in China remain. 
At 02:10 ET (0710 GMT), the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. traded 15 points, or 0.2% higher. France's CAC 40 futures were up 5 points, or 0.1%, while the DAX futures in Germany fell 18 points, or 0.1%. Futures on the pan-eurozone Euro Stoxx 50, gained 2 points, or 0.1%. That followed modest upside surprise from German consumer confidence numbers and the strongest monthly growth in U.K. house prices since November 2018, according to the lender Nationwide.
Overnight the death toll from the outbreak reached 132 people, with close to 6,000 infected. Chinese authorities have closed transport systems in and out of Wuhan, where the virus was first noticed, and at least 10 other cities, effectively quarantining millions of people. 
British Airways decided early on Wednesday to suspend all flights to China, Reuters reported. CNBC had reported on Tuesday that the White House had also considered imposing a ban on U.S. flights to China.
There are at least 47 cases confirmed in 16 other countries, including in Thailand, France, the U.S. and Australia.
“So far, the spreading outside of China still seems limited and no deaths have been reported outside of China,” said Danske Bank, in a research note. “We expect the epidemic to be particularly hard on the service sector in China, but retail sales could also suffer, which could hurt imports.”
Overnight the S&P 500 rose 1%, the Nasdaq 1.4% and the DJIA gained 0.7%, rebounding from the worst daily decline in four months on Monday, as investors turned their attention to earnings season and improving economic data.
The Conference Board measure of consumer confidence rose to 131.6 in January's preliminary report, up from a revised 128.2 in December. This is the best reading since August and is not far from the all-time high of 137.9 seen in October 2018. 
“The fact that the report has come in so strong shouldn't be too much of a surprise given the U.S. has the lowest unemployment rate since the late 1960s, record high home and equity prices and the lowest national gasoline prices since last March,” said ING's James Knightley in a research note. “As such, households have job security, their balance sheets are in a great position and they perhaps have a bit more cash in their pocket after filling up at the gas station.”
While earnings were mixed, with 3M (NYSE:MMM) and   Pfizer   (NYSE:PFE) dropping sharply after weaker than expected quarterly results, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) boosted the major indexes by closing higher amid expectations its fourth quarter release would impress. And after the market close the tech giant duly delivered, reporting better-than-expected profits for the fourth quarter and forecast revenue in the current quarter above Wall Street expectations.
The earnings season continues Wednesday, with most eyes on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). The online social media and social networking service is expected to post earnings growth of 6.2%. That said, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) will also be in the spotlight as the banking giant offers up its first-ever investor day. In Europe,   Novartis   (SIX:NOVN) is likely to drop back after reporting a slight miss to its fourth quarter numbers, although it did predict 2020 growty, while   Banco Santander   (MC:SAN) posted a 35% increase in fourth-quarter net profit, boosted by a solid underlying performance in its main market Brazil.

1271,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2020 02:13AM ET</span>","For airlines, China boom now exposes them to risk as coronavirus slams market","By Jamie Freed and Tracy Rucinski
SYDNEY/CHICAGO (Reuters) - China's growth has helped power a global aviation boom over the last decade, but as the country curtails travel in the face of a new coronavirus, a slowdown could hit the industry harder than ever before.
United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL),  Air Canada  (TO:AC) (TO:AC), Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (HK:0293) and Finnair Plc (HE:FIA1S) are among the carriers that have already canceled some flights to China as countries expand travel warnings and demand plummets due to the coronavirus outbreak.
British Airways (L:ICAG) has halted bookings of direct flights from London to Beijing and Shanghai until March, according to its website.
The virus that has killed more than 130 people and sickened more than 6,000, the vast majority of whom are in China.
U.S. officials said the White House had decided against suspending all flights there for now, but was still considering the measure.
The virus appears to represent the biggest epidemic threat to the airline industry since the SARS outbreak, which at its peak in April 2003 led to a 45% plunge in passenger demand in Asia, analysts said.
The global airline industry has been profitable for the last 10 years, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). Airlines are in a stronger financial position than in 2003, but also far more dependent on China.
""Airlines and airports that are financially strong and well managed are able to overcome a drastic drop in air travel,"" said Shukor Yusof, head of Malaysia-based aviation consultancy Endau Analytics. ""Weak and poorly managed airlines will suffer.""
Margins at many carriers remain narrow, economic growth has been fragile amid a U.S.-China trade war and there are fears that the return of the 737 MAX, expected mid-year, could lead to overcapacity and push down fares. Airbus and Boeing orders have fallen from the peak levels of 2013 and 2014.
The epidemic is particularly concerning to the industry because China is the world's biggest outbound international travel market and the second-largest domestic aviation market.
The country accounts for about 25% of global sales for airplane manufacturers Airbus SE (PA:AIR) and  Boeing Co  (N:BA). About 450 million more passengers fly to, from and within China per year compared with a decade ago, according to the IATA.
For Chinese airlines, the biggest of which are state-backed, the impact of the new coronavirus has been swift. On Wednesday, 23% of departures from Shanghai Hongqiao airport had been canceled, according to FlightRadar24, compared with 8% at the more internationally focused Shanghai Pudong airport.
Mike Boyd, head of U.S.-based aviation consultancy Boyd Group International, said that he had forecast airport traffic in China to rise 8.1% in 2020, but that he now sees traffic growing at less than half that rate.
""It is a real slam,"" he said.
Cathay Pacific, already battered by a fall in demand because of anti-government protests in its home market of Hong Kong, said on Tuesday evening it would cut flights to mainland China by 50% or more through the end of March.
The fate of Cathay and local rival Hong Kong Airlines could depend on the willingness of travelers to transit through Hong Kong airport, BOCOM International analyst Luya You said. The protests had already caused a collapse in demand from mainland tourists and business travelers, she said.
Asian jet fuel prices have dropped and refiners' profits for the product have slumped to their lowest in more than 2-1/2 years over concerns that the coronavirus will hurt demand, although that will also help unhedged carriers keep a lid on costs.
U.S. and European carriers have less relative exposure to the Chinese market than their Asian rivals. Chinese carriers, which have a huge home market, dominate airline travel between China and long-haul destinations. But they were racking up international losses even before the virus broke out.
Flights to China account for 2%-6% of estimated revenue at United Airlines, Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL),  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) and Air Canada, according to analysts at Cowen, an independent investment bank, although they added there were concerns the virus would not be contained in China given how it was spreading.
Historically, air traffic has returned to normal after health scares. In the case of SARS, it took nine months to recover, according to IATA.
""It (SARS) meant we did cut back on some international capacity but it rebounded very fast,"" Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN) Chief Executive Alan Joyce told reporters on Wednesday, saying that earnings took a A$55 million ($37.61 million) hit from that epidemic.
""We do now have a lot of experience over the years with MERS, with Zika virus, with volcanoes, with all sorts of activity that's impacted the airlines,"" he said."

“Given the various factors including the guidelines by the local and region governments and parts supply situation, as of Jan. 29, we have decided to halt operations in our plants in China until Feb. 9,” Maki Niimi, a spokesman for the Japanese automaker, said. “We will monitor the situation and make further decisions on operations from Feb. 10.”
Toyota has already restricted travel to Hubei province, based on guidelines from Japan’s foreign ministry. While there are no restrictions to other parts of China, Toyota has asked employees to avoid unnecessary travel to other areas of the country, Niimi said. There are currently no Toyota employees in Wuhan, Hubei’s capital, or the province, he added.
Asked whether there would be an impact on Toyota’s supply chain, Niimi said: “Since there is an extensive supply chain in the automotive industry and there are a wide range of parts and components that are used for vehicles, it is difficult to specifically comment.”

1274,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2020 01:37AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Do or die - Nissan takes the axe to the house Ghosn built,"By Norihiko Shirouzu
YOKOHAMA, Japan (Reuters) - Nissan (T:7201) is planning aggressive cost cuts to deal with an unexpected slump in sales as the expansionist strategy it inherited from fugitive former Chairman Carlos Ghosn flounders, four people familiar with the plans said. 
Japan's second biggest carmaker is set to eliminate at least 4,300 white-collar jobs and shut two manufacturing sites as part of broader plans to add at least 480 billion yen ($4.4 billion) to its bottom line by 2023, two of the people told Reuters.
The moves come on top of a turnaround plan unveiled in July and are likely to include cutting Nissan's range of cars and the array of product options and trims in each line, slashing jobs mostly at head offices in the United States and Europe, and reducing advertising and marketing budgets, they said.
""The situation is dire. It's do or die,"" a person close to Nissan's senior management and the company's board told Reuters.
Most of the planned cuts and measures to enhance efficiency were presented to Nissan's board in November and received its general blessing, two sources said.
A Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) spokeswoman declined to comment on new restructuring measures or the view that weaker-than-expected sales were the catalyst for a global overhaul.
Under Ghosn, Nissan embarked on a global expansion, boosting capacity to add new models, driving more decidedly into markets such as India, Russia, South Africa and southeast Asia and spending heavily on promotions and marketing to hit targets.
Now, many of those models are missing sales goals and executives at Nissan's Yokohama headquarters estimate up to 40% of its global manufacturing capacity is unused, or under-used.
Some executives are worried Nissan, part of an alliance with  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Mitsubishi (T:7211), could post another loss at its carmaking business in the last quarter of 2019 - and possibly for all its operations in the year ending in March.
One source said that would most likely hinge on whether Nissan books big restructuring expenses in its current financial year, or waits until the year ending in March 2021.
Reuters spoke to nine people familiar with Nissan's plans. All declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the subject.
(GRAPHIC: Nissan's sales woes - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/NISSAN-RESTRUCTURING/0H001R87NBLV/eikon.png)
MISSED TARGETS
In July, Nissan said it would cut 12,500 jobs from 14 sites around the world, from the United Kingdom to Spain, Mexico, Japan, India and Indonesia - and reduce its model range by 10%.
At the time, Nissan officials told Reuters that meant shutting one production line at each plant.
Now, Nissan is considering shutting two plants permanently, on top of the reductions at the 14 other sites, people close to Nissan's management and board with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. They didn't say which two new sites were at risk.
People familiar with the plans said the axe was also likely to fall at Nissan's North American head office in Tennessee and its European headquarters in Geneva, as they were bloated with high-spending sales and marketing staff.
One source with direct knowledge of the turnaround plan said Nissan's marketing teams globally gobble up nearly 1 trillion yen a year, or about 45% of Nissan's annual fixed costs of 2.1 trillion.
Nissan had been saddled with the excess, ""thanks to (Ghosn's) highly aggressive, expansionist volume goals, which we failed to achieve"", the source said. 
A spokeswoman for Ghosn said he declined to comment for this story.
Ghosn told a news conference in Beirut on Jan. 8 that Nissan's poor performance since 2017 was down to Hiroto Saikawa, who formally took over from him as Nissan CEO in April 2017. 
""He was CEO and he was responsible for it,"" Ghosn said.
In addition to cuts in Nissan's fixed costs, managers are also considering plans to kill off unprofitable models, accelerate the pace of new product development and reduce the average age of its line-up to 2-1/2 years from five now.
The new plans aim to add 480 billion yen to Nissan's bottom line by the end of March 2023, with 300 billion from cuts in fixed costs and 180 billion from an array of cars to be launched in the next three years, people familiar with the matter said. 
Nissan is aiming to achieve an operating margin of 6% on revenue of 14.5 trillion yen by March 2023, compared with 3.0% from 13.0 trillion forecast for the year ending in March 2020, according to plans announced in July.
But since July, Nissan's operating performance has worsened by more than expected, making it likely its new management team will have to find savings significantly above the 480 billion yen currently envisaged to hit its targets, three sources said.
(GRAPHIC: Nissan's 2023 recovery goals - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/NISSAN-RESTRUCTURING/0H001R87MBLR/eikon.png)
'PHASE TWO'
To be sure, Nissan has plenty of cash in its coffers to cope with setbacks. According to quarterly results, it had 1.14 trillion yen in net cash at the end of September.
Still, sources said Nissan was no longer adding freshly generated cash to its war chest, mainly because of its high fixed costs and the sales slide. Furthermore, it has expensive car launches in the next few years that could eat into reserves. 
""Even if we had one trillion yen in cash, that could be depleted in no time if we didn't pay attention,"" a person close to Nissan management told Reuters.
Three of the people said the collapse in Nissan sales around the world was a major factor in forcing the company to consider restructuring above and beyond the measures outlined in July.
They said Nissan's global sales would likely fall toward 5 million vehicles, or slightly above, way short of its sales goal of 5.5 million for its current financial year.
The worse-than-expected downturn, which has forced Nissan to spend more on promotions to cushion the fallout, has created additional urgency to take more drastic steps, sources said.
Of particular concern is the U.S. market, where sales fell 10% in 2019, and the continued sluggishness of the Chinese market, which left Nissan's sales volumes down 1.1% from 2018.
One especially troublesome issue for Nissan has been its sales efficiency. In 2018, it had 69 models and sold 5.2 million vehicles - or 75,000 on average per model line - and it was planning to expand its line-up to 73 by the end of 2022.
Now, it is aiming to cut its range to 62 and boost average sales per line to 87,000, the equivalent of Toyota's (T:7203) average last year, according to calculations and forecasts by the team formulating Nissan's recovery plan.
""We thought by now we would be selling 6 million cars a year. But the truth of the matter is our selling ability is about just north of 5 million,"" one source said.
OPEN ROAD?
People familiar with Nissan's internal discussions said there was even some concern the new measures being considered, known as ""Phase Two"" cuts, might not be enough to achieve its three-year turnaround goals if sales don't recover fast enough.
""Those Phase Two measures will most likely fall short,"" said one person familiar with restructuring plans, making a point echoed by several people close to the management team and board.
To make matters worse, the restructuring efforts have been disrupted by the political turmoil following Ghosn's departure in 2018, his flight from Japan in December and subsequent accusations against former colleagues at Nissan.
According to five sources, the upheaval rattled Nissan's top management team so much that it paralyzed their ability to execute many of the planned restructuring moves smoothly.
The latest turmoil lasted from December to mid-January, when the board curbed the influence of ""anti-alliance"" forces sabotaging the plans, two sources said, declining to elaborate.
Nissan's new CEO Makoto Uchida took the reins at the start of December with Ashwani Gupta, who has worked at Mitsubishi, Nissan and Renault, as chief operating officer.

""Whoever the action was aimed at, the upshot is that Gupta is now completely freed from pressures from those anti-alliance forces to carry out all the planned turnaround measures,"" one of the people said. ""He should do so without hesitation as the board has cleared the way.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Hong Kong casino operator Melco Resorts & Entertainment Ltd (O:MLCO) is cooperating with Japanese prosecutors in a widening bribery investigation of a senior Japanese ruling party lawmaker, a source said on Wednesday.
""Tokyo prosecutors sent Melco a letter and visited the office on Jan 17 after receiving no reply,"" said the source, who was briefed on the matter. Melco's office was empty that day, but it is now cooperating with investigators, he said.
The source, who asked not to be identified because he is not authorized to talk to the media, also confirmed the authenticity of a photograph seen by Reuters that showed a notice from prosecutors taped to Melco's office door.
Melco declined to comment on whether it is under investigation. A spokeswoman at the prosecutors office said it did not comment on individual cases.
The widening probe could bolster opposition in Japan to gaming companies vying for licenses to open casino resorts in Japan after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last year eased gambling restrictions to allow integrated resorts like those in Macau or Las Vegas.
Prosecutors last month arrested Tsukasa Akimoto, a former vice minister in the Cabinet Office in charge of casino policy, on suspicion of accepting more than $50,000 worth of money and gifts from employees at a company that wanted to set up a casino in Japan. Akimoto has denied the bribery allegations.
Prosecutors did not name the company, but public broadcaster NHK and other Japanese media identified it as China's 500.com.
The Shenzhen-based company said in December it had formed a internal committee to investigate the allegations and that Xudong Chen, Chairman of the Board, had resigned.
Other companies interested in building resorts in Japan include MGM Resorts International (N:MGM),  Las Vegas Sands  Corp (N:LVS),  Wynn Resorts Ltd  (O:WYNN) and Galaxy Entertainment Group (HK:0027).
Japan is viewed as one of the world's largest and most promising untapped casino markets. Melco and other operators have said building a casino resort there would cost $10 billion or more.
In a bid to overcome gambling's seedy image in Japan, Melco has collaborated with Tokyo University of Arts to promote Japanese culture, and offered vacations for students living in areas hit by Japan's 2011 earthquake.
Public support for Abe's casino plan, however, has waned with backing for casinos as low as 30% in some polls.
Japan has authorized licenses to build three resorts with Tokyo, Yokohama and Osaka among the cities expected to bid for them.
That process, may be pushed back beyond next year because of the bribery scandal involving Akimoto, the Asahi newspaper reported on Tuesday, citing government and ruling party sources."

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Li Chunrong was hired by Chinese automaker Geely to revive the fortunes of the Proton brand in Malaysia, and it took him two years to eclipse Japanese giants Honda and Toyota. Now he plans to take the fight across Southeast Asia and beyond.
Li, appointed Proton CEO in 2017 when Geely acquired 49.9% of the company, has turned around a once-celebrated Malaysian marque that had to rely on state aid after a string of losses, with his success built on an aggressive cost-cutting drive.
Now Geely has told the Proton boss to expand across the region, initially focusing on Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore and Brunei, Li told Reuters - the first time concrete details of the brand's expansion plans have been disclosed.
Like Malaysia, they are right-hand drive markets so require fewer car modifications. Proton also aims to drive into the Middle East and increase sales to Egypt, said the 56-year-old Chinese national.
Li did not give specific timeframes for expansion into individual markets, but said Proton wanted to raise overseas sales - which stood at about 1,000 cars last year, or 1% of total sales - at least four-fold this year.
The carmaker wants 40% of its sales to come from foreign markets by 2027, he told Reuters in two interviews, identifying Thailand and Indonesia as the key markets but declining to outline his strategy to crack them.
""We have a good foundation,"" he said. ""We commit that, every year, we will launch a new model.""
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region of over 500 million people is promising territory; car sales are forecast by consultancy IHS Markit to grow at a compound annual rate of 3% in 2016-2020, compared with a 1% drop globally.
But IHS said Proton was still a small player compared with the Japanese brands, and that it could struggle to compete.
ASEAN sales are led by Toyota with a 30% market share, Honda with 13% and Mitsubishi (T:7211) with 10%, according to the consultancy. Proton is in 11th place with about 3%, mainly from Malaysia.
Proton's goals are ambitious and it may not have the production capacity to make inroads regionally, said Mayuree Chaiyuthanaporn, a senior IHS analyst.
""In terms of sales, Proton may not be successful outside Malaysia,"" she added.
Geely said Proton had performed well in the past two years and it was committed to seeing the Malaysian company be a leading brand in Southeast Asia.
EXPORTING COSTS MODEL
Proton, majority-owned by Malaysian conglomerate DRB-HICOM (KL:DRBM), has launched products at a breakneck speed in its home market. It dropped many old models the first year of the joint venture, and then launched six new ones within eight months, including the X70 SUV based on Geely's Boyue.
It became the second-largest car seller with a 16.7% share last year - when it made its first profit in about nine years - climbing above Honda and Toyota from fourth position.
Li said Proton could beat Malaysia's top seller Perodua, backed by Japan's Daihatsu (T:6023), by 2022 - five years ahead of the target announced after Geely's investment.
Proton outlined to Reuters some of the cost-cutting measures that have bolstered its Malaysian fortunes - and that could be key for success in its expansion drive. Some of the rapid changes have, however, jarred local sensitivities, a problem that it could also encounter in other countries.
The carmaker has increasingly switched to sourcing cheaper components from China, and let go of many small local distributors, stoking some resentment. It has also been trying to get more Malaysian vendors to partner with Chinese suppliers, in a bid to get them to cut costs by 30%.
Proton, which saved 250 million ringgit ($61.5 million) in costs in 2018, has also cut its warehouses to four from 16 and sold 1,000 of its 1,500 company cars. Its drive has even extended to stopping newspaper subscriptions for all executives apart from Li's deputy.
DISCORD WITH DEALERS
The automaker has also faced accusations from politicians and industry groups of favoring Chinese or ethnic Chinese-Malaysian dealers.
All the 47 dealers who left the brand since Geely's entry are Malays, and the number of Malay dealers has fallen to 32% from 42% before the Chinese investment, the trade and industry minister told parliament last month.
Many left as they were unable meet Proton's demand of investing around $1 million to upgrade their sales-only centers to offer aftermarket services, said the Malaysian Association of Malay Vehicle Importers and Traders.
""It was a culture shock,"" said Nik Izani Nik Ibrahim, deputy president of the association, adding that most dealers were losing money before Geely's entry.
Li denied that there had been any discrimination, saying decisions were driven by business logic.
He said nearly a dozen Malaysian ministers had raised the concerns of Malay dealers in his first year but that those worries had eased now.
The automaker has since changed its strategy for dealership, allowing some basic sales-only centers to continue, dealers and company officials said.
Proton, launched in 1983, was Malaysia's market leader in its early years. Its market share plunged in the last decade, however, as customers shunned its lower-standard cars and limited after-sales service, Proton officials have said.
The turnaround under Li has forced Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, a car aficionado, to reverse his initial opposition to Geely's investment in Proton.
""Now, it's selling 100,000 cars and it's making profit,"" Mahathir, whose fleet of cars now includes a red X70, told reporters this month.

(Reuters) -  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) on Tuesday became the first major U.S. company to warn of a financial hit from the new coronavirus outbreak in China, as it closed thousands of restaurants and adjusted operating hours in its biggest growth market. 
The world's largest coffee chain delayed a planned update - based on strong quarterly earnings results - to its 2020 financial forecast because of the outbreak, which has caused over 100 deaths and over 4,000 confirmed cases in China.
Shares of the company, which operates 4,292 stores in China, fell 1% in extended trading. 
The company, which beat sales estimates during its first quarter, ""intended to raise certain aspects of our full-year financial outlook for fiscal 2020,"" Chief Executive Officer Kevin Johnson said during the earnings call.
But because of the coronavirus outbreak, it decided not to revise guidance on Tuesday.
The company expects the financial impact to be material but temporary, and it will depend on the number of stores it has to close and for how long. Currently about half of its stores are shuttered in China, which makes up about 10% of global revenue.
It will not know until March at the earliest what the financial impact will be, but its long-term double-digit growth expectations are intact, executives said. 
The virus, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has spread across the world and prompted companies to close stores and restrict travel to and from the country.
Starbucks' China rival,  Luckin Coffee  Inc (O:LK), has said it will keep stores closed in Wuhan throughout the Lunar New Year holidays. 
Starbucks is responding to the virus ""in a thoughtful and responsible way to protect our partners and support health officials and the government as they work to contain this public health risk,"" Johnson said. ""I am proud of how Starbucks China is navigating a very dynamic situation."" 
GROWTH FROM COLD BREW, LOYALTY MEMBERS 
The Seattle-based company beat first-quarter estimates for same-restaurant sales, growing 5% compared with expectations for a 4.4% increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Sales at restaurants open for at least 13 months rose 3% in China, where it will continue to concentrate on personalized beverages and its digital push rather than adopt a strategy of offering cheaper drinks like its rivals have used to gain market shares, Johnson said. 
Overall, the company has been boosting its cold brew options, adding online ordering options and updating its loyalty rewards program.
It also plans to add a breakfast sandwich with a plant-based patty in the United States and Canada this year.
Total net revenue rose 7% to $7.1 billion, largely in line with analysts' average estimate of $7.11 billion.
Net earnings attributable to the company rose to $885.7 million, or 74 cents per share, from $760.6 million, or 61 cents per share, a year earlier. 
Excluding one-time items, the company earned 79 cents per share, above estimates of 76 cents. 
Revenues grew 9% in the quarter in the United States, where it added 1.4 million customers to its 90-day active Starbucks Rewards membership, ending the quarter with 18.9 million active members, a 16% increase over prior year.

1285,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 28, 2020 06:55PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch for Jan. 29,"By Kim Khan 
Investing.com - Here are three things that could rock the markets this week.
1. Apple’s Done, Here Comes Tesla
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) came through for investors with its results after the bell today, but there will be little time to dwell on numbers before another huge batch of big-name earnings reports drops.
And the hype will be all around Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), a stock that’s up more than 70% in the last three months and now sporting a market cap of more than $100 billin.
Tesla reports after market close Wednesday, with analysts expecting a fourth-quarter profit of $1.64 per share on sales of nearly $7 billion, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Oppenheimer, which has an outperform rating on the stock, said ahead of the results that the critical (long term) variables for the stock are whether the company can scale to 1 million vehicle deliveries, achieve double-digit margins at that level and seize a time-to-market advantage in autonomous vehicles.
As of Tuesday, Tesla options implied an 11% swing for the shares in either direction by Friday. Over the last eight quarters, the stock moved 9.5% on average after Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) reported results, according to options analytics company Trade Alert.
Joining Tesla in reporting postmarket are two tech giants, Dow components Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Facebook is expected to have earned $2.52 per share in its latest quarter on revenue of nearly $21 billion.
Stifel reiterated its buy on Facebook on Monday and bumped up its price target to $250 from $240.
Analysts are looking for Microsoft to post earnings of $1.32 per share, with revenue of about $35.7 billion. Shares are up nearly 15% in the last three months.
Before the bell the Dow deluge continues, with component Boeing (NYSE:BA) probably garnering the most interest. It’s been in the headlines constantly with the grounding of its 737 Max jetliner after two fatal crashes and its high share price has big impact on the price-weighted blue-chip index.
Boeing is forecast to report an adjusted profit of 60 cents per share on revenue of about $21.7 billion.
Maybe even more important than the numbers, though, will be if the aerospace giant provides any more visibility on when the 737 Max could return to service. The company most recently said it expects regulatory approval sometime in the middle of this year.
Boeing will be joined by more Dow components when McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) and   Dow Chemical   (NYSE:DOW) also weigh in ahead of trading.
  General Electric   (NYSE:GE) and AT&T (NYSE:T) are also on the calendar.
2. Fed Looks to Be on Hold, but Watch for Hints on Months From Now
It’s not often a Federal Reserve interest rate decision isn’t the big news of the day, but while tomorrow’s announcement will still be important, it’s also considered a foregone conclusion.
The Federal Open Market Committee will release its statement on the fed funds rate at 2:00 PM ET (19:00 GMT).
The press conference with Fed chief Jerome Powell will follow at 2:30 PM ET.
There is an 89% chance that the FOMC keeps rates at 1.5% to 1.75%, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
Investors will be looking for anything in the statement or Powell’s remarks that looks to take additional easing off the table for the rest of the year.
And don’t forget the specter of politics still hovers over Fed decisions.
President Donald Trump on Tuesday renewed his call for the Fed to lower interest rates, saying it would allow the United States to pay off debt.
“The Fed should get smart & lower the Rate to make our interest competitive with other Countries which pay much lower even though we are, by far, the high standard. We would then focus on paying off & refinancing debt! There is almost no inflation-this is the time (2 years late)!” Trump wrote in a tweet.
3. Home Sales, Oil Inventories Also on Tap
Among the last-minute data the Fed will get to consider before its decision will be the goods trade balance, which comes at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).
Economists expect it to have widened in December to $68.75 billion, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
At 10:00 AM ET, the National Association of Realtors issues its numbers on December pending home sales.
Pending home sales are seen rising 0.5% for the month, below November’s 1.2% rise.
For the energy traders, the Energy Information Administration reports weekly oil inventory numbers at 10:30 AM ET.
Oil stockpiles are expected to have dropped by 482,000 last week, although the American Petroleum Institute reported a surprise draw of 4.3 million today in its measure.

1286,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2020 06:44PM ET</span>","EBay forecast disappoints amid competition from Amazon, Walmart","By Ayanti Bera
(Reuters) - EBay Inc (O:EBAY) forecast first-quarter revenue below analysts' estimates on Tuesday, as the e-commerce company faces fierce competition from Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Walmart Inc (N:WMT).
Shares of San Jose, California-based eBay were down about 5% after the bell.
""The relative growth rates of eBay's business versus Walmart's e-commerce efforts suggests eBay is losing market share to Walmart in the category,"" D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte said.
Facing stiff competition in its marketplace business, eBay has shifted focus to its advertising and payments businesses, as well as worked to make its platform simpler to use by adding features such as grouped listings and personal recommendations.
""I'd say Amazon is still the primary culprit"", said Benchmark analyst Daniel Kurnos.
EBay slashed nearly $116 million in marketing expense in the fourth quarter in line with its continued effort to cut costs.
""They (eBay) also pulled back on marketing, basically giving up more share back to the marketplace in certain unprofitable channels,"" Kurnos added.
The company is also reeling under pressure from activist investors to hive off some of its businesses to improve profitability.
Following pressure from Elliott Management Corp and Starboard Value, eBay in November agreed to sell its ticketing unit, StubHub, for $4.05 billion to ticket reseller Viagogo Ltd.
For the first quarter, eBay expects revenue of between $2.55 billion and $2.60 billion, while analysts were expecting $2.64 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
However, the company's revenue of $2.82 billion in the fourth quarter came in above analysts' expectation of $2.81 billion.
Gross merchandise volume, which is the value of goods sold on its websites within a certain time frame, fell 5% to $23.3 billion.
EBay said active buyers grew 2% to 183 million in the quarter from a year earlier, but they remained unchanged from the third quarter.
Growth in active buyers was impacted by the reduced marketing spend and a higher churn than what the company had expected, Chief Financial Officer Andrew Cring said on a post-earnings call. 
Net income from continuing operations fell to $558 million, or 69 cents per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $763 million, or 80 cents per share, a year earlier. 

On an adjusted basis, the company earned 81 cents per share, above the average analyst estimate 76 cents.

1288,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2020 06:06PM ET</span>",Exclusive: OxyContin maker Purdue is 'Pharma Co X' in U.S. opioid kickback probe - sources,"By Mike Spector and Tom Hals
NEW YORK (Reuters) - OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP is the unnamed company that surfaced in criminal charging documents filed earlier this week in a probe of illegal kickbacks from drugmakers, according to people familiar with the matter.
Purdue Pharma, which faces U.S. Justice Department probes and sprawling litigation over allegations it played a central role in the deadly U.S. opioid crisis, faces new scrutiny in connection with a case Vermont federal prosecutors unveiled on Monday against a San Francisco electronic health records vendor.
The vendor allegedly received a roughly $1 million illegal kickback from an opioid company identified in the documents as ""Pharma Co. X."" The unnamed company is Purdue Pharma, the people familiar with the matter said. Purdue was not criminally charged in the case or accused of wrongdoing. 
""As Purdue Pharma has previously stated, the company is cooperating with investigative demands by various components of the U.S. Department of Justice in connection with criminal and civil investigations of the company,"" the Stamford, Connecticut-based drugmaker said in a statement, adding that it had no further comment.
Members of the wealthy Sackler family who control Purdue but no longer sit on its board have also been named in litigation and issued a separate statement. 
""Throughout their time on the board since 2007, the directors were regularly and consistently assured that the company was in full compliance with all legal and regulatory requirements, and so we would be profoundly disappointed if any of those assurances turned out not to be true,"" they said. 
A spokesman for the Vermont U.S. attorney's office and a Justice Department spokeswoman in Washington declined to comment. 
The development intensifies pressure on Purdue and the Sacklers as the company holds talks aimed at resolving the Justice Department investigations. Resolving those probes is a condition of a tentative multibillion-dollar settlement with more than 2,600 cities, counties and states that have sued Purdue and its wealthy owners seeking to hold them responsible for the opioid epidemic.
The company and the Sacklers deny they are to blame for the crisis that has caused some 400,000 deaths between 1999 and 2017, according to U.S. health officials. 
Purdue filed for bankruptcy protection in September in the hopes of hammering out a final settlement it values at up to $10 billion.
The vendor at the center of the kickback investigation is Allscripts Healthcare Solutions Inc's (O:MDRX) Practice Fusion unit.
It agreed to pay $145 million to resolve criminal and civil allegations that it solicited and received kickbacks from several drugmakers in exchange for embedding alerts in physicians' software to boost sales of their products, the Vermont U.S. attorney's office said.
As part of the settlement, Practice Fusion entered into a deferred prosecution agreement to resolve criminal charges linked to the illegal kickback it received from the unnamed company, which sources identified as Purdue.
Practice Fusion also resolved a civil allegation that it submitted false claims to federal healthcare programs in relation to the kickback arrangement with the unnamed opioid company, prosecutors said. 
Reuters was unable to learn the identities of the other pharmaceutical companies involved in the case.
PUSHING MORE ADDICTIVE OPTIONS 
Practice Fusion began soliciting payments from Pharma Co. X in late 2013 in exchange for creating an physician alert designed to boost opioid prescriptions by suggesting doctors focus on assessing and treating a patient's pain symptoms with opioid medication as a preferred option.
Practice Fusion pitched the software as a way to influence doctors and counter the unnamed company's declining opioid sales, stemming from heightened public awareness of addiction risks, according to court documents. 
The goals of the alerts was to create new opioid patients and convert current users from immediate-release opioid medications to highly addictive extended-release drugs, according to court documents. 
The alert on the Practice Fusion platform, used by tens of thousands of healthcare providers, was triggered 230 million times from July 2016 until the spring of 2019, according to court documents.
Allscripts General Counsel and Chief Administrative Officer Brian Farley said in a statement the allegations predate his company's 2018 acquisition of Practice Fusion for $100 million. 
He said Allscripts has strengthened Practice Fusion's compliance program and is aware of the devastation opioids have caused to U.S. communities.

Shares of the company fell 4% in extended trading on Tuesday. The stock has surged over 150% in the last 12 months, making it the top gainer on both the S&P 500 Index (SPX) and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) during the period.
The console business has been under pressure as inventory is drawn down ahead of  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) and Sony Corp (T:6758) launching their new gaming consoles in the second half of this year.
Fourth-quarter sales in its enterprise, embedded and semi-custom segment, which also houses chips used in consoles, rose 7% to $465 million, but missed FactSet estimates of $603.8 million.
""The secular decline in the game console semi-custom chip (SoC) should have been expected. I think investors wanted to see a steeper growth profile from its datacenter, CPU business to offset the near-term gaming SoC decline,"" said KinNgai Chan at Summit Insights Group LLC.
Sales at AMD's computing and graphics segment, which includes graphic chip sales to data centers, surged 69% to $1.66 billion in the fourth quarter, beating analysts' estimate of $1.5 billion, according to market research firm FactSet.
Data center demand also powered strong results and forecast from bigger rival  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) last week, which reinforced chip industry turnaround expectations triggered by Micron Inc (O:MU) and Texas Instruments (O:TXN).
AMD projected first-quarter revenue to be about $1.8 billion plus or minus $50 million, compared to analysts' average estimate of $1.86 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Revenue jumped 50% to $2.13 billion in the fourth quarter, beating analysts' estimates of $2.11 billion.
The company said it expects 2020 revenue growth of about 28% to 30% year-over-year, while analysts were expecting 27%. 

Excluding items, the company earned 32 cents per share, beating estimates of 31 cents.

1290,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2020 05:53PM ET</span>",Airbus faces record $4 billion fine after bribery probe,"By Sudip Kar-Gupta and Tim Hepher
(Reuters) - Airbus faces a record $4 billion fine and lower 2019 profits after unveiling a preliminary deal with French, British and U.S. authorities following a crippling three-year probe into allegations of bribery and corruption over jetliner sales.
The deal, believed by anti-corruption experts to be the largest ever in a bribery case, ends an almost four-year crisis that led to a sweeping management overhaul and delayed plans to redeploy the plane giant's cash surplus.
If approved by courts, the deal is expected to allow Airbus to avoid criminal charges that risked banning the company from public contracts in the United States and European Union - a massive setback for one of Europe's top defense and space firms.
The European planemaker has been investigated by French and British authorities for suspected corruption over jet sales dating back over a decade. It has also faced U.S. investigations over suspected violations of export controls.
Announcing the tentative agreement, Airbus - which dominates the commercial jet market alongside U.S. rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) - said it would take a provision of 3.6 billion euros ($3.96 billion) in its 2019 earnings if the deal won approval in court hearings in the United States, Britain and France on Jan 31.
""To my knowledge, an approximate $4 billion global settlement amount would be the largest global bribery settlement amount in history,"" said bribery law expert Mike Koehler, a professor at Southern (NYSE:SO) Illinois University School of Law. 
That compares with analyst expectations of 3-5 billion euros and dwarfs an $809-million multinational settlement in 2017 over the use of middlemen by aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce (LON:RR), which included the biggest ever corruption fine in Britain.
Airbus said the charge would affect 2019 results due on Feb 13. Analysts had expected 2019 net profit of 4.638 billion euros against 4.405 billion in 2018, according to Refinitiv data.
Despite the hit, Airbus shares rose 1% on what appeared to end one of the most damaging chapters in its history.
""Sorting out the fraud investigation is likely to remove a major overhang for the company,"" said Vertical Research Partners analyst Rob Stallard. Others noted plans for a new share buyback had been postponed as Airbus faced uncertainty over the fines.
British and French investigations began after Airbus alerted regulators to misleading and incomplete declarations it had made to Britain’s export credit agency over payments to sales agents.
Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) launched its probe in August 2016, followed seven months later by France's Parquet National Financier (PNF).
It was not immediately clear to what extent the U.S. part of any settlement would stick to the infringement of export control violations or include the broader corruption case.
The U.S. Department of Justice has signaled a close interest in the bribery affair while mainly allowing Britain's SFO to take the lead, say people familiar with the matter.
It was also not clear whether a deal would lead to individual prosecutions, which are not covered by corporate plea bargains. Britain's SFO abandoned individual prosecutions over the Rolls-Royce case last year.
AGENT NETWORK
At the center of the Airbus case was a decades-old system of third-party sales agents run from a now-disbanded headquarters unit which at its height involved some 250 people in parts of the world and several hundreds of millions of euros of payments a year, sources familiar with the matter have said.
In 2014, then finance director Harald Wilhelm ordered a halt to all third-party payments, triggering a massive internal probe and claims from unpaid consultants.
The investigation, which racked up legal bills of around 100 million euros a year, led to a board-driven clearout of the company's top management and plunged the company into years of self-examination, hampering its sales efforts.
Nobody has been accused of wrongdoing but Airbus acted to clear out its senior ranks to improve its chances of winning a U.S.-style deferred prosecution agreement (DPA), insiders said.
In a landmark 2017 ruling setting the bar for future settlements, a British judge had described Rolls-Royce as ""dramatically changed"" with a new leadership and culture.
Airbus has fired more than 100 people over ethics and compliance issues as a result of its own probe into the allegations, which widened to other divisions. 
But the internal probe led to anger within the Franco-German firm and its jet sales teams who denied any influence over the tightly controlled agent system, which political sources have described as part of a wider French influence network abroad.
It also threatened to reopen Franco-German tensions over Airbus as French sources complained the row diverted attention from a separate probe into fighter jet dealings with Austria, partially overseen by German-born Tom Enders who later served as chief executive. Enders has denied any wrongdoing.
A further German probe into potential misuse of client documents is ongoing.

1292,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2020 05:26PM ET</span>","Apple iPhone sales return to growth, pushing profits above expectations","By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) on Tuesday reported sales and profits for the holiday shopping quarter above Wall Street expectations, powered by a rise in iPhone sales for the first time in a year and soaring demand for add-ons like AirPods wireless headphones.
But even though Apple executives set a new target of 600 million paid subscribers on its platform by the end of calendar 2020, the company's closely watched services business, which includes its new Apple TV+ streaming offering, missed Wall Street's targets. Apple's total number of installed devices grew by 100 million to more than 1.5 billion over the past year.
Apple gave a revenue forecast for the quarter ending in March above Wall Street expectations. But Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters the company was using a wider-than-normal prediction range because of the uncertainty created by the coronavirus outbreak in China, where many of Apple's suppliers are based. Cook said executives plan to discuss more details of how the virus will affect Apple's supply chain on the company's conference call with investors.
Apple shares rose 2.7% to $326.15 in after-hours trading after the results were announced.
Apple posted $91.8 billion in revenue for the quarter ended Dec. 28, compared with analyst estimates of $88.5 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The company forecast $63.0 billion to $67.0 billion in revenue for the quarter ending in March, ahead of estimates of $62.4 billion, showing it believes that its phones and other devices such as AirPods wireless headphones will continue to sell well during what is often a slow time of year.
Apple’s share price has more than doubled since Cook warned a year ago that the company was likely to miss financial targets for its biggest sales quarter of its fiscal 2019. In the year since, Apple slashed prices in China, one of its most important markets, to rekindle sales there. The company also made a push into paid services, rolling out a credit card with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and subscription gaming and television services last year.
Apple reported services revenue of $12.7 billion, below analyst estimates of $13 billion, and up from $10.9 billion the year before. Many investors think that services revenue eventually will boost Apple’s gross margins, which were 38.35% in the December quarter compared with estimates of 38.06%.
The shift toward services, however, depends on Apple continuing to grow its base of users and sign them up for recurring subscriptions that analysts view as potentially more lucrative than hardware sales, which can be inconsistent because they are large purchases that consumers make only every few years. Apple said it now has more than 1.5 billion active installed devices and 480 million subscribers to both its own and third-party paid services, compared with 1.4 billion devices and 360 million subscribers a year earlier.
Apple's Cook told Reuters the company expects surpass its previously stated goal of 500 million subscribers for 2020 during the current quarter ended in March, ahead of schedule. Cook said Apple is establishing a new goal of 600 million subscribers by the end of the calendar year.
""We're really proud of 100 million (user) growth in the installed base. That's huge. And that's a testament to the new customers we brought in, the switchers,"" Cook told Reuters.
Cook said the company's Apple TV+ subscription streaming video service released last fall was a ""rousing success"" and that it is ""very strong, both the people that are getting it in the bundle and the people that are paying for it that haven't bought a new device.""
Solid iPhone sales of $55.96 billion compared with analyst estimates of $51.6 billion and year-before sales of $52 billion snapped a yearlong trend of major sales declines for Apple’s biggest-selling hardware product. Cook said that the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro models drove the growth and also factored into the company's forecast, calling the devices ""the strongest iPhone lineup we've ever had.""
But Apple’s wearables segment – which, along with AirPods, also includes the Apple Watch – hit $10.0 billion in revenue versus estimates of $9.5 billion, up sharply from $7.3 billion the year before. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi wrote in a note to clients that sales of AirPods alone – a metric Apple does not disclose – may have reached $3.5 billion to $4 billion in the December quarter, a rise of 150% from the year before.
Cook told Reuters that Apple could not make enough AirPods and Apple Watch Series 3 devices to meet demand during the fiscal first quarter and continues to be short on both. Cook said Apple does not have an estimate for when it will be able to fulfill demand for each.
""We're working on both of those very hard,"" Cook told Reuters.
For the December quarter, Apple reported earnings per share of $4.99, compared with analyst estimates of $4.55 per share. For the quarter ending in March, Apple forecast gross margins of between 38.0% and 39.0%, compared with analyst estimates of 38.2%."

1295,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2020 04:51PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Do or die - Nissan takes the axe to the house Ghosn built,"By Norihiko Shirouzu
YOKOHAMA, Japan (Reuters) - Nissan (T:7201) is planning aggressive cost cuts to deal with an unexpected slump in sales as the expansionist strategy it inherited from fugitive former Chairman Carlos Ghosn flounders, four people familiar with the plans said.
Japan's second biggest carmaker is set to eliminate at least 4,300 white-collar jobs and shut two manufacturing sites as part of broader plans to add at least 480 billion yen ($4.4 billion) to its bottom line by 2023, two of the people told Reuters.
The moves come on top of a turnaround plan unveiled in July and are likely to include cutting Nissan's range of cars and the array of product options and trims in each line, slashing jobs mostly at head offices in the United States and Europe, and reducing advertising and marketing budgets, they said.
""The situation is dire. It's do or die,"" a person close to Nissan's senior management and the company's board told Reuters.
Most of the planned cuts and measures to enhance efficiency were presented to Nissan's board in November and received its general blessing, two sources said.
A Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) spokeswoman declined to comment on new restructuring measures or the view that weaker-than-expected sales were the catalyst for a global overhaul.
Under Ghosn, Nissan embarked on a global expansion, boosting capacity to add new models, driving more decidedly into markets such as India, Russia, South Africa and southeast Asia and spending heavily on promotions and marketing to hit targets.
Now, many of those models are missing sales goals and executives at Nissan's Yokohama headquarters estimate up to 40% of its global manufacturing capacity is unused, or under-used.
Some executives are worried Nissan, part of an alliance with  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Mitsubishi (T:7211), could post another loss at its carmaking business in the last quarter of 2019 - and possibly for all its operations in the year ending in March.
One source said that would most likely hinge on whether Nissan books big restructuring expenses in its current financial year, or waits until the year ending in March 2021.
Reuters spoke to nine people familiar with Nissan's plans. All declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the subject.
MISSED TARGETS
In July, Nissan said it would cut 12,500 jobs from 14 sites around the world, from the United Kingdom to Spain, Mexico, Japan, India and Indonesia - and reduce its model range by 10%.
At the time, Nissan officials told Reuters that meant shutting one production line at each plant.
Now, Nissan is considering shutting two plants permanently, on top of the reductions at the 14 other sites, people close to Nissan's management and board with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. They didn't say which two new sites were at risk.
People familiar with the plans said the axe was also likely to fall at Nissan's North American head office in Tennessee and its European headquarters in Geneva, as they were bloated with high-spending sales and marketing staff.
One source with direct knowledge of the turnaround plan said Nissan's marketing teams globally gobble up nearly 1 trillion yen a year, or about 45% of Nissan's annual fixed costs of 2.1 trillion.
Nissan had been saddled with the excess, ""thanks to (Ghosn's) highly aggressive, expansionist volume goals, which we failed to achieve"", the source said.
A spokeswoman for Ghosn said he declined to comment for this story.
Ghosn told a news conference in Beirut on Jan. 8 that Nissan's poor performance since 2017 was down to Hiroto Saikawa, who formally took over from him as Nissan CEO in April 2017.
""He was CEO and he was responsible for it,"" Ghosn said.
In addition to cuts in Nissan's fixed costs, managers are also considering plans to kill off unprofitable models, accelerate the pace of new product development and reduce the average age of its line-up to 2-1/2 years from five now.
The new plans aim to add 480 billion yen to Nissan's bottom line by the end of March 2023, with 300 billion from cuts in fixed costs and 180 billion from an array of cars to be launched in the next three years, people familiar with the matter said.
Nissan is aiming to achieve an operating margin of 6% on revenue of 14.5 trillion yen by March 2023, compared with 3.0% from 13.0 trillion forecast for the year ending in March 2020, according to plans announced in July.
But since July, Nissan's operating performance has worsened by more than expected, making it likely its new management team will have to find savings significantly above the 480 billion yen currently envisaged to hit its targets, three sources said.
'PHASE TWO'
To be sure, Nissan has plenty of cash in its coffers to cope with setbacks. According to quarterly results, it had 1.14 trillion yen in net cash at the end of September.
Still, sources said Nissan was no longer adding freshly generated cash to its war chest, mainly because of its high fixed costs and the sales slide. Furthermore, it has expensive car launches in the next few years that could eat into reserves.
""Even if we had one trillion yen in cash, that could be depleted in no time if we didn't pay attention,"" a person close to Nissan management told Reuters.
Three of the people said the collapse in Nissan sales around the world was a major factor in forcing the company to consider restructuring above and beyond the measures outlined in July.
They said Nissan's global sales would likely fall towards 5 million vehicles, or slightly above, way short of its sales goal of 5.5 million for its current financial year.
The worse-than-expected downturn, which has forced Nissan to spend more on promotions to cushion the fallout, has created additional urgency to take more drastic steps, sources said.
Of particular concern is the U.S. market, where sales fell 10% in 2019, and the continued sluggishness of the Chinese market, which left Nissan's sales volumes down 1.1% from 2018.
One especially troublesome issue for Nissan has been its sales efficiency. In 2018, it had 69 models and sold 5.2 million vehicles - or 75,000 on average per model line - and it was planning to expand its line-up to 73 by the end of 2022.
Now, it is aiming to cut its range to 62 and boost average sales per line to 87,000, the equivalent of Toyota's (T:7203) average last year, according to calculations and forecasts by the team formulating Nissan's recovery plan.
""We thought by now we would be selling 6 million cars a year. But the truth of the matter is our selling ability is about just north of 5 million,"" one source said.
OPEN ROAD?
People familiar with Nissan's internal discussions said there was even some concern the new measures being considered, known as ""Phase Two"" cuts, might not be enough to achieve its three-year turnaround goals if sales don't recover fast enough.
""Those Phase Two measures will most likely fall short,"" said one person familiar with restructuring plans, making a point echoed by several people close to the management team and board.
To make matters worse, the restructuring efforts have been disrupted by the political turmoil following Ghosn's departure in 2018, his flight from Japan in December and subsequent accusations against former colleagues at Nissan.
According to five sources, the upheaval rattled Nissan's top management team so much that it paralyzed their ability to execute many of the planned restructuring moves smoothly.
The latest turmoil lasted from December to mid-January, when the board curbed the influence of ""anti-alliance"" forces sabotaging the plans, two sources said, declining to elaborate.
Nissan's new CEO Makoto Uchida took the reins at the start of December with Ashwani Gupta, who has worked at Mitsubishi, Nissan and Renault, as chief operating officer.
""Whoever the action was aimed at, the upshot is that Gupta is now completely freed from pressures from those anti-alliance forces to carry out all the planned turnaround measures,"" one of the people said. ""He should do so without hesitation as the board has cleared the way."""
1296,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 28, 2020 04:48PM ET</span>",Apple Earnings Beat in Q1 as iPhone Growth Returns,"
By Yasin Ebrahim 
Investing.com - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported earnings that topped analyst expectations as a new slate of phones led to a revival in iPhone sales during the fiscal first quarter.
Shares rose a little more than 1% after hours.

The company reported earnings per share of $4.99 on revenue of $91.82 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com forecast EPS of $4.54 on revenue of $88.38 billion.
That was in comparison with EPS of $4.18 on revenue of $84.31 billion in the same quarter a year before. Apple had announced EPS of $3.03 on revenue of $64.04 billion in the prior quarter.
The earnings beat comes as iPhone sales returned to growth, while services grew slower than expected in the quarter.  
IPhone revenue rose 7.6% to $55.96 billion from a year earlier, topping estimates of $51.2 billion.
“We are thrilled to report Apple’s highest quarterly revenue ever, fueled by strong demand for our iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro models, and all-time records for services and wearables,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “During the holiday quarter our active installed base of devices grew in each of our geographic segments and has now reached over 1.5 billion. We see this as a powerful testament to the satisfaction, engagement and loyalty of our customers — and a great driver of our growth across the board.”
Revenue for the company’s fast-growing services segment, which includes Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Music, Apple Pay and iCloud storage – rose 17% to $12.7 billion from a year earlier, compared with estimates of $12.8 billion.
""With growth for iPhones reviving and Apple’s services business showing strong expansion, investors have become confident about the company’s prospects. For the first time since 2011, shares of the iPhone maker have been trading at a higher price-earnings ratio than the S&P 500,"" Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar said. 
Apple’s wearables, home and accessories category - previously called other products - grew revenue 37% to $10 billion from the year-ago period, above estimates of $9.7 billion.
Revenue for the iPad grew 17% and revenue for the Mac grew 9%.
Looking ahead, the company guided fiscal second-quarter revenue in the range of $64 billion and $67 billion, compared with Wall Street estimates of $58.83 billion.
Gross margin was guided within a range of 38% to 39% compared with estimates of 38.2%. 
""Apple’s push to expand its sales from services is clearly succeeding, while growth from iPhones is coming back,"" Anwar said. ""This powerful combination justifies the stock’s current valuation and its future growth potential. Any post earnings weakness, in our view, should be taken as a buying opportunity."" 

Apple is up 8.19% from the beginning of the year, still down 1.74% from its 52-week high of $323.32 set on January 24.

But AMD cut top-line guidance for the first quarter, saying it predicts revenue of $1.75 billion to $1.85 billion.
Analysts were looking for $1.87 billion, according to S&P Capital IQ.
“Trading near the highest level in two decades, AMD stock is susceptible to correction before carrying on higher,” Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar said. “But the chipmaker is slowly expanding its market share and is well positioned to take advantage of lapses by Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).”
“Any weakness in AMD's stock value should be taken as a buying opportunity,” Anwar added.
“The majority of its gaming chip updates are set to hit the market this year, giving AMD an edge over competitors,” he said. “AMD’s smart move to partner with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing means that it has access to the 7-nanometer server chips much ahead of Intel.”

Investing.com – The Dow rallied sharply Tuesday, as the rout a day earlier attracted bargain buying across stocks, even as the bulk of corporate earnings failed to live up to Wall Street expectations.
The S&P 500 rose 1%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7%.
Bargain-hunting investors piled into beaten-down sectors like tech and travel stocks.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) both ended in a day the green. But United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) proved an expectation to the rally after announcing that it was cutting some flights from the U.S. to mainland China, citing a ""significant decline in demand as the (coronavirus) continues to spread.""
The death toll from the coronavirus in China rose to 106, with 4,600 affected globally, according to media reports. 
Tech also saw some reprieve, led by a rebound in semiconductor stocks with some on Wall Street suggesting the outbreak may pose a benefit to U.S.-based chip firms.
Any disruption to memory output in China on the back of a faster spread of the virus could ""be positive for memory suppliers outside of China such as Micron (NASDAQ:MU),   Western Digital   (NASDAQ:WDC) and others,"" said Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh.

A wave of mostly bearish earnings, meanwhile, had little impact on sentiment.
3M (NYSE:MMM) slipped about 6% after the industrial giant reported quarterly results that fell short of Wall Street estimates. United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), however, beat quarterly estimates on both the top and bottom lines, sending its shares about 1% higher.
  Pfizer   (NYSE:PFE), meanwhile, fell 5% after its missed quarterly earnings estimates, driven partly by the loss of exclusivity for its pain drug Lyrica.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Electric pickup truck start-up Lordstown Motors is pursuing a $200 million loan from a U.S. Energy Department program to retool a former General Motors (N:GM) factory in northeast Ohio, Chief Executive Steve Burns told Reuters.
Burns met with Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette on Monday for about an hour and the company was holding additional talks with officials on Tuesday from the Energy Department's Loan Program Office.
""We think we are worthy of government help. We don't want a handout - we want a loan,"" Burns told Reuters in an interview. ""It's just going to be more jobs faster if we get it. We are viable without it.""
Burns disclosed the company plans to unveil a drivable version of its electric truck at the Detroit auto show in June. It hopes to begin production by year-end.
The Energy Department declined comment.
Burns said the company hopes to receive funding from the Energy Department's Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing program that in 2009 awarded loans to  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) and Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) to retool factories, but has not issued loans since 2011. Nissan and Tesla previously repaid their loans.
The fate of the sprawling plant became a political lightning rod after GM announced its planned closure in November 2018, drawing condemnation from U.S. President Donald Trump and many U.S. lawmakers.
A bipartisan group of Ohio lawmakers wrote Brouillette last week offering ""strong support"" for the loan, saying northeast Ohio was dealt a ""severe blow"" by the plant closing.
Lordstown Motors Corp, which is 10% owned by Workhorse Group Inc (O:WKHS), bought the plant and equipment for $20 million as part of its ambitious plan to begin building electric pickup trucks by the end of 2020.
""It's cool to bring something back to life,"" Burns said.
The company is working to raise additional funding and is in advanced talks with a large strategic investor, Burns said.
GM last year agreed to loan Lordstown Motors $40 million to acquire and retool the plant. Burns hopes to repay GM's loan ""in a few weeks.""
Burns plans to start crash-testing vehicles in July, hiring about 400 hourly workers in September and to begin production in November or December.
Electric vehicle startup Rivian, backed by Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Ford, plans to build an electric pickup truck and companion starting in late 2020. GM plans to build its first electric pickup truck starting in late 2021. Tesla plans to start building its electric Cybertruck in late 2021."
1306,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2020 03:01PM ET</span>","High expectations for Tesla, and a long way to go to match rivals' steady profit","By Tina Bellon and Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - Buckle up. Tesla's quarterly report could be another wild ride for investors.
The electric carmaker's stock has more than doubled since Tesla's previous quarterly report on October 23, when it posted a surprise profit that was viewed as a milestone for the company.
Still, a Reuters analysis of Tesla's and other luxury carmakers' operating profit per vehicle - a metric closely watched by auto executives - shows Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) still has a long way to go before reaching the steady profits of rivals  Porsche  (DE:PSHG_p), BMW and Mercedes-Benz.
(For a graphic comparing vehicles' profitability, click https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/TESLA-RESULTS/0H001R87WBMF/index.html)
At an average of roughly $17,750 per vehicle, operating profit at luxury carmaker Porsche, for example, has been stable over the past four years. Mercedes' and BMW's profit per vehicle have been closer to $3,000.
At Tesla, on the other hand, operating results fluctuated between a loss of nearly $20,500 per vehicle in the third quarter of 2017 and a profit of nearly $5,000 per vehicle in the third quarter of 2018.
Calculating profits per vehicle allows for better comparison across the auto industry. Reuters selected Porsche, BMW and Mercedes because their cars compete in similar price segments and for a like-minded customer base.
Tesla's rally in recent months has been fueled by its unexpected third-quarter profit, a production ramp-up at its new factory in China and better-than-expected car deliveries. Tesla's stock was up 1% on Tuesday.
While analysts on average expect Tesla to report another profitable quarter, it would be only the fifth such quarter since 2010. For the December quarter, analysts on average expect Tesla to post revenue down 2.9% to $7.02 billion and adjusted net income of $305 million, or $1.72 per share.
Options traders expect more volatility after Tesla releases its fourth-quarter results late on Wednesday.
As of Tuesday, Tesla options implied an 11% swing for the shares in either direction by Friday. Over the last eight quarters, the stock moved 9.5% on average after Tesla reported results, according to options analytics company Trade Alert.
Porsche last year released its first fully-electric sports car, while Mercedes and BMW have released their own electric vehicle versions. General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) are gearing up to launch their own electric vehicles.
While the German carmakers still largely rely on combustion engine-powered cars and are struggling to persuade customers to pay a premium for electric vehicles, they have a century of manufacturing and a well-developed global sales network behind them.
As Musk's nears the first tranche of a record pay package that depends in part on increasing Tesla's market capitalization, the carmaker's stock remains among the most divisive on Wall Street.
While Tesla’s recent progress has cheered supporters, many investors remain skeptical of the company’s ability to consistently deliver profit and cash flow. As well as repeatedly missing targets in recent years, Musk’s mercurial behavior has come under scrutiny from financial regulators and shareholders.
Tesla's market capitalization must be sustained at or above $100 billion for both a one-month and six-month average in order to trigger the vesting of a $346-million tranche of options that are the first part of Musk's record-breaking pay package.

In the past 30 days, short bets against Tesla have decreased by almost $660 million to $14 billion, eclipsing the $12.9 billion worth of short positions against much-larger Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and making Tesla the most shorted stock on Wall Street, according to S3 Partners, a financial technology and analytics firm.

1309,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2020 02:02PM ET</span>",Belt and Road Initiative to boost Chinese lending in LatAm,"By Daniela Guzman and Aaron Weinman
NEW YORK (LPC) - China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is jumpstarting new infrastructure and energy development projects in Latin America, while opening the door for more Chinese lending in the region.
Initiated in 2013 by the Chinese government, the BRI seeks to build a modern version of the Silk Road to link China with the rest of Asia, Europe and beyond through large-scale projects. It is one of the most ambitious infrastructure initiatives conceived.
Latin America is projected to be the “bright spark” for Chinese investment throughout 2020, according to a report from Fitch Solutions, as more countries sign up to the initiative and Chinese companies obtain new contracts to construct and finance infrastructure projects in the region.
China is Latin America’s second-largest trading partner, after the US. Trade between China and the region grew 19% year-over-year to US$307.4bn in 2019 from 2018, according to Fitch Solutions.
Since 2017, Ecuador, Chile, Uruguay, Trinidad & Tobago, Panama, the Dominican Republic and El Salvador have signed agreements to cooperate with China on the BRI.
As China’s President Xi Jinping seeks to strengthen ties with governments in the region, the country’s biggest state-owned firms are increasingly winning construction, energy and transportation projects.
Earlier this month, utility China Yangtze Power completed a US$4bn bridge loan with the Bank of China, Industrial Commercial Bank of China, Santander (MC:SAN) in Hong Kong and MUFG supporting its proposed acquisition of Sempra Energy’s power assets in Peru. 
In November, power company State Grid Corp of China was seeking more than US$2bn in bank debt to finance the purchase of Sempra’s assets in neighboring Chile, sources told Refinitiv LPC at the time. 
“The favorite strategy of the Chinese investor is to invest in a Latin American company that has a connection with China, and they (China’s banks) prefer to lend bilaterally,” said a managing director at a US investment bank, adding that the country’s banks generally fund deals directly or on a club basis.
ICBC and the Bank of China, for example, are providing US$600m in debt to help construct an oil refinery at the Mexican port of Dos Bocas, China’s Ambassador to Mexico Zhu Qingqiao told reporters on January 13 at a Mexican economy ministry event. The refinery is estimated to cost up to US$8bn, according to various media reports.
China Civil Engineering Construction Corp on January 7, signed a contract to build the Regiotram de Occidente, an elevated rail line in Colombia’s capital Bogotá, and the firm is after US$300m in debt to finance the operation, banking sources said. 
DUE DILIGENCE
As Chinese-backed projects progress in Latin America, the pace of BRI-related works could slow down in 2020, as the Chinese government works to improve transparency and sustainability on financing with BRI-linked countries, according to the January 8 report from Fitch Solutions.
Given that most countries linked to the BRI are characterized as emerging markets that pose higher risks for investors, the scheme has faced some criticism. Many observers are fearful that opaque financing arrangements could lead to unsustainable debt and question whether the initiative is more about promoting Chinese influence than bringing development.
“There has been criticism around the types of projects that were advanced and transparency around projects’ costs, sovereign debt and the sustainability of government finances impacted by loans,” said Matteo Addonizio, an analyst at Fitch Solutions.
In Ecuador, for instance, by the end of 2018, the government had borrowed up to US$19bn in loans from China to fast-track development projects. The loans, which were partially repayable with oil shipments, became expensive as oil prices dropped.
Ecuador has since struggled to tighten its fiscal deficit. In February 2019 it resorted to a US$10.2bn bailout package from international financial institutions including the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
Going forward, China’s approach to each country is expected to be more customized, according to Fitch Solutions. And this is likely to reduce reputational risk for China and help gain the trust of other BRI countries.

“This increased focus on transparency will slow the advance of projects overall as the deal-making process will lengthen,” said Addonizio, but added that these processes would be more stringent with heightened due diligence measures.

1311,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2020 01:53PM ET</span>",Countdown to recession: What an inverted yield curve means,"By Karen Brettell
NEW YORK - A dramatic rally in Treasuries this week led some key parts of the U.S. yield curve to reinvert, a signal that has traditionally been bearish for the U.S. economy.
The curve between two-year and five-year notes inverted on Monday for the first time since December, and the three-month, 10-year curve briefly turned negative on Tuesday for the first time since October.
Long-dated yields dropped as fears over the economic impact of China's coronavirus led investors to seek out safe-haven assets.
The move has offset optimism heading into the year that growth and inflation would pick up, after the United States and China in December agreed to de-escalate their trade war.
The gap between three-month and 10-year yields is closely watched. An inversion, when 10-year yields fall below those on three-month bills, has in the past been a reliable indicator that a recession will follow in one to two years.
This part of the yield curve inverted last March for the first time since the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
Still, while a recession may be likely to follow, the timing is uncertain, and loose monetary policy globally could result in any downturn taking longer to materialize.
Some analysts also think that the relative attractiveness of U.S. bonds to those in Europe and Japan, many of which have negative yields, is keeping longer-dated yields below where they would otherwise be, reducing the accuracy of the yield curve inversion as a recession signal.
WHAT IS THE TREASURY YIELD CURVE?
The yield curve is a plot of the yields on all Treasury maturities - debt sold by the federal government - ranging from 1-month bills to 30-year bonds.
In normal circumstances, it has an arcing, upward slope because bond investors expect to be compensated more for taking on the added risk of owning bonds with longer maturities.
When yields further out on the curve are substantially higher than those near the front, the curve is referred to as steep. So a 30-year bond will deliver a much higher yield than a 2-year note.
When the gap, or ""spread"", is narrow, it is referred to as a flat curve. In that situation, a 10-year note, for instance, may offer only a modestly higher yield than a 3-year note.
WHAT IS A CURVE INVERSION?
On rare occasions, some or all of the yield curve ceases to be upward sloping. This occurs when shorter-dated yields are higher than longer-dated ones and is called an inversion.
While various economic or market commentators may focus on different parts of the yield curve, any inversion of the yield curve tells the same story: An expectation of weaker growth in the future.
In March, inversion of the yield curve hit 3-month T-bills for the first time in about 12 years when the yield on 10-year notes (US10YT=RR) dropped below those for 3-month securities.
It has traded in positive territory since October, with the exception of Tuesday's brief inversion.
The curve between 2-year and 10-year notes, which is also watched as a recession indicator, inverted for the first time since 2007 in August. It has been positive since early September.
(Graphic: Yield curve inversions typically precede recessions, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/4686/4648/Inversion210.png)
WHY DOES INVERSION MATTER?
Yield curve inversion is a classic signal of a looming recession.
The U.S. curve has inverted before each recession in the past 50 years. It offered a false signal just once in that time.
When short-term yields climb above longer-dated ones, it signals short-term borrowing costs are more expensive than longer-term loan costs.
Under these circumstances, companies often find it more expensive to fund their operations, and executives tend to temper or shelve investments. Consumer borrowing costs also rise and consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, slows.
The economy eventually contracts and unemployment rises.
WHY DOES THE CURVE INVERT AT ALL?
Shorter-dated securities are highly sensitive to interest rate policy set by a central bank such as the U.S. Federal Reserve.
Longer-dated securities are more influenced by investors' expectations for future inflation because inflation is anathema to bond holders.
So, when the Fed is raising rates, as it did for three years, that pushes up yields on shorter-dated bonds at the front of the curve. And when future inflation is seen as contained, as it is now because higher borrowing costs are expected to become a drag on the economy, investors are willing to accept relatively modest yields on long-dated bonds at the back end of the curve."

CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) said on Tuesday it was suspending some flights between the United States and Beijing, Hong Kong and Shanghai between Feb. 1 and Feb. 8 due to a ""significant decline in demand"" as the new coronavirus spreads.
""We will continue to monitor the situation as it develops and will adjust our schedule as needed,"" United said in a statement.
The coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China has killed 106 people in the Asian country and spread across the world, rattling financial markets.
United's suspension affects a total of 24 flights.

The other two U.S. airlines that fly to China, Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) and  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL), said they had not reduced their flights at this time but were closely monitoring the situation.

1313,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 28, 2020 01:37PM ET</span>",LVMH Sales Growth Slows as Hong Kong Protests Take Toll,"(Bloomberg) -- LVMH’s sales growth slowed in the fourth quarter as protests in Hong Kong dented Chinese demand for the luxury giant’s products at the end of a strong year.
Sales rose 8% on an organic basis, slowing from 11% in the third quarter, Paris-based LVMH said Tuesday after the close of trading. Analysts expected an 8.7% increase, according to a Bloomberg survey.
The maker of high-end items ranging from Givenchy perfume to Veuve Clicquot Champagne has been riding high during a three-year boom led by Chinese customers. The momentum largely persisted through headwinds including a weaker yuan and slowing domestic growth.
Recent political protests in Hong Kong have dissuaded shoppers from visiting the long-time luxury hub. Anti-Beijing demonstrations particularly affected duty-free retailer DFS, LVMH said.
Italy’s Salvatore Ferragamo SpA also said Tuesday that it was hit by the turmoil in Hong Kong, with retail sales there falling more than 50% from a year earlier in the fourth quarter. The company’s overall sales for the full year also missed analysts’ estimates.
Coronavirus Fears
Concerns about the impact of the coronavirus epidemic originating in Wuhan, China, have prompted a sell-off in luxury stocks over the past week. The outbreak of the respiratory illness has coincided with the Lunar New Year holiday, which is usually a high point for tourist shopping.
Hong Kong on Tuesday announced curbs on travel from mainland China in an effort to contain the virus, which could act as a further drag on spending.
“We’re seeing an extremely strong and motivated response from China,” LVMH Chairman Bernard Arnault said in a Paris briefing. “That reaction will have clear consequences in the fight against this epidemic.”
LVMH’s shares have risen more than 60% over the past two years, fueling acquisitions including a $16.2 billion deal to take over American jeweler Tiffany & Co. That purchase, the luxury industry’s biggest to date, is expected to be completed mid-year.
The slightly downbeat end to the year took some of the shine off growth at Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, LVMH’s biggest fashion brands, which boosted the fashion division’s profits 24% for the full year.
Christian Dior’s $3,000 canvas book totes and $1,100 sneakers drove growth for the house. Rising demand for Louis Vuitton saw the brand open new factories in France and Texas, inviting U.S. President Donald Trump to inaugurate the latter.

LONDON/NEW YORK/PARIS (Reuters) - U.S. boutique investment bank Centerview has found an office in the heart of Paris and is hiring senior bankers to establish a second European hub as Brexit looms, three sources told Reuters.
Centerview, which already has an office in London's Mayfair, has rented space on the upmarket Avenue Matignon and plans to open for business in the next few months, the sources said, requesting anonymity as the matter is confidential.
The New York-based bank has held talks with a number of prominent dealmakers in Paris including the former boss of Lazard in France, Matthieu Pigasse, the sources said.
Its target list also includes Deutsche Bank's (DE:DBKGn) co-head of corporate and investment banking Emmanuel Hasbanian and  Barclays  (L:BARC) managing director Yann Krychowski, who specializes in financial services, the sources said.
The two were recently approached by Centerview but an agreement over a possible move has yet to be found, they said.
Centerview, Hasbanian and Krychowski declined to comment. Pigasse did not respond to a request for comment.
The bank's push into continental Europe comes with Britain set to leave the European Union on Jan. 31. Large investment banks and independent advisory outfits are bulking up their presence across Europe to ensure access to continental clients.
The value of French mergers and acquisitions (M&A) rose 2% last year to $193 billion, the third highest in the past decade, according to Refinitiv data.
That was mainly due to a surge in outbound M&A which spiked 33% to a record $115 billion, despite a general slowdown in European activity, the data showed.
Citi (N:C) topped the French M&A league table in 2019 followed by Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) with only three independent advisory firms - Lazard, Perella Weinberg & Partners and D'Angelin & Co - making the top 10.
Centerview ranked fourth last year for global M&A deals led by advisory boutiques with a 2.1% share of the overall fee pool. Lazard took the largest slice.
FRENCH ROLLOUT
Centerview is betting on a mix of junior and seasoned deal-makers to drive its French roll-out as it wants to become the advisor of choice for big French companies, the sources said.
It recently landed a key advisory role representing U.S. jeweler Tiffany (N:TIF) in takeover negotiations with French luxury group LVMH (PA:LVMH) - a milestone transaction for French dealmaking in the United States.
Pigasse, whose contract with Lazard ended on Dec. 31, would help Centerview woo large French clients. He has held talks about a senior role at Centerview in Paris but has yet to commit, the sources said.
The U.S. bank, co-founded by Blair Effron and Robert Pruzan, is also close to poaching two other former Lazard dealmakers, Nicolas Constant and Pierre Pasqual, the sources said.
Constant helped Pigasse advise French cosmetics giant L'Oreal (PA:OREP) while at Lazard, two of the sources said.
Neither Constant nor Pasqual were immediately available for comment.
Other M&A newcomers in France include Perella Weinberg - the investment bank founded by Joe Perella and Peter Weinberg - and  Greenhill  & Co (N:GHL).
Perella launched its Paris office in 2018, luring French bankers from Bank of America (N:BAC) and Goldman Sachs while Greenhill picked Amelie Negrier-Oyarzabal, a former Lazard partner, to open its French hub in late 2019.
New York-based Evercore Inc (N:EVR) tapped headhunting firm Charta Partners last year to attract French bankers with long-standing relationships with the country's key companies but has yet to open a local office."

Investing.com – The S&P rallied Tuesday, shrugging off mostly weaker corporate earnings and lingering fears over the new coronavirus as the U.S. stepped up measures to curb a potential outbreak.
The S&P 500 jumped 1.06%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.37% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.82%.
As the busiest week of earnings continues to unfold, traders had to contend with a slew of mostly bearish quarterly reports.
3M (NYSE:MMM) slipped about 6% after the industrial giant reported quarterly results that fell short of Wall Street estimates. United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), however, beat quarterly estimates on both the top and bottom lines, sending its shares about 2% higher.
  Pfizer   (NYSE:PFE), meanwhile, fell 4% after its missed quarterly earnings estimates, driven partly by the loss of exclusivity for its pain drug Lyrica.
The rebound in the broader market, following a rout a day earlier, comes against lingering concerns about the coronavirus as the death toll in China continues to rise.
China's death toll from the coronavirus rose to 103 and it reported that the number of people infected with the virus jumped 60% overnight. 
The virus has mostly been isolated to China, with a handful of cases reported elsewhere, but the U.S. has stepped up preventative measures.
Health Secretary Alex Azar warned that the disease potentially represents a ""very serious public health threat,” and confirmed that the Trump administration is expanding screening for the virus from five to 20 U.S. airports.
Casino stocks, which are among the worst hit by the outbreak of virus in China, clawed back some of their recent losses, with Wynn (NASDAQ:WYNN),   Las Vegas Sands   (NYSE:LVS) and Melco Resorts & Entertainment (NASDAQ:MLCO) trading above the flatline.

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 rose over 1% on Tuesday as a surge in Apple and other technology stocks helped the benchmark index recover from its worst selloff in about four months that was sparked by concerns over the coronavirus outbreak.
Markets across the world stabilized as the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said he was confident in China's ability to contain the virus outbreak, which has killed 106 people in the country, prompted businesses to close operations and curbed travel.
President Xi Jinping later said China was sure of defeating a ""devil"" coronavirus.
""Investors are still trying to assess the possible impact of the coronavirus and they probably feel that yesterday's decline was a bit overdone,"" said Daniel Grosvenor, director of equity strategy at Oxford Economics.
""Our base case is that economic impact is likely to be relatively short-lived, but there is scope for volatility in the near-term.""
The earnings season gathered pace, with Apple Inc (O:AAPL) set to report fourth-quarter results after markets close. Its shares rose 2.4% after a 3% drop on Monday amid a broader market selloff.

Results were mixed on Tuesday, with U.S. industrial giant 3M Co (N:MMM) sliding 5.5% after it forecast 2020 profit below expectations as weak demand from China dents overall growth.
 Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) dropped 4.4% after the drugmaker reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit and said it would no longer rely on share repurchases to help drive growth.
Shares in Xerox Holdings Corp (N:XRX) jumped 5.9% after the company's profit beat analysts' estimates as it kept a tight lid on costs.

1320,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2020 12:58PM ET</span>",Atlantia shares rise on hopes for truce with Italian government,"By Francesca Landini and Giuseppe Fonte
MILAN/ROME (Reuters) -  Atlantia  (MI:ATL) shares gained more than 6% on Tuesday as comments from a minister rekindled hopes that the infrastructure group could reach a compromise with the government over its lucrative motorway concession.
Speaking on Radio 24, Deputy Transport Minister Giancarlo Cancelleri, from the 5-Star Movement that has led calls for Atlantia to be stripped of its concession, acknowledged the government could decide not to revoke the license.
Cancelleri said he personally favored cancellation but that the government had not yet taken a decision.
Atlantia has been under pressure since August 2018 when a bridge operated by its motorway unit Autostrade per l'Italia collapsed in the port city of Genoa, killing 43 people.
Autostrade generates a third of Atlantia's core profits and losing the concession would put the group, which has billions of euros in debt, under severe pressure.
The government is divided on revoking the concession, with the center-left Democratic Party (PD), which governs with 5-Star, more cautious on the issue, fearing a legal battle and potentially heavy compensation costs for the state.
""If the government changes its attitude (on the concession), the stock can only gain,"" a Milan-trader said.
One PD minister said the party, whose position in government has been strengthened by 5-Star's disastrous performance in regional elections at the weekend, preferred a tough contract revision to revoking the license.
They said one option being considered was a partial revocation covering a section of the tollway network, such as the area where the disaster occurred, and allowing the company to keep the rest.
LOOSENING GRIP
The new chief executive of Atlantia, which is controlled by the Benetton family, signaled a more conciliatory approach last week when he talked about the possibility of loosening the group's hold on Autostrade to allow new investors in.
Asked whether Atlantia would be prepared to give up its majority stake in Autostrade or other units, CEO Carlo Bertazzo said: ""Nothing is taboo. It depends on the quality of the partners and on the possibility of creating greater value with them.""
Offering to reduce its stake in Autostrade and allow state-backed investors in the motorway unit could be a way to mend fences with the government and break a standoff which has weighed on the shares for months, one analyst said.
A senior 5-Star source however was cautious about the prospect of finding a quick way out of the dispute.
""Letting new investors inside Autostrade is not a game changer that could make 5-Star retreat from its intention to revoke Atlantia's concession,"" the source said."

Under Albert Bourla, who took the helm at the start of last year, Pfizer has streamlined operations and announced plans to separate its off-patent branded drugs business, Upjohn, and combine it with generic drugmaker Mylan NV (O:MYL).
The company said it expects 2020 adjusted earnings per share to be in the range $2.82 to $2.92. Excluding Upjohn unit, it expects full-year adjusted earnings in the range $2.25 to $2.35 per share.
Sales of breast cancer drug Ibrance rose 13.2% to $1.28 billion in the fourth quarter, but missed the consensus estimate of $1.35 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Revenue fell 9% to $12.69 billion, partly hurt by intense competition for its pain treatment Lyrica that lost patent protection last year.
Excluding items, it earned 55 cents per share, missing the average analyst estimate of 58 cents per share.

Net loss attributable to Pfizer narrowed to $337 million, or 6 cents per share, in the quarter, from $394 million, or 7 cents per share, a year earlier.

1325,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2020 12:06PM ET</span>",Harley-Davidson's shares tumble on steeper fall in revenues,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc (N:HOG) on Tuesday reported a larger-than-expected decline in its motorcycles revenue, hurt by a continuing slide in retail sales in the United States, sending its shares lower.
Revenues at its motorcycles, parts & accessories and general merchandise segment fell 8.5% year-on-year to $874.1 million in the fourth quarter on the back of lower bike shipments. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv on average expected revenues to decline 3.7% to $920.14 million in the quarter.
Its shares were down 3.2% at $33.71 in midday trade.
Harley's challenges in the United States, which accounts for more than half of sales, are well-documented - core customers are growing older and efforts to attract new and young riders have yet to show results.
In the December quarter, U.S. retail sales declined for the 12th straight quarter. Sales in the domestic market are projected to slide at a tempered pace in 2020.
In a reflection of the demographic headwind, the heavyweight motorcycle maker's stock price has declined by 44% in the past five years. In comparison, the S&P 500 has gained 63%.
Chief Executive Matthew Levatich told analysts that the challenges facing the company were ""significant"" as Harley's heavy and expensive bikes were competing for ""people's scarce time, people's scarce funding and commitment.""
To turn around the business, Levatich is focusing on increasing ridership in the United States and has plans to invest as much as $1.6 billion through 2022.
But with the company struggling to improve sales at a time when the U.S. economy is having its longest expansion in history, investors speculate whether Harley would consider strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of the company to help preserve its brand and maximize shareholder value.
On Tuesday, Levatich parried that question by expressing confidence in the company's strategy to make forays into middleweight, lightweight and battery-powered bikes and grow its business overseas, particularly in Asia, to account for half of its revenue by 2027.
Those efforts seem to be bearing fruit. Sales in Asia-Pacific were up 2.7% year-on-year in 2019.
And with the European Union allowing it to ship bikes from its facility in Thailand, sidestepping the trading bloc's 25% retaliatory tariffs on U.S.-built motorcycles, Harley's sales in Europe are also expected to get a boost this year.
The move is projected to help reduce the costs of EU and China tariffs to $35 million this year from $98 million in 2019.

In 2020, motorcycles segment revenues are expected to be about $4.53 to $4.66 billion compared with $4.57 billion last year. Lower tariff bill and higher savings are projected to improve operating margins by at least 70 basis points this year.

1326,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 28, 2020 11:28AM ET</span>",Billionaires Square Off Over Newcastle United,"(Bloomberg) -- Want the lowdown on European markets? In your inbox before the open, every day. Sign up here.
England’s Premier League has been buzzing with news that Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund is leading an investor group that wants to buy Newcastle United for about 340 million pounds ($445 million).
A potential takeover could be a boon for the northern soccer team with legions of passionate fans but a lackluster recent record, but it would also have repercussions well beyond sport. Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund is led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
The potential deal is bringing together a disparate group of billionaires, and at the center a well-connected dealmaker.
Amanda Staveley
The 46-year-old investment adviser has carved out a niche as a bridge between the royal families of the Middle East and the U.K. Staveley advised Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a member of the royal family of Abu Dhabi, on a potential capital investment in  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc during the 2008 financial crisis. She wound up suing the bank, alleging it cheated her firm, PCP Capital Partners, out of hundreds of millions of pounds in compensation. The suit is expected to be heard this year.
She also advised Mansour on his 2008 purchase of Manchester City, a team that had long been eclipsed by its crosstown rival, Manchester United. The deal paved the way for a remarkable run as Manchester City won four Premier League championships. Last year, the club sold a 10% stake for $500 million.
She had less success in 2018 when trying to organize a separate bid for Newcastle. Now Staveley, who operates from a stone mansion across from London’s Hyde Park as well as Dubai, is back in the fray. Her firm is poised to buy a stake alongside the Saudis and another super-rich family.
For Staveley, who grew up in North Yorkshire just south of Newcastle, a deal would be a riposte to critics who doubted the seriousness of her prior bid.
Reuben Family
British billionaires Simon and David Reuben also are part of the buyers group, according to a person familiar with the negotiations, who asked not to be identified as the information is private.
The Reubens have an eclectic past. They were born in India into a prominent Iranian Jewish family, but then moved to London as teenagers. They made their money in Russia’s aluminum industry in the 1990s, and are now investing in data centers and real estate, including a development in Newcastle with high-end shopping, a boutique hotel, and a restaurant in a converted police and fire station. They have a combined fortune of $12.6 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
David’s son Jamie, 32, is leading the family’s involvement in the Newcastle negotiations, the person said. Jamie is a director with Queens Park Rangers, a London club that plays one level below the Premier League. He’s largely kept a low profile, though he sits on the boards of private members club 5 Hertford Street and horse racing group Arena Racing.
Mike Ashley
Newcastle’s current owner built his fortune from a single sporting goods shop in a town west of London. He bought the club in 2007, the same year he took retailer  Sports Direct  (LON:SPD) public. He’s worth $3.8 billion, according to Bloomberg’s index.
Ashley has courted controversy along the way, becoming known for holding business meetings in pubs complete with drinking contests while Sports Direct employees have complained of poor working conditions. His relationship with Newcastle fans is increasingly fractious as the club remains mired in mediocrity. Ashley has been ambivalent about selling the team, further frustrating its supporters.
Mohammed bin Salman
The crown prince, who is widely known by his initials MBS, was hailed as a reformer after coming to power in 2017. He detained 200 of the wealthiest figures in the country as part of an anti-corruption push and permitted women to drive in the kingdom.
That ended when Jamal Kashoggi, a dissident columnist for the Washington Post, was murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. While Prince Mohammed denied involvement, U.S. intelligence officials concluded that he ordered the assassination, sparking a global outcry against him and his regime.
Then last week, two investigators said bin Salman may have helped hack the mobile phone of Jeff Bezos, the chief executive officer of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). and the owner of the Washington Post. The data gleaned from his phone may have formed the basis for tabloid reports that Bezos was having an extramarital affair, which led to his divorce from MacKenzie Bezos last year.
Prince Mohammed is looking to sport as a way to burnish his reputation. Government officials have held talks with the National Basketball Association and the Formula One race series about holding events in the kingdom, according to the New York Times.
Amnesty International has called the Saudi sports push “sportswashing,” but the Public Investment Fund’s purchase of Newcastle might be be an appealing way to change the narrative, at least in the U.K."

Investing.com - Dow component McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) is going on the offensive again in the fast-food sector’s game of chicken, adding new items to its breakfast menu.
The company said Tuesday it is adding two new chicken sandwiches to its national breakfast menu.
Shares rose 1.1% in morning trading.
Chicken sandwiches have been the talk of fast food since the debut of the Popeyes Spicy Chicken Sandwich, which resulted in a run on restaurants for the item, with lines rivaling those of gas stations during the 1970s oil embargo.
Bill Oakley, former showrunner of The Simpsons and now a pivotal voice on fast food on Instagram, named the Popeyes Spicy Chicken Sandwich his item of the year for 2019 (Instagram.com/thatbilloakley).
The resultant battle between Popeyes and perennial favorite Chik-Fil-A has resulted in shortage of little chickens, which have quarter-pound breasts that fit on a bun, Bloomberg reported today.
McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) has been playing catch-up, but will now roll out its Chicken McGriddles and McChicken Biscuit sandwiches nationwide. The items were previously just available in certain U.S. locations.

1328,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2020 10:08AM ET</span>","Adidas to launch new fabrics from recycled ocean plastic, polyester","BERLIN (Reuters) - Adidas (DE:ADSGn) will launch new fabrics made from recycled polyester and marine plastic waste and expand the product lines that use them after the success of shoes made with the Parley for the Oceans initiative, the sportswear firm said on Tuesday.
Adidas first teamed up with Parley in 2015 and gradually ramped up production of shoes using plastic collected on beaches and coastal regions to make more than 11 million pairs in 2019, still only a fraction of a group total of more than 400 million.
The Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that promotes shifting the economy to a circular model that eliminates waste, says less than 1% of material used for clothing is recycled, a loss of more than $100 billion worth of materials each year.
Adidas will continue to make Parley-branded shoes and clothes out of ocean plastic in 2020 and will also launch ""Primeblue"" fabric containing Parley marine waste that it will use in existing lines like its popular Ultraboost shoes.
In total, the German firm will produce 15-20 million pairs of shoes using ocean plastic in 2020.
Recycled polyester costs about 10% more than the virgin material, but Adidas ultimately wants to get the price down so more consumers can afford to choose sustainable products. 
""It is a matter of time, it is a matter of scale, of volume and we are trying to lead that charge,"" James Carnes, Adidas vice president of brand strategy, told Reuters.
Adidas says it wants more than half of the polyester it uses to be recycled in 2020, ramping up to 100% by 2024. In 2019, Adidas expected 46% of polyester used in its clothing to be recycled, compared with just 28% for its shoes.
Criticism has been mounting of the environmental impact of the fashion industry, which is responsible for about 10% of all greenhouse gas emissions, according to charity Oxfam.
""Increasing the presence of recycled polyester fibre has the potential to massively impact global energy and resource requirements,"" said  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Anushka Challawala. ""Sportswear is leading a lot of the change.""
Market leader  Nike  (N:NKE) uses recycled polyester yarn for the uppers of its popular Flyknit shoes, saying that has helped it divert more than 4 billion plastic bottles from landfills.
In addition to the ocean plastic initiative, Adidas will start labelling products made from 100% recycled polyester from other sources as ""Primegreen"" later in the year. 

In an announcement timed ahead of the Super Bowl on Sunday, Adidas said it would also move to make more uniforms out of sustainable fabrics with U.S. sports partners like Major League Soccer and the National Hockey League.

Investing.com -- Wall Street opened with a bounce on Tuesday after its worst daily loss in more than three months on Monday, as fears about the novel coronavirus in China abated somewhat.
The market was undeterred by a durable goods report that suggested defense was the only sector that really enjoyed the end of 2019. Core orders excluding defense goods fell 2.5% on the month in December and November’s figures were revised down to 0.5% drop from a 0.7% increase reported originally.
Those figures cast something of a shadow over the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting, which is due to get under way later Tuesday, but chimed with a quarterly report from   Lockheed Martin   (NYSE:LMT), the U.S.’s biggest defense contractor, that showed profit up nearly 20% from a year earlier, thanks in part to rising sales of the F35 combat jet. Lockheed stock was up 1.0% at a new all-time high.
By contrast, industrial giant 3M (NYSE:MMM) fell 3.5% to a six-week low after saying it will cut 1,500 jobs worldwide as it comes to terms with sluggish demand out of Asia. The company’s fourth-quarter profit fell 28% due to litigation and restructuring charges.
By 9:50 AM ET (1445 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 85 points, or 0.3%, while the S&P 500 was up 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.7%.
Among the biggest movers were auto parts supplier Delphi, which surged 61% after rival BorgWarner (NYSE:BWA) announced it would buy the company in an all-stock deal valuing at $3.3 billion. BorgWarner’s stock fell 7.3% on perceptions that it is overpaying.
Elsewhere, Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) fell 2.7% to a three-month low after a quarterly report that again showed its core motorcycle business in an apparently irreversible decline in the U.S. (even if it forecast flat revenues for the key division this year).
Airline stocks staged a modest recovery after tumbling on Monday, but the fear that the coronavirus will hit air travel numbers this year was still clearly in evidence. United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Delta Airlines (NYSE:DAL) all rebounded less than 1% after declines of as much as 6% on Monday. Likewise, Booking.com (NASDAQ:BKNG) managed only a 0.2% rebound from the seven-week low it registered.
In other markets, U.S. crude oil futures were unable to hold on to earlier gains and fell 0.1% to $53.07 a barrel, while the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of currencies, rose 0.2% to a two-month high of 97.920."

Investing.com -- Stocks in focus in premarket trade on Tuesday, 28th January. Please refresh for updates.
9:04 AM ET: United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) stock rebounded 1.3% after Monday’s shellacking on fears that the Chinese coronavirus will hit air travel this year. Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) stock and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock managed a bounce of less than 1%.


9 AM ET: Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) stock was down 1.9% after reporting a decline in fourth-quarter profit due to rising costs. Its guidance for the current year, in line with forecasts, failed to compensate for the disappointment. 


8:56 AM ET: Xerox (NYSE:XRX) stock rose 4.6% after the copier business reported a sharp rise in earnings in the fourth quarter, up from a low comparable base in 2018. It also forecast profit above consensus in 2020. The company’s revenue fell 2.4% from a year earlier as the trend toward paperless offices continued, however.


8:52 AM ET: United Technologies  (NYSE:UTX) stock fell 1.0% after the company warned of a hit of between $550 million and $600 in sales for its Collins Aerospace unit as a result of the grounding of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX. It also said it expects operating profit at the unit to suffer this year as a result.


""We expect to be producing (parts for the 737 MAX) as we get into the second quarter, although at a significantly reduced rate, than where we were in 2019,"" CFO Neil Mitchill told Reuters.

8:49 AM ET:   Lockheed Martin   (NYSE:LMT) stock rose 1.5% after the U.S.’s biggest defense company reported a 20% rise in quarterly profit in the three months through December, due partly to expanding sales of the F35 combat jet. U.S. durable goods orders for December also showed a healthy bounce in military orders.

8:42 AM ET: Delphi Technologies (NYSE:DLPH) stock rose 58% after rival BorgWarner (NYSE:BWA) said it would buy the automotive components company in an all-stock deal valued at $3.3 billion. That's still less than one-third of what Delphi was worth two years ago. BorgWarner stock fell 7.5% on perceptions that it is overpaying.


3M (NYSE:MMM) stock fell 1.6% after the industrial giant forecast below-consensus profit in 2020, after a fourth quarter bogged down by slow sales in Asia. Its guidance range for 2020 EPS, at $9.30-$9.75, had a midpoint around 1% below consensus forecasts. The company also said it will cut 1,500 jobs globally.


  Pfizer   (NYSE:PFE) stock fell 2.0% after the company said it expects adjusted earnings to edge down in 2020, a year in which it intends to spin off its Upjohn division into generics specialist Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL). The company said it expects adjusted revenue from operations to grow by around 8%. Pfizer's fourth-quarter revenue and earnings declined as the loss of patent exclusivity hurt drug sales.


Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) stock fell 6.3% after the company reported another steep drop in revenues from its core motorcycle division, which is struggling to find new customers as its traditional user base ages. U.S. retail sales, by far the most important market for the company, fell 3.1%, a 12th straight quarterly drop. The midpoint of its guidance range for 2020 motorcycle revenues suggested that it expects them to be essentially flat this year.

1334,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2020 08:34AM ET</span>",3M forecasts 2020 profit below estimates on weak China demand,"(Reuters) - U.S. industrial giant 3M Co (N:MMM) forecast 2020 profit below expectations and narrowly missed quarterly revenue estimates on Tuesday, as it continues to face sluggish demand in China, sending its shares down 2.8% in early trading. 
3M, which makes everything from adhesive tapes to air filters, also said it would cut 1,500 jobs globally as it continues to restructure its businesses to boost growth.
Sales in Asia-Pacific fell for the fifth straight quarter, hurt by weak demand from China's automotive and electronics sectors. It had forced the company to cut jobs and production last year.
China's economic growth expanded at its slowest pace in almost three decades in 2019 amid a bruising trade war with the United States that hit factory production.
Sales in Asia-Pacific fell 1.7%, while Europe, Middle East and Africa reported declines of 2%. Sales in the United States rose 7.4%.
""The sales performance suggests any recovery will be gradual,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Julian Mitchell said.
Sales at its healthcare unit rose about 25.4% on strength in international markets and was flat at its consumer unit. The company's healthcare unit sells everything from surgical tapes to sterilization products and accounted for about 25% of its total revenue in the quarter. 
The company said it expects 2020 profit to be between $9.30 per share and $9.75 per share. At the midpoint of the range, it was below the average analysts' estimate of $9.61 per share.
Net income attributable to 3M fell 28% to $969 million, largely due to restructuring and litigation charges.
On an adjusted basis, 3M earned $2.15 per share, beating expectations of $2.10, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Net sales fell 2.1% to $8.11 billion and missed expectations of $8.12 billion.

UTC forecast sales at the unit, which makes products such as avionics, cabin seating and lighting, to be hit by about $550 million to $600 million.
About $225 million of the impact to its full-year operating profit is due to a divestiture and lower sales related to a surveillance technology that facilitates tracking of aircraft position during flight, Mitchill told Reuters.
""Rest relates to the 737 MAX,"" Mitchill said, as UTC temporarily halted production of the aircraft parts earlier this month.

1336,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 28, 2020 08:06AM ET</span>",Six Strategists on What Next for Markets as Virus Fears Spread,"(Bloomberg) -- International efforts to contain the spread of a deadly virus emanating from China have gone some way to easing a global sell-off in risk assets, but markets remain fragile as the death toll rises.
The announcement of further curbs on travel between China and Hong Kong derailed an equity rebound on Tuesday morning in Europe, while Treasuries resumed their rally and most European government bonds edged higher. As fears grow over the impact the virus and attempts to control it will have on the world’s economy, oil extended losses, the stockpile of negative-yielding debt surged and gold hovered near the highest in seven years.
It’s all a lesson in humility for the prognosticators of Wall Street, as hard-to-price risks challenge predictions for 2020.
Here are some of the latest thoughts from market watchers as they rush to work out what’s next:
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)
Jim Reid, global head of thematic research and team.
“Without downplaying the very tragic human effects, a confirmed death toll of 106 so far (vs. 80 yesterday) is but a fraction of the hundreds of thousands of people who die each year globally from seasonal flu.“Many experts suggest that by far the biggest issue in this episode is the long contagious period where there are no symptoms which makes the virus much harder to isolate and different from SARS. SARS had a higher mortality rate of 9.6% though against c.2.8% for Coronavirus so far. For reference the famous 1918 flu outbreak had a fatality rate of 2.5% with normal flu often no more than 0.1%.“China’s reaction has been a lot more rapid than for SARS so a different template and this makes analyzing it hard.“As a minimum Chinese data is going to take a notable hit for many weeks and getting a true read of underlying momentum is going to be hard.”Nordea Investment Funds
Sebastien Galy, senior macro strategist.
“China is slowing, we may be the only one making that point, but it most likely is and there is no coordinated rebound, only the end of a passthrough of the EM shock in DM. The shock of this health crisis is likely around 1 to 1.5% in a Chinese economy likely growing 4.7%. While we are very optimistic for H2, it is the type of cocktail that is unhelpful for the global carry trade.“Consequently, we suspect that enough strategies will be selling on rallies to cap these limited equity gains and that humans will reduce their exposure in part forced by a tad higher volatility (VIX is not in the stressed 20-30 regime). Expectations that the Fed will react to this is a testament to late comers in the carry trade. We expect them to stay on hold.“Till then we continue recommending a diversified portfolio which could include covered bonds, listed infrastructure and listed real estate.” Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN)
Kit Juckes, chief FX strategist.
“The belief that low rates can and will smooth over in the deepest potholes in the road ahead for financial markets, is deeply-ingrained. But there will be an economic impact from the virus outbreak, even if we don’t yet know how long it will last and therefore how big the economic hit will be. Whatever else happens, there will be more pressure for easier policy in China, and further reason for other central bankers to remain dovish.“Most already have a skewed reaction function to news now (ease on bad news, do nothing on good news) though Yves Mersch yesterday was the latest ECB grandee to warn of that dangers of elevated asset prices. Overall, pressure on bond yields, while it may ebb and flow, will mostly be downwards and the FX market will be torn between seeking havens and seeking yield, but the dollar and yen are winners, the euro and China-sensitive EM currencies are losers.“Today, investors are threatening to go yield-hunting again. I doubt that this mood will last for long, but it won’t do much for the euro.”Pepperstone Group Ltd.
Chris Weston, head of research.
“What we are trying to understand is the economic impact shutting transport links and imposing strict travel controls in Beijing and Shanghai, as well as effectively quarantining 14 cities and millions of people will have.“With so few in markets holding any formal training in virology, trying to connect the dots is incredibly complicated, and, as with any thematic that is gripping markets and causing risk aversion, we need to understand the circuit breaker. Obviously, that comes from a cure or a plateau in the number of cases of people around the world getting the virus. But the fact is that the incubation period is up to 14 days, where the virus can be contagious during this period, even if the host has no symptoms and this makes this situation very hard to comprehend just how bad it is, or how much worse it can get.“How do we fully price risk, if we have such limited visibility on bad this could get, not just in terms of contagion, but the impact this will have on economics and we may have to wait for weeks until this is portrayed in the formal data releases?“It’s no surprise to see rates markets moving up a gear as traders start to anticipate a future central bank response. In the U.S., for example, we see a full 25 basis point cut priced by November (from December), with two- and five-year Treasury yields lower by 5 and 6 basis points.”TD Securities
Priya Misra, head of global rates strategy and team.
“There remains substantial uncertainty about the virulence and transmission of the virus, and incoming news should keep markets on edge.“We took off our long 10 year Treasury position at 1.6% as the risk-reward is no longer attractive given an uncertain headline-driven world. However, Treasuries remain a risk-off hedge and should benefit from more convexity receiving flows. We think that any further risk-off moves should be accompanied by a steeper 5s30s curve as the market should reprice for more Fed rate cuts.”Rabobank
Richard McGuire, head of rates strategy and team.
“The immeasurable threat (so-called “Knightian risk”) inherent in the coronavirus outbreak sees us loathe to jump aboard a growing bandwagon of analysts recommending investors fade the pronounced moves above. As far as we can tell, these recommendations are derived from comparing the economic fallout/market reaction from the SARS outbreak in 2002/2003 to the current episode.“However, China’s stellar growth in the intervening years means that such comparisons are on shaky ground.“The apparent safe haven status of peripheral bonds feeds into our argument that these assets offer investors the benefit of asymmetric risk and, in so doing, arguably offer considerable appeal given the unknowable implications of the coronavirus. To reiterate, a rapid containment of this virus is likely to prompt a very sharp reversal of market sentiment which we would expect to support higher-beta EZ sovereigns as these markets are buoyed by the resultant “risk-on” move. Conversely, ongoing concern is only likely to see safe haven yields fall further into negative territory which stands to force investors, through financial repression, to seek out higher yielding alternatives of which peripherals are clear examples.”"

1338,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2020 07:59AM ET</span>","At Exxon, CEO's promised turnaround sapped by chemicals, refining","By Jennifer Hiller
HOUSTON (Reuters) - At  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM), CEO Darren Woods' plan to revive earnings at the largest U.S. oil and gas company is being sidetracked by the two businesses he knows best: chemicals and refining.
Another year of poor profit could require Exxon to re-evaluate its bold spending plans or weaken its ability to weather the next oil-price downturn, say oil analysts. Exxon already must borrow or sell assets to help cover shareholder dividends.
The world’s biggest publicly traded oil firm after Saudi Arabian Oil Co (SE:2222), Exxon was long considered one of the best-managed majors and most capable of coping with volatile prices due to its size. 
Those advantages have slipped in recent years, however, with the drop in once-steady earnings from chemicals. Its total shareholder returns of negative 13% in the five years through this month compare with a 25% gain at  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) and 82% at  BP  Plc (L:BP), according to Refinitiv.
Two years ago, CEO Woods promised to restore flagging earnings by heavily investing in operations even as rivals cut spending. The plan to crank up chemicals, refining and increase oil output pushes capital expenditures to as much as $35 billion this year, up from $19 billion in 2016, the year before Woods took over as CEO after running Exxon's refining and chemical businesses.
Last March, he forecast potential earnings could hit $25 billion this year and nearly $31 billion in 2021, close to the $32.5 billion it earned in 2014 before the oil-price collapse. 
The hoped-for payoff, however, has run headlong into a global chemicals glut, tariffs on U.S. exports to China, and lower margins in fuels. Exxon's refining profit last year fell on equipment outages.
The company declined to comment ahead of quarterly earnings, expected on Friday.
On Monday, Exxon shares traded under $65 - close to their level of 10 years ago. 
The company recently telegraphed weak fourth-quarter results because of chemicals and refining businesses. Wall Street cut profit forecasts through 2021 on the sour outlook for both. Exxon ""seems to be tracking way behind their own expectations,"" said Evercore ISI analyst Doug Terreson, who slashed his quarterly forecast by a third, to 55 cents a share.

CHEMICALS OVERBUILD
In chemicals, Woods expanded the company's output of polyethylene, a business where it has 9% of global production capacity, to benefit from demand for plastic bags, food packaging and consumer goods. Output rose last summer at the depth of the U.S.-China trade dispute, and industry margins for a key polyethylene fell 30% compared with levels between 2016 and 2018, said James Wilson, analyst at pricing provider ICIS.
""The industry ended up overbuilding,"" said Pavel Molchanov, an analyst with investment firm Raymond James. ""Exxon, of course, is among the companies that led that build-out."" 
In refining, outages and higher maintenance costs at Exxon refineries in the United States, Canada and Saudi Arabia hurt profit, according to regulatory filings. 
Crude oil prices and slack global demand from the trade dispute are squeezing profit across the industry, said Garfield Miller, chief executive at Aegis Energy Advisors. 
This month, an Exxon regulatory filing implied a loss in chemicals of about $200 million for the fourth quarter, and refining earnings of just $400 million. 
In contrast, chemicals and refining delivered $7 billion to $11 billion annually for Exxon between 2013 and 2018. In the first nine months of last year, the combined profit was $2.37 billion. Exxon's regulatory filing indicates 2019 earnings for the two at about $2.52 billion, the lowest in at least a decade. 
Woods has halted the company's oil output declines by ramping up in shale. Oil volume has risen year-over-year for five straight quarters, reversing annual declines between 2016 and 2018.

TARIFFS HIT EXPORTS
Ending the trade dispute represents the biggest challenge. Global demand for the plastic resins and pellets that Exxon makes is rising, said Marc Levine, chief executive of Plantgistix, which provides logistics for U.S. plastic manufacturers.
""This is the first time in my lifetime and in the plastics industry's lifetime where we make plastics resin for export,"" said Levine. 
China in 2018 placed an additional 25% tariff on U.S. polyethylene imports, a move that helped send North American margins to the lowest levels since 2011, said Joel Morales, a polymers analyst at consultancy IHS Markit.
""Imagine having a lot of something and your biggest, easiest consumer you can’t do business with,"" Morales said. 
The January U.S.-China agreement does not remove Chinese or U.S. tariffs on chemicals, plastics or oil.
Exxon has ramped up asset sales, aiming to collect $15 billion by next year to balance spending. So far, results have been tepid. It expects to receive about $3.6 billion from selling Norwegian oil and gas production assets.

Weak demand for those assets comes as rivals have written off the value of their own properties. BP, Chevron, Equinor ASA (OL:EQNR), Repsol SA (MC:REP) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L:RDSa) last year cut a total of $22 billion primarily on U.S. assets due to sharply lower gas prices. Exxon has not signaled whether it expects any writedowns.

1339,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2020 07:53AM ET</span>",Selling abates after virus causes worst day since October,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - European markets stabilized on Tuesday after worries about the economic fallout of China's spreading coronavirus set off the worst global rout in months.
A flat STOXX 600 (EU) and higher Wall Street futures (N) indicated some relief after Monday's biggest drop in world stocks since October.
Chinese markets are closed all week, but a 0.5% overnight drop in Tokyo's Nikkei was more modest than Monday's thumping. Many of Asia's other markets that were open had rallied.
Even so, the mood remained jittery. The death toll from the virus topped 100 overnight and Germany confirmed its first case. A number of governments and multinational companies were curbing travel.
Japan's safe-haven yen began to climb again after a pause overnight. China's yuan dropped toward three-week lows and the euro fell to almost a three-year trough against the Swiss franc. [/FRX]
Oil prices were wobbling after a three-month low of $58.50 a barrel drew talk of an OPEC output cut. In bond markets the demand for safety pushed U.S Treasury yields under 1.60% for the first time since October. [O/R]
""We saw a bit of a bounce back overnight in the most high- volume liquid assets like the S&P 500 futures, but it's hard to find anything to hang your hat on because we still need to assess the risks,"" said Saxo Bank's head of FX strategy, John Hardy. 
China has taken the precaution of extending its Lunar New Year holiday to Feb. 2 nationally and to Feb. 9 for Shanghai. Its largest steelmaking city, Tangshan, suspended all public transit in an effort to contain the virus.
Chinese President Xi Jinping also met with the chief of the World Health Organisation, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in Beijing, and discussed ways to combat the outbreak, including ""possible alternatives"" to evacuations, a WHO spokesman said.
""The virus is a devil and we cannot let the devil hide,"" state television quoted Xi as saying. 
WILD CARD
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ended down 0.8%. Japan's Nikkei, which was down nearly 1% at one point, closed 0.5% lower. Australian shares ended 1.3% down and South Korea's Kospi index fell 3%. 
The iShares China Large-Cap ETF sank 4% on Monday. It is down about 10% since Jan. 17, when worries began to grow about the virus, which emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.
""The wild card is not the fatality rate, but how infectious the Wuhan virus is,"" Citi economists wrote in a note. ""The economic impact will depend on how successfully this outbreak is contained."" 
Moreover, as companies report potential business disruptions and governments advise against unnecessary travel to and within China, analysts are trying to compute how much the disruption could damage growth.
APPLE EYED
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is due to report results later. Its plan to ramp up iPhone production by 10% in the first half of the year will be the top question as the coronavirus spreads across major markets like China.
""... The interesting part will be how much the virus and the contamination efforts of the Chinese government will hamper supply chains and growth, and that is really hard to grasp in the short term,"" said Christian Lenk, an interest rates strategist at DZ Bank.
Market gauges of long-term inflation expectations fell to their lowest in a month and a half in the euro zone at 1.2640%.
The yield on the benchmark German Bund was flat at -0.38%, not far from the three-month low -0.391% it fell to on Monday. Yields across other European markets, including Italy and Spain, were also broadly stable.
In the United States, a two-day Federal Reserve meeting starts later. The market consensus is that the Fed will keep interest rates unchanged at 1.5% to 1.75%, but attention will be on what it thinks about the virus effects.
Chinese authorities may also have more limited room to stimulate the economy than it had during the 2002-03 outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus, another reason investors were jittery. 
Treasury 10-year note yields were off lows after falling as low as 1.598%, the lowest since Oct. 10. Fed fund futures <0#FF:> have rallied in recent days as investors priced in more risk of a rate cut later this year. Futures now imply around 35 basis points of easing by year-end. 
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said it has not yet altered its forex forecasts, though it was taking profits on ""bullish"" EUR/USD positions and remains ""considerably long"" on Swiss francs, which benefit from safe-haven demand. 
Short build-up in the Aussie was another risk hedge. The currency was last flat at $0.6760 after two days of losses. The euro was up at $1.1022.
In commodities, Brent crude was off 12 cents a barrel at $59.20. U.S. crude fell 2 cents to $53.12. Brent is now down 18% from a spike caused by the U.S. killing of Iran's top military commander at the start of the year. [O/R]
Spot gold weaker at $1,579.28 an ounce, after climbing to its highest since 2013 on Monday.

""(Gold) could reach $1,600, but would be more around the $1,570-$1,590 levels as we need to get more information,"" said John Sharma, an economist at National Australia Bank (NAB). ""There are a lot of unknown variables around the virus.""

1341,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2020 07:36AM ET</span>",Factbox: The City and Brexit: what changes and when,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain leaves the European Union at 2300 GMT on Friday but has yet to negotiate a deal on future trading relations with the bloc.
The EU is Britain's biggest market for financial services, worth about 26 billion pounds ($34.2 billion) a year in exports. That level of business has helped to keep London as one of the world's biggest financial centers and made the financial industry Britain's most important tax-raising sector.
The following are details on what will happen to Britain's financial sector after Brexit.
WHAT CHANGES ON JAN 31?
Effectively, nothing. There will be a business-as-usual transition period until the end of 2020, meaning that investors in Britain and the EU will see no change in services on Monday, Feb. 3.
All EU financial rules will still be applicable in Britain until the end of December.
Banks, asset managers and insurers in Britain will continue to have full, unfettered access to investors in the bloc during that period.
NEXT STOP, JUNE
Britain and the EU are set to begin talks on a trade deal that would take effect from January 2021.
Access to each other's financial services markets will come under the so-called equivalence regime in which each side decides if the other's rules for financial stability and investor protection are sufficiently aligned with its own to grant access.
The EU and UK have agreed to complete the technical assessments for equivalence by the end of June.
UK regulators have said that Britain is the most equivalent country in the world, but the EU has made it clear that actual access will hinge on trade-offs in a broader deal that cuts across all economic sectors.
Without equivalence, EU investors will probably have to stop using London-based platforms for trading euro-denominated shares, while EU companies would have to use banks inside the bloc to issue bonds.
Asset managers in Britain, meanwhile, may not be allowed to continue running funds domiciled in the EU without equivalence.
Even with equivalence, which falls far short of the unfettered access from the so-called 'passporting' system currently in operation, there will be only patchy and limited direct access from Britain. For example, it does not cover basic banking or insurance broking.
BULKING UP
Financial firms in Britain have opened more than 300 subsidiaries in the EU to avoid disruption to business in the event of any glitches, such as delays in obtaining equivalence, and will face pressure from EU regulators to keep bulking up.
Consultant EY estimates that 7,000 jobs are moving from Britain to staff these satellite operations, though bankers say this could rise over the course of the year if it appears there will be no equivalence agreements in place by December.
NO BONFIRE OF REGULATIONS
Leaving the EU means that Britain will be responsible for writing financial rules that hitherto came from the EU.
But the financial sector has said it does not want a ""bonfire of regulations"" that could jeopardise equivalence and many rules that already follow globally agreed principles.
Instead, the sector is asking UK regulators to have a formal remit to avoid new rules that put London at a disadvantage to New York or Frankfurt.

1343,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 28, 2020 07:09AM ET</span>",Pfizer's Q4 Earnings Fall More Than Expected,"
Investing.com -   Pfizer   (NYSE:PFE) said it expects underlying revenue growth of around 8% this year as it carves out another of its main divisions into a separate company. 
The company said that after folding its Upjohn unit into pharma rival Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL), it expects operational growth of around 8%. However, earnings per share, adjusted for foreign exchange swings, are expected to fall by around 3.3% to a range around $2.89.
The Upjohn deal is Pfizer's second big corporate action in a year, after spinning off its consumer health unit into a joint venture with GlaxoSmithKline last year.

 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) ended 2019 on a comparatively weak note. It said adjusted diluted earnings per share fell 13% on the year in the fourth quarter to 55c, on a 9% drop in revenue to $12.69 billion.
Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $0.58 on revenue of $12.61 billion. 
 

Analysts are expecting EPS of $0.72 and revenue of $11.7 billion in the upcoming quarter.

 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) stock is currently 10% below the record high it set last July, amid fears about the loss of patent protection for key drugs in the coming years.
""The biggest challenge that Pfizer is facing over the next few years is how to make up for the pending loss of patent protection,"" said Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar. ""Some of its top revenue-generating products -- Xeljanz, Ibrance, Xtandi, Eliquis and Tafamidis -- all are losing patent protection from 2025 to 2029.
To mitigate the impact of revenue loss, Pfizer is trying to reorganize its business, spending heavily in developing new drugs and buying companies whose success is uncertain.
""In the short run, the company’s revenue growth is dependent on its more established prescription drugs and cancer drugs that now make up more of Pfizer’s revenue than any other segment,"" Anwar added.

On January 22, J&J reported fourth quarter EPS of $1.88 on revenue of $20.75B, compared with a forecasts for EPS of $1.87 on revenue of $20.8B.
Abbott Labs earnings matched analysts' expectations on January 22, with fourth quarter EPS of $0.95 on revenue of $8.31B. Investing.com analysts anticipated EPS of $0.95 on revenue of $8,263M

1344,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2020 07:05AM ET</span>",Services in spotlight after Apple stock market value hits $1.4 trillion,"By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - When Apple Inc (O:AAPL) posts quarterly results on Tuesday, investors will be looking for fresh evidence the iPhone maker should be treated as a producer of high-margin, subscription services after its stock market value touched $1.4 trillion and its earnings multiple trades at decade highs.
The Cupertino, California corporation's stock has doubled over the past year, even as iPhone sales contract along with the rest of the global smartphone market. Fueling its stellar run has been Chief Executive Tim Cook's push to turn Apple's loyal client base into a source of steady services revenue, including streaming video and a credit card launched last year with Goldman Sachs (N:GS).
Also supporting Apple's stock is excitement around an eventual pickup in iPhone demand with the rollout of 5G wireless technology, and low interest rates that have broadly helped Wall Street.
Shares of Apple fell 2.9% on Monday from record highs as fears about the economic fallout of the coronavirus outbreak in China hit Wall Street. Analysts on Apple's quarterly earnings call after the bell on Tuesday will listen for comments concerning the impact on its manufacturing operations in China.Apple's market capitalization briefly exceeded $1.4 trillion last Wednesday for the first time, but it has yet to end a session at that level. Some investors worry that Apple's rally, and surging earnings multiple, may have become overextended.
""The run-up in the stock is a concern, and I wouldn't be surprised if we see a bit of a pullback in the near future,"" said People's United Advisors chief equity strategist John Conlon, who added that Apple's services business has become his main reason for owning stock.
Following its recent rally, Apple's stock is trading at the equivalent of 23 times expected earnings, its highest multiple since 2010, according to Refinitiv. Apple's average PE over the past decade was about 14, lagging other high-growth companies with recurring revenue and reflecting its singular dependence on iPhones sales and reliance on persuading consumers to upgrade their phones year after year. 
Salesforce.com (N:CRM) and Netflix (O:NFLX), which rely on recurring revenue, are trading at over 55 times expected earnings. Tech hardware sellers Intel (O:INTC) and Cisco Systems (O:CSCO) are at about 14 times expected earnings.
Apple is on track to reach a goal to double its 2016 services revenue to $48.7 billion by the end of fiscal 2020 as it focuses on selling high-margin subscriptions to its user base. Many investors envision an increasingly rosy future for its earnings, a trend reflected in its soaring earnings multiple.
Adding to existing services including cloud storage, the App Store and music, Apple last year launched an ambitious video streaming service, along with its credit card, a subscription news app and a videogame service.
Apple has also increased the emphasis on its AppleCare, its extended warranty program. For example, the iPhone's ""settings"" now includes reminders encouraging people to buy or renew their AppleCare plans.
In the September quarter, Apple said its services revenue hit $12.51 billion, topping analysts expectations of $12.15 billion. Services accounted for 20% of total revenue in that quarter, up from 17% in the same quarter the year before.
Apple also gave cost of sales data showing gross margins for its services segment rose to 64% from a 61% a year earlier. That is far more generous than Apple's overall gross margin of around 38% in recent years.
Still, for a business segment getting the most attention from Wall Street, Apple provides limited details. Apple's quarterly reports break out sales of iPhones, Macs and iPads, but a breakdown of results from products falling within the services category so far has not been released.
Apple's recent strong stock performance has been perpetuated by fund managers buying its shares in order to avoid underperforming their benchmarks, a trend that could reverse when the recent rally ends, Cowen analyst Krish Sankar wrote in a client note last week.
For the fiscal first quarter, which ended in December, analysts on average expect services revenue to jump 19.7% to $13.0 billion, according to Refinitiv.
Overall quarterly revenue is expected to rise 5.0% to $88.5 billion, with adjusted net income inching up 1.5% to $20.3 billion and earnings per share of $4.55."
1345,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2020 06:55AM ET</span>",Renault poised to name VW manager De Meo as CEO: sources,"PARIS (Reuters) - Renault's (PA:RENA) board is set to meet later on Tuesday to approve the nomination of Luca de Meo, the former head of Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) Seat brand, as its next chief executive, two sources familiar with the matter said. 
The Italian-born executive, who stepped down from Seat earlier this month, is not due to take up his post at the French carmaker until toward July, due to negotiations around his contract, according to one of the sources.
 Renault  declined to comment. 
De Meo is not expected to face any last minute hurdles in his nomination, and has already won tacit backing from parties including the French government, a Renault shareholder. 
His appointment fills one of the major gaps left at the firm as it tries to move past a year of turmoil following the 2018 arrest in Tokyo of former boss-turned-fugitive Carlos Ghosn, and reset its strained alliance with Japan's Nissan.
Ghosn, who forged and oversaw the Renault-Nissan partnership for almost two decades, has since fled Japan and resettled in Lebanon, from where he has contested the financial misconduct charges against him and said the alliance was at risk of collapse. 
De Meo, along with Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard, brought in last January from tire maker  Michelin  (PA:MICP), will have his work cut out to turn around the firm. 
Like rivals, Renault is grappling with a downturn in demand, and has said it expects a slight decline in the car market in Europe, Russia and China this year.
The firm has also presented 2020 as a make-or-break year for the alliance with Nissan (T:7201) and is under pressure to deliver on cost savings and joint industrial projects.
Automakers face pressure to meet stringent new emissions targets with less polluting models, and are also competing to produce innovations such as self-driving cars, which require large investments. 
De Meo, who speaks French, will be one of a growing handful of outsiders in senior company jobs in France. The 52-year-old started his career at Renault and has worked at Fiat and Audi among other brands. 
He is credited with revitalizing sales at Barcelona-based Seat, imbuing it with a more sporty image, though his portfolio will be markedly larger at Renault, whose brands include Dacia and Lada. 

Renault's finance chief Clotilde Delbos has been CEO on an interim basis since last October, when Thierry Bollore, a former Ghosn ally, was ousted by the board.

1350,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 28, 2020 06:33AM ET</span>","Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Tuesday, 28th January","By Geoffrey Smith
Investing.com -- Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reports quarterly results amidst expectations for record service revenue. China's death toll from the coronavirus rises but so does the recovery rate. The Federal Reserve kicks off its two-day policy meeting against a backdrop of data on durable goods and consumer confidence, while the ECB flagged the increasing strains of low interest rates on the profitability of eurozone banks. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, 28th January.
1. Mixed news on the coronavirus
The death toll from the novel coronavirus rose to 106, according to Chinese government data, while the number of confirmed cases rose to 4,515. Chinese authorities also reported 60 cases where patients had recovered, strengthening impressions that the virus may not be as lethal as the SARS virus was 17 years ago.
Restrictions on public life in China continue to point to a dip in economic activity, however. Hong Kong suspended ferry and rail services with the mainland, while Shanghai municipal authorities instructed factories to stay shut until Feb. 8. Other manufacturing centers have also taken similar measures.
The Chinese yuan touched a new low against the dollar earlier in the day but losses were more moderate than on Monday.
2. Apple's first earnings since launching streaming service
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is set to report another record quarter for revenue from its growing services division when it posts its quarterly earnings after the closing bell, helped by the launch of its Apple TV streaming service in November.
Also of note will be Apple’s guidance on the smartphone market, which it has previously said will surge this year due to upgrades to 5G-supportive devices.
Analysts polled by Investing.com expect the first quarter of Apple’s 2020 fiscal year to show earnings per share up 9% on the year at $4.54, on a 4.5% rise in revenue to $88.38 billion.
Services revenue – the key to Apple’s long-term outlook, given the increasing saturation of the global smartphone market, rose 17% in the 2019 fiscal year.
3. Stocks set to bounce after Monday horror show
U.S. stock markets are set to bounce at the open after their worst day in months on Monday. By 6:30 AM ET (1130 GMT), Dow 30 futures were up 62 points, or 0.2%, while S&P 500 Futures were up 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.5%.
After the bell on Monday, Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) stock and Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) stock had both fallen in response to their respective quarterly updates.
In Europe, the recovery was a more mixed affair, with the German DAX and Dutch AEX both falling under the weight of disappointing updates from index heavyweights SAP (DE:SAPG) and Koninklijke Philips (AS:PHG). The benchmark Stoxx 600 fell 0.1%, while the U.K. FTSE rebounded a modest 0.1%.
4. Fed meeting starts; durable goods, consumer confidence data due
The Federal Reserve kicks off its two-day policy meeting against a backdrop of concerns for the world economy due to China’s measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Analysts expect the central bank to keep its official interest rates unchanged, despite fresh criticism last week from President Donald Trump.
The day’s economic data include the release of monthly durable goods orders at 8:30 AM ET and the Conference Board’s consumer confidence survey at 10 AM ET. There will also be regional business surveys from the Dallas and Richmond Feds.
5. ECB fails six banks in its annual capital review
The European Central Bank said that six banks fell short of their capital requirements in its latest supervisory review. That’s up from one a year ago.
The ECB also said it was concerned by the low profitability of many of the banks it monitored. Low interest rates, high operating costs and limited flexibility in cutting jobs mean that many banks are earning below their cost of capital, which limits their ability to issue fresh equity should they need to.
The ECB’s supervisory head Andrea Enria also warned that governance standards had slipped in the last year, and expressed concerns about operational risks."

1352,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2020 05:36AM ET</span>",U.S. Treasury curve inverts as virus outbreak fans growth fears,"LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury yield curve, measured by the gap between yields on three-month and 10-year bonds, briefly inverted on Tuesday for the first time since October as investors worried about the economic impact from a virus outbreak in China.
An inverted curve, when longer-dated yields fall below shorter-maturity ones, has been a fairly reliable predictor of U.S. economic recessions in the past.
The death toll from the coronavirus outbreak in China has risen to more than 100 and the virus has spread to more than 10 countries, including France, Japan and the United States.
That has rattled world markets, fuelling concerns about the impact on a world economy hit last year by a trade war between the United States and China.
Investors in turn have rushed into safe-haven U.S. Treasuries, with 10-year yields falling on Tuesday to 1.57% (US10YT=RR), their lowest since early October.
The gap between yields on three-month notes and 10-year government bonds briefly fell to -0.015 basis points (US3MT=RR) (US10YT=RR), its lowest since October, before returning to around 0.01 bps.
""The movement in the curve is probably telling us we are seeing an increasing shift away from risk assets to safe assets, including Treasuries, and the entire curve is being pulled down,"" said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec.
""If the signs were to multiply, there could be a more severe impact not just in China but globally. Markets are starting to speculate the Fed could bring rates down by summer.""
That three-month/10-year part of the yield curve is closely watched as a recession indicator. It inverted in March last year for the first time since the financial crisis, a signal that a recession was likely to follow in one to two years.
The yield curve can revert and reinvert many times before a recession hits.
It has traded in positive territory since October, when optimism that the United States and China would reach a trade deal boosted risk sentiment.
(GRAPHIC: U.S. curve inverts - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1543/1518/curve.png)
The two-year/five-year curve also inverted on Monday . The gap between two-year and 10-year yields (US2US10=RR), also considered a recession signal, was at the flattest since Nov. 29.
Markets have ratcheted up expectations the Federal Reserve will cut U.S. interest rates this year, fully pricing in one 25- basis-point cut and a 50% chance of a second easing later in 2020, Fed funds futures show."
1353,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 28, 2020 05:35AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Sainsbury Aims to Swallow the Costs of Going Green,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- ‘Live well for less’ looks like mutating into ‘live longer for a bit more’.
U.K. supermarket chain J   Sainsbury   (LON:SBRY) is placing a big bet on its customers being willing – and able – to accept the costs of going green.
The company said it will spend $1.31 billion over the next 20 years to make sure it’s carbon neutral by 2040, a full 10 years ahead of the U.K. government’s target for the country as a whole. The announcement sharpens its profile as a leader in sustainable corporate governance, one that admittedly hasn't been able to reverse gradual long-term declines in market share. 
“Only when the trajectory for global warming slows to a maximum of 1.5 degrees will we all know that we can truly live well for less now and in the future,” outgoing chief executive Mike Coupe said in an accompanying statement.
Sainsbury stock rose 0.4% by 5:30 AM ET (1030 GMT) on a day when the FTSE 100 was broadly flat, licking its wounds after a sharp fall on Monday due to fears about the Chinese coronavirus. The benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 index was down 0.1% and the German DAX was down 0.2%.
Sainsbury will be spending the money on everything from making store refrigerators and lighting more energy-efficient to replacing plastic packaging, using low-carbon vans and trucks in its delivery fleet and optimizing water use.
For investors, the announcement raises two questions: can it pass the extra costs on to consumers without sacrificing market share or profit margins? And, will it be rewarded with a higher valuation by the swelling ranks of institutional investors who are under pressure to divert more of their assets under management to sustainably-run companies?
The costs are incremental, and won't get in the way of it cutting debt as planned over the next three years. The average 50 million pounds a year of the initiatives announced is less than twice the 26 million annually that it has shelled out over the last decade. The extra 24 million it will be incurring in future represents around 4.5% of operating income over the last year. If it wants to maintain margins it will have to make some non-negligible efforts. It does at least have the comfort of having stemmed losses in market share over the last year: Kantar Worldpanel put its share at 16% over the Christmas holiday season, down only 0.1% from a year earlier.
As for how investors view the move, the chief problem that Sainsbury has is the sector and the country that it’s operating in. U.K. grocery retail is notoriously competitive and consumer confidence, after a bounce at the end of last year, will have to overcome persistent uncertainties over the post-Brexit future for the U.K. economy in 2020.
Any premium valuation tied to good behavior on sustainability will likely pale in comparison to the near-30% drop in its share price since U.K. competition regulators first indicated they would block its proposed deal with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) unit Asda a year ago, a merger that had been seen by investors as a convincing response to chronic pressure on margins from German discounters Aldi and Lidl.
Tellingly, only six out of 17 analysts covering Sainsbury stock have a buy or overweight recommendation, according to Dow Jones data. Compare that to a ratio of 14 out of 20 for LafargeHolcim, Europe’s largest player in a cement industry that is responsible for almost as many carbon dioxide emissions as passenger cars in the EU.

(Reuters) - European stocks edged higher on Tuesday, after posting their worst day in about four months in the previous session on heightened concerns about the potential impact on businesses from the coronavirus outbreak.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) rose 0.1% as markets monitored developments on the outbreak in China that has claimed 106 lives so far. Monday's pullback had wiped out around 180 billion euros of market capitalization from the European companies index.
Airbus (PA:AIR) was the biggest boost to the benchmark index, after the planemaker agreed to reach a settlement with French, British and U.S. authorities regarding a probe into allegations of bribery and corruption.
""It's just a rebound as markets await further information on what's happening with the virus situation in China,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at broker AJ Bell.
""We're moving into the results season with some European heavyweights slated for today, central bank meetings this week and Brexit on Friday. There is lots to keep people occupied.""
Shares of Europe's most valuable technology company SAP (DE:SAPG) dropped 2.5% as the software provider's in-line results failed to impress investors. Some analysts also pointed to the company's slowing cloud revenue growth.
Dutch firm Philips (AS:PHG) slipped 1.3% after the health technology company's quarterly sales fell short of estimates. The company is also said it was looking to sell its domestic appliances division. 
Among lenders, Swedish bank  Swedbank  (ST:SWEDa) gained 3.3% after a better-than-expected fourth quarter profit while Spain's state-owned lender  Bankia  (MC:BKIA) slipped 3.3% after a wider-than-expected quarterly loss.
Luxury goods makers  Burberry  Group Plc (L:BRBY), Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and  Moncler SpA  (MI:MONC), reversed early gains to extend Monday's slide. LVMH (PA:LVMH) bucked the trend to rise 0.3% ahead of its results.
As the week progresses, investors anticipate central bank meetings with the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates due on Wednesday and the Bank of England's policy stance expected on Thursday. Financial markets see a nearly 60% chance of a rate cut in Britain.

Britain is also set to formally leave from the European Union on Friday, followed by a ""business as usual"" transition that ends next December. The two sides will also start trade talks in the coming days.

The yuan steadied and Treasuries turned higher.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index erased an early advance, while contracts on the three main American equity indexes clung to moderate gains. Earlier in Asia, Japanese shares fell for a second day and equities slumped in South Korea as that market reopened after holidays. Trading is scheduled to resume in Hong Kong on Wednesday; the latest guidance from China, where the outbreak is still concentrated, is for markets to reopen on Monday.

“Risk appetite is unlikely to improve until we start getting news that the virus is under control,” DBS Group Holdings Ltd. strategists Philip Wee and Eugene Leow wrote in a note. “For now, the lack of positive news flow is likely to keep investors on the defensive.”
The outbreak shattered a calm in markets that hadn’t seen a 1% up-or-down move in the S&P 500 since early October. The latest surge in demand for havens also sent bond yields tumbling, with the global supply of notes with negative rates surpassing $13 trillion, to the highest since November.

After the United States and Canada warned against travel to China, Australian stocks resumed trading sharply lower after a public holiday. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index (AXJO) fell 1.4% weighed by stocks exposed to the illness that has killed more than 100 people and infected more than 2,700.
Shares of airlines and travel agents were sharply lower amid freezes on travel into and out of the world's second largest economy, while companies with an indirect exposure to Chinese consumer spending abroad, such as casinos and luxury retailers, also tumbled.
""We don't know how long it will go,"" said Peter Costello, chairman of Australia's $115 billion sovereign wealth fund, the Future Fund, in a media briefing to coincide with a regular portfolio update.
""Obviously we hope that the measures that have been taken now will contain the virus but it's still far too early. It will have an obvious negative effect on the Australian economy and indeed beyond,"" added Costello, a former Australian treasurer.
With Chinese markets closed for the week-long new year holiday, other stock markets in Asia were feeling an outsized impact of investor concerns. 
South Korean cosmetic makers highly dependent on Chinese tourists coming to Seoul stumbled, with Tonymoly (KS:214420) and Able C&C (KS:078520) losing more than 12% and 15% respectively on Tuesday.
Japanese travel company H.I.S. (T:9603), which owns an amusement park popular with Chinese tourists in Nagasaki, has tumbled more than 14% since early last week.
Shares of Australia's biggest airline Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN) were down 5% on Tuesday, while travel agent  Webjet  Ltd (AX:WEB) fell 11%. South Korea's top two airlines, Korean Air Lines (KS:003490) and Asiana Airlines (KS:020560), dropped 6% and 5%. Japan Airlines (T:9201) lost 7.9% and airline ANA Holdings (T:9202) was down 6.0%.
Australia's top two casino companies  Crown  Resorts Ltd (AX:CWN) and Star Entertainment Group ltd (AX:SGR), which both get a sizeable portion of revenue from vacationing Chinese gamblers, each fell about 5%. 
Traders meanwhile pointed to companies which might generate sales from efforts to curb the spread of coronavirus as investment prospects. 
The Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturers Association (MARGMA) said on Tuesday China had requested more urgent shipments from the world's top producer, and its members were ramping up production. Top Glove Corp (KL:TPGC) has seen its shares surge by a quarter in a week.
""MARGMA believes that demand for gloves will inevitably shoot up and has urged its members to give priority to those affected areas and countries,"" association president Denis Low said in a statement.

1357,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 28, 2020 03:55AM ET</span>",Swiss Watch Export Growth Slows to Weakest Pace in Three Years,"(Bloomberg) -- Swiss watch export growth weakened to the slowest pace in three years as the market for lower-priced timepieces evaporated and the coronavirus outbreak threatens to pummel the industry.
Shipments rose 2.4% to 21.7 billion francs ($22.4 billion) in 2019, the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry said Tuesday. Exports to Hong Kong dropped 11% as political protests led to store closures in the top export market.
Swiss watchmakers this year will be challenged to find markets to offset China, where consumption will likely slump because of the spread of the viral lung disease. Authorities in that country curbed travel for 40 million people during the Lunar New Year, the peak gifting period. Switzerland exported almost 50% more timepieces to China in December, ahead of an earlier-than-usual Chinese New Year that kicked off on Jan. 25.
The coronavirus could lead to a reduction of as much as 8% to earnings for luxury-goods companies this year, RBC analyst Piral Dadhania estimated. Such firms generate some 35% of revenue from Chinese consumers, he added. The SARS epidemic led to a 20% drop in international travel in 2003, according to RBC.
Shipments of Swiss watches by units fell to the lowest level since 1984, down 13% to 20.5 million as the industry focused on limiting production and shifting toward higher-priced models.
Lower-end timepieces have been struggling with competition from fashion labels and smartwatches. That’s bad news for Swatch Group (SIX:UHR) AG (OTC:SWGAY), which gets a good share of earnings from cheaper brands like its namesake and Tissot. The watchmaker is expected to report 2019 earnings as soon as this week."

Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (JO:AMSJ) expects to report that profit more than doubled last year after prices of the metals it mines surged.
Headline earnings were probably 131% to 151% higher than a year earlier, despite power outages which cut production and deferred processing of some metal, Amplats said Tuesday. It will report full-year results on Feb. 17.
The improved earnings show how higher metals prices are boosting mining companies’ bottom line, particularly in South Africa, where producers are also benefiting from a weaker rand that lowers costs. Palladium has surged to a record and platinum and rhodium prices also climbed as stricter emissions rules prompt automakers to use more of the metals in catalytic converters.
Anglo Platinum, which is controlled by   Anglo American   Plc (LON:AAL), rose as much as 2.8% in Johannesburg. While the stock has fallen this month, it’s still up more than 90% in the past year. The company said it also benefited from operational improvements last year.

Sainsbury's agreed 7.3 billion pound ($9.6 billion) deal for Walmart (N:WMT) owned Asda was blocked by Britain's competition regulator in April.
Asked by BBC radio if he was paying the price for that deal not happening, Coupe said: ""No, absolutely my choice.""
""If you looked at our AGM (annual general meeting) last year, 99.5% of our shareholders voted for me to carry on doing what I'm doing,"" he said.
""It's something I promised myself throughout my career that at the age of 60 I will stop and do something different with my life.""
Coupe, who is 60 this year, has been at Sainsbury's for 15 years, six as chief executive.
Sainsbury's said last week that Coupe would be succeeded as CEO by Simon Roberts, the current retail and operations director.
Coupe was asked, given last year's ruling by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), if it was now impossible for two big players, such as Sainsbury's and Marks & Spencer (L:MKS) to merge.
""I think it's difficult at the moment, but ultimately I have a very strong view that the industry will consolidate,"" he said.
""You see the amount of change that's going on in the world of retail...One way or another there's going to be a significant rationalization of brands that you've taken for granted for a generation.
""And that will happen...probably in the next five or ten years.""
Coupe was speaking after Sainsbury's committed to have net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040, a decade ahead of the British government's own target which it said ""isn't soon enough""."

Investing.com - European stock markets edged higher Tuesday, rebounding a touch from Monday’s sharp losses. However, the tone remains one of caution as the deadly coronavirus in China continues to claim victims.
At 03:45 ET (08:45 GMT), the U.K.'s FTSE index was trading 24 points, or 0.3%, higher, France's CAC 40 was up 24 points, or 0.4%, while the DAX gained 28 points, or 0.2%. The pan-Europe Euro Stoxx 50 index rose 30 points, 0.8%.
The death toll from the new strain of coronavirus in China climbed to 106 overnight, with Beijing suffering its first victim, while the number of total confirmed cases in China surged to 4,515, the country’s National Health Commission said. All but six of those to die were in Wuhan, the city where the disease was first noticed. Elsewhere, Japan confirmed a case of the disease in a person who had not traveled to China, illustrating the risks of transmission among people.
The Chinese government has sealed off entire cities, isolating some 50 million people in the region around Wuhan, in the hope this will curb the spread of the disease. Long-distance buses and some public transport networks have also been shut down. Hong Kong said Tuesday it would suspend all ferry and high-speed rail connections with China.
Looking at corporate news in Europe, shares in   Swedbank AB   (OTC:SWDBY) climbed over 4% after the Swedish bank reported a smaller than expected fall in fourth-quarter profit during what the company’s CEO called a “turbulent year.”
Airbus (PA:AIR) shares climbed 2.3% after the European airplane manufacturer reached an agreement with authorities in a number of countries to settle bribery allegations that have dogged the company for years. 
SAP shares (DE:SAPG) fell 1.8% despite the software company lifting guidance and stating net profit and revenue for the fourth quarter of 2019 increased on the year.
And Koninklijke Philips (AS:PHG) stock fell 1.4% after the Dutch conglomerate said it will review options for its domestic appliance business. The Dutch company suffered a 17% drop in annual profit in the fourth quarter and wants to concentrate on its higher-margin medical technology unit.
Still, most eyes will be on Wall Street as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reports earnings after the bell, with many eager to see whether its latest slate of phones has revived sales. Additionally, three more Dow components will issue results ahead of trading, namely   Pfizer   (NYSE:PFE), 3M (NYSE:MMM) and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX). Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) will join Apple in reporting after the close.
The U.K.’s CBI Distributive Trends Survey, at 06:00 AM ET (1100 GMT) could be of some interest ahead of the Bank of England’s rate-setting meeting on Thursday.
U.S. data will also be studied carefully at the start of the Federal Reserve’s two-day meeting. Durable goods orders are due at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), and are expected to have risen 0.3% last month, while at 10:00 AM ET, the January consumer confidence index is expected to come in at 128 from 126.5 in December.
Elsewhere, oil has traded in a calmer fashion, after Monday’s sharp losses.
At 3:45 AM ET (0845 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% lower at $52.95 and the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.6% to $58.26. Gold futures for February delivery on New York’s COMEX were 0.1% higher at $1,578.55."
1361,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 28, 2020 03:46AM ET</span>",These Pricey Shares Just Got $46 Billion Cheaper ,"(Bloomberg) -- European equities suffered their sharpest sell-off in nearly four months yesterday, sending the Stoxx 600 index to test its 50-day moving average. Looking at the damage, one European sector has been particularly hammered since the coronavirus outbreak started to hit markets last week: luxury goods.
About $46 billion: That’s the cumulative market cap wipe-out from the top nine European luxury-goods stocks since a peak earlier this month, half of which is from France’s LVMH (PA:LVMH), which reports earnings after the market close today. The sector was already under pressure because of the protests in Hong Kong this year, so no wonder fears are mounting about the 2020 prospects for stocks highly exposed to Chinese customers, as the virus puts many cities in lock-down during the of Lunar New Year holiday, a crucial period for shopping and travel.
Similarities are being drawn with past crises. While it’s too early to determine the severity of the new coronavirus, travel trends and hotel occupancy in China dropped meaningfully during the SARS outbreak of 2002 and 2003,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said last week. But the decline then was temporary, with trends recovering over a few months, and governments are now better prepared to face a potential threat, Morgan Stanley said.
Performance-wise, the MSCI Europe Apparel and Luxury Goods lagged the MSCI Europe and the Hang Seng heavily over six weeks as the SARS outbreak worsened. Although it recovered, the ride was volatile until the end of the crisis.
But the world has changed over the past two decades and the problem now is one of exposure. Whereas Chinese consumers contributed to 2-3% of luxury goods revenue in 2003, the proportion is now 35%, Exane estimates. Some stocks are more at risk than others, but generally, the biggest players have an average revenue exposure to Asia in excess of 40%.
Luxury-goods makers, from LVMH and   Kering   SA (PA:PRTP) to Swatch Group (SIX:UHR) AG (OTC:SWGAY) and   Moncler SpA   (MI:MONC), are increasingly reliant on the China cluster for continued growth, meaning any drop in spending in the region could have serious repercussions for the entire sector. As Flavio Cereda, a Jefferies analyst said last week, “No China, no party.” As other shopping locations such as Hong Kong lose their appeal, consumption in the country “needs to grow as it’s THE driver” for popular brands from Kering’s Gucci and LVMH’s Louis Vuitton to Prada, Cereda added.
Given the exposure of the luxury sector to China, and following poor industry data in the fourth quarter, Citi estimates downside risks to the consensus for this year’s revenue and Ebit/EPS around 3% and 10%, respectively. They say the stocks most at risk are Swatch, Prada SpA (HK:1913) and Salvatore Ferragamo SpA (MI:SFER) (Citi is restricted on LVMH).
Valuation is another issue, particularly regarding the luxury winners of 2019, like LVMH or Moncler, reaching the top of the range of the past 10 years, according to Cedric Ozazman, head of investment and portfolio management at Reyl & Cie. in Geneva. This means these companies have “stretched” valuations and need to deliver on the results front again in 2020, with additional earnings-per-share growth of at least 10%, Ozazman says. “Any small miss might actually lead to a de-rating, which will exacerbate any downside move,” he writes. The MSCI Europe Apparel and Luxury Goods still trades at around 60% premium to the MSCI Europe on forward price-to-earnings.
That said, the luxury industry’s medium-to-long-term structural underlying growth drivers are still “very solid” and any major price drop in the coming months could be a chance to snap up shares in “high-quality” names such as  Hermes International  (PA:HRMS), Moncler and LVMH “where investors have been finding it difficult to find a new entry point,” Morgan Stanley wrote in a note.
Noting the lack of visibility, the virus’s impact on the luxury goods sector is difficult to quantify without accurate data, says Isabelle Carpentier, fund manager for international equities at Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management. “However, the first quarter of 2020 could be impacted without tarnishing growth for the whole year,” Carpentier says. “In addition, around half of Chinese consumers’ sales are now made locally, which helps limit the consequences of potential travel stoppages, with the possible transfer of sales to the internet.”
Swetha Ramachandran, investment manager of the GAM Global Luxury Brands Fund is upbeat on the “extremely buoyant” broader Chinese consumer picture as the middle class, the biggest driver of luxury-goods demand, continues to grow. Companies might adopt a usual cautious tone for the first quarter, but it’s hard to predict if any will follow the path of Remy Cointreau SA and put their guidance on hold, she says.
Ramachandran says there probably will be a short-term hit to demand, merely because of the uncertainty, but in many cases, the reset in valuations could provide a compelling entry point.
So are we in the buy-the-dip situation? Not yet, according to Aneeka Gupta, associate research director at asset manager WisdomTree, who expects the negative impact on shares to last for a quarter at least, based on analysis of prior outbreaks, and possibly longer given the situation is “definitely getting worse.”"
1362,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2020 03:36AM ET</span>",China proxies bear the brunt of investor concerns on virus,"By Stanley White and Swati Pandey
SYDNEY/TOKYO (Reuters) - Stock and currency markets in Thailand, South Korea and Australia are bearing the brunt of investors' scramble to hedge the mounting risks from a new viral outbreak in China during a long holiday on the mainland.
In the week since the spreading coronavirus became a mainstream market concern, every hour has brought headlines of mounting cases or another Chinese city shutting public transport or a country telling citizens not to travel.
Stock markets from South Korea to Thailand have fallen hard, with transport, tourism, retail and luxury stocks badly hit.
Investors sold the Australian and New Zealand dollars as a proxy for the yuan, while also buying their sovereign bonds and U.S. Treasury debt on wagers central banks globally might have to ease policy to offset the economic drag from the virus.
It was a shift made all the more prominent by the closure of Chinese markets for the week-long new year holiday, which has forced investors to hedge through proxies.
""I want to buy Chinese government bonds with around 5-years’ duration. People already believe China's economy will slow down, so there will be more upside for these bonds. I need to wait until China’s markets re-open,"" said Toshinobu Chiba, chief portfolio manager in the fixed income department at Nissay Asset Management Corp in Tokyo.
Chiba is therefore using the forward curve in the offshore Chinese yuan to express his views, while also buying shorter term U.S. Treasury bonds and swapping his lower quality corporate bonds for higher.
""Normally, in a situation like this, people would want to be long in countries with current account surpluses, like South Korea, Singapore or Taiwan, but you cannot because of their correlation with China,"" he said, adding that was why he was avoiding the Korean won.
Stock markets in Thailand (SETI) and Korea (KS11) have fallen more than 2% in the past week, taking a bigger hit than U.S. and world stocks broadly. A large China ETF - iShares Large-Cap ETF (P:FXI) sank nearly 4% on Monday and is now down about 10% since Jan. 17.
The baht is Asia's worst performer for the year, with losses against the dollar nearly 3%.
STRETCHED STOCK VALUATIONS
Analysts at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) recommended clients use currency options to hedge cheaply, given how low the measures of expected volatility were. To brace for a negative impact on the tourism sectors in Malaysia and Thailand, JPMorgan said it is changing to neutral an underweight holding in Thai government bonds and an overweight position in Malaysia's ringgit .
That demand for cheap hedges has seen implied volatility on offshore yuan rise by about a percentage point across tenors in the past week.
Chris Rands, Sydney-based portfolio manager for Nikko Asset Management, is tracking the spreads on credit default swaps, which are insurance products used to hedge against default risk, between those on Australia and the United States as one barometer of negative sentiment.
He hasn't put on a trade yet, though, and many other big fund managers said they are sitting tight.
""We don't have enough information to know how bad this is so we don't think we should be making huge decisions on the back of that,"" said Rands.
The panic engulfing markets and the resulting dive in bond yields could help underpin equity valuations, at least in the major developed nations, leaving emerging markets to bear the brunt.
Optimists argue that this episode would not be a repeat of the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), in part because Beijing had acted more quickly and radically this time.
While the SARS outbreak initially caused steep losses for Asian stocks, they rebounded smartly in its wake.
One hurdle this time is that many equity markets globally are trading at stratospheric valuations. The U.S. S&P 500 index (SPX) is trading at a price-earnings ratio above 23, last seen in late 2018. Valuations for the MSCI world equities index (MIWD00000PUS) are also at 2018 highs. ""For those looking to play the big rebound, keep in mind in 2003, the entire backdrop was completely different as most risky assets were already at the lows, not highs, after the tech bubble blew up and the U.S. recession,"" said Stephen Innes, Asia Pacific market strategist at AxiCorp.
""So the rebound comparison is invalid on many levels."""

Wall Street closed sharply in the red Monday, with the S&P 500 down 1.6%, the Nasdaq Composite off 1.9% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 1.6%, more than 450 points. This followed on from hefty losses in Europe, with the DAX in Germany and France’s CAC 40 dropping 2.7% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 off 2.3%.
“Equities are finally beginning to contemplate the possibility that the virus 2019-nCoV in China will have significant economic impact,” said Peter Garnry, Head of Equity Strategy at Saxo Bank Group.
“The most sensitive sectors to the Chinese coronavirus and potential economic impact are materials, energy, industrials, IT and consumer discretionary,” he added.

NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson Chief Executive Alex Gorsky on Monday faced questions from plaintiffs lawyers over the timing of his sale of company stock, as he testified for the first time in a jury trial over allegations that the company's Baby Powder causes cancer. Gorsky told the jury that he had sold company shares in November 2018, two days after a Reuters reporter contacted the company and summarized in an email her review of documents that showed J&J knew small amounts of asbestos had been found in its talc on occasion since 1971.
Gorsky testified that he was not shown the email from the Reuters reporter at the time of the stock sale.
On Dec. 14, 2018, Reuters published the story that showed J&J had failed to disclose that small amounts of asbestos, a known carcinogen, had sometimes been found in its talc over several decades. After the Reuters report was published, a selloff wiped out more than $40 billion from the company's market value.
At the time, J&J dismissed the Reuters' report as ""an absurd conspiracy theory.""
""My trade took place at a time when I did not have that kind of knowledge about the article,"" Gorsky said on Monday. Gorsky testified that he followed all of the appropriate approval processes with the company's board of directors and legal team regarding the sale of company shares after exercising stock options.
J&J faces more than 16,000 lawsuits alleging it sold powders contaminated with asbestos and failed to warn users. It also faces a federal criminal investigation into how forthright it has been about the products' safety.
Filings made by J&J to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission show that Gorsky sold $38.6 million of company stock on Nov. 16, two days after Reuters made its findings known to the company.
On Monday, Gorsky acknowledged that his net proceeds totaled about $22 million. In response to questions from a lawyer representing J&J, Gorsky reiterated that he had not been told about the Reuters email in advance of the stock sale.
He also acknowledged that he sold less than 10% of his holdings in the company in that transaction and that the shares would be worth more now if he had held onto them.
A J&J spokesman said that Gorsky had notified the company's legal department about the planned sale on Nov. 12, 2018, two days before the Reuters inquiry. The stock sale was prompted by plans to buy a house, he said.
The spokesman provided no further details, and Reuters could not independently confirm the purchase.
RELIED ON EXPERTS
Gorsky was subpoenaed by plaintiffs' lawyers as a witness in a trial playing out in a courtroom near J&J headquarters. The plaintiffs, three men and one woman, all have mesothelioma, a rare and incurable cancer that they allege was caused by their exposure to asbestos in Baby Powder in infancy during their diapering.
During an earlier liability phase of the trial, a jury awarded $37.2 million in compensatory damages. Now plaintiffs' lawyers are seeking to persuade a new jury that J&J failed to do enough to ensure the purity of its product, and therefore additional punitive damages should be awarded.
""I was told by the experts in their fields that we were using the most appropriate, most up-to-date technology to make sure our talc was safe,"" Gorsky testified.
In response to a question posed by plaintiffs' lawyers, Gorsky also told the jury he did not read all the internal company documents related to potential asbestos contamination in Baby Powder, including those contained in links in the Reuters report.
""I did not read all the documents, but I would rely on the experts in these fields,"" Gorsky testified.
J&J had fought against the subpoena, arguing that its CEO had no first-hand knowledge about the safety of its powders and that the case involves corporate conduct that occurred long before he joined the company.
Compelling his testimony ""would serve no purpose other than to harass Mr. Gorsky and divert him from his executive responsibilities,"" J&J said in a motion.
The New Jersey Supreme Court turned down the company's request to suspend the subpoena last week.
In October, J&J disclosed that a contract lab for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had found asbestos in a bottle of Baby Powder produced in 2018. The company questioned the finding and commissioned tests on samples from the same bottle and talc from the same lot.
Less than two weeks later, J&J announced those tests had found no asbestos, other than some contamination it blamed on an air conditioner in the lab.
Gorsky's journey to the witness stand can be traced to the lead role he played in company efforts to rebut the Reuters report, which prompted plaintiffs lawyers to subpoena his testimony.
In the days following publication, the CEO personally attested to the safety and purity of Johnson’s Baby Powder in a video posted on the company’s website, as well as in an appearance on CNBC’s “Mad Money.”
""We unequivocally believe that our talc, our Baby Powder, does not contain asbestos,"" Gorsky told the investment show’s host Jim Cramer."

Cade's top administrative council could still call for a reconsideration of the case, putting the matter to a vote.
The companies welcomed the move on Monday, with Boeing saying it remained confident of getting approval from the European Commission, the last hurdle to the transaction.
The European Union has set an April 30 deadline to decide on the deal.
Boeing has offered to pay $4.2 billion for 80% of Embraer's commercial jet division, which builds passenger jets in the 70- to 150-seat segment.
That puts it in direct competition with next-generation jets designed by  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) and acquired by Europe's Airbus SE (PA:AIR), which rebranded them the A220 program.

1368,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2020 07:13PM ET</span>","Sainsbury's targets 2040 for net zero emissions, criticizes UK goal","LONDON (Reuters) - Sainsbury's (L:SBRY) committed itself on Tuesday to have net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040, a decade ahead of the British government's own target which it said ""isn't soon enough"".
Britons have become increasingly aware of the urgency of addressing climate change, spurred on by climate campaigners including veteran naturalist and broadcaster David Attenborough and Swedish teen activist Greta Thunberg.
Sainsbury's, Britain's second-biggest supermarket group which trades from some 2,300 locations, employs 185,000 people across Britain and Ireland and has over 27 million customers each week, said it would spend 1.0 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) to hit the target.
With consumers demanding less waste and action on the environment, retailers are responding and Sainsbury's said its focus would be on reducing carbon emissions by increasing its use of renewable energy, lowering water consumption, cutting the use of plastic, increasing recycling and tackling food waste.
""We have a duty to the communities we serve to continue to reduce the impact our business has on the environment and we are committing to reduce our own carbon emissions and become net zero by 2040 ... because 2050 isn't soon enough,"" Sainsbury's Chief Executive Mike Coupe said in a statement.
""Over the next 20 years we will...transform the way we do business and put environmental impact at the forefront of every decision we make,"" he said.
Coupe steps down in May after six years as CEO and will be succeeded by retail and operations director Simon Roberts.
Sainsbury's said its current carbon footprint is one million tonnes - a 35% absolute reduction in the last 15 years despite its space increasing by 46% over the same period. It said it has invested 260 million pounds in more than 3,000 initiatives over the last decade.
The group will work with the Carbon Trust to assess emissions and set science-based targets for reduction, publicly reporting on progress every six months.
It plans to work collaboratively with suppliers and will ask them for their own carbon reduction commitments.
Sainsbury's latest move builds on a pledge, made in September, to halve plastic packaging by 2025 - the first UK supermarket to make a commitment of this scale.
Having reduced plastic packaging by just 1% in 2018, Sainsbury's said a ""transformational leap in thinking"" was required to tackle the almost 120,000 tonnes it uses a year.
Last week  Tesco  (L:TSCO), Britain's biggest retailer, said it would remove plastic wrapping from its multipack tins.
The move is part of its pledge to remove one billion pieces of plastic packaging from products in its UK stores by the end of 2020.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - America Movil, the telecoms giant controlled by the family of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, said on Monday that one of its subsidiaries had been fined 1.3 billion pesos ($69.53 million) by Mexico's telecoms regulator.
The company decried the fine.
The regulator, the Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT), said in a statement that it fined the company for failing to share information about the availability of its telecom infrastructure, such as posts, with competitors.
America Movil said the regulator's action reflected a ""lack of due process,"" and it vowed to exercise ""all legal remedies to challenge it.""
""This arbitrary, illegal and disproportionate fine affects the legal certainty in a sector that requires important investments,"" the company said in a statement. 
America Movil, which has long dominated Mexico's telecoms market, is required to open its infrastructure to industry rivals in order to promote competition. But competitors grumble that they do not have sufficient access. 
The fine was levied against one of America Movil's subsidiaries, Telefonos del Noroeste, known as Telnor, after the IFT found the unit had failed to share the necessary information as of September 2017. The penalty represents 6% of Telnor's revenues. 
Sharing information about infrastructure puts competitors on more even footing and ""promotes the development of competition in the telecommunications sector,"" the IFT said in a statement.
Sharing infrastructure among telecom companies can be a crucial way to extend coverage and bring down costs to consumers, said Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics. Despite America Movil's protests, a $69 million fine is unlikely to change the company's conduct, he said, due to its deep pockets.
""Penalties of that amount, it's like the cost of doing business,"" he said. 
If the fine withstands legal challenges, it is not expected to affect America Movil's consolidated financial results, analysts from Mexican bank Banorte wrote in a note to investors. Nevertheless, they warned America Movil's share price could be hit.

The labels would also extend to alcohol-free versions of established brands.
The IARD, which has previously run educational initiatives, said underage drinking was declining in many countries but the trend was not universal
The producers have agreed that online safeguards would go beyond the more usual current practice of asking website visitors to confirm they are a given age.
They said partnerships with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Snapchat and YouTube were helping to remove children who might misreport their ages. Their real ages could be exposed, for example, by interests that were more common for children or by their choice of friends.
IARD said it was also looking into extending the ability of adults to opt out of alcohol marketing.
Producers have agreed to apply tighter safeguards for at least 95% of online alcohol marketing by 2024.

The owner of brands such as KitchenAid and Maytag increased prices twice in 2019 as U.S. tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, both major components in the company's products, pushed up the cost of production. 
Chief Executive Officer Marc Bitzer told CNBC that the company will maintain the high prices. 
""Yes, we've seen some relief on the raw materials. And yes, it's coming down. But we're far away from having kind of eaten into that $700 million high of cost increases,"" he said, noting that the company is still facing the impact of rising cost over the past two years.
Whirlpool said it expects full-year 2020 profit to be between $16.00 per share and $17.00 per share, the mid-point of which is above analysts' average estimate of $16.34, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump last week announced adjustments to tariff-rate quotas (TRQ) on large residential washers, saying that domestic producers had begun to do better in the face of foreign competitors but more was left to be done.
Net sales fell nearly 5% to $5.38 billion, missing analysts' estimates of $5.52 billion as higher prices crimped demand for washing machines and dishwashers. 
Sales were flat in the company's biggest market of North America, while they fell in the other three regions.
Brand transition investments and soft demand environment resulted in another quarter with operating losses in China, the company said.
Net earnings available to the company rose to $288 million, or $4.52 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $170 million, or $2.64 per share, a year earlier. 
Whirlpool said cost of products sold fell nearly 8% to $4.33 billion.
Excluding items, the company earned $4.91 per share, beating estimate of $4.27.
Whirlpool is expected to hold a post-earnings conference call with analysts on Tuesday before the bell.

Theme park operators, movie theaters, retailers and restaurant chains are suspending or curtailing operations to protect workers and limit the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The moves by companies highlight Wuhan’s importance as a manufacturing, shipping and business hub. The central Chinese city has more than 500 factories and other facilities, placing it 13th among 2,000 Chinese cities in Bloomberg’s supply chain database. It’s the capital of Hubei province, which has 1,016 such facilities, making it seventh of 32 such jurisdictions.
Japan-based companies have about 54 of the facilities, while U.S. firms account for 44 and Europeans about 40, the data show. Many plants are in the auto and transportation industries, and big names include PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc. and  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn).
As the outbreak accelerates, China has extended the Lunar New Year holiday to Feb. 2 from the original Jan. 30 date to reduce travel. Authorities have also locked down cities with a combined 40 million people around the epicenter in Wuhan, as they race to contain a pneumonia-like illness that has killed at least 80 in the country with about 2,744 confirmed cases.
Cases of infection were reported in countries including Japan, Singapore, South Korea and in the U.S., which on Monday said citizens should reconsider travel to China in light of the disease.
Here is how some of the biggest companies are responding, as well as early analysts’ estimates of the impact:
Jan. 27:
Carnival (NYSE:CCL) Corp. and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. Carnival’s Costa Cruises brand, working with the Chinese government, decided to suspend nine voyages leaving China from Jan. 25 to Feb. 4. In a separate statement, Royal Caribbean said it suspended Jan. 27 and Jan. 31 sailings. Both pledged to provide refunds to customers. China is a small but growing market for American cruise companies, and analysts project further cancellations could hurt earnings. Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX)., McDonald’s Corp. and Domino’s Pizza Inc. Of the three U.S. restaurant chains, Starbucks is the most exposed to the outbreak, as measured by percentage of worldwide revenue and operating income, according to Guggenheim analyst Matthew DiFrisco. “China represents a high growth region and a meaningful contributor to the longer-term global revenue growth goals for all three companies,” DiFrisco said in a note.Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc., Nio Inc. About 8 million cars were sold last year in the roughly 40 Chinese cities that have 10 or more diagnosed coronavirus cases, or 36.8% of total retail volumes in the country, Bernstein analysts estimate. Those cities accounted for 82.5% of Tesla’s retail volumes, and 68% of NIO’s, the analysts wrote in a note. “The latter looks especially vulnerable to a prolonged slump in EV sales,” they said. “We expect EV sales in China to be worse hit than the broader market. Consumer adoption of EVs in China is highly concentrated in the top cities where license plate restrictions and other policies enforce EV purchases.”Imax Corp. The Mississauga, Ontario-based company temporary closed about 70,000 theaters in the wake of the outbreak. The impact of lost revenue from the Chinese New Year will cost Imax at least $60 million in global box office revenue, according to MKM Partners. If the epidemic lasts for a few more weeks, “it is not unreasonable to project” a shortfall of $200 million in the first quarter, MKM Partners analysts said in a note.Nissan Motor Co. The automaker plans to evacuate most of its expatriates and their family members from Wuhan using chartered plane dispatched by the Japanese government, a company spokeswoman said in an email.GMO Internet Inc.

Ahead of the earnings report, the spread of the coronavirus over the crucial Chinese New Year has cast doubt over iPhone sales in China. But Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said today the bulk of iPhone sales were already in the bag before the outbreak led to a lockdown of major cities in China.
“While China is a major part of our bull thesis and growth story of Apple for the coming 12 to 18 months, we do not view the impact of this virus epidemic as changing the numbers/merits behind the renaissance of growth in China for FY20/FY21 with a 5G super cycle the longer term driver,” Ives said.
Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar echoed the bullish sentiment.
“Apple’s push to expand its sales from services is clearly succeeding, while growth from iPhones is coming back,” Anwar said. “Any post earnings weakness, in our view, should be taken as a buying opportunity.”
Apple is expected to report earnings of $4.52 a share on revenue of $88.38 billion.
2. Here Comes the Rest of the Earnings Parade
While Apple takes the earnings spotlight, there are plenty more big-name earnings reports to move the market.
Three more Dow components will issue results ahead of trading:   Pfizer   (NYSE:PFE), 3M (NYSE:MMM) and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX).
After the close of trading, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) will weigh in.
On average, analysts are predicting a profit of 76 cents per share on revenue of about $7 billion.
U.S. same-store sales are forecast to be up 5% for the quarter, according to FactSet.
The stock looks risky with U.S. and China performance fully priced in, Anwar said.
“But when the next pullback comes, this stock is an attractive buy-and-hold candidate for long-term investors, especially with its hefty dividend growth,” he added. “On the strategy side, Starbucks remains well on course as the chain wins back coffee drinkers not only in its home markets, but also in China.” 
Semiconductor bellwether Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) also reports postmarket.
AMD is forecast to report a profit of 31 cents per share, with revenue coming in at about $2.1 billion.
The “chipmaker is slowly expanding its market share and is well positioned to take advantage of lapses by Intel (NASDAQ:INTC),” Anwar said.
3. Durable Goods, Consumer Confidence Due
As the Federal Open Market Committee starts its two-day meeting on interest rates, there will be some more data to consider ahead of trading.
The Commerce Department will issues its December report on demand for long-lasting goods at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).
Durable goods orders are expected to have risen 0.3% last month, reversing a November decline, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Core durable goods orders, which exclude autos, are seen posting a 0.2% rise.
At 10:00 AM ET, the Conference Board releases its latest measure of consumer sentiment.
The January consumer confidence index is expected to come in at 128 from 126.5 in December."

 Renault  declined to comment. The board had not yet been called, according to a source close to the matter, who declined to be named as the timing is still confidential. But De Meo's nomination is widely expected to take place any day now.
De Meo, who stepped down from Seat earlier this month, will not take up his post at Renault until closer to July, the source added.
Italian-born De Meo had been hotly tipped for the job for several weeks but faced wrangles over his contract and a stringent noncompete clause, which had to be negotiated between Renault and Volkswagen, sources previously told Reuters.
The delay in his arrival comes at a delicate time for Renault, which is trying to reboot its alliance with Japan's Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) after the partnership's former boss, Carlos Ghosn, was arrested in Tokyo in 2018.
Ghosn, who has repeatedly denied the financial misconduct charges he was accused of, slipped out of Japan and fled to Lebanon at the end of 2019.
Renault's board ousted its former CEO and longstanding Ghosn ally Thierry Bollore last October, as part of efforts to clean the decks and reset the alliance, and the job has been occupied in the interim by financial chief Clotilde Delbos."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The latest rally in U.S. stocks is facing a serious test, as the S&P 500 heads toward its worst loss in months on concerns over how the coronavirus will impact the global economy.
So far, the selling has been measured, with most investors confident the U.S. economy remains in good shape and the Federal Reserve stands ready to provide stimulus if the situation deteriorates.
Still, worries have grown that months of placid trading may have left stocks primed for an upsurge in volatility.
""Markets hate uncertainty, and the coronavirus is the ultimate uncertainty,"" said Alec Young, managing director of global markets research, FTSE Russell, New York. ""With the markets overbought to begin with, this is now a sell first, ask questions later situation.""
On Monday, the benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) stock index broke a streak of 71 days without a 1% move, the third such longest stretch since 1995. The index registered its biggest one-day percentage drop since October on news that the death toll from the virus grew in China while more cases were reported abroad.
Past runs of quiet trading in U.S. stocks have tended to culminate in periods of turbulence: for instance, an unusually calm period from September 2017 to January 2018 preceded a sharp sell-off in February 2018, fueled by an implosion of bets volatility would stay low.
For an interactive graphic on S&P 500 moves, click here: http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/GLOBAL-MARKETS-DASHBOARD/010050DG0V9/index.html
The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) touched a three-month high on Monday and ended the session 3.67 points higher at 18.23, after having traded near its lowest levels over the past year earlier this month.
""Positioning in the equity markets ... had gotten a little bit out of hand. That creates a lot of kindling for a fire in risk asset prices,"" said Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.
There have been few tests of the bull market's most recent leg higher, which before Monday's losses has seen the S&P hit numerous fresh highs after the preliminary U.S.-China trade deal was announced in mid-December.
Growing confidence in the rally's durability had pushed investors to increase their exposure to equities: Allocations to global stocks stood at their highest level in 17 months, while cash levels shrank to a seven-year low, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) survey of fund managers showed last week.
Until last week, options also reflected muted concerns about a sharp pullback.
Persistent low volatility would usually prompt greater demand for puts, which offer downside protection, in comparison to calls, used to participate in further upside, said Stacey Gilbert, portfolio manager for derivatives at Glenmede Investment Management in Philadelphia. But skew, a measure of interest in puts versus calls, for the S&P 500 rose only modestly in relation to the plunge in volatility.
Investors may take comfort from the market's reaction to the 2003 SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak, when the S&P rallied more than 10% from the start of the outbreak to the announcement of its containment.

A few investors have gone against the grain in recent weeks, buying insurance against a jump in volatility while prices for most such bets have been relatively discounted. At least one investor bought 225,000 calls earlier this month that would require the VIX to hit 22 by late February in order to be redeemed. The index traded as high as 19.02 on Monday.
""People are nervous because the market has been going up for such a long time and done so well recently,"" said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Funds. ""I think this coronavirus may be more of an excuse than a rational estimate of its effects."""

1380,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2020 04:50PM ET</span>","New York, FTC sue 'pharma bro' Shkreli, others over Daraprim price hikes","By Diane Bartz
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Martin Shkreli, the ""pharma bro"" in prison for defrauding investors, faces a lawsuit filed by the Federal Trade Commission and New York Attorney General's office for a scheme to preserve his monopoly for the drug Daraprim, which saw its price increase by more than 4,000% in one day.
The lawsuit accuses a company Shkreli once ran of buying the rights in 2015 to Daraprim, which is used to treat toxoplasmosis, and quickly raising the price from $17.50 per tablet to $750 while taking steps to ensure that there would not be a cheaper generic version of the medicine. 
The company named is Vyera Pharmaceuticals, formerly Turing Pharmaceuticals, which was headed by Shkreli.
The lawsuit also names Shkreli associate Kevin Mulleady, the FTC said. The FTC and New York attorney general's office are seeking monetary relief for people who overpaid for the medicine and an order requiring the company to halt illegal conduct.
Shkreli, who is in prison in Pennsylvania, became notorious as ""Pharma Bro"" when he sharply raised the price of the anti-parasitic drug Daraprim while chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals.
A spokeswoman for Vyera and a lawyer for Shkreli, 36, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Shkreli is slated for release in September 2023, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons.
""We filed this lawsuit to stop Vyera’s egregious conduct, make the company pay for its illegal scheming, and block Martin Shkreli from ever working in the pharmaceutical industry again. We won’t allow 'pharma bros' to manipulate the market and line their pockets at the expense of vulnerable patients and the health care system,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement.
James said Vyera raised the price of the drug by more than 4,000% in a single day.
The FTC alleged that the company protected its dominance of the drug by restricting distribution to ensure generic drug makers could not get the samples needed to make their own version of the drug. The company also prevented potential competitors from buying one of the medicine's ingredients, the FTC said.
The U.S. Supreme Court said in November that Shkreli must remain in prison, rejecting his effort to overturn his conviction and seven-year sentence for securities fraud and conspiracy.

The justices refused to hear Shkreli's appeal of his August 2017 conviction and $7.36 million forfeiture for cheating investors in two hedge funds he founded, and trying to prop up the stock price of biotechnology company Retrophin Inc (O:RTRX), which he once ran.

(Reuters) - A federal judge on Monday dismissed an antitrust lawsuit by investors who accused the parent of the Chicago Board Options Exchange of letting anonymous traders rig the ""fear gauge,"" Wall Street's main gauge of future stock market volatility, at their expense.
U.S. District Judge Manish Shah in Chicago found no proof that Cboe Global Markets Inc (Z:CBOE) intended to defraud investors by letting the ""John Doe"" traders manipulate options and futures tied to the fear gauge, known as the VIX (VIX), to generate higher transaction fees.
In a 48-page decision, Shah said he found no plausible allegations that Cboe knew who the John Does were or worked with them to rig the VIX, as Cboe Volatility Index is known, or that Cboe's failure to enforce its rules caused losses for investors not involved in any manipulation.
""The more compelling inference here is that Cboe pursued a profit motive by making the VIX replicable,"" helping liquidity providers offset risk, ""and any manipulation that occurred was unintentional or negligent (from Cboe's perspective),"" Shah wrote.
Lawyers for the investors did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Cboe's lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests.
Shah dismissed a version of the proposed class action last May, but gave the investors another chance to pursue federal securities and commodities law claims.
Monday's dismissal was with prejudice, meaning the complaint cannot be filed again.
The VIX measures expected 30-day volatility for U.S. stocks based on Standard & Poor's 500 (SPX) options, and often rises when stock prices fall.
The VIX gained notoriety in February 2018 when prices of two products tied to it sank more than 80%, and an anonymous whistleblower alerted U.S. financial regulators to alleged manipulation.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks suffered their worst day in over three months on Monday as China extended the Lunar New Year holiday due to a virus outbreak, fueling worries about the economic impact of containment efforts in the world's second largest economy. 
The benchmark S&P 500 suffered its worst weekly performance since September last week as China locked down several cities and curbed travel, reminding investors of the deadly SARS virus that killed nearly 800 people in 2002-03 and cost the global economy billions.
Still, some investors viewed any long-term economic impact as unlikely, given past experiences with viral outbreaks. 
""This whole thing is way overblown,"" said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco. 
""It seems to me the Chinese are doing a much better job of containing it than with SARS and what did SARS ultimately lead to? Did it lead to some sort of economic catastrophe - no."" 
After the 2003 SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak, the S&P rallied more than 10% from the start of the outbreak to the announcement of its containment.

Travel-related stocks, including airlines, casinos and hotels, were among the hardest hit on Wall Street, while shares of sectors exposed to China's growth, including technology (SPLRCT), materials (SPLRCM) and energy (SPNY), pressured the markets. 
Adding to downside pressure was the sluggish start to corporate earnings season with indexes near record levels.
Earnings are now expected to show a decline of 0.5% for the fourth quarter, according to Refinitiv data. Of the 87 companies that have reported though Monday morning, 67.8 have topped expectations, below the 74% rate from the past four quarters.

Technology and internet heavyweights that have powered the recent rally including Apple Inc (O:AAPL),  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT), Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), which account for about 15% of the S&P 500 weighting, lost at least 1.6%.
 Wynn Resorts Ltd  (O:WYNN), Melco Resorts & Entertainment Ltd (O:MLCO) and  Las Vegas Sands  Corp (N:LVS), which have large operations in China, plunged at least 5%. The NYSE Arca Airline index (XAL) dropped 3.32%. 
 Yum China Holdings Inc  (N:YUMC) tumbled 5.27% after the company said it had temporarily closed some of its KFC and Pizza Hut stores in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak.
The rush to safe-haven assets sank U.S. Treasury yields, with the benchmark 10-year note (US10YT=RR) falling as low as 1.603%, its lowest since Oct. 10, and the yield curve between the two-year (US2YT=RR) and 5-year (US5YT=RR) inverting for the first time since Dec. 4, putting pressure on lenders. The S&P 500 banks index <.SPXBK> was down 1.42%.
The S&P energy index (SPNY) dropped 2.76% as crude prices settled down about 2% on fears the outbreak would dent demand.
Fourth-quarter earnings will kick into high gear this week with 141 of the S&P 500 companies, including Apple, Microsoft Corp and  Boeing Co  (N:BA), reporting. 
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.63-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.25-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

1384,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 27, 2020 04:08PM ET</span>",EU Gets Primed to Attack With Stubborn Position on U.K. Trade,"(Bloomberg) -- Sign up to our Brexit Bulletin, follow us @Brexit and subscribe to our podcast.
The European Union’s remaining 27 governments agreed to pursue a tough line in the post-Brexit negotiations with the U.K., seeking early concessions on fishing rights and state aid that put them on collision course with Boris Johnson’s government.
Diplomats from national capitals have set out a list of demands they want to see Britain meet as condition for any deal on the two sides’ future relationship, according to a summary of a series of meetings in Brussels obtained by Bloomberg. The EU will next week decide its formal negotiating mandate for the talks based on these guidelines.
Britain’s exit from the EU on Friday starts the clock on an 11-month negotiation encompassing trade, security, finance and fishing. Officials in Brussels are bracing for tough months ahead as the two sides try to reconcile their desire to reach a trade deal with Johnson’s eagerness to break free from what he views as anti-competitive EU rules. If the two sides can’t agree, the U.K. will start next year doing business with the world’s biggest single market on the far more restrictive World Trade Organization terms.
“We have to rebuild everything with the U.K.,” EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said in Dublin on Monday. “If we have no agreement, it will not be business as usual and the status quo: we have to face the risk of a cliff edge, in particular for trade.”
Johnson has ruled out extending the talks beyond the end of 2020 and is pushing for a comprehensive trade agreement similar to that struck between the EU and Canada. The EU has warned that the U.K.’s future access to the single market depends on how far Johnson agrees to abide by the bloc’s rules.
At the meetings, diplomats representing national governments and officials from the European Commission, which will conduct negotiations on their behalf, hammered out their initial demands. According to the document, they include:
Maintaining the current “distribution keys” for divvying up fishing areas around the U.K. -- something that looks nothing like giving Britain back control over its watersDismissing the “existing precedents” of the EU’s current free-trade agreements -- because the U.K.’s size and proximity means there’s a “risk of unfair competition by undercutting standards.” That’s a blow to Johnson because it means the EU thinks the Canada model, which allows divergence, won’t workInsisting the so-called level playing field -- the EU’s strict demand that the U.K. adhere to its rules in areas like state aid and labor protection to prevent it getting a competitive advantage -- is a “precondition” for any dealRuling out separate negotiations on individual issues so that there’s an over-arching agreement, not a series of mini-deals as wanted by the U.K.: This could see agreement in one area hinging on concessions in anotherDemanding full protection and enforcement of its intellectual property rights and no automatic recognition of U.K. standardsRequiring that any rules on allowing citizens to live and work in each other’s territories should be based on “full reciprocity.” The U.K. won’t be allowed to discriminate in favor of one EU country over anotherAllowing the U.K. to take part in EU projects, as long as they pay for them and accept it won’t have any “decision-making power”In financial services and data-sharing, the EU has made no concessions to the U.K., requiring cooperation based on equivalence and adequacy respectively. That means the EU could pull the plug on any agreement whenever it sees fit.
But amid the toughness, the document contains elements that will hearten the U.K. and reveals the path to an eventual deal. The governments say they want an ambitious agreement on services and cooperation on public procurement as well as the continuation of digital trade and free movement of capital and payments. They also want to maintain cooperation on energy supply.
The EU wants to prioritize negotiations on aviation to ensure continued connectivity, and is hoping for an ambitious security deal based on “reciprocity and proportionality.” That could see the U.K. still taking part in some foreign missions."

Mizuho boosted its target on Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to $1,650 from $1,450, saying it looks like the numbers are tracking ahead of forecasts. It’s got a buy rating on the stock.
Stifel reiterated its buy on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and bumped up its price target to $250 from $240.
And Benchmark raised its target on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to $2,300 from $2,100, while keepings its buy rating.
“We expect another record revenue holiday quarter, which could eclipse the high end of guidance thanks to share gains from the impressive, aggressive, one-day shipping rollout,” analyst Daniel Kurnos wrote, according to Barron’s.
And following up from last week’s Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) earnings, Citi raised its price target on shares to $350 from $325, citing optimism on continued cord-cutting strength.
In afternoon trading, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) was down 1.1%, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) lost 1.4%, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) lost 2.8% and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) slipped 2.2%."

Investing.com – Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was caught up in the intense selloff Monday, as many fret the impact of the coronavirus on Chinese New Year sales, but one analyst sees reason for optimism ahead of the iPhone maker's earnings due Tuesday.
China made up about 17% of Apple's total revenue last year, and the spread of the coronavirus has raised worries over the consumer impact on the highly anticipated Chinese New Year, Wedbush said.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell 2%, but Wedbush said it would be buyers of the stock on weakness and reiterated its outperform rating and $400 price target.
The bulk of Apple sales in China and the surrounding countries has already taken place in the lead up to the holiday with a ""strong December and January likely already in the books with sales up markedly year over year and thus have helped drive a strong China region for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL),"" Wedbush added.
With as many as 48 cities in China reportedly on lockdown, transportation and foot traffic is limited in major cities, including Shanghai and Beijing. This would result in just 1 million iPhones, less than 3% of Chinese annual iPhone sales at most, in the region shifting out of the March quarter into the June quarter, Wedbush estimated.
The fundamental impact from this virus to Apple’s top line is ""negligible,"" according to Wedbush, as the tech company decided against cutting prices this year or introducing last-minute sales around the Chinese New Year, which had be seen in prior years to boost sales. 
Apple is up about 5% for the year so far and reports fiscal first-quarter earnings on Tuesday after the closing bell."

She was confirming a Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper report that cited chief executive Holger Engelmann as saying in an interview that travel to and from China will stop for two weeks.
A Chinese employee from Shanghai tested positive for the virus on Jan. 26, Engelmann told the paper.
The employee had been at the company's German headquarters from Jan. 19 to 22, but it was unclear when the employee became infected, he said.
The company, which has 11 locations in China, including in Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus, is also examining its supply chain, Engelmann said."
1389,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 27, 2020 02:17PM ET</span>","Traders May Hate Treasuries at 1.6%, But What Else Is There?","(Bloomberg Opinion) -- So far, 2020 has proved to be a tricky year for Wall Street bond strategists. First, they had to handicap the likelihood that a conflict between the U.S. and Iran would escalate into something truly terrible. Now they are grappling with the impact of the coronavirus that has left 80 dead in China, infected almost 3,000 people and spread across continents.
In both cases, the immediate reaction was a massive rally in the $16.7 trillion U.S. Treasury market. The benchmark 10-year yield plunged 9 basis points on Jan. 3 in the immediate aftermath of the U.S. drone strike in Iraq that killed Qassem Soleimani. Similarly, the yield fell 5 basis points on Jan. 24 and tumbled an additional 7 basis points on Monday as the fallout from the disease intensified.
In the first case, the rally fizzled within three days. Bond traders largely wrote off the episode as a blip that wouldn’t ultimately change the trajectory for global growth or the likelihood that the Federal Reserve would keep interest rates steady in 2020.
Some strategists are making a similar call now. JPMorgan Chase & Co. says to sell 30-year bonds, calling the coronavirus scare “the latest risk of a series that have driven U.S. Treasury yields far below what fundamentals indicate.” TD Securities said it was closing its long 10-year Treasuries position in its model portfolio, explaining that “even though it is impossible to forecast the extent of contagion to the global economy or risk assets, we take profit on our long 10y trade as we don’t think that the risk-reward to being long Treasuries is as attractive any longer.” NatWest Markets acknowledged that “no one knows how offsides the market is at these levels,” but suggested “tactical longs should consider at least partially exiting here, while holding the core position.”
Few dispute that if and when the coronavirus is contained, it’ll be painful for Treasuries. Even BMO Capital Markets, which is “decidedly in dip-buying mode,” estimates that 10-year yields will jump by 20 to 30 basis points when fears ultimately subside. Relative-strength index analysis suggests the market is already overbought and the haven-inspired rally should lose steam soon.
But until that happens, the question is this: If traders can’t stomach 10-year Treasuries at 1.6%, what’s the alternative?
For all the talk of stock markets in turmoil, the S&P 500 Index is still just down 3% from its all-time high and has gained more than 15% since early October. Investment-grade U.S. corporate bonds yield less than 1 percentage point more than Treasuries, close to the narrowest spread of the post-crisis period. And, of course, non-American safety seekers are really in a bind, with 10-year German bund yields falling to -0.38% and Japanese 10-year yields dipping to -0.05%. Simply put, nothing looks like a screaming buy, unless you count credit-default swaps on large U.S. airline companies.
These back-to-back risk-off episodes have some strategists contemplating if they reflect something more permanent about the state of the world. Jim Vogel at FHN Financial put out his thoughts in a Monday note:
“Markets trade them as one-off events. Unfortunately, the number of armed conflicts and political miscalculations has been steadily rising around the world for five years. Individual events can fade, but the overall noise level intensifies. For one thing, a structural increase in political and economic mistakes provides the infrastructure for still more. U.S. decisions to pull back from global affairs – hoping to force others to step up – represent an obvious vacuum that for now fosters more confusion and mistakes.”
All of this throws a splash of cold water on what was supposed to be the prevailing investing theme of 2020: reflation. It’s hard to quantify what sort of damage the coronavirus will cause to global growth, but it’s safe to say it’ll come in lower, not higher. And the prospect of contagion makes it harder to focus on whether inflation will finally stage a comeback this year.
I spoke earlier this month with Joseph Davis, Vanguard Group Inc.’s chief economist and global head of the Vanguard Investment Strategy Group. His headline-grabbing call was for U.S. growth to slow to just 1% in 2020. “Reflation is the head-fake this year,” he said. “Last year, it was recession.” He added that for the economy, “China is not going to be the world’s savior,” and that was before any word of the coronavirus.
In that context, maybe a 1.6% yield on 10-year Treasuries doesn’t look so bad after all. It’s not what many expected — just six out of 58 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg saw it ending the first quarter at 1.6% or lower. But the events of the first few weeks of the year were equally as unpredictable. "
1390,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2020 02:10PM ET</span>",Task force pushes U.S. lawmakers to strengthen insider trading rules,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of former U.S. officials and lawyers is urging Congress to strengthen and clarify law around insider trading that has ""generated confusion"" and ""failed to keep up with the times.""
The United States needs a specific law to prohibit insider trading, rather than continuing to rely on rules against fraud and deception, a task force led by former U.S. attorney for the Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York Preet Bharara said in a report published on Monday.
The task force recommended a legislative fix that outlines elements of insider trading with a focus on material, nonpublic information that is ""wrongfully"" obtained or communicated, according to the report.
That would mark a shift as there is no current U.S. law that explicitly prohibits insider trading, according to the lawyers. Decades of cases, including a recent high-profile one against former Republican U.S. Representative Chris Collins, instead rely largely on previous court decisions and enforcement of restrictions against deceptions and fraud.
""If we move to a standard that talks about wrongfully obtaining information, it will cover conduct that unquestionably involves the same conduct as insider trading but do so more clearly,"" Joon H. Kim, vice-chair of the group and former acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a phone interview.
The U.S. House of Representatives last month passed a law to explicitly prohibit trading of securities by someone who is aware of material, nonpublic information. But the Senate has yet to act.
The House of Representatives' Insider Trading Prohibition Act goes a long way toward providing that clarity, though it kept a requirement for ""personal benefit"" that should be eliminated, Kim said.
It was not immediately clear how much weight the task force's recommendations might carry with U.S. lawmakers, but the panel includes many former enforcement officials besides Bharara and Kim.
The group also included Columbia University law school professor John Coffee, Jr.; former Justice Department official Katherine R. Goldstein; former SEC Commissioner Joseph A. Grundfest, former U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California Melinda Haag, former SEC enforcement official Joan E. McKown, and senior U.S. district judge for New York District Judge Jed Rakoff."

Investing – Freeport-McMoRan sank in midday trading Monday as the world’s biggest copper producer fell afoul of the pervasive virus concerns and effect on the Chinese economy.
Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) shares sank 6%.
Copper prices also sank, off 3%, heading for their ninth-straight down session, which would be the metal’s longest losing streak in six years.
China, the world’s top buyer of metal, is hitting worldwide investments as concerns of a wider spreading of the coronavirus and an economic slowdown grew. The government has taken emergency measures to contain the disease, like extending the Lunar New Year holiday, as the death toll hit 81.
Copper, regarded as a bellwether of the global economy, has given up all of its gains since early December when a rally pushed prices up nearly 10% to eight-month highs as investors welcomed the first phase of a U.S.-China trade deal and hoped for a rebound in economic growth.
""Chinese demand accounts for about 50% of the majority of base metals and looking at the latest data regarding the coronavirus, it's now spread quite widely,"" said analyst Timothy Wood-Dow at BMO Capital in London.
“On Friday, we didn't know this, it seemed quite contained. Now this wider geographical spread is very concerning, so that's feeding through to the market.""
Freeport sold off last week following its fourth-quarter earnings report. While profit was better-than-expected, it was down more than 80% from the year-ago period.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Four investment firms opposing the sale of U.S. educational software company  Instructure Inc  (N:INST) to private equity firm Thoma Bravo picked up support on Monday when an influential proxy advisory firm came out against the planned all-cash deal of roughly $2 billion.
Institutional Shareholder Services Inc (ISS) recommended that Instructure shareholders vote against the company's planned sale to the private equity firm at a Feb. 13 meeting. 
""Given legitimate concerns regarding the conduct of the process, a seemingly uncompelling valuation, and a strong standalone case, a vote AGAINST the transaction is warranted under the proposed terms,"" ISS said in a note to clients, including large and small investment firms which often follow ISS's recommendations on proxy and merger votes.
The ISS note, released on Monday, was seen by Reuters.
Hedge funds Praesidium Investment Management, Rivulet Capital LLC and Lateef Investment Management as well as Oberndorf Enterprises have said they plan to vote against the deal and criticized the price as well as how the company found a buyer. 
The firms either declined to comment or could not be reached for comment.
Thoma Bravo did not comment.
Instructure did not have an immediate comment.
Instructure said in early December it planned to sell itself to Thoma Bravo for $47.60 a share or about $2 billion, giving in to pressure from one of its shareholders pushing for a sale. Thoma Bravo had raised its price from $47.00 per share to $47.60, the documents show. Other offers could be made during a 35-day go-shop period when Instructure sought alternative bids.
Market reaction to the proposed sale, which represented a 10% discount to Instructure's closing share price on Dec. 3, was negative when it was announced on Dec. 4.
Instructure shares were up 6 cents at $47.90 on Monday morning.

Investing.com - Casino stocks with exposure to Macau gaming got another drubbing Monday as worries about the economic impact of the coronavirus pushed investors out of risk assets in a big way.
Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) kept getting hit by the selling, no surprise as it has three properties in Macua that account for about 75% of its revenue.
Shares fell 7.6% in morning trading and are down about 13% in the last five sessions.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Securities downgraded Wynn to neutral from buy on concerns about how China’s restrictions on travel would hurt business. It lowered its price target on shares to $150 from $160.
""Understandably, the Macau-focused gaming names have traded off more than the broader market as they are 1) highly exposed to domestic Chinese travel, 2) the timing is concurrent with Chinese New Year,"" BofA analyst Shaun Kelley said.
  Las Vegas Sands   (NYSE:LVS) dropped 6.8%, while MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) lost 4%.
The China trouble overshadowed what was a positive article by Barron’s for the gaming sector on the “huge opportunity” in legalized U.S. sports betting."

The company said its first electric truck will be a pickup, whose production will begin late next year and will be followed by a self-driving vehicle, Cruise Origin.
GM last week https://reut.rs/30V6MfE unveiled a prototype of a driverless vehicle for ride-sharing service. 
Reuters had reported last year that GM plans to build a new family of premium electric vehicles at the plant beginning late 2021, possibly reviving its Hummer brand. The company had said it would invest $7.7 billion in its U.S. plants over the next four years. 
The Detroit-Hamtramck plant currently operates one production shift and builds the Cadillac CT6 and the Chevrolet Impala sedans. 
The plant will be idled for several months at the end of February as GM starts renovations for the production of electric trucks and SUVs.

Ford is also expected to begin building premium electric pickups in late 2021 at a Detroit-area assembly plant. Ford and GM expect annual electric truck production to hit around 40,000 units by 2024, analysts have said.

1403,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2020 10:37AM ET</span>",J&J CEO to testify at trial for first time on Baby Powder risks,"By Michael Erman and Lisa Girion
NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson Chief Executive Officer Alex Gorsky was set to be called as a witness on Monday in what would be his first appearance in a jury trial over allegations that the company's Baby Powder causes cancer.
Lawyers for three men and one woman who sued J&J subpoenaed Gorsky in a trial playing out in a state courtroom in New Brunswick, New Jersey near the company's headquarters.
All four have mesothelioma, a rare and incurable cancer that they said was caused by their exposure to asbestos in Baby Powder applied when they were diapered as infants.
During an earlier phase of the trial, the jury held J&J liable for the plaintiffs' cancers and awarded them $37.2 million in compensation. Now their lawyers are seeking to persuade a second jury that J&J's behavior was so reckless that punitive damages are warranted.
J&J fought the subpoena of Gorsky, arguing that he had no first-hand knowledge about the safety of its powders and that the case involves corporate conduct that occurred long before he joined the company in 2012. Compelling his testimony, J&J said in a motion, would set a precedent that could result in other chief executives being hauled to court and ""would serve no purpose other than to harass Mr. Gorsky and divert him from his executive responsibilities.""
Last week, the New Jersey Supreme Court turned down the company's request to suspend the subpoena, clearing the way for Gorsky to be called to testify.
The stakes are high. J&J faces more than 16,000 lawsuits. They assert that J&J sold powders contaminated with asbestos, a known carcinogen, and failed to warn users. J&J also faces a federal criminal investigation into how forthright it has been about the products' safety.
In October, J&J disclosed that a contract lab for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had found asbestos in a bottle of Baby Powder produced in 2018. The company questioned the finding and commissioned tests on samples from the same bottle and talc from the same lot. Less than two weeks later, J&J announced those tests had found no contamination, other than some asbestos it attributed to an air conditioner in the lab.
In December 2018, a Reuters report based on J&J documents produced in litigation showed that the company knew small amounts of asbestos had been found in its talc on occasion since 1971. J&J dismissed the Reuters' report as ""an absurd conspiracy theory.""
Gorsky's road to court began in the days following the publication of that report when he took the lead in company efforts to rebut it. The chief executive attested to the safety and purity of Johnson's Baby Powder in a video posted on the company's website and in an appearance on CNBC's ""Mad Money."" 
""We unequivocally believe that our talc, our Baby Powder, does not contain asbestos,"" Gorsky told the investment show's host Jim Cramer."

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets fell to their lowest level in three weeks at the opening Monday before rebounding slightly, as growing fears about the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on the Chinese and the global economy sent a wave of risk-aversion rippling through the financial system.
By 10:25 AM ET (1525 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 410 points, or 1.4% at 28,581 points. The S&P 500 was down 48 points, also a drop of 1.4%, while the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.8%.
At the same time, yields on safe-haven Treasury bonds plummeted. The 10-Year benchmark yield fell seven basis points to 1.61%, its lowest since early October. It's now down 21 basis points in the last week. Gold futures also rallied.
Travel stocks were badly hit as markets participants priced in the risk of a hit to global tourism if the outbreak continues to spread. Booking (NASDAQ:BKNG) stock and   Expedia   (NASDAQ:EXPE) stock both fell over 3.5%, while American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock fell 6.9% to its lowest since October and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) stock fell 5.3% to an 18-month low. Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) stock fell 5.0%.
Over the weekend, the Chinese authorities had said that it estimated traffic by road, rail and air at the start of the week-long holiday seasons fell by 29% from a year earlier, due in part to a broadening clampdown on public transport aimed at containing the virus near its origins in central China.
The novel coronavirus has, however, been detected in almost all of China’s regions, and the head of the country’s health commission said at the weekend that patients can be infectious for up to 14 days before becoming symptomatic – a key difference with the SARS virus in 2003 that will allow the new bug to spread more widely.
Energy stocks were also hit hard as oil traders factored in a sharp drop in Chinese oil demand – in a market that both OPEC and the International Energy Agency had already said would be oversupplied in the first half of the year, even before the outbreak started. U.S. crude bounced from earlier lows to be down 1.7% at $53.28 a barrel.
Blue chips   Exxon Mobil   (NYSE:XOM) and   Chevron   (NYSE:CVX) both came under pressure, both falling 1.5%, but financially-constrained shale plays such as Laredo Petroleum (NYSE:LPI) and Oasis (NASDAQ:OAS) were worse hit, both touching new lows. Laredo is now down over 50% in the last three weeks. Oasis was down 3.3%.
Elsewhere, Walt   Disney   (NYSE:DIS) stock fell 2.2% to a two-month low, amid reports that both of its theme parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong will be closed for the entire Chinese holiday season.   Alibaba   (NYSE:BABA) ADRs meanwhile fell 4.4% on more generic fears for Chinese retail sales.
One rare bright spot was homebuilder DR Horton (NYSE:DHI), which rose 2.9% to a new all-time higher after posting stronger-than-expected earnings for the three months through December.
Elsewhere the dollar benefited from the wave of caution.The dollar index rose 0.1% to its highest since early December at 97.750."

1408,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 27, 2020 09:40AM ET</span>","‘Fear is The Name of The Game’: Investors Dump Airlines, Miners","(Bloomberg) -- After surging to a fresh record high at the end of last week, European equities on Monday became the latest market to get hammered by fears that measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus were failing, sending investors running from risky assets.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index tumbled about 2%, with miners, airlines, luxury-goods makers and tech stocks taking a serious beating. All industry groups were in the red, signaling just how worried traders are.
“Fear is the name of the game,” said Stephane Ekolo, an equity strategist at TFS Derivatives in London. “Market participants are taking some risks off the table as they are afraid of the potential economic implication of the virus outbreak.”
Today’s drop is quite a change from Friday, when the market rallied on optimism that China was moving quickly enough to contain the outbreak. The death toll has now risen to at least 80 people, the infection is spreading around the world, and investors are dumping equities at the start of a week jam-packed with earnings.
“A spike in volatility will add further excuses to sell and to adjust the weight into the end of the month,” said Alberto Tocchio, chief investment officer at Colombo Wealth SA in Lugano. “We are therefore continuing to buy puts on main European and U.S. indexes in order to protect the portfolios.”
The Euro Stoxx 50 Volatility Index jumped 25% to the highest level since Jan. 6, signaling that traders were unsettled by the rising number of victims from the outbreak. The gauge had dropped to a record low earlier this month.
While Monday’s pull-back in stocks was pronounced, all was not lost yet. Technical charts showed the Stoxx 600 remained in an uptrend channel, and trading above its 50-day moving average.
Meanwhile, Italian banks managed to buck the trend, gaining ground along with the country’s bonds as after Matteo Salvini, leader of the anti-immigrant League party, suffered a defeat in a key regional vote.
Here are the most affected sectors in today’s sell-off:
Luxury-goods makers
Shares in luxury-goods makers were hurt by worries that Chinese consumers won’t spend as much time shopping during Lunar New Year festivities as they usually do.  Kering  (PA:PRTP) SA, Swatch Group (SIX:UHR) AG and  Burberry  Group (LON:BRBY) Plc were among the biggest decliners in the sector.“It’s very apparent that the last thing on anyone’s mind right now is purchasing luxury items,” Keith Temperton, a trader at Tavira Securities, said by email.While it’s too early to draw any firm conclusions on the potential impact on the industry from the virus, disruptive events -- especially those affecting consumer sentiment and people traveling -- have in the past been “historically good times” to buy into the sector, a team of Exane  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) analysts wrote in a note.Airlines and Airports
The spread of the virus and China’s order to suspend sales of package tours in an attempt to contain the outbreak are weighing on travel and leisure shares including airlines.Deutsche Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) AG and Air France-KLM shares tumbled as the two airlines are the most exposed to China among European peers, with about 7% of capacity, according to a UBS note; IAG (LON:ICAG) SA also underperformed even as its exposure is more limited. Finnair also sank; the carrier has 10% of its seat capacity exposed to China and a further 38% to other Asian countries, according to Goodbody.“This is of growing concern for global long-haul airlines,” Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd. analyst Daniel Roeska said in an email. “While low-cost airlines in Europe don’t have any exposure, the majors’ links to their Chinese partners will make Asia traffic a difficult region in their 1Q,” “However, we have also seen that travel can resume very quickly after events like this and I would expect top-line challenges for AF, LHA, IAG only as long as the tragic situation persists.”Among airport managers, Fraport AG has the highest exposure to Asia, which represents about 10% of the airport’s capacity, according to UBS, followed by Aeroports de Paris and Flughafen Zurich AG.Autos
Shares of European carmakers and suppliers dropped on fears of further weakening in demand in China, the world’s biggest automotive market. Car sales in the country fell for a second straight year in 2019 and, while the head of its main automotive industry association is predicting some growth in the market this year, Beijing Automotive Group Co. has said competition is “brutal.”Wuhan, the virus outbreak’s epicenter, is the base of Dongfeng Motor Group Co., one of the three main shareholders in French carmaker PSA Group, the maker of Peugeot, Citroen and Opel models. In addition to that partnership, Dongfeng is also working on electric vehicles with PSA’s main domestic rival,  Renault  SA (PA:RENA).Parts producers with multiple sites in China include German tire and powering-systems manufacturer  Continental AG  (DE:CONG) and French peers  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) SA and Faurecia SE.Technology
Tech stocks, which touched their highest levels since May 2001 on Friday, also pulled back, weighed by losses for almost every member of the Stoxx Tech Index apart from Ericsson (BS:ERICAs). Prosus, Micro Focus, Dialog Semiconductor and AMS were among the biggest decliners.Trade-war concerns for the tech sector have dissipated, Fahad Hassan, a fund manager at Atlantic House Fund Management, said by phone, still “this is just a different sort of macro concern that obviously affects all stocks, but given tech has been the strongest group so far this year, I think it was going to get hit on any pull-back,” Fahad added, referring to the coronavirus.Mining and Steel
Mining shares slid 4.1%, their biggest drop on since August. Large diversified miners such as  Anglo American  (LON:AAL), BHP Group,  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) and  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) paced the retreat, alongside steelmakers ArcelorMittal and Evraz, as base metals tumbled on concerns that the spread of the coronavirus will weigh on demand, with China being the world’s largest consumer of commodities."

In a regulatory filing on Monday, the company said it expects the offering of 9.6 million shares to be priced between $17 and $19 per share. At the top end of the range, the IPO will raise $182.4 million and give the firm a valuation of $768 million.
Casper was valued at $1.1 billion in March 2019 following a fundraising round. The offering will test investor appetite for money-losing companies following WeWork's IPO debacle late last year.
In the past, public market investors have typically expected companies to become profitable within 18 months or so of an IPO. But investors have been willing to overlook losses in favor of rapid growth. Recent deals, however, suggest investors are becoming more selective about loss-making companies.
""Valuations in the private market are currently under the microscope, especially with unicorns, as they attempt to tap the public markets,"" said Jeff Zell, a senior research analyst at IPO Boutique.
""The biggest hurdle that Casper Sleep is going to have during the roadshow process is proving to investors a viable path to profitability while competing in a highly competitive industry.""
Launched in 2014, Casper, along with fellow online mattress retailers such as Purple, Nectar Sleep and Tuft & Needle, has squeezed the industry's old players.
Led by its co-founder Philip Krim, Casper made its name by selling one ""universally comfortable"" type of memory-foam mattress, as opposed to offering options for different firmness and designs. It now sells three different types of mattresses.
Investors hope that Casper's increased popularity with urban millennials will ensure it does not share the same fate as Mattress Firm Inc, the largest U.S. brick-and-mortar mattress retailer that filed for bankruptcy protection in 2018.
Casper brought in revenue of $312.3 million for the nine months ended Sept. 30, up 20% higher from a year earlier. For the same period, it posted a net loss of $67.3 million, expanding slightly from the prior year.
Casper said it would use a sizeable portion of the net proceeds to fund growth.
The New York-based company's investors include retailer  Target  Corp (N:TGT) and investment firms Lerer Hippeau Ventures, IVP and New Enterprise Associates.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Jefferies are the lead underwriters on the IPO."

CARACAS (Reuters) - Rum distiller  Ron Santa Teresa  (CR:RST) has launched Venezuela's first public share offering in 11 years, citing rare optimism that the socialist-ruled nation may see an economic transition similar to China and the Soviet Union.
One of Venezuela's best-known brands, Santa Teresa, which exports via an alliance with Bermuda-based Bacardi Ltd., sold an initial 1 million shares on Friday. It was the firm's first in a series of offers of bolivar-denominated shares hoped to raise the equivalent of a modest $3 million this year.
Company president Alberto Vollmer compared the sale, the first public share offering since 2008 on the diminished Caracas bourse, to the re-opening of the Shanghai Stock Exchange 30 years ago that helped revive China's economy.
Another Venezuelan company, real estate developer Fondo de Valores Inmobiliarios (CR:FVIb) (FIV), also plans a share issue this year, according to its president, Horacio Velutini.
The two men belong to an informal group known as ""Optimists Anonymous"" made up of 39 corporate leaders, bankers and investors who think businesses will become profitable again as President Nicolas Maduro will not be able to reverse his opening of the ailing economy.
Last year, the government unexpectedly relaxed 15 years of stringent economic regulations, abandoning enforcement of price controls and allowing dollar transactions in the face of runaway inflation and U.S. sanctions.
The Santa Teresa and FIV bosses' views contrast with the rest of the business establishment, the political opposition, and U.S. President Donald Trump's administration - all of whom maintain the economy cannot fully recover with Maduro in power.
""When we sit down with authorities, or businesses, or trade unions, we tell them that Venezuela's economic recovery will involve (share offerings),"" Vollmer told Reuters.
""We're taking the first step, let's see who follows.""
Vollmer led a ceremony at a Caracas roof bar on Friday, where attendants toasted with glasses of rum, to celebrate the sale of shares that will finance the expansion of warehouses and the acquisition of new barrels to age their spirits.
Investors included Venezuelans living in country and abroad.
""LOOSENED THE MOORINGS""
Velutini said his real estate group plans to use proceeds of its planned share sale to buy up office space in Caracas, which he says is looking cheap.
""After 15 years in a controlled economy, they've loosened the moorings, and we're not used to it yet,"" said Velutini, who likened the situation to the Soviet Union's perestroika. ""Venezuela is entering a cycle of liberal economic opening.""
Under Maduro's rule since 2013, Venezuela has become a deeply unequal society in which small pockets of flashy wealth in the capital and major cities contrast with deep poverty and chronic malnutrition driving a migration exodus.
Vollmer and Velutini say members of ""Optimists Anonymous"" have met U.S. authorities to discuss how Washington's sanctions have affected private sector businesses.
Those sanctions prevent U.S. firms from doing business with Venezuela's government and state-run companies, but do not explicitly block commerce between private companies.
Venezuelan businesses say that in practice, overzealous compliance of sanctions often hamstring their operations, and measures such as prohibiting direct flights between the two countries have boosted operating costs.
The State Department, in a response to questions, said the United States is using sanctions to support a ""transition to free and fair presidential elections.""
""U.S. sanctions on Maduro and his cronies have been targeted, while also ensuring that the flow of humanitarian goods and services to the Venezuelan people is not prohibited by U.S. sanctions,"" said a State Department spokesperson.
Share offerings, albeit a pittance compared to others internationally, could serve as a lifeline to Venezuelan companies that have been effectively cut off from bank financing. Inflation of 30,000 percent and government regulations left banks unwilling to provide even the most basic of loans.
The Caracas bourse was largely abandoned after late socialist leader Hugo Chavez in 2007 nationalized the two largest companies that traded on it, though the exchange stayed open with a trickle of business.
Firms would at times issue shares to existing shareholders as a way of paying dividends. Entrepreneurs hope to lobby the government so that they can sell shares in dollars.
Local finance industry experts consulted by Reuters said they believe there is demand for shares both within the Venezuelan business community and among Venezuelans abroad who see the economic situation changing.
""Negativity is like a virus that reached Venezuela, and we're the anti-body,"" said Velutini."
1418,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2020 07:44AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Banco do Brasil plans reforms after failed privatization bid - sources,"By Carolina Mandl and Marcela Ayres
SAO PAULO/BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian state-controlled bank Banco do Brasil SA (SA:BBAS3) is planning reforms to better compete with private rivals, after President Jair Bolsonaro quashed an attempt by management to fully privatize the lender, according to four people familiar with the matter.
The plan includes changing employment rules to make it easier for the bank to hire and fire staff and remove some pay restrictions, said these people, who declined to be identified because the plan is not public yet. 
They added the plan also calls for the bank to maintain its dividend payout ratio even as it expects asset sale proceeds to add to profits in the coming months, and form partnerships with financial technology and other startups.
The plan was approved by the bank's board late last year, two of the sources said. Portuguese-language paper Valor Economico reported on Thursday the bank's plan to form joint ventures with fintech startups, but the other details have not been previously reported.
The bank will still need to seek approvals from the government to move ahead. Some elements of the plan, such as weaker job protections, could prove to be politically tricky and face resistance from within the bank's nearly 94,000 workforce. The sources said the conversations with the Economy Ministry on job rules started last year and any changes are likely to apply to other listed state-controlled companies as well. However, the outcome of those discussions remains unclear.
Banco do Brasil declined to comment on the matter. 
The Economy Ministry denied that it was considering changing employment rules. But two ministry sources said discussions were ongoing. One of these sources described the talks as preliminary.
The bank's latest attempt at reforms underscores how the realities of Brazilian politics are slowing Bolsonaro's agenda. The right-wing populist, who became president in January 2019, raised investor expectations that he would reduce the role of the state in Latin America's largest economy. But he has fallen short on delivering on some of those promises.
Soon after taking over, his administration installed new management at Banco do Brasil, the country's second-largest bank with a market cap of $35 billion, and the bank initiated a series of divestitures.
Helio Magalhaes, who previously headed  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and  American Express  Co (N:AXP) in Brazil, was named chairman. Rubem Novaes, a University of Chicago-trained economist who had been an academic most of his career, was named chief executive.
The management argued in public and private that the government needed to give up its 50% stake in the lender for it to better compete against rivals such as Itau Unibanco Holding SA (SA:ITUB4), Banco Bradesco SA (SA:BBDC4) and  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) Brasil SA (SA:SANB3). They argued that the bank could rapidly fall behind such rivals if it was not quick to offer clients new products, upgrade technology and retain and hire talent.
Bolsonaro, however, rejected the idea. The bank believed that was in part because he would face opposition from members of congress whose constituents rely heavily on Banco do Brasil, one of the sources said. Banco do Brasil is often the only bank in rural and other underbanked regions.
Bolsonaro did not immediately comment on the matter. In December, the Brazilian president told journalists that discussions on the bank's privatization was a closed matter.
PLAN B
The latest proposal is Plan B, two of the sources said. 
One of the key pillars of the plan is to change how the bank hires and fires staff, and gain more flexibility in how much it is able to pay employees, the four sources said. 
Depending on how strategic the position is, the bank wants to be able to pay higher salaries to attract and retain talent without having to ask for permission from the Economy Ministry, the sources said.
The pay differences among senior managers could be substantial, a review of publicly available pay data shows. For example, top managers at Santander Brasil, on average, were paid more than four times what Banco do Brasil pays for similar roles. Lower level jobs, however, are paid more at Banco do Brasil.
While arguing for privatization, Novaes has said the bank lost 50 top executives to competitors in 2019 in part because they could not afford to pay those people as much as the private sector paid. 
If the government approves the change, it would also allow Banco do Brasil to reduce headcount faster through initiatives such as voluntary severance programs.
The workforce reforms, however, are likely to face resistance from public servants who are used to generous benefits and job protections.
In a private Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page for employees called ""BB Down-to-Earth Workers"", seen by Reuters, some staff complained about Novaes' privatization efforts and called for his resignation as they worried about its implications.
DIVIDENDS AND DEALS
Other parts of the reforms plan include a larger dividend payout in absolute terms as planned asset sales in the coming months boost profits, two of the sources said. 
The bank is planning to keep its payout ratio at 40%, the sources said.
A third element of the plan is to negotiate joint ventures and acquire minority stakes in startups, the four sources said.
Banco do Brasil wants to offer startups access to its wide network in Brazil - 37.3 million clients and more than 4,000 branches - in return for stakes in those companies, these sources said.
It will also continue to strike deals with big financial institutions, as it did last year when it announced a joint venture with UBS Group AG (S:UBSG) in investment banking. It is currently looking for a partner for its asset management unit.

LONDON (Reuters) - Insurance premiums to protect shops and offices in Chile from damage caused by protests have at least doubled, industry sources say, as insurers scramble to cover losses following last year's riots.
At least 27 people were killed during protests that began in October over a rise in transport fares and spiraled out of control.
The government estimated weeks of strikes, marches and damage to property and public transport cost the economy $3 billion, while the local subsidiary of Walmart (N:WMT) said 128 of its approximately 400 stores had been looted.
International insurers that focus on cover against attacks on property were surprised by the length of the protests in a country previously regarded as low risk.
Tim Davies, head of crisis management at Lloyd's of London insurer Canopius, said the firm had a strong presence in political violence insurance in Chile.
""Until eight or nine months ago, we would have bitten your hand off to write more.""
Insurers are now less enthusiastic, and sources, who asked not to be named, said some had withdrawn from the market.
Spanish insurer  Mapfre  (MC:MAP) said last month the riots, together with typhoons in Japan, would knock between 130 million and 140 million euros ($144-$155 million) from its results.
KBW analysts said the protests in Chile were likely to impact international insurers' fourth-quarter earnings.
The losses and reduction in providers have driven up rates.
Chris Kirby, head of political violence and terrorism at London insurer Optio, said even for businesses that had not made a claim and were not in the middle of a big city, ""rates will typically double"".
A London broker said rates had trebled, while Allianz (DE:ALVG) and Munich Re (DE:MUVGn) also said rates had risen significantly.
Insurers remain cautious ahead of a referendum on a new constitution in April, which they said could trigger more protests.
Physical damage because of political protests is typically covered by terrorism or political violence insurance policies that companies buy in addition to property policies. These are often insured or reinsured by Lloyd's of London and other London-based insurers.
Competition has lowered property rates globally in recent years and encouraged property insurers to offer protection against ""strikes, riots and civil commotion"" for no extra cost, particularly in countries regarded as stable.
That trend is reversing, with property insurers starting to exclude these events from their policies in Chile, as well in other countries where there have been protests, such as Colombia, insurers say.
Given Chile's upcoming referendum, ""it is likely we will need...12–24 months before the market calms down and gets back to normal,"" Steve Dalchow, executive director in crisis management at broker Gallagher, said.

1421,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2020 06:58AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Regulator probes board role in Credit Suisse spying scandal - sources,"By John O'Donnell and Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi
FRANKFURT/ZURICH (Reuters) - The  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) spying debacle risks tipping the bank into a crisis that could engulf its top executives.
Switzerland's market supervisor is scrutinizing Credit Suisse's oversight of chief executive Tidjane Thiam and his top lieutenants as part of a probe into corporate espionage, two people with direct knowledge of the investigation said.
FINMA is examining whether management control failures led to Switzerland's second-largest bank snooping on two former executives, they said.
Depending on the outcome of the investigation, FINMA could order Credit Suisse to overhaul its leadership, including requesting the resignation of any executive or board member if it concluded they failed to act in a 'fit and proper' manner, the people said.
They added that the probe was at an early stage and no conclusions had yet been drawn.
A spokesman for FINMA declined to comment. The watchdog said in December that it would appoint an independent auditor to help with its ongoing investigations into the compliance issues raised by the surveillance.
A spokesman for Credit Suisse said any suggestion that FINMA would focus on its senior management or its directors was speculation.
""Such speculation is unfounded and serves only to pre-judge the outcome of what is an audit and not an enforcement action,"" the spokesman said.
""FINMA will conduct an independent audit which is not an enforcement. The final decree has not yet been issued and an auditor has not been appointed.""
Credit Suisse has said Thiam was unaware of the surveillance and said former Chief Operating Officer Pierre-Olivier Bouee, a longtime confidant of Thiam, initiated it in a solo run.
Bouee resigned after taking responsibility for the spying, the bank said in October. He has not commented publicly on the scandal and Reuters could not reach him for comment.
FINMA's chairman, Thomas Bauer, has said that the use of external security companies is, ""not a supervisory issue per se"" but there were unanswered questions about governance and control arising from Credit Suisse's surveillance activities.
As part of the inquiry, FINMA is investigating whether the bank's board gave Thiam free rein to run a ""bank within a bank"", one of the people said.
Credit Suisse said the characterisation of a ""bank within a bank"" was ""absurd"".
""The Chairman and the Board of Directors have regular and open conversations with the CEO on his activities and the operations of the bank,"" the spokesman said.
""Credit Suisse is governed according to the highest international standards and to suggest otherwise is wholly incorrect.""
Credit Suisse could mount a legal challenge if FINMA orders it to take measures it disagrees with, a third person said.
Banks typically follow FINMA's direction. In 2018, for example, Raiffeisen, Switzerland's third-largest bank, completely overhauled its board after FINMA said it needed 'fresh blood' after finding serious breaches in its supervision of a former CEO.
But some of FINMA's decisions have been appealed, including last year when a court ruled it should reconsider its confiscation of 95 million Swiss francs from a small bank.
The stakes are high for both parties. Credit Suisse is battling competitive headwinds and FINMA is tasked with protecting the reputation of Switzerland's multi-trillion-dollar banking industry, the world's biggest center for offshore wealth.
""FINMA is under political pressure to investigate this case and corporate governance is under their remit,” said Peter V. Kunz, a legal expert at the University of Bern. ""But they will need to find illegal wrongdoing before they can remove the bank's management.""
A spokesman for Switzerland's finance ministry said FINMA was independent, declining further comment.
NOT AN ISOLATED EVENT
Credit Suisse has been under pressure since September when details emerged of a botched surveillance operation conducted by the bank against former wealth management chief Iqbal Khan, previously one of its most senior executives.
According to the bank's own probe of the spying, carried out by Homburger, a Swiss law firm, Bouee ordered the surveillance to see if Khan was trying to poach Credit Suisse colleagues to join him at UBS. 
Khan had left Credit Suisse for its crosstown rival over the summer. After the spying scandal broke, details of animosity between Thiam and Khan emerged in the local media. Khan had bought the house next door to Thiam and the pair quarreled over a construction project Khan was carrying out on his property, according to a person with direct knowledge.  
A lawyer for Khan declined to comment.
Homburger has said the relationship between Thiam and Khan was not part of its investigation and it found no evidence that the surveillance was related to their possible differences. It also said that it had access to only some private communications during the probe, while others were deleted.
The firm declined to comment further to Reuters about its investigation.
FINMA has said it will review the handling of information and the use of electronic communications as part of its review.
Following its internal probe, Thiam called the spying an isolated event and Chairman Urs Rohner said that staff surveillance was not ""part of our toolbox"".
Two months later, it emerged the bank had also spied on its former head of human resources, Peter Goerke, another longtime ally of Thiam.
Goerke couldn't be reached for comment.

Credit Suisse again publicly blamed Bouee and described a rogue operation in which all executives and directors, including Thiam, were kept in the dark. The bank said Bouee had been terminated for cause, which means his bonus and other potential compensation would be forfeited.

Investing.com - U.S. stock markets are set to open sharply lower Monday, as the pneumonia-like virus in China continues to spread despite the concerted efforts of local authorities, which threaten to put a big near-term damper on the Chinese economy.
At 6:55 AM ET (1155 GMT), futures for the S&P 500 traded 49 points, or 1.5%, lower, futures for the Nasdaq 180 points, or 2%, lower, while the Dow 30 futures contract fell 449 points, or 1.6%.
Markets in mainland China and Hong Kong were closed, while Japan’s Nikkei index closed 2% lower. In Europe, Germany’s DAX, the FTSE 100 in the U.K. and France’s CAC 40 all dropped more than 2%.
Losses have also been severe in the oil complex, as traders fret about the impact on demand for crude from China, the world’s largest importer.
By 6:55 AM ET (1155 GMT), U.S. crude futures had slumped 3.1% to $52.52 and the international benchmark Brent contract had fallen 3% to $58.09. 
The coronavirus outbreak in China has now killed 81 people and infected thousands and has already spread to more than 10 countries, including France, Australia and Singapore. The number of confirmed cases in the United States has risen to five.
The Chinese authorities have imposed travel restrictions, limited social gatherings and working hours and extended the Lunar New Year holidays nationally by three days to Feb. 2 to limit the spread of the virus.
“China’s health commission has said this morning that the epidemic is becoming more complicated to battle, said Peter Garnry, Head of Equity Strategy at Saxo Bank. “Our view is to respect the unknowns of viruses and that it comes with potential ugly nonlinearities.”
“From a tactical side traders should be on the short side in equities and the large gains from last year will likely be attempted to be locked in creating downside liquidity effects. For investors with a longer term view we believe reducing exposure somewhat or hedge market risk is a good precautionary step,” Garnry added.
That said, volumes could be limited Monday as the week ahead holds a number of key influences. 
Tech giants Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are all due to release their earnings this week for the final quarter of 2019, starting with Apple Tuesday.
The Federal Reserve is set to hold a rate-setting meeting this week, concluding on Wednesday. The central bank is widely expected to keep monetary policy on hold as policymakers continue to assess how the three rate cuts from 2019 are percolating through the economy.
Additionally, the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump continues. At the weekend, a New York Times report cited an unpublished manuscript from former national security adviser John Bolton saying Trump told him he wanted to freeze military aid to Ukraine - already approved by Congress - until its officials helped with investigations into the Biden family.
First-tier economic data are thin on the ground Monday, with December’s new home sales the main release, at 1000 AM ET (1500 GMT)."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lawyers in the extortion case of Michael Avenatti are expected on Monday to begin choosing jurors who will decide the fate of the celebrity lawyer and prominent critic of U.S. President Donald Trump.
Avenatti, 48, is charged with threatening to publicize accusations that  Nike  Inc (N:NKE) illegally paid families of college basketball recruits unless the sportswear company paid him and another lawyer $15 million to $25 million to conduct an internal probe.
He is also charged with defrauding his client Gary Franklin, who coached in the Nike Elite Youth Basketball League, by concealing a settlement offer made by Nike, and using the coach's accusations to extract riches for himself.
Nike has denied wrongdoing.
Avenatti has pleaded not guilty. He could face more than 40 years in prison if convicted.
Prospective jurors will fill out questionnaires on Monday and be questioned by lawyers on Tuesday.
Avenatti's trial before U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe in Manhattan federal court could last three weeks.
The charges announced last March, and separate criminal charges against Avenatti announced the same day by prosecutors in California, brought a sudden halt to Avenatti's roughly year-long ascendance from obscurity to a self-described ""high-profile nemesis"" of Trump.
Much of that stemmed from his representation of adult film actress Stormy Daniels in lawsuits against the president.
Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, received hush money before the 2016 election not to reveal her alleged sexual encounter with Trump, which he denies occurred.
Avenatti has said his tactics helped the government win a guilty plea from Michael Cohen, once Trump's personal lawyer and fixer, for campaign finance violations.
Jurors will be drawn from the Democratic strongholds of Manhattan and the Bronx.
Prosecutors do not want frequent mentions of the Republican president to politicize the trial, though Gardephe has acknowledged that Trump and Daniels will be mentioned.
Avenatti faces two other criminal trials this year.
Prosecutors in Manhattan have said Avenatti defrauded Daniels out of proceeds from a book contract, while prosecutors in California said he defrauded other clients and lied to the Internal Revenue Service and a bankruptcy court.
He has pleaded not guilty in both cases.
Avenatti was jailed and put in solitary confinement following his Jan. 14 arrest for an alleged bail violation in the California case."
1425,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2020 05:58AM ET</span>","India renews push to sell Air India, puts entire stake on the block","By Aftab Ahmed and Aditi Shah
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India said on Monday it plans to sell its entire interest in Air India Ltd, making a renewed push to sell the flag carrier after it drew no bids in an effort to auction a majority stake almost two years ago.
A document released on Monday showed March 17 as the deadline for submission of initial expressions of interest, and that any bidder must assume liabilities, including debt of 232.87 billion rupees ($3.28 billion).
Substantial ownership and effective control of the airline must remain with an Indian entity, the government added.
The potential sale of an airline kept aloft by a $4.2 billion 10-year bailout in 2012 comes as the government divests money-losing assets to manage the fiscal deficit.
The latest offer should garner significant response partly because it involves a clean exit by the government, said CAPA aviation consultancy India head Kapil Kaul.
""As the entire debt excluding aircraft debt is taken out of the deal, it signals a very determined effort to exit Air India, to allow taxpayers' funds be utilized for the government's social agenda,"" said Kaul.
Indian business house Hinduja Group and US-based fund Interups have expressed interest in buying the airline, the Business Standard daily said.
It quoted Laxmi Prasad, the chairman and chief business architect of Interups, as saying the fund had initiated talks with the government and would like to make a case for certain aspects of the airline's business to be included in the deal.
The government in 2018 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-air-india-divestment/air-india-sale-gets-no-bid-exposes-hurdles-for-modis-divestment-drive-idUSKCN1IW1HP tried to sell 76% of Air India and offload about $5.1 billion of its debt, with terms including the retention of all employees.
InterGlobe Aviation Ltd's (NS:INGL) IndiGo and Jet Airways Ltd (NS:JET) - which has since collapsed - initially showed interest, but opted out after the terms were disclosed.
Steel-to-autos conglomerate Tata Group, widely viewed as a potential suitor for Air India, also decided not to bid after deeming the terms too onerous, sources told Reuters at the time.
On Monday, civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri said the government was open to suggestions and altering some provisions if the changes helped to find a buyer.
""We have gone into this exercise, months of planning and preparation have gone into it and this is not the final, final. The bidders are going to get 45 days, they are going to come back to us. It is an interactive process,"" Puri told reporters.
""We are open to revising, refining and tweaking our views.""
A successful bidder would win control of Air India's 4,400 domestic and 1,800 international landing and parking slots at domestic airports, as well as 900 slots at airports overseas.
It would also get 100% of low-cost arm Air India Express and 50% of AISATS, which provides cargo and ground handling services at major Indian airports, the bid document showed.
The buyer would also have to provide 3% of the value of the airline's equity as stock options for permanent employees.
Air India has about 9,400 permanent employees and 3,600 fixed-term contract staff - including 1,850 pilots and 4,600 cabin crew - with benefits such as discounted air tickets and pensions.
Its employees protested against the 2018 sale attempt, and it was not immediately clear if they would also resist the latest effort. The government said it would provide details on safeguarding employee interests in its final bid document.
A spokesman for the employee union did not have immediate comment.
The government's divestment plan could also face opposition from within, with Subramanian Swamy, an MP from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), threatening legal action against the sale.
""This deal is wholly anti-national and I will (be) forced to go to court. We cannot sell our family silver,"" Swamy said on Twitter."

PARIS (Reuters) - French consulting and IT services provider Capgemini (PA:CAPP) succeeded in securing more than half of the capital of smaller rival Altran Technologies, the French market regulator AMF said on Monday, marking a win against U.S. activist fund Elliott.
The AMF said Capgemini holds 53.6% of Altran's share capital and at least 53.4% of the voting rights. The group - which faced a tussle with Altran shareholder Elliott over its offer price - had aimed to get the backing from just over half of Altran's investors to pursue its bid.
Earlier in January Capgemini had slightly raised the price of its friendly bid for Altran to 14.5 euros a share from 14 euros, valuing the company at 3.7 billion euros ($4.1 billion).
That move failed to convince Elliott, which has built up a stake of over 15% in Altran, to tender its shares to the group's offer, which closed on Jan. 22.
The AMF said Capgemini's offer would be reopened to other investors, though it did not give a fresh timeframe.
Capgemini is hoping the deal will add to its services in industries from telecoms to aerospace and help it slash costs.
Altran shares were up 1.4% after the results of Capgemini's offer were announced, a rare bright spot in a European stockmarket spooked by coronavirus fears."
1429,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 27, 2020 05:11AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Miners, Airlines, Luxury Routed as China Ramps up Virus Fight","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Markets were in risk-off mode all across the board on Monday, leaving few places to hide for most short-term players.
Losses everywhere were roughly proportionate to the degree of exposure to China, where a big – if arguably temporary – hit to key economic indicators seems inevitable after Beijing extended the week-long new year holidays by another three days.
Only two pockets of the equity markets escaped the carnage. One was gold miners, where price action was driven by a flood of money into Gold and gold-backed ETFs.
The other uncorrelated asset was Italian banks, which rose in sympathy with Italian bond prices after regional elections at the weekend ended in defeat for the right-wing populist alliance led by Matteo Salvini’s Lega party. The top five performing bank stocks in Europe were all Italian, with only Unicredit (MI:CRDI) drifting slightly into the red.   Intesa Sanpaolo   (MI:ISP) rose 0.6% while Banco Bpm (MI:BAMI) rose 0.8%.
The FTSE MIB as a result was the best performer in Europe, losing ‘only’ 1.1% by 5 AM ET (1000 GMT). The benchmark Stoxx 600 fell 1.8% to 416.12, while the resource-heavy FTSE 100 underperformed with a 2.2% drop, as traders priced in three days of shuttered factories and untold disruptions to fuel demand.
The major producers of iron ore and copper -   Anglo American   (LON:AAL),   Rio Tinto   (LON:RIO), BHP Billiton (LON:BHPB),   Glencore   (LON:GLEN) and   Antofagasta   (LON:ANTO), all fell by between 4% and 5%.
Three more days of shuttered shopping malls, movie theaters and theme parks can’t help but hit retail sales (Bloomberg reported earlier that tourist arrivals in Macau, the country’s gambling capital, were down 80% year-on-year), and the shares of luxury goods makers, with their traditionally heavy dependence on the region, suffered accordingly. 
By 5 AM ET,   Hermes International   (PA:HRMS) stock was down 4.2%, LVMH (PA:LVMH) stock was down 3.5% and Gucci owner   Kering   (PA:PRTP) stock was down 3.9%.   Burberry   (LON:BRBY) stock fell 4.3%.   Hugo Boss   (DE:BOSSn) stock fell 4.1%, giving up most of last week’s bounce, but   Remy Cointreau   (PA:RCOP) stock fell another 3.2% even after a 10% drop on Friday, when it reported disappointed sales and suspended its guidance.
Airlines, too, continued to feel the pain, as reports of confirmed cases of coronavirus in France raised the risk that the public will shun flying even within Europe. Short-haul specialists Ryanair, EasyJet and Wizz Air have all outperformed the sector in the last week, partly because the ongoing collapse in fuel prices makes more of a difference to their margins than to those of long-haul flyers such as International Airlines Group (LON:ICAG) and Air France KLM (PA:AIRF). 
IAG (LON:ICAG) was the worst performer in the sector again on Monday, falling 6.1%, but EasyJet (LON:EZJ) was also shaken, losing 5.0%. Ryanair (LON:RYA) and Wizz Air (LON:WIZZ) kept their losses to a more modest 2.7% and 2.8%, respectively."

Investing.com - European stock markets traded strongly lower Monday, in a broad risk off move on the back of the sharp escalation of Chinese measures to curtail the spread of the deadly coronavirus.

At 04:15 ET (0915 GMT), the U.K.'s FTSE index was trading 142 points, or 1.9%, lower, France's CAC 40 was 107 points, or 1.8%, lower, while the DAX dropped 223 points, or 1.7%. The Italian FTSE MIB index dropped a relatively light 0.7%, outperforming after political developments over the weekend. The Euro Stoxx 50 index fell 30 points, 0.8%.
Markets in mainland China and Hong Kong are shut, but Japan’s Nikkei 225 closed 2% lower and Brent crude futures continued to tumble, hitting their lowest level since October as traders priced in the hit to Chinese demand.
U.S. crude futures traded 3.1% lower at $52.51 and the international benchmark Brent contract fell 3% to $58.10. Gold, by contrast, rallied, with futures for February delivery on New York’s COMEX were up 0.6% at $1,580.55.
""According to recent clinical information, the virus's ability to spread seems to be getting somewhat stronger,"" China's National Health Commission Minister Ma Xiaowei said at a press briefing Sunday, adding that it is infectious in its incubation period, i.e. before symptoms show, making it harder to contain.
Nearly 2,000 people in China had been infected and 56 killed by the disease, Ma said Sunday, although Reuters reported later that the death toll has since increased to 80 and the number of confirmed cases to 2,744. Over the last week, both numbers have been rising at close to 50% a day.
“China has extended its New Year's holiday until 2 February in efforts to curb the virus and airports around the world have stepped up screening of passengers from China,” said analyst Bjorn Tangaa Sillemann at Danske Bank, in a research note.
“However, with about 5 million residents leaving the city of Wuhan (where the virus originates) before the government shutdown of the city on Thursday, the job of containing the epidemic seems considerable,” he added.
There have also been gains in sovereign bonds, and in particular in Italy after nationalist leader Matteo Salvini suffered a setback in his attempt to return to power when his party’s candidate disappointed in a regional election Sunday.
The yield on the 10-yr benchmark Italian government bond dropped 17 basis points, while the spread between the 10-yr BTP and the 10-yr Bund fell 17 bps.
Turning back to the European equity markets, it’s the sectors which are strongly exposed to the Asian consumer which are hardest hit Monday. 

In the luxury sector, Burberry dropped 5.3%, LVMH fell 3.7% and Gucci owner   Kering   (PA:PRTP) fell 4.1%, while in airlines, Lufthansa fell 4.5% and IAG (LON:ICAG), the parent company of British Airways, fell 5.2%. 

The one bright spot is the Italian banking sector, helped by the results of regional elections in Emilia Romagna over the weekend, where Matteo Salvini's Lega party failed to take control of the government from the ruling center-left Democratic Party and its allies.
The release of the German Ifo index also disappointed Monday, with the business climate indicator dropping back top 95.9 from 96.3 in December. An improvement had been expected after the gains in the ZEW and the PMI for the month.
Aside from worries over the impact of the virus in Asia, fresh economic data are thin on the ground in Europe Monday while the two-day meeting of the Federal Reserve that ends on Wednesday coupled with the Bank of England's meeting on Thursday could keep a lid on activity.

Turning to corporate earnings, most eyes will be on the U.S. this week as tech giants Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) all report their financial results for the final quarter of 2019."

ZURICH (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker AbbVie's (N:ABBV) $63 billion tie-up with Allergan (N:AGN) is getting help from Nestle (S:NESN) and AstraZeneca (L:AZN) buying up products the Irish-domiciled company is shedding to placate regulators.
AbbVie is swallowing Allergan to give it control of the lucrative wrinkle treatment Botox and to diversify a portfolio heavily dependent on its $19-billion-per-year arthritis drug Humira, the world's best-selling medicine that is advancing toward U.S. patent expiration.
Swiss food group Nestle bulked up its medical nutrition business with Allergan's Zenpep, a product with 2018 sales of $237 million which treats people whose pancreases do not provide enough enzymes to digest fats, proteins and sugars.
Nestle did not give financial details, but analysts from Zuercher Kantonalbank estimated the takeover could have cost the Vevey, Switzerland-based company more than $1 billion.
Meanwhile, AstraZeneca is regaining rights to brazikumab, Allergan's experimental drug against Crohn's Disease and ulcerative colitis. The European Commission said this month the immunology medicine must be divested because of the risk its development would be halted after AbbVie's takeover because of competing medicines.
""These definitive agreements represent significant progress toward the completion of our acquisition of Allergan,"" Richard Gonzalez, AbbVie's chairman and chief executive, said.
With regulators wary of the deal's anti-competitive potential, rivals are getting a chance to stock their own product shelves.
Nestle Chief Executive Mark Schneider, who also gets Allergan's Viokace, another pancreatic enzyme product, in Monday's deal, is bulking up on nutrition products that combine properties of medicine and food as the Swiss company expands in areas where growth may outpace its mainstream food business.
""This is a significant opportunity for our business in the United States,"" Greg Behar, head of Nestle Health Science, said in a statement. 
AstraZeneca's pact for brazikumab marks a return of the inflammation medicine to the British drugmaker's portfolio. In 2016, Astra had struck a licensing deal with Allergan worth up to $1.5 billion for the medicine.
With its return to AstraZeneca, Allergan has agreed to fund development costs for brazikumab in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, including the creation of a companion diagnostic, AstraZeneca said in a separate statement.
""This agreement creates an opportunity for us to complete the full development program and bring this potential new treatment option to patients as quickly as possible,"" Mene Pangalos, Astra's biopharmaceuticals research head.
Even if Allergan must foot the development bill, analysts appeared underwhelmed, in part because AbbVie's Skyrizi, or risankizumab, a similar medicine, has a head start.

""This could be another autoimmune product to add to Astra's portfolio, although it will be somewhat late to the market,"" Liberum's Alistair Campbell wrote in a note to investors.

LONDON (Reuters) - World shares fell to their lowest in two weeks on Monday as worries grew about the economic impact of China's spreading coronavirus with demand spiking for safe-haven assets such as Japanese yen and Treasury notes.
The death toll from the coronavirus outbreak in China rose to 81 and the virus spread to more than 10 countries, including France, Japan and the United States. Some health experts questioned whether China can contain the epidemic.
The MSCI All-Country World Index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares across 47 countries, was down 0.42% to its lowest since Jan. 13.
In Europe, stock markets slumped at the start of trading, tracking their counterparts in Asia. The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 1.4% to its lowest level since Jan. 14. (EU)
Shares of mining companies (SXPP) slumped 3.1%, dragged down by their exposure to China, the biggest decline among the major European subsectors.
""The coronavirus is an economic and financial shock. The extent of that shock still needs to be assessed, but it could provide the spark for an arguably long-overdue adjustment in the capital markets,"" Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Securities, told clients. 
In Asia, Japan's Nikkei average (N225) slid 2.0%, the biggest one-day fall in five months. A Tokyo-listed China proxy, ChinaAMC CSI 300 index ETF (T:1575), fell 2.2%. Many markets in Asia were closed for the lunar new year holiday.
U.S. S&P 500 mini futures (ESc1) were last down 0.9%, after falling 1.3% in early Asian trade.
The ability of the coronavirus to spread is getting stronger and infections could continue to rise, China's National Health Commission said on Sunday. Nearly 2,800 people globally have been infected and 81 in China killed by the disease.
China announced it will extend the week-long new year holiday by three days to Feb. 2 and schools will return from their break later than usual. Chinese-ruled Hong Kong said it would ban entry to people who have visited Hubei province in the past 14 days.
""With most Asian markets closed, fast-money investors are buying risk-off hedges like Treasuries and selling the Nikkei,"" said Masahiko Loo, portfolio manager at Alliance Bernstein.
""I think this would continue this week, until China markets resume trading next week and the coronavirus outbreak subsides.""
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) was off 0.45%, although markets in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore and Australia were closed on Monday.
All three major Wall Street indexes closed on Friday, with the S&P 500 seeing its biggest one-day percentage drop in over three months.
The S&P 500 (SPX) lost 0.9%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) 0.6% and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) 0.9% after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed a second case of the virus on U.S. soil.
U.S. Treasury prices advanced, pushing down yields. The benchmark 10-year note's (US10YT=RR) yield fell to a three-and-half-month trough of 1.627%.
Elsewhere in bonds, the Italian 10-year yield fell to a three-month low Monday after right-wing leader Matteo Salvini failed in his bid to overturn decades of leftist rule in the northern region of Emilia-Romagna on Sunday. [GVD/EUR]
In the currency market, the Japanese yen strengthened as much as 0.5% to 108.73 yen per dollar , its two-and-a-half-week high. 
The euro (EUR=) last stood at $1.1031 to the dollar, up from its eight-week low of $1.1019 on Friday. 
The offshore yuan  dropped more than 0.5% to 6.9776 against the dollar, its weakest since Jan. 6.
The coronavirus outbreak also pressured oil and other commodity prices.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures (CLc1) plummeted 3.8% to a three-and-a-half-month low of $52.15. Brent (LCOc1) shed more than 3% to a three-month low of $58.68 per barrel. [O/R]
""Investors will react quickly to any sign of negativity and this is no exception as China announces that the issue has become an emergency. This could keep oil prices fragile until the coronavirus shows signs of slowing down,"" said Mihir Kapadia, chief executive at Sun Global Investments.

Spot gold  rose as much as 1.0% to $1,585.80 per ounce, the highest level since Jan. 8, as the coronavirus outbreak pushed up demand for the safe-haven metal. (GOL)

The U.S. company had said in planning documents that the factory would need 372 cubic meters of water from the public drinking water network per hour, sparking protests by local residents earlier this month.
""Sounds like we need to clear up a few things! Tesla won't use this much net water on a daily basis. It's possibly a rare peak usage case, but not an everyday event"", Musk said on Twitter on Saturday.
On another environmental issue, Musk tweeted that only a small part of the forest on the property that Tesla bought in the outskirts of Berlin will be cut to construct the planned factory.
""Also, this is not a natural forest -- it was planted for use as cardboard,"" he said.
The U.S. carmaker announced plans last November to build its first European car factory in Gruenheide, in the eastern state of Brandenburg.
Politicians, unions and industry groups have welcomed the move, saying it will bring jobs to the region, but environmental groups have aired concerns and a Brandenburg water association warned against ""extensive and serious problems with the drinking water supply and wastewater disposal"" for the proposed factory.

PARIS (Reuters) - Renault's (PA:RENA) engineering boss will meet his counterpart at Nissan (T:7201) in Japan this week, two sources close to  Renault  said, as the carmakers seek to revive projects crucial to an alliance left reeling by the Carlos Ghosn affair.
The Franco-Japanese alliance is wrestling with the fallout of the ouster and arrest of Ghosn, the architect of the partnership who now says it is at risk of collapse.
Analysts say that in order to turn investor sentiment around, the firms need to make good on cost-saving joint engineering projects that have slowed since Ghosn's departure.
According to the two sources, Gilles Le Borgne, who was hired on Jan. 6 from rival automaker PSA (PA:PEUP), will meet Nissan's Tsuyoshi Yamaguchi, the Nissan executive in charge of delivering the joint engineering projects.
Renault did not respond to a request for comment on Le Borgne's meetings.
Renault-Nissan's cost-saving alliance is vital to both companies as the car industry battles a slowdown and huge investments in cleaner vehicles and automated driving.
""The alliance has taken a hit, but the alliance engineering team is still there,"" said a third source, who is close to the alliance. ""You cannot, from one day to the next, stop something that's been embedded so deeply.""
Japanese prosecutors arrested Ghosn -- who was at the time the head of the carmakers' alliance -- in November 2018 and accused him of financial misconduct.
Ghosn slipped out of Japan and fled at the end of December to Lebanon. He says the charges were fabricated to force him out of an alliance in which the Japanese side no longer trusted its French partners.
FOCUS ON JOINT PROJECTS
Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard has said both sides are determined to make the partnership succeed, with the joint projects a major focus.
Those projects will be on the agenda when the board of the alliance, which also includes Japanese carmaker Mitsubishi (T:7211), holds a regular meeting in Japan on Jan. 30.
One area of focus will be hybrid power systems, a field where, analysts say, the alliance has not effectively pooled its research and development efforts. Each of the three members of the alliance has developed their own systems.
""That's been among the sources of the friction,"" said the third source close to the alliance. ""But now the three systems are there, we'll need to use them in the most efficient way possible.""
Nissan will use the E-Tech hybrid system developed by Renault on its Juke small SUV, while Renault will use the Nissan-developed e-Power system on its Kadjar model, particularly in Asia, according to the same sources.
Mitsubishi is still using its own hybrid system on its best-selling Outlander."

MILL VALLEY, California (Reuters) - Electric vehicle startup Rivian on Saturday displayed its pickup truck and SUV at an event in San Francisco's Bay Area and said that when their prices are unveiled soon they will be lower than has been previously announced.
Rivian founder and chief executive R.J. Scaringe told Reuters the mid-range R1T pickup truck with a glass sky panel that can change from blue to clear was about $69,000. It can travel 300 miles on a full charge. A similar range R1S SUV will sell for about $72,000.
Rivian said the large battery could go 400 miles and the smallest could go 230 miles.
Scaringe declined to say how many prospective buyers have so far spent $1,000 on a refundable deposit to hold their spot for a Rivian, but he said the reaction had been ""really positive"".
""So we're excited by that. But we now have the challenge of a lot of pre-order customers aren't going to get the cars as fast as they like because there's such a long queue,"" he said.
Rivian, founded in 2009, made waves when it unveiled its first prototype model at the LA Auto Show in 2018. It has raised $3.6 billion and counts Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and  Ford Motor Co . (N:F) as investors.
Many customers at the event were excited about the designs, but Patrick Bonsi, who flew from New Jersey to see the vehicles, questioned whether Rivian would have a Tesla Supercharger-like charging network. He owns a Tesla (O:TSLA) Model 3.
""What I found with super charging is, if the Supercharger network is not made by the car company, it doesn't charge the car as fast,"" said Bonsi.
Scaringe said Rivian was working on rolling out a network of charging stations at key locations such as national parks, but that the vehicles can charge on most charging networks available today. 
Brian Gase, Rivian chief engineer of special projects, and employee number four was busy showing customers the batteries, saying 7,776 of them were powering the pickup truck, and one was powering a flashlight that slides into the door, giving the car a lucky 7,777 batteries. 

The first R1T trucks will be delivered starting at the end of this year, followed shortly after by the R1S SUVs, Scaringe said.

SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co successfully completed on Saturday the maiden flight of the world's largest twin-engined jetliner as the embattled planemaker steps up competition with European rival Airbus in a respite from a crisis over its smaller 737 MAX. 
The 777X, a larger and more efficient version of Boeing's successful 777 mini-jumbo, took off outside Seattle at 10:09 a.m. local time (1809 GMT) and landed at 2:00 p.m. (2200 GMT). Two earlier attempts were called off this week due to high winds.
Boeing officials said the maiden voyage would herald months of testing and certification before the aircraft enters service with Emirates in 2021, a year later than originally scheduled because of snags during development.
The aircraft is the larger of two versions planned by Boeing and will officially be known as the 777-9, but is better known under its development codename, the 777X.
Its most visible features include folding wingtips - designed to allow its large new carbon-composite wings to fit into the same parking bays as earlier models - and the world's largest commercial engines, built by  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) and wide enough to swallow the fuselage of a 737 MAX.
The successful flight was a boost for Boeing as it grapples with a broadening crisis over the 737 MAX, which has been grounded since March following two fatal crashes.
""To me this is the flagship for the big airlines around the world ... it represents the great things we can do as a company,"" 777X marketing director Wendy Sowers told reporters when asked about the flight's importance in light of the MAX crisis.
Boeing says it has sold 309 of the aircraft – worth more than $442 million each at list prices – but analysts have questioned its heavy reliance on Middle East carriers that have scaled back purchases as they suffer a pause in their expansion.
The 777X will compete with the recently introduced Airbus A350-1000 which seats about 360 passengers. Both reflect the growing range and efficiency of twin-engined jets that are steadily displacing their older four-engined counterparts.

The two planemakers have clashed over the relative efficiency of their latest jets but both face worries about demand due to overcapacity and signs of weakness in the global economy.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The EU plans to adopt more protectionist antitrust rules and encourage businesses to share data as part of an industrial policy overhaul aimed at giving European companies a sharper edge in global markets, a strategy document seen by Reuters shows.
Drafted by the European Commission and set to be unveiled in March, the strategy also includes the more aggressive use of trade defense instruments against companies deemed to be benefiting unfairly from foreign subsidies.
""Our vision is not about shielding uncompetitive industries or encouraging protectionist policies ... At the same time, the EU cannot be complacent about third countries or companies undermining fair competition in the single market on global markets,"" the document said.
""This strategy sets the contours of a new and assertive industrial policy what will enable the EU to remain a global economic power,"" it added.
Numerous EU countries and companies have called for Brussels to adopt a more ambitious and strategic industrial policy, complaining that others are able to take advantage of Europe's open markets without being subjected to the same rules.
That argument was cited by German conglomerate  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) and French rival  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) in their failed bid to gain EU antitrust approval to create a European rail champion last year.
Under the new policy blueprint, the Commission will evaluate and review EU competition rules to ensure that they are fit for purpose and contribute to a strong European industry at home and in the world.
In light of the growing data economy, the new policy envisions setting up a legal framework to facilitate the use, access to and sharing of data in a push to get companies to embrace artificial intelligence and blockchain technology.
It will also promote more ""Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEI)"", building on the success of an 8-billion-euro battery project involving seven EU countries and 17 European companies approved last year.
Such alliances are foreseen in clean hydrogen technologies and low-carbon industries as well as in microelectronics, the paper said.
The new strategy warns foreign governments against unfairly shoring up their companies while restricting access to their markets, with the EU ready to use existing tools or create new ones if necessary, and also reinforcing customs controls.
""The EU will mobilize all relevant tools including rule-making, standards, international financial instruments, trade agreements, public procurement and intellectual property rights to leverage its strengths and advantages,"" the document said."

(Reuters) - The husband-and-wife owners of DC Solar, a California solar company that caused Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) to take a $377 million charge last year, pleaded guilty on Friday to involvement in an estimated $912 million Ponzi scheme.
Jeff Carpoff, 49, pleaded guilty to money laundering and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, while Paulette Carpoff, 46, pleaded guilty to money laundering and conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States.
They entered their pleas in federal court in Sacramento, California. Jeff Carpoff faces up to 30 years in prison and Paulette Carpoff up to 15 years at their May 19 sentencing.
Prosecutors called the criminal fraud scheme the largest in the Eastern District of California, which includes Sacramento.
They said that from 2011 to 2018, DC Solar entered $2.5 billion of transactions to sell mobile solar generators meant to provide emergency power to cellphone towers and lighting at sports events, attracting investors with associated federal tax credits.
But according to prosecutors, about half of the 17,000 generators did not exist, and the Benicia, California-based company used false financial statements and lease contracts to conceal the fraud.
Authorities said the Carpoffs siphoned money to fund a lavish lifestyle including dozens of properties and vacation homes, a Nascar sponsorship, a stake in a private jet service, a holiday party featuring the rapper Pitbull, and at least 150 cars.
Malcolm Segal, a lawyer for Jeff Carpoff, said in an interview that his client ""feels terrible that this business started out intending to provide clean energy and tax benefits to many large corporations, but unfortunately failed and resulted in his committing a number of illegal acts.""
Paulette Carpoff's lawyer Bill Portanova said in an interview: ""She regrets absolutely what she did, and is looking forward to the difficult job of making amends.""
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed related civil charges against the couple.
Authorities said more than $120 million has already been forfeited from the scheme, including a 1978 Pontiac Firebird once owned by the actor Burt Reynolds.
Last May, Berkshire said it had taken the $377 million charge in the prior quarter, after concluding that tax benefits it had accepted concerning investments in tax equity investment funds from 2015 to 2018 were ""not valid.""
Buffett's assistant confirmed at the time that the charge related to DC Solar.

Last February, DC Solar filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Reno, Nevada.

Fiat Chrysler's motion to dismiss GM's civil racketeering lawsuit was expected. The company has said GM's lawsuit is baseless and aimed at disrupting the Italian-American automaker's proposed merger with France's  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP). 
GM general counsel Craig Glidden told reporters in November the FCA-PSA merger had nothing to do with GM's legal action. 
Fiat Chrysler's arguments were filed on Friday evening in U.S. District Court in Detroit.
In response, GM said it remained confident in the legal underpinnings of its case and will respond in court.
""We are confident in the legal and factual underpinnings of our case, which have already been documented in part through the guilty pleas and admissions of FCA executives made in connection with the government's ongoing criminal investigation"", GM said in a statement.
GM sued Fiat Chrysler in November charging its rival with bribing officials of the United Auto Workers union in order to gain advantages in 2009 and 2015 labor contracts and have the UAW withhold those terms from GM. Fiat Chrysler's now deceased Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne sat ""at the center"" of the schemes, GM charged in its lawsuit. 
In its response Friday, Fiat Chrysler rejected GM's claim that Marchionne tried to force a merger between GM and FCA by agreeing to labor contracts that favored the UAW.
GM failed to show ""why Mr. Marchionne would want to saddle FCA and GM with unfavorable CBAs (collective bargaining agreements) if his ultimate goal was to run the merged company (presumably on a profitable basis)."" 
GM's accusations relied in part on revelations from an active federal criminal investigation of corruption within the UAW. That investigation began at Fiat Chrysler but has since spread to past and present UAW officials at GM.
In its motion on Friday, Fiat Chrysler said GM's lawsuit was ""fatally flawed"" for several reasons. 
The lawsuit was filed after a four-year statute of limitations had expired, Fiat Chrysler argued. GM is not a direct victim of wrongdoing by FCA executives or UAW officials related to labor contracts, and so cannot bring a RICO action, FCA argued in its motion. 
The UAW is such a large organization, ""the notion that FCA seized control of the UAW by virtue of the alleged prohibited payments is implausible on its face,"" the FCA brief stated. 

Further, Fiat Chrysler argued that GM's allegations about corrupt contract negotiations should be heard by the National Labor Relations Board, not by a federal court.

Investing.com- The Dow Jones ended the session in the red Friday, although off its lows, and it was helped in a big way by Boeing (NYSE:BA).
Shares of Boeing (NYSE:BA) rose $5.26, or 1.7%, to $323.05.
The rise of more than $5 is significant as, unlike other indices, the Dow calculated on the dollar amount of its components’ moves.
The rise in Boeing (NYSE:BA) helped the blue-chip index by a little more than 35.7 points. The Dow ended the day down a little more than 170 points, or about 0.6%.
The fate of Boeing’s shares has been dictated by the timeline on when its 737 Max jet will receive regulatory approval to fly again after two fatal crashes last year.
The problem has seen off the CEO of Boeing (NYSE:BA) and brought out embarrassing headlines of how the company handled the design and manufacturing process of the plane.
Today shares bounced as the FAA said it could clear the 737 Max to fly again before mid-year, a timeline recently given by Boeing (NYSE:BA) that send shares down.
FAA administrator Steve Dickson said if there are no new problems the plane could be flying again before the outside date of mid-year, CNBC reported, citing a person familiar with the matter."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The former top U.S. military official, General Joseph Dunford, has been elected to the board of  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT), the Pentagon's largest weapons supplier, the company said on Friday.
Dunford, who served as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 2015 to 2019, will join the board of the F-35 fighter jet maker on Feb. 10. He left the Pentagon last year.
Critics of U.S. military spending have long complained of a revolving door between Pentagon leadership and the defense industry. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper was a lobbyist for missile maker Raytheon (N:RTN) before taking the job last year and his predecessor Patrick Shanahan was an executive at Boeing (N:BA).
""His experience in complex, global operations and risk management, including cybersecurity threats, is a tremendous asset and will enhance board oversight in key business areas,"" Marillyn Hewson, chairman, president and CEO of Lockheed Martin said in a statement.
Before serving as principal military adviser to the president, secretary of defense, and U.S. National Security Council starting in 2015, Dunford was the commandant of the Marine Corps.
Dunford commanded the 5th Marine Regiment during Operation Iraqi Freedom and had also served as the commander of all U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan.
Lockheed, based in Bethesda, Maryland, will expand its board to 12 members in order to include Dunford. It can increase its board to up to 14 members according to the company's bylaws.
The former top officer will serve on the company's classified business and security committee as well as corporate governance.
Dunford, a Marine, has a master's degree in government from Georgetown University and in international relations from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.
Former energy executive Debra Reed-Klages joined Lockheed's board in November. The company is due to announce its fourth quarter and year end financial results on Tuesday."
1453,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2020 05:27PM ET</span>","U.S. bank regulator sharpens teeth on Wells Fargo, surprising critics","By Pete Schroeder and Chris Prentice
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Long accused of being too soft, a U.S. bank regulator has surprised its critics with tough treatment of scandal-ridden lender  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), culminating on Thursday in more than$58 million in fines against eight former executives at the bank.
Consumer groups had worried that the Trump administration's pick to lead the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Joseph Otting, would do little to change its reputation for leniency. A former chief executive of California's OneWest Bank, Otting as comptroller has referred to lenders as his ""customers"" and pursued rule changes pushed for by bank lobbyists.
But when it comes to Wells Fargo's sales practices, Otting has consistently been a harsh critic, driving penalties against the bank which have broken new ground. One person with knowledge of the matter said Wells Fargo's failure to swiftly fix systemic misconduct has angered Otting, precisely because he spent decades as a banker and felt he was held to high standards. 
""You would get far more significant penalties from someone who has been in the business and is disappointed in what Wells Fargo has done,"" said Thomas Vartanian, a law professor at George Mason University and former OCC official. 
On Thursday, the OCC banned former Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf from the banking industry and fined him $17.5 million to settle charges he failed to put a stop to sales misconduct - the most it has ever secured from an individual. Among other former executives charged was retail banking head Carrie Tolstedt, who has not yet settled and is potentially facing a whopping $25 million penalty.
After watchdogs including the OCC failed to charge senior Wall Street executives for their role in the 2007-2009 financial crisis, lawmakers have pressed them to hold more individuals responsible for corporate wrongdoing. Proving personal culpability, though, is legally tough, which makes Thursday's charges all the more striking.
“The OCC actions are eye-popping in terms of the number and seniority of the individuals charged,"" said Erik Gerding, a law professor at the University of Colorado, adding there had not been such a high profile executive crackdown in recent memory.
Arthur Wilmarth, a law professor at George Washington University, said he was ""surprised"" the OCC had pursued such drastic charges. ""It's fair to say they've always been viewed as probably the most bank-friendly regulator,"" he added.
On Thursday, Otting said in a statement that the charges ""reinforce the agency's expectations that management and employees ... provide fair access to financial services, treat customers fairly and comply with applicable laws.""
""LOW BAR""
In addition to Thursday's charges, the OCC fined Wells Fargo $500 million in 2018 for product mis-selling, only the second time it has dished out a penalty of that size. 
That settlement requires the bank to make extensive fixes and to repay harmed customers, an effort the OCC has been monitoring closely. It also imposed novel restrictions on the bank by giving the OCC the right to remove current executives and to vet new ones. 
Otting's frustration with Wells Fargo's slow progress on its remediation effort was laid bare in March last year. Then-CEO Tim Sloan had just finished telling Congress the bank was back on track, when the OCC responded with a rare public rebuke saying it continued to be ""disappointed"" in the bank. 
The comptroller's public loss of confidence in Sloan contributed to his abrupt departure later that month, Reuters reported at the time.
Wells Fargo has said repeatedly it was making every effort to fix its problems. On Thursday, the bank's new CEO Charlie Scharf said in a statement Wells Fargo had made ""fundamental changes to its business model, compensation programs, leadership, and governance.""
By being strict with Wells Fargo, the OCC may also be trying to shed its image as a soft touch, said Wilmarth.
""You hammer this one bank and its executives ... and when people accuse you of being bank-friendly, you say, 'Look how tough we were on Wells Fargo!'"" he added.
The OCC was lambasted for missing signs of the brewing financial crisis and was again criticized for failing to catch Wells Fargo's problems in the first place. An internal OCC review found its examiners failed to follow-up on red flags, including hundreds of whistleblower complaints. 
While Otting is personally aggrieved by the bank's lapses, he has also been under pressure from lawmakers to take a tough line. The pressure has come particularly from progressive U.S. senator and Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, who has voiced sometimes stinging skepticism of the agency. 

""No one has been tougher on Wells Fargo than myself,"" Otting told Warren when defending his record before Congress in May. ""At the OCC?"" Warren replied. ""That's a low bar.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Glenn Dubin, who made a fortune building and managing hedge funds, is retiring from the industry after 40 years to focus on private investments, the billionaire investor said. 
Dubin, 62, will turn over management and his equity stake in Engineers Gate LP, the quantitative hedge fund firm he founded in 2014, at the end of January, he told Reuters in an interview on Thursday.
Engineers Gate President Greg Eisner will take over as chief executive and chair the investment committee. Dubin said Eisner already ran most day-to-day operations of the approximately $1 billion firm.
The firm hopes to increase its assets to as much as $2 billion despite profits cut by the high fees of building the high-tech business, according to a person familiar with the situation. Engineers Gate’s annualized gains of about 13% over the last four years come out to about 5% for clients, net of fees, the person said.
Dubin's exit adds him to a growing list of prominent managers who have stepped back from running hedge funds, including Louis Bacon, John Griffin, Stephen Mandel and Leon Cooperman, at a time of increasing pressure from clients and muted industry returns. 
Dubin said he plans to focus on direct investing--as opposed to passive stakes in hedge funds--through his family office, Dubin & Co. 
He is also on the boards of The Robin Hood Foundation, The Museum of Modern Art and Mount Sinai Health System, in addition to the executive committee of the Harvard Kennedy School.
""I want to be active, I want to be on boards, I want to be invested in operating companies,"" Dubin said. 
Engineers Gate, based in New York and named after an entrance to Central Park, launched with $100 million from Dubin. The firm started with four portfolio managers and now has 14, among 90 other employees.
He said the decision to leave Engineers Gate had nothing to do with media attention related to his old association with Jeffrey Epstein, the late U.S. financier charged with trafficking underage girls.
Dubin told Reuters that news coverage of his and his wife Eva Andersson-Dubin’s relationship with Epstein and related allegations by Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre https://www.reuters.com/article/us-people-jeffrey-epstein-documents/jeffrey-epstein-accuser-links-powerful-men-to-financier-civil-court-filing-idUSKCN1UZ27X had been ""false"" and upsetting but that he was encouraged by loyal friends who showed support. 
The son of a New York City taxi driver and a first-generation college graduate, Dubin partnered with childhood friend Henry Swieca in 1992 to form Highbridge Capital Management, which became one of the largest and best-known hedge fund firms.
In 2004, the pair sold a majority stake to JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM). Dubin left Highbridge in 2013, when it controlled approximately $35 billion.
Dubin said he was proud of his time in the investment industry but had long planned to step back, especially with the growth of Engineers Gate and his youngest child leaving home for college.

""It’s bittersweet,"" Dubin said by telephone. ""I’ve had a phenomenal career.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The  Habit Restaurants Inc  (O:HABT), known as the Habit Burger Grill, plans to put a plant-based meat patty from Impossible Foods Inc on its menu in the second half of this year as a limited-time offering.
The agreement would put a third plant-based meat producer on the map among YUM! Brands Inc (N:YUM) restaurants. Yum said earlier this month that it would acquire Habit, a California-based burger chain with over 280 stores nationwide, for about $375 million.
Habit would join Yum brands KFC and Pizza Hut, which ran short tests last year of plant-based chicken nuggets from  Beyond Meat Inc  (O:BYND) and a plant-based sausage topping called Incogmeato from Kellogg Co's (N:K) Morningstar Farms, respectively.
""In probably the second half of the year, we'll do a system-wide (limited time offering) with Impossible,"" Habit Chief Executive Office Russ Bendel told Reuters in a phone interview on Friday.
Consumer hunger for plant-based meat alternatives has raged, with more retail stores selling the products and more big fast food chains putting them on their menus.
At times, that has led to shortages as producers struggled to scale up fast enough to meet demand.
In October, Bendel said during an earnings call that Habit had tested the Impossible patty in 2018 and liked it, but that ""it was impossible to secure supply chain... throughout (2019),"" according to a transcript.
Supply shortages left White Castle, among other restaurants, without patties for its Impossible Slider sandwiches in June.
More recently, however, the major plant-based meat producers have ""brought more points of production and distribution on line"" and helped mitigate supply concerns, Bendel told Reuters.
Impossible declined to comment for this story.
Habit has tested a number of plant-based meat alternatives but been working more closely with Impossible for a burger sandwich, Bendel said.
""On the burger side, it just fit our needs,"" he said.
While known for its lower-priced grilled burgers, which cost about $4, about 40 percent of Habit's entrees are items other than burgers, including a sushi-grade ahi tuna sandwich, he said.
About 85 percent of Habit locations are on in the western United States. It has 8 stores in China and is developing a number of stores in Cambodia.
The transaction with Yum could close in the second quarter of this year, Bendel said. Shareholders must still approve the merger."

New York (Reuters) - Wall Street is betting that the most popular U.S. technology and internet stocks can keep outshining the broader equities market but their latest rally leaves little room for error this earnings season. 
Investors dashed for the exits after Tuesday's less-than-stellar quarterly report from Netflix (O:NFLX) - the N in FAANG - an acronym for the group of U.S. tech companies that have been the biggest drivers of the bull market.
Hopes remained high for the other FAANGs - Facebook (O:FB), Apple (O:AAPL), Amazon.com (O:AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (O:GOOGL), as well as Microsoft (O:MSFT), ahead of their financial reports.
Daniel Morgan, portfolio manager at Synovus Trust in Atlanta, Georgia describes the group as the ""Cadillacs"" of the technology sector, and said they should keep providing an outsized boost to the S&P 500.
""They're still going to be the show-business highlight stocks that everybody focuses on, and I expect them to do well,"" said Morgan, a long time technology stock investor. 
Analysts also see the group reporting faster revenue growth than the broader S&P 500 for the December quarter and faster earnings growth in some cases. 
However with recent gains among most of the group far outstripping the broader market, general equity strategists say the market's superstars may need to provide outsize positive surprises in their quarterly numbers and their forecasts for future growth.
In comparison to the S&P 500's gain of roughly 12% from the start of October to Thursday's close, Apple rose about 43% while Facebook climbed about 24% and Google jumped almost 22%, just beating Microsoft's 20% advance. 
""We do believe there could be downside for the stocks if they do not over-deliver on earnings and narrative,"" said John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington National Bank in Columbus, Ohio. ""To push the stocks higher from here, both earnings and guidance need to beat expectations.""
Here is a graphic looking at valuations for the group compared with the S&P 500 over the last year: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1502/1477/forwardPEfaanmgvsSPX.gif
The S&P 500's fourth-quarter earnings are expected to decline 0.8% and revenue is seen rising 4.4%, according the latest estimates gathered by Refinitiv.
In comparison, Apple earnings for its fiscal first quarter ended in December are seen rising 8.7% while revenue could climb 4.8% year-on-year when it releases results on Jan. 28.
In comparison, Facebook, due to release fourth-quarter numbers on Jan. 29, is expected to report earnings growth of 6.2% on revenue that is estimated to grow 23.4% year-on-year. On the same day Microsoft is expected to post an earnings gain of 20% on revenue that is seen rising 9.9% for its fiscal second quarter ended in Dec. . 
On Jan. 30, Amazon.com is expected to report a revenue rise of 18.7% in the same timeframe, although earnings per share are seen declining more than 30% because it announced it would beef up investment in its package delivery business during the fourth quarter.
The last of the group due to report, Google's parent Alphabet, is expected to announce a decline of 1.7% for fourth-quarter earnings and a revenue increase of 19.5% in its Feb. 3 release.
Of all the group Morgan, at Synovus, favors Amazon most as he expects strong growth and profit margins in its cloud computing business. Plus, the stock has underperformed its peers, and the S&P 500, with a 8.6% gain since early October.
Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh favors Microsoft because of its ""great suite of products with no true replacement"" but also cites a solid outlook for Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Alphabet.
They're ""core holdings for so many managers that they would have to have serious issues for them to be sold. Plus, when people buy an index, they are buying a lot of these companies given the market weight cap of an index,"" said Forrest.   
But she added: ""They need to have a good enough quarter and forecast a better 2020 and be able to list the reasons why it'll be better than 2019.""
Ken Mahoney, chief executive of Mahoney Asset Management in Chestnut Ridge, New York, said Netflix faces tough new competition from companies including Apple and Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) but the rest of the group have ""wide moats,"" including consistent growth and strong balance sheets. But he is not buying more of the group, arguing that valuations are too high.

""I'd look to add on some of these names in a pullback,"" said Mahoney.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street fell in a broad sell-off on Friday, as investors fled equities on growing concerns over the scope of the coronavirus outbreak, capping the S&P 500's worst week in six months.
All three major U.S. stock averages turned sharply negative, with the S&P 500 seeing its biggest one-day percentage drop in over three months after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the second case of the virus on U.S. soil, this time in Chicago.
S&P 500 and Dow wrapped up their worst week since August and the Nasdaq snapped a six-week winning streak. 
Market participants kept a wary eye on developments surrounding the coronavirus, which the World Health Organization (WHO) deemed ""an emergency in China,"" having now killed 26 people and infected more than 800 on the eve of the Lunar New Year holiday.
""Markets hate uncertainty and the virus has been enough to inject uncertainty in the markets,"" said David Carter, chief investment officer at Lenox Wealth Advisors in New York. 
But some analysts believe the investors were looking for a reason to take money off the table. 
""The virus is really more an excuse to take profits right now,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research in New York. 
Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago, agreed. ""The markets are expensive and were looking for a reason to go down, and (the virus) is the excuse to do it."" 
Intel Corp's (O:INTC) stock surged 8.1% after reporting jumps in data center and cloud computing revenue and forecasting better-than-expected 2020 earnings.
Consumer credit company  American Express  Co (N:AXP) benefited from a robust U.S. retail sales environment, posting a better-than-expected 9% annual revenue increase. Its stock advanced 2.8%.
Fourth-quarter reporting season is well under way, with 74 companies in the S&P 500 having reported, 68.2% of which have beaten Wall Street estimates, according to Refinitiv data.
Analysts now expect earnings to have contracted by 0.5%, on aggregate, in the October to December quarter.
Next week, a swarm of closely watched results are expected, notably from Apple Inc (O:AAPL), McDonald's Corp (N:MCD),  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX), Tesla Inc (O:TSLA), Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN),  Boeing Co  (N:BA),  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT), among others.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 170.36 points, or 0.58%, to 28,989.73, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 30.09 points, or 0.90%, to 3,295.45 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 87.57 points, or 0.93%, to 9,314.91.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, all but utilities (SPLRCU) ended the session in the red, with healthcare (SPXHC) and financial (SPSY) suffering the largest percentage losses. 
Broadcom Inc (O:AVGO) rose 1.3% after entering an agreement with Apple Inc (O:AAPL) for the supply of wireless components used in its products.
Rivals Skyworks Solutions (O:SWKS) and  Qorvo Inc  (O:QRVO) were down 4.6% and 4.5%, respectively, on the news.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.33-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.94-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 85 new 52-week highs and 5 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 115 new highs and 62 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.96 billion shares, compared with the 7.13 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Thursday said new rules coming soon will put more limits on technology sales to Huawei, which American officials suspect of making gear that could be used for espionage -- an allegation the company has denied. The proposal, however, has foundered at least temporarily amid objections, said the person who spoke on condition of anonymity because the discussions aren’t public.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that the Treasury Department and Pentagon opposed the tightening. Asked Friday about the matter, Defense Secretary Mark Esper seemed to acknowledge administration discussions. Esper didn’t specifically address Huawei but said there’s always a “back-and-forth” during interagency talks about proposed rule changes.
At issue are rules to make it harder for U.S. companies to sell to Huawei from their overseas facilities. Some U.S. companies have kept selling to Huawei by using exemptions if the majority of work to create the products happens outside the U.S.
The current threshold permitting sales effectively kicks in when 75% of the work occurs overseas. The administration is debating raising this to 90%.
How Huawei Landed at the Center of Global Tech Tussle: QuickTake
The chip industry argues that further tightening could reduce its competitiveness and ability to innovate.
Such issues are “never black and white,” Esper said in remarks at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, but restrictions generally must consider “second- and third-order effects” on American companies and “sustaining those companies’ supply chains and those innovators.”
The Commerce Department didn’t respond to a request for comment. Rob Manfredo, a spokesman for Huawei, declined to comment.
Huawei is one of the world’s biggest purchasers of chips. U.S. semiconductor makers have argued that a complete clampdown is counterproductive as many of the parts Huawei needs can be bought from non-U.S. providers. Huawei also buys software and other products from U.S. companies."

While the nation hasn’t reported any cases, the coronavirus that’s sickened hundreds of people and prompted travel lockdowns comes at a delicate time for the slowing Canadian economy. Air Canada, the country’s airline giant, is poised for its worst week since January 2016, while two of the nation’s market pillars -- energy and mining -- took a beating.
Get updates on the coronavirus outbreak here
Markets have been jittery all week as health authorities around the world attempt to halt the disease’s spread. The coronavirus has the potential to slow growth, just as the SARS outbreak did 17 years ago, said Frances Donald, Toronto-based global chief economist at Manulife Investment Management. Bank of Canada officials have recently expressed heightened concern about an economic slowdown, and revised near-term growth projections.
Air Canada plunged about 9% on the week. During the outbreak from 2002-2003, travelers avoided Toronto, the airline’s main hub, after the World Health Organization imposed a travel advisory due to an outbreak in the nation’s biggest city.
Oil and gas stocks including Baytex Energy Corp. and Enerplus Corp. tumbled as oil sold off amid fears that the virus will cripple fuel demand from China just as markets struggle with adequate supplies. Lundin Mining Corp., Taseko Mines Ltd. and Teck Resources Ltd. paced losses in industrial metal miners as the price of copper sinks as concerns that global growth could slow heighten.

Its stock slumped about 13% this week.Markets -- Just The Numbers
Economy
Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said the door is open for interest rate cuts if the current economic slowdown persists. While the central bank left the key rate unchanged at 1.75%, Poloz said growing slack in the economy threatens to damp inflation pressures. He added that borrowing costs remain “appropriate” for the time being.
Still, retail sales numbers released Friday helped ease some concerns about recent weakness in household spending. About 0.9% more goods were sold in November, largely offsetting October’s 1.1% decline:
“The beat on expectations looks less impressive in the details: auto sales revived, but most everything else was pretty weak. This print doesn’t change our view that momentum significantly weakened in Q4 and portends rate cuts from the BOC.” -- Brett House, deputy chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia.

Investing.com – The S&P ended the week deep in the red as new cases of the coronavirus beyond China's borders stoked contagion fears prompting traders to rein in their bullish bets on stocks.
The S&P 500 lost 0.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.9% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 0.6%.
Signs that virus is spreading took a toll on investor sentiment, with France reporting its maiden case of the outbreak and a second case identified in the U.S.
Confirmed cases of the flu-like virus have reached 900 so far, and are likely to increase further, intensifying fears that areas of the market sensitive to a decline in tourism and air travel are in for rocky ride.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) closed sharply lower, while Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) slipped 2.4%.
Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) and   Las Vegas Sands   (NYSE:LVS) fell 3% and 2% respectively.
Following the turn in sentiment, financials come under pressure as investors snapped up Treasuries, pushing yields sharply lower.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),   Citigroup   (NYSE:C) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) closed more than 1% lower as a slump in bond yields tends to keep a lid on net interest margin.
Energy stocks, meanwhile, were pressured by an ongoing rout in oil prices amid fears that further outbreaks of the virus may halt air travel and lessen demand for jet fuel. 
Against the sea of red, however, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) pared some gains, ending 8% higher, buoyed by bullish quarterly results.

Investing.com – Walt   Disney   (NYSE:DIS) has hogged most of the headlines as the streaming wars intensify, casting a shadow over Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), but new data shows that Apple TV+ racked in more subscribers than Disney+ in the fourth quarter.
Apple TV+ added 33.6 million U.S. subscribers in the fourth quarter, short of Netflix's 61.3 million and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime Video's 42 million, but ahead of the Disney+ figure of 23.2 million. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was up 0.2%.
Despite launching a nearly two weeks before Disney+, AppleTV+ is still playing catch-up, and made its debut with only 11 series or movies available for streaming. 
Some suggest that Apple's impressive subscriber addition should be taken with a grain of salt as the strength of its streaming offering will be put to the test when the free one-year trial expires.
Under the current promotion, Apple TV+ subscribers are on a one-year free trial included with the purchase of any iPhone, iPad, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) TV, iPod touch, or Mac after Sept. 10, 2019.

Oil fell for a fourth day on concern the outbreak will dent economic growth.
The S&P 500 Index headed for its biggest drop since October amid reports that U.S. officials had confirmed two more cases of the illness, which originated in China and has also spread to Japan, South Korea and Singapore. Benchmark Treasury yields fell to a three-month low, while the dollar advanced for a second day.
Investors are exercising caution with stocks close to all-time highs, cognizant of the chance the respiratory virus migrates across the world and develops into a more devastating pandemic like the SARS illness that emerged 17 years ago. Officials in China boosted travel restrictions to cover 40 million people to contain the virus’s spread.
“The market has been reacting to headlines, but no one really has much information in terms of how bad it will get,” said Marvin Loh, senior global macro strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT). “It is affecting some of the growth expectations because ultimately that’s how it will manifest itself in the numbers. But it’s a moderate reaction at best -- it’s not like people are panicking.”
In company news, United Airlines Holdings Inc. and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc. each slid more than 4% on concern the virus will limit demand for air travel and tourism. Financial shares also sank, with  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). down 2% as UBS warned the sector could be hurt by less credit-card spending and a decline in cross-border payments.

Consent orders: Wells Fargo is currently operating under roughly 14 consent orders with various regulators including the OCC, SEC, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Under the orders, the bank will endure intense regulatory scrutiny until it proves it has fixed procedures that allowed employees to create potentially millions of unauthorized accounts, and sell auto insurance and other add-on products that customers did not want or need. The orders also require Wells Fargo to repay customers for costs associated with its consumer abuses. So far the bank has paid out at least tens of millions of dollars in remediation.
Asset cap: The most notable consent order looming over the bank is the U.S. Federal Reserve’s asset cap, which put an unprecedented growth restriction on the bank's balance sheet until it proves that it has overhauled its risk management and controls. Since the asset cap was announced in early 2018, bank executives repeatedly extended the timeline for getting it removed and have since stopped giving any guidance on the issue. On his first public call with the company earlier this month, new Chief Executive Charlie Scarf did not set a new timeline.
Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) rating: Even if Wells Fargo's asset cap is lifted, its growth could still be hampered by its CRA rating, which assesses how well banks service poorer communities. In 2017, federal regulators downgraded Wells Fargo two notches to ""Needs to Improve"" from ""Outstanding"" shortly after the scandal broke. The rating, which is typically only reviewed every five years, curtails the bank's ability to make acquisitions and open branches, and requires Wells Fargo to seek regulatory approval in financing decisions like issuing or prepaying debt. A less than satisfactory rating also prevents the bank from courting certain government business that requires a higher CRA rating.
More hearings: The bank's executives have in the past been called to testify before Congress about the bank's wrongdoings and explain how the bank has changed. New CEO Scharf has tried to place the scandal squarely in the past, describing ""historical and ""legacy"" issues during his first call, but lawmakers are likely to continue rehashing Wells Fargo's mistakes in public. Congresswoman Maxine Waters, House Financial Services Committee chair, said she plans to call Wells Fargo board members to testify this year."

Investing.com – The S&P fell Friday, as reports of a second coronavirus case in the U.S. spooked sentiment amid fears that a further spread of the virus may dent global growth.
The S&P 500 fell 0.8%. The Nasdaq Composite lost 0.7% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.7%.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed that the second case of the deadly virus that originated in China was detected in Illinois.
With more than 900 confirmed cases of the flu-like virus reported so far, fears are rising that the virus, in the event of widespread contagion, could hurt economic growth and experts point to the impact of global growth from Ebola in 2014, Sars in 2003 and the Avian-Flu virus in 1997.
The virus jitters were most prevalent in energy as stocks slumped after oil prices fell sharply on concerns about weaker aviation fuel demand amid a stumble in tourism and air travel.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Airlines fell 4%, while Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) slipped 2%. 
Boeing (NYSE:BA) also added to wave of selling, slipping 1% as on report that the aircraft maker was mulling further cuts to its 787 Dreamliner production.
Tech was an exception to the selloff, staying just above the flatline, led by a surge in Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) on bullish quarterly results a day earlier.
  American Express   (NYSE:AXP) also reported results that beat on both the top and bottom lines, sending its shares about 3% higher. "

1470,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2020 01:15PM ET</span>",U.S. senator slams Tesla's 'misleading' name for Autopilot driver assistance system,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. senator on Friday urged Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) to rebrand its driver assistance system Autopilot, saying it has ""an inherently misleading name"" and is subject to potentially dangerous misuse.
But Tesla said in a letter that it had taken steps to ensure driver engagement with the system and enhance its safety features.
The electric automaker introduced new warnings for red lights and stop signs last year ""to minimize the potential risk of red light- or stop sign-running as a result of temporary driver inattention,"" Tesla said in the letter.
Senator Edward Markey said he believed the potential dangers of Autopilot can be overcome. But he called for ""rebranding and remarketing the system to reduce misuse, as well as building backup driver monitoring tools that will make sure no one falls asleep at the wheel.""
Markey's comments came in a press release, with a copy of a Dec. 20 from Tesla addressing some of the Democratic senator's concerns attached.
Autopilot has been engaged in at least three Tesla vehicles involved in fatal U.S. crashes since 2016.
Crashes involving Autopilot have raised questions about the driver-assistance system’s ability to detect hazards, especially stationary objects.
There are mounting safety concerns globally about systems that can perform driving tasks for extended stretches of time with little or no human intervention, but which cannot completely replace human drivers.
Markey cited videos of Tesla drivers who appeared to fall asleep behind the wheel while using Autopilot, and others in which drivers said they could defeat safeguards by sticking a banana or water bottle in the steering wheel to make it appear they were in control of the vehicle.
Tesla, in its letter, said its revisions to steering wheel monitoring meant that in most situations ""a limp hand on the wheel from a sleepy driver will not work, nor will the coarse hand pressure of a person with impaired motor controls, such as a drunk driver.""
It added that devices ""marketed to trick Autopilot, may be able to trick the system for a short time, but generally not for an entire trip before Autopilot disengages.""
Tesla also wrote that while videos like those cited by Markey showed ""a few bad actors who are grossly abusing Autopilot"" they represented only ""a very small percentage of our customer base.""
Earlier this month, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it was launching an investigation into a 14th crash involving Tesla in which it suspects Autopilot or other advanced driver assistance system was in use.
NHTSA is probing a Dec. 29 fatal crash of a Model S Tesla in Gardena, California. In that incident, the vehicle exited the 91 Freeway, ran a red light and struck a 2006 Honda Civic, killing its two occupants.
The National Transportation Safety Board will hold a Feb. 25 hearing to determine the probable cause of a 2018 fatal Tesla Autopilot crash in Mountain View, California."

LONDON/MONTREAL/PARIS (Reuters) - Bombardier (TO:BBDb) has approached France's  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) and Japan's Hitachi (T:6501) to find a merger partner for its rail business as it struggles to contain costs that have eaten into margins, sources told Reuters.
The Canadian manufacturer of planes and trains is working with  Citigroup  (N:C) and UBS (S:UBSG) to strike a deal that could help create a rail champion to better compete with China's state-backed operator, CRRC.
Rail companies are eyeing consolidation to reduce costs through scale in a market dominated by CRRC, the world's largest train maker.
Bombardier has seen its share price plunge 37% since the start of the year after it flagged a 2019 profit warning on Jan.16.
It has been reviewing several rail merger scenarios in recent months which also involved a possible deal with Germany's  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) and a Chinese counterpart, but these options failed to gain traction, one of the sources said.
It remains in active talks with Alstom, one of its closest rivals in Europe, while also looking at Hitachi as another merger option, the sources said, requesting anonymity as the matter is confidential.
Bombardier, Alstom, Hitachi and Siemens all declined to comment.
Discussions with French industrial group Alstom began in July and became serious in September, one of the sources said.
The French government is open to a rail deal for Alstom but no final decision has been made on the terms of a potential transaction, another source said.
Alstom, advised by Rothschild, was only recently involved in a similar rail merger with Siemens - a deal set to create a European rail powerhouse but subsequently halted over antitrust concerns.
Berenberg analysts said that there would be less of a regulatory barrier to a deal between Alstom and Bombardier since the pair has a lower European market share in high-speed rail and signaling.
Japanese conglomerate Hitachi was also approached last year, the sources said, but it was not immediately clear whether the talks are still ongoing.
Hitachi's biggest rail market in Europe is Britain where there is little overlap with Bombardier's operations.
Yet both companies are active in Germany where concentration may raise concerns among European authorities, one of the sources said.
Bombardier's selection of its preferred merger partner will ultimately hinge on the likelihood of winning antitrust approval and the remedies that can be offered to soothe competition concerns, the sources said.
European regulators are set to review two-decade old rules that determine if companies have the market power to hammer rivals - a move that could help Bombardier win consensus for its rail deal.
GROWING PRESSURE
Bombardier sold 30% of its rail business to Canada's second-largest pension fund, Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec, in 2015 after reviewing strategic options including a possible listing in Germany or Britain.
However, the unit has since struggled to cope with a handful of problematic rail contracts which have eaten into its margins, leading Bombardier to issue a profit warning for 2019.
The company recently slashed its guidance for its fourth-quarter earnings due to delays in business jet deliveries and higher rail costs.
The plane-and-train-maker, which has $9.7 billion in outstanding bonds according to Refinitiv data, faces growing pressure to quickly raise money from its transport unit, one of the sources said.

""They are serious about this. Without a deal the outlook is bleak,"" he said.

WINNIPEG, Manitoba/ZURICH (Reuters) - Food group Nestle SA (S:NESN) said on Friday it has teamed up with small Canadian plant-based food ingredient makers Burcon (TO:BU) and Merit Functional Foods, the second such supply agreement this month that targets Canadian crops. 
Meat substitutes from plants in burgers, nuggets and many other foods are a fast-growing industry, driving up demand for crops that produce them.
Canada is among the world's largest growers of peas and the biggest producer of canola, crops high in protein that technology companies like Burcon can separate and isolate for use in foods and beverages.
The agreement with Nestle is long-term, with no expiry, Burcon Chief Executive Johann Tergesen said in an interview. Nestle will buy pea and canola proteins from a 20,000-tonne per year Merit plant to be built by the end of this year in Winnipeg, Manitoba.
Merit will process the proteins using Burcon technology under a licensing agreement. 
""It's a little bit like Christmas morning for those of us who have been doing this for 20 years,"" Tergesen said.
""In the early days, I had to explain to people what protein was. Now it has been a wild ride.""
Burcon stock jumped 36% in Toronto to C$1.89 per share, touching its highest price in nearly three years. Nestle stock rose 0.9% in Switzerland.
With the deal, Burcon expects to report its first-ever commercial revenue and profit in 2021. Terms were not released.
Nestle launched soy and wheat protein-based ""Incredible Burgers"" in Europe last year. The deal gives the company access to a range of ingredients for its foods and beverages, using the ""unique expertise"" of Burcon and Merit, Nestle Chief Technology Officer Stefan Palzer said.
It comes after  Beyond Meat Inc  (O:BYND) this month struck a similar supply agreement with France-based Roquette, which is also building a pea protein plant in Manitoba.

With so much of Canada's peas exported raw, finding enough supply to satisfy the Nestle deal will not be a challenge, said Ryan Bracken, Merit's co-CEO. The company is already planning to expand the Winnipeg plant under construction to more than double production.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Reports of suspicious transactions submitted by banks and betting firms in Denmark have increased tenfold in recent years, straining anti-money laundering authorities which drew heavy criticism on Friday from a state auditor. 
Banks across the Nordic region are facing increasing scrutiny by regulators after a string of money laundering scandals, including at  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE), Denmark's biggest lender.
Since 2013 the number of suspicious transaction reports submitted to Denmark's Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), which investigates reports of suspected criminal behaviour, has risen tenfold to 53,454 in 2019, according to an FIU paper reviewed by Reuters.
According to the paper, a quarter of all reports last year were passed along to police or tax authorities for further investigation. 
The arms and narcotics trades, human trafficking, cyber crime and forgery are known to be the primary types of criminal activities which use money-laundering to blur the origin of money, according to Europol. 
Separately on Friday, Denmark's national auditing agency said efforts to combat money laundering and terrorism financing by Danish ministries and authorities had not been effective or adequate. 
The agency said the FIU's electronic screening model was ""too simple"" and had a ""range of weaknesses"", and that it had failed to process all relevant reports and forward these to authorities. 
""Generally, we agree with the agency's criticisms,"" Jorgen Andersen, head of the FIU, told Reuters. He said the unit had improved its IT resources throughout last year and had more capacity after it was allocated further funds.
Nordic financial firms are on a hiring spree to beef up their compliance and anti-money laundering departments. Danske Bank said last year it would spend an additional 2 billion Danish crowns ($300 million) to improve IT systems and hire an additional 600 compliance workers. 
Banks have invested heavily in regulatory technology, known as ""regtech"", to automate the process of identifying new customers and teach computers to detect suspicious patterns in money flows. 
According to the FIU's Andersen, the submissions from the financial sector, of which banks account for the majority, are generally ""well-founded"" and ""informative"". 
""There are no cover-my-ass reports. They send reports, because it is relevant,"" he said. 
Ulrik Noedgaard, chief executive of financial business association Finance Denmark, said there had been a widespread concern among banks about whether authorities could keep up with the banks' boosted focus on compliance. 
""No matter how fine-meshed we make our systems, if there is no follow-up with regards to the criminals, then nothing changes,"" Noedgaard said. 
The Danish Justice ministry, which drew the heaviest criticism from the auditor, warned of reform in response to the report.
""There is a need for reform of the efforts against economic crime, and that involves assessing whether there is an adequate amount of resources,"" Justice Minister Nick Haekkerup said in a statement.

By 1030 AM ET (1630 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 21 points, or 0.1%, while the S&P 500 was down 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite was flat, coming off an earlier record high.
Chipmaker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was the standout performer, rising 7.2% to its highest since the very peak of the dot-com boom back in 2000 after reporting better-than-expected earnings after the bell on Thursday. The company continues to ride the wave of demand for high-powered chips from data centers on which Cloud servers run. It also enjoyed a kicker from demand for new PCs ahead of Microsoft’s deadline for ending support for Windows 7.
Rival Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) also extended gains, rising another 2.5%, in the wake of its announcement of a major deal to supply Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Skyworks (NASDAQ:SWKS), whose products will be displaced by the deal, fell 4.2%
NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE), the parent company of Florida Power & Light, meanwhile overcame an initial dip premarket to rise 0.7%, as it reiterated its ultra-bullish guidance for the next three years.
  American Express   (NYSE:AXP) rose 2.9% after reporting a strong holiday quarter, with U.S. spending on its cards up by 6% year-on-year.
Elsewhere, the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of other currencies, hit a new high for the year of 97.710 before retreating to 97.665, up 0.2% on the day. U.S. crude oil prices continued to fall on fears of oversupply, as fears strengthened that the coronavirus outbreak will hit Chinese demand.

DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Friday that he expects to begin negotiations with China on a so-called Phase 2 trade deal soon, with Washington and Beijing on the same page.
""My guess is they (China) will consider waiving other tariffs as part of their purchasing program,"" Mnuchin said of the $200 billion in additional U.S. goods and services that China has pledged to buy.
""I don't see any difference in our views. My expectation is that we'll start conversations on phase two in the near future,"" he said in an interview at the end of the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in the Swiss ski resort of Davos.
China had a low-key presence at the Davos meeting, with most of the focus on trade concentrated on a dispute between the United States and the European Union over a ""digital tax"", with Washington threatening retaliation if the bloc's members tax U.S. based companies before an apparent compromise was reached.
""Once there is a consensus, those tax changes need to be implemented and in many places, require legislation. We object to a tax that targets just American companies,"" Mnuchin said.
With chief executives representing many of the biggest companies from around the world at Davos, it is often used as a barometer of business confidence and the economic outlook.
""It seems like Europe and Asia have bottomed and the U.S. still looks in very good shape. So there's a lot of positive attitudes,"" Mnuchin said, with U.S. tax cuts in prospect.
""My expectation is that the focus of tax cuts will be for the middle class and some pro-growth incentives,"" he added.
'OTHER ISSUES'
The biggest battleground during the four-day event has been the debate over how politicians and business leaders should tackle climate change, with much of the focus on exchanges between U.S. President Donald Trump and activist Greta Thunberg.
This year's WEF included a contingent of young activists like Thunberg, with the organisers keen to add to the voices engaging in debate at the exclusive event.
""I was at dinner last night and people were very focused on the climate issue. My comment was, look we're in the middle of a serious health issue in China. It was not a topic of discussion until I brought it up,"" Mnuchin said. 
""The environment is important. I just think it should be put in context. This goes back to a little bit of communication. The youth have focused on this one issue.  But there are many other important issues that will impact the next generation."" 
One possibility, Mnuchin said, was to change the lexicon.
""Perhaps the historical language that we use, we need to reconsider. When young people hear capitalism, perhaps it has a different meaning to them,"" Mnuchin said.
""Perhaps the language we should be using is free markets versus managed markets. Open society versus closed society.""
Addressing the use of sanctions by the United States, Mnuchin said it was a strategy that needed scrutiny because of the potential impact it could have on the U.S. dollar.
""Sanctions are up dramatically. Over a very long period of time, we have to be careful in how we use these, where it could impact the use of the dollar. So we take that responsibility very seriously,"" he said.
Mnuchin is also looking at increasing the amount of U.S. borrowing at longer maturities, with a focus on 20 years.

""We can issue a lot more 20-year bonds than we could issue 50- and 100-year bonds. So in terms of our objective in both raising proceeds and extending duration, the 20-year bond is a priority at the moment,"" he said.

1484,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2020 10:21AM ET</span>",UK finance sector ready to wave Brexit white flag amid 'fish for finance' talk,"By Sinead Cruise, Huw Jones and Andrew MacAskill
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's finance sector is losing hope of securing even basic access to European Union markets from Dec. 31, as talk that the EU wants UK fishing rights in exchange draws the industry into a political struggle between the bloc and its departing member.
Hopes were high that Prime Minister Boris Johnson would prioritize the financial sector -- Britain's largest export industry and biggest corporate tax generator -- in trade talks. 
But bank sources say a push by the EU for fishing access to UK waters and London's stance that it will diverge from EU rules are prompting them to review hard-Brexit plans that could see more jobs than anticipated move to Europe.
Until now, financial firms running EU operations from Britain believed that technical assessments by EU banking, insurance and markets regulators would be enough judge UK rules 'equivalent' to those governing EU-based firms, granting them market access after December.
But banking sources say the EU's executive now sees things differently.
Sources from three international banks fear that access will depend on a broader trade-off such as Britain allowing fishing in its waters -- a concession they feel the government is reluctant to make.
""We're now hearing very explicitly -- it's not even the rumor mill -- the European Commission has said these are politically linked to progress in phase-two negotiations,"" one banking source told Reuters.
""As one official put it to me, if 'fish for financial services' is going badly, this will impact the Commission's willingness to grant equivalence.""
The fishing industry is valued at about 169 times less than financial services and official data shows it employs just 8,000 people compared to more than a million in finance. 
But regaining control of Britain's rich fishing waters was a totem for Brexit campaigners. 
A European Commission spokesman referred to a January EU document saying the bloc and Britain should endeavour to complete equivalence assessments before June 30. He declined to comment further.
The EU is Britain's biggest financial services export market, worth about 26 billion pounds annually.
Since the 2016 Brexit vote, the sector has reorganized to preserve a foothold in the EU, launching or beefing up subsidiaries and relocating staff and capital. Many banks and money managers are preparing for a further transfer of resources after a transition period ends in December.
Consultants EY said this week that around 7,000 financial services jobs will move from Britain to staff new EU hubs.
Failing to obtain equivalence could add risk-management, compliance, middle and back office roles to that figure, as well as trading and client-facing jobs, the sources said.
Finance minister Sajid Javid said last week that Britain would not be a rule-taker after Brexit, even though some businesses could suffer from regulatory divergence.
He wants ""outcomes-based"" equivalence in financial services, meaning UK rules need not be identical to those in the EU but should have the same effect.
The EU updated its equivalence policy ahead of Brexit, saying third-country regimes like those in Japan and the United States do not need to be identical but must have the same ""outcomes"" as EU rules to give access to its markets. 
But it would impose tougher scrutiny of ""high-impact"" countries, expected to include Britain.
The EU's withdrawal of share trading equivalence from Switzerland during a dispute over a partnership treaty, not because of any divergence in rules, showed how equivalence can be politicised.
Britain's finance ministry had no immediate comment.
COST AND SCRUTINY
Bankers say jobs transferred to Europe as politicians wrangle are likely to stay there, even if equivalence is eventually granted.
""The sector's approach has always been to prepare in a way for the worst,"" a second senior banking source said.
Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week,  Deutsche Bank  (de:DBKGn) CEO Christian Sewing recognised the risk that a trade deal would not be finalised before end-2020.
He said his bank ""could do everything out of Frankfurt"" but that Britain would remain an important capital market.
Financial lobby groups have warned that if Britain does not get equivalence, the government will lose valuable tax revenue.
The bloc is the biggest customer for Britain's financial services exports, worth about 26 billion pounds annually based on unfettered access. 
But lawmakers from Johnson's Conservative Party say the City could cope with the fallout if negotiations turned sour.
""London is a marketplace. The marketplace doesn't come to them (the EU) ... the health of the City doesn't depend nearly to the extent that is believed on having some privileged position in the EU,"" said Peter Lilley, who sits in parliament's upper chamber.
A second Conservative lawmaker, Tim Loughton, said Johnson would not consider swapping assets such as fishing rights to cut a better deal for banks, which have struggled to rebuild their image since the 2008 financial crisis.
He said the EU was bluffing and would not politicize financial services because it, too, risked losing access to the region's deepest markets.

""It would be a massive exercise in cutting off your nose to spite your face,"" he said.

In November 2018 the watchdog ruled that Facebook had not informed users properly about the collection and use, for commercial reasons, of the data they release. 
It fined the U.S. company 5 million euros ($5.5 million) and asked it to publish an amending statement on the homepage of its website for Italy, on the Facebook app and on the personal page of each registered Italian user. 
On Friday the regulator said in a statement that Facebook had not done so and the company could face another fine of up to 5 million euros.
A spokesperson for Facebook said the group was reviewing the decision.
The company made changes last year, including to its Terms of Service, to further clarify how it makes money, the spokesperson said.
""These changes were part of the group's ongoing commitment to give people more transparency and control over their information.""

1488,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2020 09:25AM ET</span>",Financier doubts add to Boeing's MAX headaches,"By Laurence Frost, Conor Humphries and Tim Hepher
DUBLIN (Reuters) - To restore faith in the 737 MAX, Boeing (NYSE:BA) needs to prove its flagship jet is not just airworthy but also a safe investment.
At a gathering in Dublin this week of the titans of the multibillion-dollar aircraft leasing industry, which finances half the world's fleet, cracks were appearing in that effort. 
Boeing said on Tuesday its troubled workhorse - grounded last March after two crashes in which 346 people died - should receive approval by mid-year from U.S regulators, paving the way for hundreds of jets to resume service later this year. 
But in scores of high-stakes negotiations in the background, it is trying to convince banks, leasing firms and airlines that the investment case for thousands more of the jets - worth hundreds of billions of dollars - remains intact. 
Airplane owners and investors said some lenders were already demanding higher collateral in deals on the MAX. One airline said financing for pre-delivery payments had dried up amid the uncertainty - though the market won't be fully tested until closer to renewed deliveries.
""Even people who have committed to financing previously are wondering should I extend or should I just pull back to wait to see because they don't know the real value of their collateral going forward,"" said the head of an asset-management firm active in the sector, declining to be named to preserve relations with Boeing.
""Banks I think are getting a bit nervous,"" he said. 
Boeing already risks losing some smaller customers who are pondering whether to revoke deals with lessors once delays of 12 months provide them with get-out clauses, according to consultant IBA, whose valuations underpin some financing deals.
That in turn could push down lease rates - and the underlying value of the plane they imply. 
""Even when we're back under starter's orders and we've got certification, I still think there will be downward pressure"" on MAX lease rates, IBA Chief Executive Phil Seymour said.
A deeper battle for Boeing is to convince its leasing mega-clients, who have orders worth tens of billions of dollars, that the MAX remains a long-term investment. 
In that battle, Boeing is fighting on two main fronts, executives said: compensation talks and efforts to convince purchasers that the MAX production cycle will not be cut short, a step that would undermine the value of the plane. 
COMPENSATION 
Investors in Boeing shares and in MAX planes are watching closely as compensation negotiations determine how much of the financial pain of the crisis each side swallows. 
""Markets believe that indeed there is an enormous cost related to the situation,"" said Bertrand Grabowski, an aviation banker turned independent adviser. ""What isn't clear is how much, how that will be compensated and to whom.""
While several airlines have said Boeing agreed to compensate for MAX delivery delays, some lessors are arguing that falls in the value of the jet should also form part of the discussions. 
AerCap, the world's largest aircraft lessor, said it was expecting Boeing to compensate it if it were forced to find new lessees for MAX jets dumped due to the delay. 
""Boeing will have to compensate me for that because we would be in a cancellation period and if we didn't get that we would just cancel,"" CEO Aengus Kelly said.
The value of the plane will be ""part of the whole thing,"" he said on the sidelines of Airline Economics and Airfinance Journal conferences.
Kelly noted strains in the market, saying 'loan-to-value' - or the share of the MAX's purchase price that a bank will cover, may be lower than for a competing Airbus. Some lenders may try to ""extract some premium"" by raising borrowing costs, he added. 
He said ""right now"" banks and lessors were willing to finance the MAX, putting a floor under its value as experts say the aviation sector remains awash with funds seeking returns.  
""If the banks were to lose confidence, that would be different,"" he added.
LIFE CYCLE
The second crucial concern among those financing MAX jets surrounds whether Boeing could be forced to develop a replacement before the typical 15-20 years of production. 
AerCap this week said it would make no sense for Boeing to replace the program until the next wave of fuel-saving technology is developed in a decade's time. 
Lessors ""will focus a lot on when Boeing end up having to announce a replacement - which for us as asset owners would be the key to deciding whether it's something we want to invest in,"" said Paul Sheridan, CEO of lessor AMCK Aviation.
Seeking to allay doubts, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said on Wednesday he expected the MAX to be flown for a generation. 

But he also ordered a new market study after shelving plans for a slightly larger jet: an exercise that could encompass the market for planes like the MAX, analysts said.

R. Shetty, had pledged over half the company's stock as security against debts it incurred buying Travelex.
Another of Shetty's London-listed firms, United Arab Emirates' largest private healthcare provider NMC Health (L:NMC) has halved in value after being hit in December by U.S. short-selling firm Muddy Waters.
Shetty's Finablr bought British travel money firm Travelex in 2015, which this month suffered a cyber attack that forced its systems offline for weeks and caused chaos for holidaymakers.
""The outlook for Finablr is poor. The fact the founder used roughly half of the company's shares as collateral for a loan suggests the situation is serious,"" said CMC Markets analyst David Madden.
""The Travelex crisis has clearly hit the founder hard and it suggests that he is scrambling around to get financing. Even if the funding issue is sorted out, Finablr's share price will probably struggle to recover – like NMC Health.""
A spokeswoman for Finablr declined to comment on the share price movement. Shetty did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

1492,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2020 08:16AM ET</span>",Investors build war chests to buy bonds of distressed European companies,"By Abhinav Ramnarayan and Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - Years into a bond market bull-run, investors are banking on a brighter future for funds that buy the debt of financially troubled European companies whose bonds are offering meatier returns because they are more risky.
With European economic growth expected to be subdued in 2020, and default rates tipped to rise, investors expect an increase in the number of companies that will struggle to service their debt.
That creates an opportunity: to buy the bonds of a troubled company at a deeply discounted price, and make big profits if the company manages to turn itself around and the bond price recovers.
Private equity groups and asset managers are creating so-called special situation funds to identify suitable targets for these high-risk - and potentially high-reward - bets.
""We have seen a significant increase in the number of stressed and distressed European corporates being screened during our team's discussions,"" said Mark Brown, co-head of special situations in Europe at private equity firm KKR.
""We do think we are late-cycle and, as the fund is focused on deploying capital in a cyclical downturn, having capital ready to go makes sense,"" he said.
The appeal of distressed debt is enhanced by the fact that a large chunk of the European bond market is offering yields close to or below zero.
KKR last year started fundraising for a third special situation fund and is seeking $1.5 billion.
Elsewhere, JP Morgan Asset Management launched its first ever special situations fund in November, raising just over $1 billion, while private equity firm CVC raised $1.4 billion for a global special situations fund in June.
PIMCO is also fundraising for a special situations fund, said a person familiar with the matter.
Bond prices show markets beginning to price in increased concern that the most troubled European companies will struggle to fund their debt obligations, providing an opportunity for those who specialize in dealing with such situations.
The ratio of European high-yield bonds trading at a spread of more than 1,000 basis points over their respective government benchmarks-- one measure of distressed debt -- hit 7% at end-2019 compared to 1.4% a year earlier, JP Morgan data showed.

RIVAL PLAY
In a slowing economy, most investors will have to look at challenging situations if they want to perform, said Amundi high-yield portfolio manager Marina Cohen.
""There are clearly going to be some opportunities in those types of (distressed) situations in the mid-term.""
Recent examples of such plays include Israel's Teva Pharmaceutical (TA:TEVA), Britain's Jaguar Land Rover and French supermarket chain  Casino  (PA:CASP), all of which found themselves in difficult situations earlier last year before rebounding and raising fresh debt.
Recent performance for distressed debt funds has lagged another favored debt play - lending money to help finance mergers and acquisitions via leveraged buyout funds (LBFs).
LBFs generated an internal rate of return of nearly 14% in the second quarter of 2019, according to the latest data available from the investment software provider eFront, compared to 8.5% for distressed debt funds.
For an interactive version of the graphic, click here https://tmsnrt.rs/2Ye2ONM.
But the volume of money flowing into distressed debt suggests investors see improving prospects there.
Assets under management in European distressed debt -- which combine unrealized funds from existing investments and ""dry powder"" for future investments -- hit a record $48.5 billion in June, Preqin data showed.
""They (special funds) have been waiting and watching for a few years now, and we may finally be moving towards an environment where this trade becomes viable,"" said White & Case European leveraged finance lawyer Jeremy Duffy.

In one recent example, investors rushed into Jaguar Land Rover's five-year bond offer in November, with demand so strong that the company had to print another seven-year tranche, raising 800 million euros in total. Jaguar - owned by India's Tata Motors (NS:TAMO) - offered a yield of 5.875% and 6.875% on the tranches, respectively.
Earlier in 2019, the British carmaker was hit by a $4 billion writedown, a slump in China sales and Brexit worries that forced it to look for alternative funding from bond markets.
Adding to the appeal of distressed debt, European Central Bank stimulus has compressed yields across the European bond market to such an extent that volatility is likely to be quite high in a downturn.
""Wobbles within individual companies are triggering some quite severe selloffs,"" said Laura Frost at M&G Investments.
""That presents an opportunity for people like us"".

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The United States wants India to buy at least another $5-6 billion worth of American farm goods if New Delhi wants to win reinstatement of a key U.S. trade concession and seal a wider pact, four sources familiar with the talks told Reuters.
U.S. President Donald Trump cited trade barriers last year when removing India from its Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program that allowed zero tariffs on $5.6 billion of exports to the United States. In retaliation, India slapped higher tariffs on more than two dozens U.S. products.
Ahead of a Trump visit to New Delhi to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi next month, negotiators on both sides are hammering out terms for a trade deal that would include New Delhi rolling back higher tariffs on some farm goods such as almonds, walnuts and apples, one of the sources said.
Both governments had hoped to work out a limited trade deal last year, but struggled to reach an agreement.
India's commerce ministry and the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi did not respond to a request for comment. The office of the U.S. Trade Representative did not immediately respond outside regular business hours.
While India has offered partial relief on medical device price caps that have hurt American pharma giants and a roll-back in tariffs on some U.S. goods, Trump's team wants a sweetener of $5-6 billion in additional trade for U.S. goods to restore GSP privileges, three of the sources said.
That demand was conveyed by the United States to India in late December, said two sources.
As part of the negotiation, the U.S. wants India to increase imports of frozen poultry products, the first source said. The U.S. has already been pushing India to cut the high import taxes on poultry products.
""The deal has to be agriculture focused, the U.S. is putting a number on everything (if India wants GSP back),"" said one of the sources.
The sources asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the discussions. 
Other than the agriculture sector, the United States could be swayed if some of that additional revenue goes to its energy sector, said one of the sources. 
Indian oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan this week said India was looking forward to extending its energy cooperation with the United States and other countries, but didn't disclose any planned deals.
Trump is likely to visit India in late February, in what would be his first visit to the South Asian nation since he took office three years ago.
SMALLER CHINA-TYPE DEAL
India and the United States have built close political and security ties, but in recent years trade frictions have come to the fore. Trump has often named India as one of the countries with the highest tariffs in the world.
Trump's administration has also been upset with India's decision to force foreign card networks to store more data locally and imposition of stringent e-commerce investment rules that impacted operations of Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Walmart's (N:WMT) Flipkart.
A fifth Washington-based source with knowledge of the U.S. administration's thinking said a U.S.-India trade deal would be far smaller than one the United States struck with China this month, but will ""look basically the same"".
China this month agreed to increase purchases of U.S. products and services by at least $200 billion over the next two years in exchange for the rolling back of some tariffs, defusing an 18-month row that had hit global growth.
""It will be challenging for the U.S. to see a reasonable agreement with India ... without concessions on the trade gap. Given the recent deal with China, India has to follow suit,"" said Samir Kapadia of Washington-based lobbying and advisory firm, The Vogel Group.
Trade between United States and India stood at $142.6 billion in 2018, but Trump wants to reduce its $25.2 billion deficit with India.
India has also offered the United States a commitment to increase purchases of almonds and apples and scrap an import tariff of 50% levied on Harley-Davidson (N:HOG) motorcycles, the first source said. Trump has publicly said India's high tariffs on such bikes was unacceptable.

India initially also offered to relax some tariffs on high-end U.S. technology products, but that is now off the table, said one of the sources.

1495,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2020 07:52AM ET</span>",Ericsson hit by higher 5G costs and weaker U.S. market,"By Johannes Hellstrom and Simon Johnson
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden's Ericsson (ST:ERICb) warned it faced higher costs this year as it rolls out new 5G networks and was also hit by a temporary slowdown in its U.S. market, sending its shares 7% lower on Friday. After a number of lean years, Ericsson has been boosted by the roll-out of 5G, particularly in the United States, and analysts hope it can benefit from a U.S. campaign to shut out Chinese rival Huawei [HWT.UL] from supplying 5G equipment. 
But while the new technology has helped sales, it has increased costs. Ericsson has also opted to take on major new clients to gain market share, betting a hit on margins in the short term will help to deliver longer-term profitability. 
It recently bought the antenna and filter business of Germany's Kathrein to boost its 5G portfolio and said costs and investments related to the deal would weigh on margins in 2020.
Increased investments in digitalization and more spending on compliance - after a $1 billion payment to resolve probes by U.S. authorities into corruption - are also expected to mean somewhat higher operating costs in 2020.
In October, rival Nokia (HE:NOKIA) shocked investors by slashing its profit outlook for 2019 and 2020 and pausing dividend payments to allow for heavier investments in 5G, leading its shares to drop by a fifth. 
However, Ericsson CEO Borje Ekholm said the Swedish firm was on track to deliver its 2020 targets of an adjusted operating margin of over 10% and sales of 230-240 billion Swedish crowns. 
The company also hiked its dividend by 50% to 1.50 crowns per share, which Christer Gardell, managing partner at Ericsson's top shareholder Cevian Capital, said showed its confidence in the future.
""We are convinced that Borje Ekholm will surpass the targets and show the doubters that they are wrong"", Gardell told Reuters. 
5G
Ericsson is fighting Nokia and Huawei to take the lead in the roll out of 5G networks, which are expected to host critical functions from driverless vehicles to smart electric grids and military communications.
That has led the United States to blacklist Huawei and launch a worldwide campaign to try to persuade allies to ban it from their 5G networks, alleging its equipment could be used by Beijing for spying - which Huawei denies.
Britain is expected soon to make a final decision on whether to allow Huawei equipment in its 5G mobile networks, while Germany may also rule on the matter during the spring.
North America has been the biggest market for 5G so far, boosting Ericsson's sales, but the company said demand slowed in the fourth quarter as the proposed merger between Sprint (N:S) and T-Mobile hit their spending. 
""It was a significant impact in a small part of the market which means the quarter came out negative in North America,"" Ekholm said. ""But in general demand is very strong there.""
While the United States is an early 5G adopter, China is expected to start its roll out this year.
Ericsson, which has targeted market share in China, said it was still too early to assess possible volumes and price levels for deploying 5G there.
""We expect that the initial challenging margins will shift to positive margins over the lifespan of the contracts,"" it said.
Western Europe is expected to lag behind, but by 2025 the GSMA telecoms industry lobby group estimates operators globally will have spent $1 trillion building up 5G networks, offering a huge jackpot for the leading suppliers.
Ericsson's adjusted fourth-quarter operating earnings rose to 5.7 billion crowns ($600.2 million) from 2.6 billion a year earlier, but were down from 7.4 billion the previous quarter. Analysts in a Refinitiv poll had forecast 6.9 billion crowns.

1496,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2020 07:49AM ET</span>",European stocks climb as economic data fuels growth hopes,"By Tom Wilson
LONDON (Reuters) - European shares on Friday were set to post their first daily gain this week on signs of a recovery ahead for growth, with easing worries over the coronavirus outbreak in China also emboldening investors. 
In some of the first glimpses of the health of the region's economy this year, a Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) survey showed Germany's private sector gaining momentum, with growth in services up and a pullback in manufacturing easing.
PMI figures from Britain, meanwhile, showed the vast services sector returning to growth in January for the first time since August and a downturn in manufacturing slowing.
And while euro zone-wide PMI showed business activity remaining weak there were some signs that the worst may be over.
The broadly positive data helped the Euro STOXX 600 extend an early advance, climbing 1.2% and heading towards its first day of gains this week. 
Indexes in Frankfurt and Paris gained 1.4% and 1.2% respectively, while London advanced 1.6%. 
Among individual shares, Bayer (DE:BAYGN) gained 2.3%, after a report on a possible out-of-court settlement at a U.S. jury trial over allegations that its weed-killer Roundup causes cancer.
Wall Street futures also pointed to slim gains. 
""Sentiment among manufacturers is improving rapidly, meaning that expectations for a 2020 recovery are increasing,"" ING economist Bert Colijn said of the euro zone. 
""We are expecting growth to very gradually pick up over the course of the year.""
CORONAVIRUS: NOT YET A GLOBAL EMERGENCY? 
The data boosted a positive vibe in markets, where fears over the outbreak of a deadly coronavirus in China abated slightly after the World Health Organization designated it an emergency for China, but not yet for the rest of the world. 
The virus has killed 26 people and infected more than 800. Chinese health authorities fear the infection rate could accelerate as hundreds of millions of people travel over the week-long Lunar New Year holiday, which began on Friday.
MSCI's world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, gained 0.2%, with resilience among markets in Asia helping.
There, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.1% amid slow trade for the Chinese holiday. Financial markets in mainland China, Taiwan and South Korea were closed.
""Markets are waiting to see whether or not (the coronavirus) has a material impact on growth, and that's hard to judge at the moment,"" said Neil Wilson, chief analyst at Market.com. 
Markets have reacted more calmly to the outbreak than was the case during the SARS epidemic in 2003, Wilson said, possibly because of greater information about its spread. 
SAFE HAVENS FALL
As investors made bets on riskier assets, safe havens such as the Japanese yen and gold stepped back. 
The yen fell a sliver to 109.60 yen against the dollar, off two-week highs of 109.26 touched on Thursday. Gold fell 0.3%.
Still, underscoring the grave economic risks posed by any deepening of the crisis, the National Australia Bank estimated China's GDP growth for the first quarter could be hit by around 1 percentage point by the virus outbreak. 
The Lunar New Year is a time of heavy consumption on travel, gifts and entertainment.
""The impact on Chinese growth could be significant given the outbreak coincides with the Chinese New Year,"" said Tapas Strickland, NAB's director of economics in Sydney. 
In currency markets, the euro tumbled to a seven-week low against the dollar as the PMI data added to a broader market conviction that European Central Bank policymakers will maintain a loose monetary policy for the near future.
The single currency was last at $1.1033. 
The European Central Bank had on Thursday left its policy rates unchanged, though President Christine Lagarde struck a slightly more dovish tone than some had expected.
The British pound retreated, after initially strengthening, as some investors still expected an interest rate cut next week even though business surveys pointed to a post-election bounce in the UK economy. 
Sterling rose as much as 0.3% to $1.3180 before erasing those gains. It was last down 0.3% at $1.3125. 

Against a basket of six major currencies, the dollar was flat, trading off two-week lows hit on Thursday.

1501,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2020 07:13AM ET</span>",Bayer faces fourth U.S. Roundup cancer trial in Monsanto's hometown,"By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) -  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGn) is set to face a fourth U.S. jury trial over allegations that its Roundup weed killer causes cancer, with four cancer patients in the hometown of its agricultural subsidiary  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) scheduled to begin making their case on Friday.
The lawsuit marks the first multi-plaintiff trial in the litigation over whether glyphosate, Roundup's active ingredient, is carcinogenic, and is the first trial outside of California. It is being held in St. Louis, where Monsanto was headquartered before Bayer bought the company in a $63 billion deal in 2018.
Three consecutive juries found the company liable for causing cancer with damages of tens of millions of dollars awarded to each plaintiff. Bayer is appealing those verdicts.
Court-appointed mediator Ken Feinberg has put the number of Roundup cancer claimants at more than 75,000 while Bayer said the claims it has been served with in court were below 50,000. 
Bayer's share price has tumbled since the first verdict in August 2018 but the stock rose 3% on Friday after Bloomberg reported a possible out-of-court settlement with some plaintiffs that could lead to a total payout of about $10 billion.
While traders said the market likes the idea of Bayer settling the litigation, some cautioned that the prospect of a comprehensive deal remained uncertain.
Analysts have estimated the size of any such settlement at $8-$12 billion.
SEE YOU IN COURT
While most plaintiffs' lawyers have agreed to postpone trials pending negotiations, some have decided to pursue their clients' day in court.
The case in Missouri's Circuit Court for the 22nd Judicial Circuit of the City of St. Louis is scheduled to last several weeks, with both sides presenting extensive scientific evidence through expert witnesses.
Bayer denies all allegations that Roundup or glyphosate causes cancer, saying decades of independent studies have shown the world's most widely used weed killer to be safe for human use and noting that regulators around the world have approved the product.
""At the end of the day, this trial should come down to the weight of the science, and we remain confident in the extensive scientific record and regulatory assessments that support the safety of our glyphosate-based herbicides and that they do not cause cancer,"" the company said in a statement.
Several court cases have been postponed by both parties in the past to expedite settlement talks. By pursuing the St. Louis trail The Miller Firm LLC, a key player in the litigation, is seeking to increase pressure on Bayer. 
The case involves the claims of Bryce Batiste from Louisiana, Ann Meeks from Florida, Glen Ashelman from Pennsylvania and Christopher Wade, a St. Louis resident. All four have been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a blood cell cancer that plaintiffs in the litigation allege is caused by Roundup.

Some legal experts said Bayer could benefit from a home advantage in the St. Louis trial, where Monsanto has century-old roots. But juries in the city are also known to dole out massive damages awards against large corporations.

1502,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2020 07:13AM ET</span>",Bargain hunters fire up rally in cannabis stocks,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some cannabis stocks are seeing their prices surge as investors hunt for winners in the ashes of an industry shakeout that hammered share prices last year.
Shares of  Tilray Inc  (O:TLRY) and Canopy Growth Corp (TO:WEED) have climbed more than 20% since the start of the year, while Cronos Group Inc (TO:CRON) and  Aphria Inc  (TO:APHA) are up more than 10%. The ETFMG Alternative Harvest exchange-traded fund (P:MJ), which targets the global cannabis industry, is up 5.8% in that period.
A speculative ""green rush"" fueled by the legalization of cannabis in Canada and some U.S. states faltered last year, as investors grew worried about oversupply and whether companies could bring enough customers out of the black market. Uncertainties over U.S. regulations and revenue shortfalls further weighed on the sector.
Investors are now betting that some of these companies have become undervalued. Canopy, for instance, trades 10% below the average target price among the 22 analysts that cover it, according to Refinitiv data. Its forward price-to-sales ratio, meanwhile, is at 16.4, well below its peak of 32.1 it hit in January 2019 and more than double its low from November.
""We went through the golden age and then we fell into the dark ages where valuations were assuming that these companies were just dead,"" said Michael Underhill, chief investment officer at Capital Innovations.
Underhill’s fund owns shares of Canopy and is increasing its stake in companies such as CBD beverage maker Alkaline Water Company Inc (O:WTER), cannabis financing company Ianthus Capital Holdings (CD:IAN), and multi-state cannabis operator Harvest Health & Recreation Inc (CD:HARV).
Others are focusing on companies that are not pure plays on cannabis, which they expect to better weather a tough regulatory environment in the U.S.
Illinois this year became the 11th U.S. state, along with the District of Columbia, to allow the recreational sale of cannabis. Yet a ballot measure to legalize recreational use in Florida, the nation’s third most-populous state, will likely not appear until at least 2022, according to a note from research firm Jefferies.
""Investors have realized that the rollout from a regulatory perspective isn't as efficient as it should be,"" said Jason Wilson, who focuses on cannabis research and banking at ETF Managers Group, which manages the $810 million ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF.
He is recommending shares of e-cigarette maker  Turning Point Brands Inc  (N:TPB).
Dan Ahrens, portfolio manager of the $49 million actively-managed AdvisorShares Pure Cannabis ETF (P:YOLO), believes the sell-off in cannabis shares was exacerbated by aggressive short-selling, or investors betting against the prices of cannabis stocks.
He is focusing on smaller companies such as  Innovative Industrial Properties  Inc (N:IIPR), a real estate investment trust that leases greenhouses to grow medical-use cannabis, and cultivators such as  Village Farms International Inc  (TO:VFF) and OrganiGram Holdings Inc
At the same time, he is underweight large Canadian companies such as Tilray in favor of companies that will focus more directly on the U.S. market.
There are ""still too many companies in the space,"" he said. ""Some will make it and some won't.""

1503,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 24, 2020 07:12AM ET</span>",Yield Hunters Push Bond Safeguards to the Brink,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- “Worrisome.” “Dangerous and aggressive.” “Abuse of documentation.” “Peak greed.”
These are just a few of the ways investors and analysts have described the riskiest corners of the debt markets in the past few days. From the U.S. to Europe, whether in collateralized loan obligations or junk bonds, the feeling that the reach for yield in fixed income is fast approaching a breaking point is becoming too powerful to ignore. It’s perhaps best encapsulated by a quote in the Wall Street Journal from Luca Cazzulani, a senior fixed-income strategist at UniCredit: “Investors are not really interested in safety, they are quite keen on yield.’’
That’s good, I guess. Because for those who still favor strong credit protection, it’s getting harder and harder to find it. 
Let’s start with CLOs. Bloomberg News’s Adam Tempkin had an in-depth article this week with the headline “CLOs Are Packed With New Loopholes, Triggering Investor Backlash.” He reported that investors, analysts and credit raters are taken aback by managers’ efforts to “swap troubled loans, circumvent credit-quality limitations, and double down on risky wagers, largely in an effort to ensure they can pass crucial compliance tests, even if a large swath of a CLO’s underlying loans lose value.” Many understand that having a bit of flexibility in an illiquid market is a good thing when prices fluctuate but argue that provisions like these create the potential for severe losses if the credit cycle truly turns.
The same problem plagues the market for speculative-grade corporate bonds. Covenant Review, an independent research firm that analyzes debt documents for investors, published its 2019 year-in-review for the U.S. high-yield market this week and found many cases in which companies “ended up keeping some of the most dangerous and aggressive covenant provisions for bondholders.” A common strategy was for issuers to propose so many offensive covenants that even after a “hack and slash treatment to appease concerned bond investors,” they still got away with far more questionable terms than in the past.
It would be one thing if bond investors were compensated for those risks — giving up some safety for yield is a classic trade-off. But, of course, that’s not the case.
Rather, the yield on an index of double-B U.S. corporate bonds hit a record low of 3.47% this week. VICI Properties, a double-B rated real estate company that develops entertainment and hospitality centers, priced $750 million of five-year bonds with a 3.5% coupon, the lowest for that maturity in more than six years. To be clear, it’s not any better elsewhere up the credit spectrum, as yields on a Moody’s Corp. index of triple-B corporate bonds and a Bond Buyer index of municipal debt are both around the lowest since 1956. Even triple-C yields have fallen by 200 basis points in two months.
Record-setting interest rates aren’t limited to America. In Austria, as my Bloomberg Opinion colleague Marcus Ashworth wrote, Erste Group Bank AG priced a so-called CoCo bond to yield 3.375%, the second-lowest coupon ever for the risky debt. And European high-yield bond sales are poised to top $11 billion this month, the most-ever for January.
By now, it’s possible that the $100 trillion global bond market has simply become immune to reaching unprecedented levels. But the potential for complacency is scary, especially when someone like Bob Prince, who helps oversee the world’s biggest hedge fund at Bridgewater Associates, declares that the days of a boom-and-bust economic cycle are over.
This brings to mind a piece of investing advice that has always stuck with me: Bull markets don’t end when everyone is on high alert for what could go wrong. It’s when everyone willfully chooses to ignore those warning signs that the cycle inevitably turns. 
The combination of weak credit protections and historically low yields on the riskiest corporate debt should be a clear red flag. Instead, when asked about financial-market bubbles, the one thing that came to mind for JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon was negative-yielding sovereign obligations. “Do you know anyone who’s actually bought a negative interest rate bond?” he asked CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin. “I would never buy a negative rate bond. Not unless I was forced.”(1)
I get it. It’s tempting to bash negative-yielding bonds and anyone who owns them. Even though it has been several years since sovereign-debt yields fell below zero in Japan and some European countries, the concept still boggles the minds of Wall Street veterans. Who would purchase a security that locks in a loss if held to maturity?
But I would pose the same question to buyers of speculative-grade securities at these rock-bottom yields. If you’re still of the mind that economic cycles exist, then it stands to reason that the longest expansion in U.S. history is long in the tooth. Will a sub-3.5% yield on double-B bonds, or sub-5% on single-B bonds, be enough to cancel out principal haircuts in the case of default? Perhaps. But it’s worth remembering that lending to the wrong companies can also lead to losses — and possibly large ones — even if dicey companies have largely avoided disaster in recent years.
Now, there are some nascent signs that investors are anxious about their ability to pick winners after years of just about every wager paying off. Bloomberg News’s Caleb Mutua this week highlighted research from  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc that showed junk bonds experienced a much sharper sell-off when downgraded in 2019 than in previous years. Usually, bond traders pride themselves on having superior information and being ahead of the credit raters. That confidence might be wavering.
Whether those fleeting jitters turn into anything more remains to be seen. Certainly, the Federal Reserve and other central banks aren’t about to do anything to derail the economic expansion with inflation still in check. And as long as yields and spreads remain near these lows, investors probably won’t lose much sleep over the daunting record $1.2 trillion of U.S. speculative-grade debt that’s set to mature through 2024.
Yet just because there’s no clear catalyst for a reversal today doesn’t mean investors are safe from a nightmare scenario in the future. At the very least, they should push for stronger protections when they buy new bonds or loans. As it stands, if and when the credit cycle turns and the losses mount, they’ll have no one to blame but themselves.
(1) Bloomberg News's Liz Capo McCormick (NYSE:MKC) quickly pointed out that plenty of Americans own negative-yielding debt, through Vanguard’s Total International Bond Index Fund."

TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank-backed cloud robotics and artificial intelligence startup CloudMinds is slashing its global workforce as it burns through cash after repeated attempts to list on the stock market, people familiar with the matter said.
Headed by former China Mobile (HK:0941) research whiz Bill Huang, money-losing CloudMinds is the latest SoftBank (T:9984) portfolio company to lay off workers. 
The job cuts include in China, two sources said, where the bulk of the company's workforce is based and where it generates most of its revenues. 
All the sources declined to be identified because the information is not public.
CloudMinds did not respond to requests for comment and a SoftBank representative declined to comment.
Around 175-225 people are being laid off among CloudMinds' around 700-strong workforce in China, one of the sources said. 
The layoffs will also leave the startup with only a nominal presence in the United States and Japan, two of the sources said, with the Silicon Valley office being closed and a small number of remaining staff moved to an office in Irvine, California.
Valuations at the Japanese tech giant SoftBank's sprawling portfolio have come under increased scrutiny as investors question CEO Masayoshi Son's bullish view of how quickly new technology can come onstream. 
CloudMinds, which is incorporated in the Cayman Islands, last year set out ambitious plans to list in the United States with predictions of rapid growth in the market for intelligent, cloud-connected robots. 
However roadshows over the summer were met with a cool reception from investors unfamiliar with the company and unconvinced about its business model, one of the sources said.
Investors were also wary of investing in a SoftBank-backed company, the source said, as market sentiment was turning against another portfolio company, office-sharing firm WeWork. 
Burning through its cash, CloudMinds is now hoping to list in mainland China after an attempt to list in Hong Kong also fell flat, the source said. 
CloudMinds suffered a net loss of almost $100 million in the six months to last June, a regulatory filing showed, compared to a loss of $65 million in the same period a year earlier.
A request for further funding from SoftBank's Vision Fund was turned down, the source said.
ELECTRIC DREAMS 
CloudMinds products include humanoid robots XR-1 and Cloud Pepper, an enhanced, cloud-connected version of the Pepper robot from SoftBank's robotics division. 
Many of the company's products are not fully commercialized, three sources said, with CloudMinds struggling to attract customers for Cloud Pepper in some markets.

The startup's struggle to market Cloud Pepper reflects the broader commercial disappointment of the robot, which with limited functionality and high prices has fallen short of Masayoshi Son's dreams of it becoming a companion robot.

KUALA LUMPUR/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indonesia has agreed to immediately increase imports of Indian buffalo meat, sugar and auto parts after India boosted purchases of Indonesian palm oil amid a spat with rival supplier Malaysia, two Indian government sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Friday.
Indonesia and Malaysia account for 85% of the world's palm oil output while India is the biggest buyer of edible oil. India has effectively halted imports of refined palm oil from Malaysia since early January in retaliation for Malaysia's accusation that recent Indian policies discriminate against Muslims.
India is a Hindu-majority country while Malaysia is mainly Muslim.
Indonesia, the world's biggest palm oil producer and exporter, is expected to be the biggest beneficiary of India's row with Malaysia. Indonesian crude palm oil has sold at a premium to Malaysian oil since India this month placed curbs on imports of refined palm oil.
The trade ministers of India and Indonesia, which want to more than double their bilateral trade to $50 billion by 2025, met in Davos on Thursday and agreed to fast-forward trade between them, one of the informed sources said.
""This is a goal we agreed upon earlier, now the process accelerates,"" said the Indian source. Both declined to be named as they were not authorised to talk to the media.
""Starting now, they have promised that they will buy a lot more meat, a lot more sugar and autos/autoparts. Palm oil imports from Indonesia will increase and there are many areas where we will export more.""
The sources declined to give figures.
An Indian government document, reviewed by Reuters, said that Indonesia had ""informally agreed"" to double the annual quota for Indian bovine meat exports to 200,000 tonnes.
Indian-Indonesian trade was worth $21.2 billion in the last fiscal year that ended in March, $15.84 billion of which comprised Indian purchases.
Indonesian Trade Minister Agus Suparmanto will visit India next month to hold further talks on enhancing trade, according to one of the Indian government sources.
A spokeswoman for Indonesia's trade ministry had no immediate comment. An Indian trade ministry spokeswoman did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
Indonesia imported 94,500 tonnes of Indian buffalo meat worth $323 million in the 2018/19 fiscal year. It is the third biggest buyer of Indian buffalo meat after Vietnam and Malaysia.
Indonesia, however, bought only 555 tonnes of sugar from India last fiscal year.
""They have now changed some of their norms to let more Indian sugar come in,"" said one of the sources. ""In other areas, there's an ongoing process of discussion on easing regulations or standards, or increasing quotas in these areas.""
Malaysia's top sugar refiner told Reuters on Thursday that it would increase purchases of sugar from India, a move that two sources in Malaysia said was part of efforts to placate New Delhi amid the palm spat."

Investing.com - U.S. stock markets are set to open higher Friday, helped by a strong tone in Europe amid signs of improving business confidence and a lessening of concerns over the impact of the pneumonia-like virus in China.
At 6:55 AM ET (1155 GMT), futures for the S&P 500 Futures traded 7 points, or 0.2%, higher, futures for the Nasdaq 31 points, or 0.3%, higher, while the Dow Jones 30 Futures contract rose 73 points, or 0.3%.
Late Thursday, the World Health Organization decided against calling the virus a global health emergency, despite the death toll in China rising to 25.
“Make no mistake, this is an emergency in China, but it has not yet become a global health emergency,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO’s director-general, said at a briefing in Geneva Thursday. 
Markets in mainland China and South Korea are shut, while Hong Kong closed early, down just 8 points, for lunar new year holidays.
Stock market gains were strong in Europe Friday, helped by improved sentiment in large parts of the continent’s business community.
The early readings of the PMI data showed Britain's vast services sector returned to growth in January for the first time since August, while a downturn in manufacturing eased. Businesses were more confident than expected in Germany, continuing the recent signs of a pick up in economic activity. The French release, by contrast, was hit by the strikes against President Emmanuel Macron's pension reform plans.
At 06:55 AM ET (1155 GMT), the German DAX was 1.4% higher, the U.K.’s FTSE 100 gained 1.6%, France’s CAC 40 gained 1.1%, and the pan-eurozone index, the Euro Stoxx 50, up 1.3%.
Eyes will now turn to the release of the equivalent U.S. PMI data, at 0945 AM ET (1445 GMT). The manufacturing PMI was revised slightly lower to 52.4 from 52.5 in December of 2019. This release averaged 53.63 points from 2012 until 2019, reaching an all time high of 57.90 points in August of 2014.
In corporate news, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) will be in focus after the tech giant published strong fourth quarter results, with sales up eight per cent to $20.21bn, compared with the $19.23 billion expected. Shares stood 5.6% higher premarket.
Shares in Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) climbed 2.4% premarket after it disclosed late Thursday new deals with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), worth $15 billion, to supply the iPhone manufacturer with components. 
By contrast, Skyworks (NASDAQ:SWKS) Solutions dropped 2.9% in premarket despite beating expectations with its latest quarterly report and upbeat guidance. The company competes with Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) to supply Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).
Elsewhere, oil prices continued to show weakness, amid fears that the emergence of the deadly virus in China could reduce demand for crude from the world’s largest importer.
AT 01:55 AM ET (0655 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 0.4% at $58.38 lower and the international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.5% to $61.73. Gold futures for February delivery on New York’s COMEX dropped 0.4% to $1,558.65."

(Reuters) -  Crown  Resorts (AX:CWN) appointed a new chairwoman and a chief executive on Friday in a major management reshuffle, as Australia's biggest casino operator seeks to navigate through regulatory probes and falling profits.
The move comes days amid investigations by the gaming authorities in the state of New South Wales on whether Crown's billionaire founder James Packer can proceed with his proposed A$1.2 billion ($820 million) partial sale of the company to Hong Kong's Melco Resorts & Entertainment (O:MLCO).
Crown said on Friday Chairman John Alexander will be stepping down and named executive director Helen Coonan as chairwoman, while Chief Financial Officer Ken Barton was elevated to chief executive, a role which has been vacant for about three years.
""Alexander stepping down is not a good thing but the greater problem that they do seem to have is all the issues related to the sale to Melco,"" said Dale Raynes, associate director at CPS Capital.
""They needed to tighten the ship and prove that they have the relevant management in place.""
Alexander will remain an executive director to assist with the transition of the chairman and chief executive roles, Crown said in a statement.
""This new structure is in line with feedback we have received from a number of proxy advisers and shareholders and better aligns with contemporary governance practices,"" incoming chairwoman Coonan said in the statement.
Packer froze the stake sale to Melco last year due to the probe into alleged criminal activity at Crown's Australian operations following media allegations that it had engaged in money-laundering, breached gambling laws and partnered with tour operators linked to organized crime.
Crown has denied the allegations.
The probe will include a public investigation into whether Melco has any corporate or business connections with its CEO's father Stanley Ho who had been investigated by Australian authorities for possible ties to organized crime.
Melco has said Ho was not involved in its business.
Hearings are due to resume in late February and lawyers leading the inquiry said Packer himself would be called to give evidence.

Crown is also under financial pressure due to reduced spending by Chinese tourists, which contributed to a 4.7% drop in its annual profit last year.

CEO Andrew Bailey leaves in March to become governor of the Bank of England, when Woolard will take over the FCA as interim chief executive.
Woolard is currently the FCA's executive director of strategy and competition, and an executive member of the FCA's board.
He has been using the FCA's competition powers to crack down on high overdraft fees charged by banks and on high interest rates exacted by payday loan companies.
The finance ministry said Woolard would remain interim CEO until a permanent successor is appointed. Futher details on recruiting a permanent CEO will be announced in due course.
The finance ministry is expected to consider internal and external candidates for the permanent post that will play a crucial role in steering the financial sector beyond Brexit.
The FCA will advise the government on granting EU banks, insurers and asset managers access to customers in Britain.
The CEO will have to ensure that Britain has a strong voice in global financial standard-setting bodies now that it no longer has a say on EU rules.
The finance ministry is likely to face pressure to appoint a woman as a permanent CEO, with the watchdog's current director of supervision and former Bank of England official Megan Butler seen as a candidate."

Several European countries are considering such a tax to raise more money from the local businesses of companies such as Google (O:GOOGL) and Facebook (O:FB), leading the United States to threaten retaliation in support of its tech industry.
Britain has said it will press ahead with its proposed digital tax, while France has put off its plans to wait for broader negotiations within the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
The Czech lower house approved the first reading of the digital tax bill on Wednesday. The bill must pass two more readings and clear the upper house Senate - or a new vote in the lower house in case of a veto - before it becomes law.
""The U.S. government has been clear on the issue of digital services taxes, or DSTs,"" the U.S. embassy said in a statement, referring to past comments by the ambassador as well as U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in Davos this week.
U.S. Ambassador to the Czech Republic Stephen King wrote in December in a newspaper article that the Czech digital tax was discriminatory. ""Another regrettable consequence (of this tax) could be some form of appropriate counter-measure by my government,"" King wrote.
The embassy declined to comment further.
Some European Union countries are pursuing their own digital taxes after failure to reach a bloc-wide agreement. Britain and the Czech Republic have said their proposed taxes are only temporary until global rules are agreed.
The planned Czech tax covers revenue from targeted advertising, digital market places, and user data sales.
It targets companies with annual global revenue over 750 million euros ($832 million), turnover of more than 100 million crowns ($4.3 million) in the Czech market, and more than 200,000 user accounts.
The Czech tax would raise about 2.1 billion crowns this year if it took effect from June, and about 5 billion annually in following years."

Investing.com -- “Harris, I am not well; pray get me a glass of brandy.”
The reaction of England’s King George IV on seeing his future bride Caroline of Brunswick for the first time may have echoed in the minds of   Remy Cointreau   (PA:RCOP) investors on Friday, after the French spirits group announced a big miss in quarterly sales at the end of 2019.
Analysts had expected a weak top line figure after the company withdrew from a bunch of distribution contracts in North America and Europe. But they weren’t prepared for a 1.6% drop in organic sales, the result of a slump in Hong Kong due to the enduring disruption from street protests and of “slow stock replenishment in the United States.”
It said the end of distribution contracts for its partner brands in the U.S. and Europe would knock 56 million euros ($62 million) off this year's revenue and 5 million euros off operating profits.
Remy also unsettled investors by choosing not to update investors on the outlook for the rest of 2020, saying that it will present new targets when it publishes its annual results in June. The company’s fiscal year runs through March.
Remy Cointreau stock fell as much as 11% in early trading in Paris before rebounding a little to be down 8.9% by 5:10 AM ET (1010 GMT).
That’s on a day when European markets were solidly in the green as fears about the spread of the coronavirus eased somewhat. The CAC 40 was up 1.3% despite a relatively weak PMI survey for the French economy in January, overshadowed by the strikes against President Emmanuel Macron’s pension reforms. The benchmark Stoxx 600 was up 1.2% at 424.98, while the U.K. FTSE 100 was up 1.6% after a stronger-than-expected PMI.
Remy is the second luxury group in a weak (after Burberry) to report sluggish sales in the U.S., underlining the fact that not all product lines are profiting equally from consumption which on aggregate still seems to be ticking along nicely. Even before the update, standalone drinks companies (as well as ‘hard’ luxury specialist Richemont) have underperformed the fashion-heavier names.
Remy Cointreau shares have risen only 1.2% in the last 12 months, while Pernod Ricard's (PA:PERP) have risen 18%. By contrast, LVMH (PA:LVMH),   Kering   (PA:PRTP) and   Hermes International   (PA:HRMS) have clocked up gains of 60%, 42% and 37% respectively. 
With French food and drink still in President Donald Trump’s crosshairs as he looks for a convenient foreign target to energize his voter base in election year, that picture may not change any time soon."

The Dutch road authority ruled on Thursday that Suzuki's Vitara and Fiat Chrysler's Jeep Grand Cherokee diesel models broke emissions rules and must be fixed or face a ban on sales across Europe.
In a statement, Suzuki said diesel versions of its Vitara and S-Cross vehicles used engines and emissions software supplied by Fiat Chrysler. 
The Dutch authorities said the vehicles in question, which are no longer in production, showed emissions levels higher than allowed following a software update in 2017, Suzuki said. 
Earlier this week, the German authorities said they were investigating Mitsubishi Motors Corp for suspected use of illegal, emissions defeat devices installed in its diesel engines.

Regulators across the world have been clamping down on emissions devices used in diesel models since Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) admitted in 2015 that it used illegal software to cheat U.S. emissions tests.

Investing.com - German businesses were more confident than expected in January, continuing the recent signs of a pick up in economic activity to start the year.

According to the Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index released by IHS Markit, the January flash manufacturing PMI came in at 45.2, up from with 43.7 in December, and 44.5 expected. While this increase signaled an 11-month high, it's important the remember the sector is still deep in contraction territory.
The German Services PMI climbed to 54.2, from 52.9 previously, and the Composite number rose to 51.1 from 50.2.

The upturn in the PMI chimes with Tuesday's release of German economic expectations by the ZEW economic research institute said Tuesday, which improved strongly in January and reached their highest level since 2015.

""The strong rise in the German PMIs is January provides more tangible evidence of industry bottoming out & services remaining highly robust,"" said Oliver Rakau, Chief German Economist at Oxford Economics. ""This is also good news as regards Monday's Ifo release.""
Economic expectations rose in January to 26.7 points, its highest value since July 2015, from 10.7 points in December, the ZEW said. The outcome was much better than economists' consensus forecast of 15 points in The Wall Street Journal's survey.

ZEW President Achim Wambach at the time cited stronger than expected German economic growth in 2019 and the resolution of the trade dispute between the United States and China for the improvement.

The French release was mixed, with a small improvement in the manufacturing print to 51.0 in January from 50.4 in December, while the services sector, a more important sector for the French economy, dropped to 51.7, from 52.4 under the impact of strikes against President Emmanuel Macron's pension reform plans.
This dragged the composite print down to 51.5, from 52.0 prior, and suggests the French economy is going to struggle to post any significant growth any time soon.

The figures have only had la minor impact upon the European stock markets Friday, with traders more focused upon an easing of concerns about the impact of the deadly virus in Asia.
At 03:40 ET (0840 GMT), the DAX traded 175 points, or 1.3% higher. France's CAC 40 was up 75 points, or 1.3%, while the FTSE 100 in the U.K. gained 106 points, or 1.4%. The pan-eurozone index, the Euro Stoxx 50 rose 48 points, or 1.3%."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Foreign investors are dumping derivatives contracts on Japan's TOPIX equity index but buying up individual, select company shares in a trade investors and analysts say is a vote of confidence in the earnings potential of companies.
Investors outside Japan net sold TOPIX futures last week at the fastest pace in almost four months and turned net buyers of cash equities for the first time in three weeks.
Active investment managers are likely paring bets on gains in the broader TOPIX index, which includes many small illiquid companies, and instead investing in companies in the Nikkei 225 with better liquidity that will benefit from a pickup in global semiconductor demand, investors and analysts said.
""This looks like an active strategy where investors get out of the TOPIX because it is not rising so much,"" said Kiyoshi Ishigane, chief fund manager at Mitsubishi UFJ Kokusai Asset Management Co in Tokyo.
""However, these investors are still positive on Japanese equities, so they're buying individual shares that they expect to rise faster than the TOPIX. In this case, technology shares are an easy buy.""
Foreign investors net sold 292.5 billion yen ($2.67 billion) in TOPIX futures (JTIc1) in the week ended Jan. 17, data from the Japan Exchange Group showed. That was the biggest net selling since the week ended Oct. 4. 2019.
Last week, foreign investors bought 75.1 billion yen of Japanese equities on a cash basis, the first net purchase since the week ended Dec. 27 last year, according to the data.
So far this year, IT systems provider NEC Corp (T:6701) and electronics maker Panasonic Corp (T:6752) are among the top gainers on the Nikkei 225.
(Graphic: Foreign investors sell TOPIX futures - https://tmsnrt.rs/36gLVEn)
Another factor behind the shift into cash stocks from TOPIX futures is a type of arbitrage trade that takes advantage of discrepancies between the Nikkei 225 (N225) and the TOPIX index (TOPX), some analysts said.
Last year, the Nikkei, composed of 225 companies, rose 18.2%, but the TOPIX, which has 2,156 members, rose only 15.2% because it is much broader and includes smaller companies that are not traded often."

At 02:15 ET (0715 GMT), France's CAC 40 futures were up 3 points, or 0.1%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 2 points, or 0.1%. The DAX futures contract traded 3 points, or 0.1%, lower, and the futures on the pan-eurozone index, the Euro Stoxx 50, were flat.
The number of cases of patients infected with the new virus as of January 23 has gone up to 830 in China, while the death toll from the virus has risen to 25, the National Health Commission announced on Friday.
Yet, on Thursday, the World Health Organization stopped short of calling the outbreak a global health emergency.
“Make no mistake, this is an emergency in China, but it has not yet become a global health emergency,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO’s director-general, said at a briefing in Geneva Thursday. “It may yet become one.”
Markets in mainland China and South Korea are shut, while Hong Kong closed early, for lunar new year holidays, with the Hang Seng Index down just 8 points, or 0.1%. Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained 13 points, or 0.1%.
It’s important to put this disease into context, stated Robert Carnell, Chief Economist Asia-Pacific at ING, in a research note, with reports of the fatalities showing them to be largely amongst the elderly, and those with pre-existing chronic conditions. 
This doesn’t mean that older, or less healthy members of the population are more expendable, he added, and that there won't be an economic or market response to this. “But it does suggest that the response will be manageable, and hopefully fairly short-lived, weeks and months, not quarters or years.“
On Wall Street on Thursday, the major equity indices bounced off session lows, as a mixed bag of earnings provided no convincing reason to doubt the current strength of the U.S. economy.
The S&P 500 rose 0.1%, the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1%.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) rallied 4% as its fourth-quarter earnings topped estimates despite a rise in costs from the grounding of the 737 MAX. Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) rose about 3% shrugging off a quarterly earnings miss.
As well as airlines,   General Electric   (NYSE:GE) also powered industrials to a strong day on Wall Street, closing 3% higher after Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) upgraded its investment recommendation on the stock to buy.
Attention will now turn to corporate news in Europe, where Swedish telecoms equipment group Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) is likely to be in focus Friday after reporting a sharp rise in fourth-quarter core earnings on Friday despite a slowdown in its previously surging U.S. business.
German chemicals giant Bayer (DE:BAYGN), meanwhile, is reported to be in talks to settle claims related to its Roundup weedkiller for $10 billion, according to Bloomberg.
Looking at the economic calendar, the focus in Europe will be on the various PMI data, leading indicators to the strength of the region. Probably the most watched is the German manufacturing PMI release, due at 3:30 AM ET (0830 GMT).
Elsewhere, the price of oil rebounded slightly after hefty recent losses following the news late Thursday from the EIA that U.S. oil inventories fell by 405,000 barrels last week. After sharp increases over the last two weeks, as well as another jump from the American Petroleum Institute's inventory report earlier this week, the figures pleased oil bulls.
At 2:10 AM ET (0710 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 0.4% higher at $55.81 and the international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.4% to $62.31. Gold futures for February delivery on New York’s COMEX were 0.3% lower at $1,560.25."

The Treasury Department penalized Triliance Petrochemical Co. Ltd., Sage Energy HK Limited, Peakview Industry Co. Limited, and Beneathco DMCC for dealings with the state-owned National Iranian Oil Co., it said in a Jan. 23 statement. The transactions helped finance Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force and its terrorist proxies, the department said.
The move is a continuation of the White House’s aggressive strategy to penalize firms dealing with Iran, a country it nearly went to war with earlier this month. Last July, It sanctioned Zhuhai Zhenrong Co., a secretive company with links to the Chinese military and a history of taking Iranian crude and fuel. A couple of months after that it threw global shipping markets into disarray after it penalized a unit of COSCO Shipping Corp.
“Iran’s petrochemical and petroleum sectors are a primary source of funding for the regime’s global terrorist activities and enable its persistent use of violence against its own people,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in the statement.
In 2019, Triliance Petrochemical ordered the transfer of the equivalent of millions of dollars to NIOC as payment for Iranian petrochemicals, crude oil, and petroleum products shipped to the U.A.E. and China after the expiration of any applicable exceptions, the Treasury Department said. In facilitating these shipments, Triliance worked to conceal the origin of these products, it added.
Triliance and Sage are based in Hong Kong, while Peakview is headquartered in Shanghai and Beneathco in Dubai. Calls to Triliance’s head office went unanswered, while a person at Beneathco declined to immediately respond to questions. Contact information for Sage and Peakview wasn’t immediately available.
All property and interests in the property of the designated companies are blocked and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with them, while foreign financial institutions that knowingly deal with them may be penalized, the department said."

Investing.com - Asian markets traded higher on Friday in Asia. Investor sentiment remained fragile, however, as death toll related to the Coronavirus in China continued to rise.
 
The number of cases of patients infected with the new coronavirus as of January 23 has gone up to 830 in China, while the death toll from the virus has risen to 25, the National Health Commission announced on Friday.
 
On Thursday, The World Health Organization said the new coronavirus remains a local crisis for now, stopped short of calling the virus a global health emergency. 
 
“Make no mistake, this is an emergency in China, but it has not yet become a global health emergency,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO’s director-general, said at a briefing in Geneva Thursday. “It may yet become one.”
 
The decision came after officials in China issued restrictions on travel and public gatherings in Wuhan, the city in China where the virus was first detected earlier on Thursday. 
 
Hong Kong and Beijing are canceling planned holiday activities, according to local officials and state media.
 
Markets in mainland China and South Korea are shut, while Hong Kong closes early, for lunar new year holidays.
 
The Hang Seng Index climbed 0.2% by 10:59 PM ET (02:59 GMT).

1526,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 23, 2020 07:45PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch for Jan. 24,"By Kim Khan 
Investing.com - Here are three things that could rock the market tomorrow.
1. Amex Rounding out Financial Earnings
The earnings parade slows down tomorrow, but it doesn’t stop.
Some big names are issuing numbers ahead of the opening bell.
  American Express   (NYSE:AXP) is expected to report a profit of $2.01 per share on revenue of $11.37 billion, according to analysts’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Baird initiated the coverage of the stock this week with a neutral rating and a price target of $124.
Communications company Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) will also report, with a profit of 14 cents per share expected on revenue of $6.9 billion.
2. Markit PMI on Tap
Just after the start of trading, Markit will release its preliminary measure of U.S. productivity in January.
The preliminary Markit composite purchasing managers’ index (PMI) is expected to tick down to 52.5, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Yet both the services and manufacturing components are expected to post a small rise.
3. Oil Rig Count Comes as Prices Slide
The oil market has been a hot topic of late with geopolitics and supply-demand arguments pushing prices sharply.
Today New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark for U.S. crude, sunk for a fourth-straight day, settling down $1.15, or 2%, at $55.59 per barrel.
Earlier in the session, WTI sunk to $54.77, its lowest since the week of Nov. 17, as traders ignored a relatively neutral weekly supply-demand report from the Energy Information Administration to focus on the potential fallout from the new coronavirus.
Tomorrow Baker Hughes will report its oil rig count, an indication of oil companies’ anticipation for higher oil prices.
Last week the oil rig count came in at 673."
1527,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2020 07:22PM ET</span>",Intel signals 2020 will be a turnaround year for chip industry leader,"By Stephen Nellis and Munsif Vengattil
(Reuters) -  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) on Thursday cemented the market view that the chip industry is turning around after a prolonged slowdown, forecasting better 2020 revenue and profit than Wall Street anticipated, driven by cloud computing demand.
The company's sales in its closely watched data center business jumped 19%, helping it beat fourth-quarter profit and revenue estimates and sending its shares up 7% in extended trading.
Chief Financial Officer George Davis said in an interview that sales to cloud computing providers were up 48% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, a trend expected to continue this year.
The Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker expects fiscal year 2020 revenue of about $73.5 billion, more than $1 billion ahead of the Wall Street consensus, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Davis did not name specific customers, but so-called ""hyperscale"" cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services (O:AMZN) and  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) in the United States and  Alibaba  Group Holding (N:BABA) and Baidu Inc (O:BIDU) all purchase Intel chips for data centers whose capacity they rent out to large businesses.
""What we're seeing is very strong demand from cloud players,"" Davis told Reuters. ""I have to give credit to the hyperscalers for this quarter."" 
Intel said its transition to a newer generation of chipmaking technology was progressing better than it expected and that it would boost its capacity to make chips for personal computers, in a sign that the manufacturing woes that plagued the chipmakers over the past year were starting to ease.
""We think this is going to help us close the gap to customer demand that we've been experiencing. We think all of this is (going to be) resolved in 2020 and we'll actually be able to start building inventory at the end of the year, which we have not been able to do for two years,"" Davis told Reuters.
Intel's positive outlook follows an upbeat forecast from chipmaker Texas Instruments (O:TXN) on Wednesday and prediction last week of sharply higher chip demand at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TWO:5425). Analysts view 2020 as a recovery year for semiconductors, driven by 5G spending for both smartphones and network upgrades.
However, Intel's Davis cautioned that the positive forecast was not directly attributable to the trade deal signed between U.S. and Chinese officials last week. 
""It's a little fresh to really have a good understanding of how that specific trade deal is going to have an impact on (Intel's customers') thinking,"" Davis said. ""But we like the demand signals we're getting."" 
After years of acquisitions outside its core area of processing chips under previous leaders, Intel Chief Executive Bob Swan has set a goal of becoming more disciplined about spending, slowing investments in areas like memory chips and shedding struggling businesses.
Intel has doubled down on its core markets such as personal computers and data centers, both of which beat analysts' fourth-quarter expectations.
Revenue from Intel's client computing business, which caters to PC makers and is still the biggest contributor to sales, rose 2% to $10 billion in the fourth quarter, beating FactSet estimates of $9.74 billion.
Shares in Advanced Micro Devices Inc (O:AMD), Intel's biggest rival in the processor market, rose about 0.8% after Intel's results. 
""AMD (stock) is up because Intel saw flattish PC demand even as PC units were up, which implies AMD likely saw strong PC demand,"" Cascend Securities analyst Eric Ross told Reuters.
Net revenue rose 8.3% to $20.21 billion, beating estimate of $19.23 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Excluding items, the company earned $1.52 per share, above estimates of $1.25.

""I have... determined that additional action is necessary to eliminate circumvention of the adjustments to (tariff-rate quotas) on large residential washing machines, by ensuring that within-quota quantities of imports of washers are spread throughout the year,"" he said in a presidential proclamation.
Under the original quota system, an annual limit was placed on washer imports. As of Feb.7, the administration will allocate the quota on a quarterly basis, with within-quota quantities of 1.2 million washers.
The Trump administration announced https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lg-elec-tariffs/lg-electronics-plans-to-hike-u-s-washer-prices-by-4-8-percent-after-tariffs-idUSKBN1FS0DA in 2018 it would impose tariffs of up to 50 percent on imports of washing machines and key components.

In response to the tariffs,  LG Electronics Inc  (KS:066570) said last year it would raise prices of its washing machines in the United States by about 4 to 8 percent.

1529,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2020 06:24PM ET</span>",U.S. bank regulator charges ex-Wells Fargo executives for role in sales scandal,"By Chris Prentice and Imani Moise
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co's U.S. regulator on Thursday announced it had banned former Chief Executive John Stumpf from the banking industry and charged him and seven other former executives combined more than $58 million in civil penalties for their roles in the bank's multi-year sales practices scandal.
The action by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) marks a rare example of senior executives being held personally accountable for failing to put a stop to misconduct at their bank. It also broke new ground for the regulator, which forced Stumpf to pay $17.5 million to settle the charges against him - the largest ever penalty it has secured from an individual. 
The OCC's probe is one of several into the San Francisco-based lender, with investigations by the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission ongoing. One person with knowledge of the OCC probe said it was far-reaching and that more individuals could be charged.
""We do not expect these penalties will end Wells Fargo's troubles in Washington...Yet this is still a positive development for Wells Fargo as this was a hurdle that the bank was always going to have to clear,"" said Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at Cowen Washington Research Group, in a note.
Some of the OCC's findings, though, contradict Wells Fargo's 2017 board report into the scandal, which largely pinned the blame on a small number of executives, in particular the bank's former retail banking head Carrie Tolstedt. But on Thursday, the OCC said many members of the bank's senior leadership were culpable, a finding that is likely to spark further questions by lawmakers who may push for criminal convictions, said Sieberg. 
In addition to Stumpf, former human resources head Hope Hardison and Michael Loughlin, former chief risk officer, settled the OCC's charges for $2.25 million and $1.25 million, respectively, the OCC said. 
Stumpf, who could not immediately be reached for comment, also agreed to a lifetime ban on working for an OCC-regulated bank. He abruptly left the company in October 2016 after a nearly a decade at the helm.
Five other former executives refused to settle, including Tolstedt who is facing a potential $25 million civil monetary penalty, James Strother, the former general counsel, and Claudia Russ Anderson, the former community bank group risk officer, who both face $5 million fines. They and two auditing executives may ultimately fight the charges before a judge under the OCC's administrative process. 
""Throughout her career, Ms. Tolstedt acted with the utmost integrity and concern for doing the right thing. A full and fair examination of the facts will vindicate Carrie,"" a lawyer for Tolstedt said in a statement.
In a statement, Strother's lawyer said the former Wells Fargo executive ""acted with the utmost integrity and transparency"" and that the OCC’s charges are ""false and unfounded."" 
Russ Anderson could not immediately be reached for comment. 
In a memo to Wells Fargo employees, CEO Charlie Scharf said the company was reviewing Thursday's filings and will determine what, if any, further action is appropriate in respect to any of the individuals who were named. The memo added that the bank would not make any remaining compensation payments that may be owed to those individuals in the meantime.
INDIVIDUAL MISCONDUCT
Wells Fargo, the country's fourth largest U.S. lender, has paid out more than $4 billion in fines and penalties since the 2016 revelation that the bank's sales practices encouraged employees to open potentially millions of unauthorized bank accounts in order to hit lofty sales targets. 
Since then, internal and external probes have uncovered issues in each of Wells Fargo's major business lines, including wealth management and the commercial bank. The fallout has also resulted in the Federal Reserve imposing an unprecedented growth restriction on Wells Fargo's balance sheet until it proves it has fixed its risk management and controls.
While Wells Fargo has inked multiple federal and private settlements for its sales practices, the OCC action marks the first federal action against individuals for their roles in the scandal, instead of just the institution. 
In its complaint, the OCC said that senior bank leadership must have been aware of rampant sales misconduct, citing large numbers of employee complaints and years' worth of other evidence. For example, an internal investigation conducted by the bank in 2004 found that instances in which staff ""gamed"" the sales system to meet targets climbed 979% from 2000 to 2004.

The number of calls to the bank's internal ethics hotline steadily climbed from 2006 through 2014, the OCC said, with nearly half of all cases investigated related to sales misconduct.

The inquiry is still in an early phase and has been overshadowed by an ongoing corruption trial centering on the 2011 purchase of a Nigerian oilfield by Eni and oil major Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L:RDSa).
Milan prosecutors opened the obstruction case in 2018 to investigate whether in 2015 and 2016 Eni officials had sought to discredit two independent board members who later became witnesses in the Nigeria case.
On Thursday tax police searched the offices of Claudio Granata, chief services and stakeholder relations officer; Michele Bianco, executive vice president of legal affairs; and Alfio Rapisarda, senior vice president of security, the sources said.
Eni, which itself is under investigation, said it was confident the prosecutors' inquiries would show it was extraneous to the whole matter.
""Eni reiterates its firm view it was an offended party,"" the company said.
Prosecutors have not laid any charges against Eni officials or the group itself and their investigation may not lead to charges.
Thursday's searches were carried out in relation to alleged attempts to convince a former Eni manager to withdraw some statements he made during investigations into the Nigerian corruption case."

U.S. stocks eked out a small advance, dodging the losses that took hold in Europe and Asia, as investors evaluated the risk that a deadly respiratory virus spreading from China could curb global growth. Treasuries climbed and crude oil dropped.
Gains for big tech companies overshadowed losses for makers of consumer goods, providing just enough lift to send the Nasdaq Composite Index toward a record high. Other markets showed greater concern about the potential fallout, with oil sinking to its lowest level since November on speculation the virus could dent demand. Government bonds and the yen rallied as investors sought a haven.
Earlier, China’s Shanghai Composite Index plunged 2.8% on the last trading day before the Lunar New Year holiday, the biggest drop in eight months, as traders considered the virus’s potential impact on travel and shopping.
While corporate earnings have beaten analysts’ estimates this season amid signals that global growth is picking up, investors are cautious with stocks trading at lofty valuations. Fewer than 20 deaths have been tallied from the Chinese virus, and the World Health Organization opted against calling the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, but traders are hesitant to take on risk on the chance the outbreak could develop into something like the much more devastating SARS respiratory illness that emerged in China 17 years ago.
“There is concern that this may become a much bigger event,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist for Prudential Financial Inc (NYSE:PRU). “The market is vulnerable to a pullback or a consolidation.”
Elsewhere, emerging-market stocks fell to a two-week low. Mining companies led the Stoxx Europe 600 Index lower. The euro weakened after policy makers held interest rates steady and European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said officials will look into the potential side effects of negative interest rates.

1535,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 23, 2020 04:46PM ET</span>",Cboe Chief Says Early Hedging of U.S. Election Is ‘Unprecedented’,"(Bloomberg) -- In 30 years at the premier U.S. options exchange, Ed Tilly has never seen an election sow more anxiety than the 2020 presidential race.
The chief executive officer of Cboe Global Markets Inc. made the observation at a luncheon in New York on Thursday. Tilly highlighted elevated demand for protection around important dates in the primary campaign and general vote showing up in the term structure of implied volatility.
“The demand for hedging and hedging vehicles is really amazing,” he said. It’s “unprecedented” this early in an election cycle.
Futures and options tied to the Cboe Volatility Index are among the exchange’s proprietary products. The VIX, or so-called “fear gauge,” measures the 30-day implied volatility of the S&P 500 based on out-of-the-money options prices.
Open interest in the October VIX 2020 futures contract has surged since Jan. 8 to reach 5,866. By Super Tuesday in 2016, the October contract’s open interest was below 400.
These futures are generally in a uniformly upward-sloping curve structure known as contango. But the October 2020 contract, whose expiration value will be linked to options that expire after the general election, trades at a premium of more than 2 percentage points to the November contract.
Back in 2016, the October VIX contract rarely traded at a premium to the November contract.
Wall Street strategists have also observed that the February contract, which will derive its expiration value from options encompassing the Super Tuesday primary votes, has remained stubbornly high because of the eventful political calendar.
Won’t Get Fooled Again
The surprising results of the 2016 election spurred a variety of rare, so-called multi-sigma moves across different asset classes. This time, equity investors aren’t going to be caught making the same mistake. Though, naturally, they could be just as wrong about the market impact this time around.
Pravit Chintawongvanich, Wells Fargo’s equity derivatives strategist, highlighted a bid for implied volatility around the September to December 2020 period as early as August 2019; a high premium around Super Tuesday had built up by November.
The 2016 election “couldn’t keep a bid” in volatility futures because it was presumed that either Hillary Clinton or a generic Republican would win, according to the strategist. After Donald Trump captured the Republican nomination, the former secretary of state was a presumptive “shoo-in” in the eyes of market participants.
“The 2016 elections were not regarded as a real event because the outcome was presumed to be ‘known,’ while the 2020 elections are regarded as a true event,” he said. “The 2020 elections are being very closely watched as each of the plausible scenarios could mean quite different things for future U.S. fiscal policy, foreign policy, the regulatory environment, and by extension U.S. and global economic growth.”"

Investing.com – Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) on Thursday reported a stronger-than-expected outlook on profit in the upcoming quarter after topping analysts' estimates on both the top and bottom lines, led by strong growth in its data-center business.
For the first quarter, Intel said it expected to report earnings of $1.30 a share on revenue of $19 billion, above estimates for earnings of $1.03 a share and revenue of $17.2 billion.
 
 

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) announced earnings per share of $1.52 on revenue of $20.21 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $1.25 on revenue of $19.2 billion. That compared with EPS of $1.28 on revenue of $18.66 billion in the same period a year earlier. Intel had announced EPS of $1.42 on revenue of $19.19 billion in the previous quarter.
The company attributed the stronger results to rising sales for chips used in data centers and growing demand for higher-performance products used in personal computers and related devices.
Revenue for its client computing group was up 1.9% to $10.01 billion. Its higher-margin, data-center business saw a 19% revenue increase to $7.2 billion.
“In 2019, we gained share in an expanded addressable market that demands more performance to process, move and store data,” said Bob Swan, Intel CEO. “One year into our long-term financial plan, we have outperformed our revenue and EPS expectations. Looking ahead, we are investing to win the technology inflections of the future, play a bigger role in the success of our customers and increase shareholder returns.""

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) share's are up 5.8% for the year to date and is trading at $63.32 , still down 0.60% from its 52-week high of $63.70 set on January 23.

""After the powerful rally this year in computer chip manufacturer shares, these companies now have little room for error. Investors have built a strong bullish case for the sector that went through a big selloff in 2018, after getting hurt by escalating trade war between the U.S. and China.Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is certainly well-positioned to take advantage of this strength,"" Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar said. 
""In 3Q earnings report, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) raised its full-year guidance as it benefited from the surging investments in datacenters by large corporations, such as Amazon (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:MSFT). On the PC side, things also look quite bright for Intel, which is the largest parts supplier for the industry,"" he said.

""Fourth-quarter sales of personal computers were the best the industry has seen in years, according to data released last week by market research firms IDC and Gartner,"" he added. ""With these positive catalysts, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) needs to show that it’s making progress in overcoming its production challenges and it is on track to bring to the market the most efficient and powerful chips in the highest volumes. Intel's biggest competitive threat right now is coming from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), which is quickly gaining market share.""

1541,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2020 03:17PM ET</span>","American, Southwest say demand helping competitors while 737 MAX sits parked","By Tracy Rucinski and Allison Lampert
(Reuters) - Healthy travel demand is cushioning results for  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) and Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV), the two said on Thursday, while warning they are losing customers as their Boeing 737 MAX jets remain parked in a global grounding. 
American and Southwest, the two largest U.S. operators of Boeing Co's (N:BA) 737 MAX aircraft that has been grounded since March following two deadly crashes, said they do not have enough aircraft to meet the demand they see in the market.
Both airlines have canceled flights into early June as they operate slimmer fleets but said on Thursday that cancellations would likely extend into the summer or fall after Boeing signaled this week that it does not expect to win regulatory approval for the jets to fly again until mid-year.
Southwest CEO Gary Kelly said the airline is losing 6 million to 7 million customers a year due to the 737 MAX grounding, but said he expects to ""aggressively recapture"" lost market share once the jets return.
""There's a lot of pent-up demand for traveling on American. We're not going to be able to meet it all,"" American CEO Doug Parker told CNBC. ""It's going to unfortunately go to some of our competitors.""
Even without the MAX, both airlines reported solid quarterly profits and pointed to strong first-quarter bookings.
Shares of American Airlines gained 2.6% to $28.03 while Southwest shares were up 3.5% at $55.35.
After regulators give the green light, airlines will still need a month or longer to prepare the jets and their pilots.
For Southwest, the world's largest 737 MAX operator with nearly 10,000 pilots, the training process will take at least a couple of months more than the 30 days that it initially expected now that Boeing is recommending simulator training rather than just computer based training.
Parker said it was too soon to see any impact from the coronavirus that has emerged from Wuhan, China, but said the carrier is working with U.S. public health officials. In response to the outbreak, passengers are being screened as a precaution at airports around the world.
Southwest does not fly to Asia.
For 2020, American said it expects 2020 full-year adjusted earnings between $4 and $6 per share, an estimate some analysts said they thought was conservative.
Southwest, which had bet its entire growth strategy on the 737 MAX, did not provide 2020 guidance given continued uncertainty around when the jets will fly again.
Both companies struck partial compensation deals with Boeing over 737 MAX damages in 2019 and said they expect additional settlements this year.

Smaller U.S. airline JetBlue also posted quarterly earnings on Thursday that showed it delivering on a three-year cost-cutting drive, sending its shares higher.

Investing.com – Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) surged on Thursday as one analyst suggested the streaming giant may be set to win big as Comcast's subscriber losses indicate cord cutting is far from over.
Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) reported a net loss of 133,000 residential video subscribers and warned that the pace of subscriber loss may continue, many of whom may likely turn to Netflix for the streaming needs, said Stifel analyst Scott Devitt 
""Comparing Netflix to introductory pricing and/or inferior over-the-top products as a justification for worrying about the competitive climate is missing the fact that the cable, telecom and satellite video industry (where all the money is) is shrinking with no end in sight,"" Devitt says.
The bullish note on Netflix comes just days after the streaming giant reported better-than-expected quarterly results, but projected weaker subscription additions than expected for the current quarter.
Netflix projected a gain of 7 million paid subscribers worldwide in the first quarter, missing estimates of the 7.82 million.
The company has seen its growth come under pressure as growth in its core U.S. market has slowed at a time when competition has intensified with the arrival of new streaming incumbents like Disney+ and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) TV."

Investing.com – Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) fell Thursday and while that’s not unusual for a stock that is the sole public bellwether for plant-based meat substitutes, there’s an interesting twist.
Shares of Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) fell 2% in afternoon trading.
There’s no denying that investors may want to take money off the table after BYND's recent run. The stock is up more than 55% since the start of the year, including today's and yesterday’s slide.
Shares fell after it was announced that Softbank had led fundraising for Memphis Meats to the tune of $161 million.
Memphis Meats makes its products from animal cells in labs, differing from companies like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, which develop their meat alternatives from plant-based proteins.
Plant-based meat and other meat alternatives are soaring in popularity, with millennials and Gen Z consumers increasingly shunning beef, poultry and pork for environmental and health reasons.
But close to the end of trading yesterday, Bloomberg reported that the largest franchisee of Burger King, Carrols Restaurant Group, would be discounting Impossible Whoppers as sales had tapered off.
The burger was moved to the two-for-$6 menu in more than 1,000 Burger Kings restaurants.
Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) caught a bid just before the close yesterday on that news, perhaps on hopes that it could get the Burger King supplier deal. But then tapered off and the selling continued today as there are worries that plant-based burgers just don’t cut it.
Bill Oakley, a television writer and former showrunner for “The Simpsons,” now runs a very influential fast food review on Instagram.
His conclusion was that the plant-based Impossible Whopper is only 70% as good as the original Whopper.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street struggled for direction on Thursday as investors digested mixed earnings and developing news about the coronavirus outbreak emanating from China.
Healthcare and financial shares helped pull stocks into the red through much of the session.
But news that  Gilead Sciences Inc  (O:GILD) was assessing its experimental Ebola drug as a possible treatment for the virus helped stocks pare their losses, and pushed the Nasdaq into positive territory. 
Health officials in China put millions of people on lockdown in efforts to contain a coronavirus outbreak that has so far claimed 18 lives, but the World Health Organization (WHO) announced it was ""a bit too early"" to declare the virus a global health emergency. 
""It feels like the coronavirus story is a convenient excuse to take a little profit, sit back and reassess,"" David Lafferty, chief market strategist at Nataxis Investment Managers in Boston. ""The indexes have become so over bought it feels like it needed a little bit of a breather and I think that's what the coronavirus (sell-off) is really about."" 
The outbreak has strained global equity markets, just as millions of Chinese are preparing to travel ahead of the Lunar New Year.
Additionally, a spate of earnings reports, while beating Street estimates in many cases, have failed to impress investors.
""The market is pricing a real turn in earnings for 2020,"" Lafferty added. ""If you tell me that companies are meeting estimates and the guidance is still positive it tells me that expectations were higher than people thought.""
Fourth-quarter reporting season gathers steam, with 74 companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 67.6% have beat consensus expectations, according to Refinitiv data.
Analysts now see fourth-quarter earnings contracting by 0.7% from a year ago.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 51.28 points, or 0.18%, to 29,134.99, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 0.93 points, or 0.03%, to 3,320.82 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 8.26 points, or 0.09%, to 9,392.03.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, six were trading in the red. Healthcare (SPXHC) was the biggest percentage loser, while industrials (SPLRCI) enjoyed the largest gain.
Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG) results fell short of analyst expectations for the first time in five quarters, sending the consumer products company's stock down 1.0%.
Insurance bellwether Travelers Cos Inc (N:TRV) reported better-than-expected quarterly profit, with underwriting gains tripling and catastrophe losses falling. Nevertheless, the company's shares were down 5.3%, and were the biggest drag on the blue-chip Dow.
Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA) beat Street estimates but lost more subscribers than analysts expected, sending its shares down 3.6%.
Freeport McMoRan (N:FCX) results also came in above expectations, but investors focused on the mining company's drop in Indonesia production. Its stock fell 5.6%.
Among winners,  Union Pacific  Corp (N:UNP) gained 3.1% after the rail operator said the Phase 1 U.S.-China trade pact should reverse slumping volumes.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.23-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.23-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 45 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 80 new highs and 42 new lows.

1545,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2020 02:00PM ET</span>",French investigators to move ahead with Ghosn prosecution over palace party,"By Simon Carraud and Elizabeth Pineau
PARIS (Reuters) - French prosecutors investigating a party that former Renault-Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn threw for his wife at the sumptuous Versailles palace will in the next few weeks ask judges to examine the case, bringing a prosecution a step closer.
Prosecutors have been investigating whether Ghosn - now in Lebanon after he last month fled prosecution in Japan on financial misconduct charges - knowingly used company resources to throw a party that was for private purposes. 
An official with the prosecutor's office in Nanterre, near Paris, which has been handling the investigation, told Reuters a judge or judges would be assigned to pursue the case against Ghosn.
The judges have wider powers than prosecutors to pursue a criminal case. They can, in certain circumstances, order the detention of a suspect pending trial, or issue an international arrest warrant if the suspect is abroad.
Asked by Reuters to comment, Jean-Yves Le Borgne, one of Ghosn's legal team, said Ghosn had done nothing wrong over the party, but there may have been a misunderstanding between Versailles and party planners working for Ghosn.
The lawyer said Ghosn had offered to pay back the 50,000 euros ($55,470) cost of renting the venue for the party.
""Carlos Ghosn is ready to answer French justice. Regarding his possible travel to France, things are complicated,"" Le Borgne added, citing a travel ban imposed by Lebanese prosecutors, and an international Interpol notice requesting Ghosn's arrest, as demanded by Japanese authorities. 
 Renault  (PA:RENA) did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Ghosn was once a giant of the global auto industry but is now a fugitive from Japanese justice. He last month slipped out of Japan, where he was subject to strict bail conditions, managing to board a private jet to Turkey and from there flying to Lebanon, his childhood home.
He says the Japanese charges were fabricated as part of a plot to oust him from the Renault-Nissan alliance.
HOME OF FRENCH KINGS 
The party at Versailles, principal residence of generations of French kings until the French revolution of 1789, took place on Oct. 8, 2016. Ghosn said it was to mark the 50th birthday of his wife, Carole.
The case revolves around whether Ghosn was aware that Renault would end up footing the bill.
Ghosn has denied any wrongdoing. He said the event was never presented as a corporate party, and he believed the venue was being offered free to him personally as a goodwill gesture by Versailles.
He said he was later surprised to find out that it cost 50,000 euros and that the amount had been deducted from an allocation for the use of Versailles that Renault had been given in exchange for financing a renovation of the chateau.
However, a spokeswoman for Versailles Palace said it was clear at the time the party took place that the event was presented as corporate in nature, and that the ultimate client the venue was dealing with was Renault-Nissan.
""There was nothing which would allow us to believe this dinner was anything other than a corporate event.""

She said that Versailles had documents demonstrating the parties were presented as corporate events, and said that Versailles was ready to share them with investigators. She declined to disclose the documents to Reuters.

The ratings agency said its expects Boeing's funds from operations (FFO) to debt ratio to fall below 30% in 2020, following the plane manufacturer's announcement earlier this week that the 737 MAX will not win approval for a return service until mid-year.

MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - Euphoric stock markets celebrated the China-U.S. trade truce by marking record highs but European auto shares continue to suffer, reflecting the stress the industry is under and fears U.S. President Donald Trump will target Europe next.
There's no shortage of issues which could trigger a fresh trade row between the continent and the United States, from plans for a tax on big digital companies like Amazon (O:AMZN) and Facebook (O:FB) and subsidies for Airbus (PA:AIR), to the involvement of China's Huawei in building 5G networks and different approaches to tackling Iran's nuclear program.
Autos look particularly vulnerable, and this week's meeting of world leaders in the Swiss mountain resort of Davos gave Trump his latest stage from which to threaten a 25% tariff on car imports from the European Union, if the bloc doesn't agree to a trade deal.
Tariffs would be an additional blow as carmakers struggle with an auto industry downturn, particularly in key market China, and the need to increase electric vehicle investment as several countries move to eventually ban combustion engines.
On Thursday, auto stocks (SXAP) were among the top fallers in Europe, down 2%, making them the worst sectoral performers so far in 2020.
Last year, they fell 17% while the broader European Stoxx 600 index (STOXX) had its best year in a decade with a 23% rise.
Since late last year, auto shares also have decoupled from Germany's DAX (GDAXI), the export oriented index of Europe's largest economy, plunging to a 10-year low relative to the index.
(Graphic: European autos vs DAX, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1474/1449/European%20autos%20chart.png)
""Trump has long been lamenting about the trade imbalance with Europe and this could be another card to play during the presidential election year,"" said Michele Pedroni, fund manager at Decalia in Geneva.
""(He) has already taken or threatened action, for example in the auto sector, which is among the most sensitive to trade. Not all of his threats were just rhetoric,"" added Pedroni.
While the signing of a ""Phase 1"" trade deal between Washington and Beijing has removed some of the uncertainty hanging over markets and dampening global business sentiment, the relief could prove short-lived for Europe if Trump's attention shifts, leaving German luxury cars first in the firing line.
TRADE WAR PRESSURE
Evercore ISI has estimated that VW (DE:VOWG) faces a 2.5 billion euro hit if the U.S. imposes 25% tariffs on EU imports, with  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) facing a 2 billion-euro blow and BMW (DE:BMWG) 1.7 billion euros.
""Investors need to be vigilant"", said Maximilian Kunkel, Chief Investment Officer Germany at UBS GMW in Frankfurt.
The U.S. is the main export destination for EU-made cars. According to Eurostat, cars from the bloc accounted for 29% of total U.S. auto imports in 2018, well ahead of China's 17%.
""There is indeed trade war pressure on the sector, that’s something we talk about with investors”, said Roland Kaloyan, head of European equity strategy at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
However, he added that while European carmakers are commonly used as a proxy for trade tensions with the U.S., the risk that they won't be able to curb emissions in time to abide by new EU rules was also weighing on the sector.
Daimler’s latest profit warning on Wednesday, one in a long line from European auto and auto parts makers, highlighted the stress the sector is under, Kaloyan said, adding that the expected upswing in global auto sales may also disappoint.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - From June 30,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) will only help take a company public if it has at least one diverse board member, as such companies perform better after listing, Chief Executive David Solomon said on CNBC on Thursday. 
The policy will apply to U.S. and European companies and will increase over time, with the bank requiring two diverse board members starting in June 2021, Goldman Chief Executive David Solomon said on CNBC.
Solomon did not define what the company meant by ""diverse"" candidates, but said the focus was on women.
""We're not going to take a company public unless there's one diverse board candidate with a focus on women,"" he said.
The decision comes as more than 60 U.S. and European companies went public in the last two years without any female board members, the bank said. 
Citing its own data, Goldman said companies with greater diversity performed better in the markets. 
Those with at least one diverse board member saw a 44% jump in their average share price within a year of going public, versus 13% at companies with no diverse board members.
""We think it's the right advice and we're in a position also because of our network to help our clients if they need help placing women on boards,"" Solomon said on CNBC. 
Goldman Sachs will not turn away companies that lack diverse boards at the outset, and it said it currently has some clients that will need help meeting this new standard. The bank said it would introduce executives of these companies to qualified potential candidates. 
Ultimately, the bank will not take the company public if it does not meet this new standard, Solomon said. 
On Goldman's own board, four out of 11 directors are women and its lead director since 2014, Adebayo Ogunlesi, is black. 
The new policy follows similar diverse hiring targets announced at the bank last spring. 
In March 2019, the bank set a goal that half of all new analysts and entry-level associates it hired would be women, 11% would be black professionals and 14% will be Latino professionals in the United States. 
In Britain, the bank aims for 9% of all new analysts and entry-level hires to be black professionals. 
At more senior hiring levels, the bank is requiring that at least two diverse qualified candidates are interviewed for any open role. Senior members of management are judged on whether they meet these targets in the determination of their pay.

DETROIT (Reuters) - A U.S. regulator said it will review part of a recommendation made last fall that India's Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (NS:MAHM) infringed upon the intellectual property rights of  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles' (MI:FCHA) Jeep SUV design.
The International Trade Commission (ITC) on Wednesday said it would review an administrative law judge's initial determination last November that Mahindra's Roxor off-road utility vehicle infringed on the ""trade dress"" of FCA's Jeep. The judge recommended the commission bar entry of Mahindra vehicles or parts that infringe and issue a cease-and-desist order.
Trade dress consists of the unique characteristics that make a product stand apart and is generally accepted as identified with that product by the public. For example, FCA sees Jeep's grille and round headlights as distinct to the brand.
The commission, which in September 2018 initially opened its investigation, said on Wednesday it is targeting completion of the inquiry by March 20.
If the ITC recommends a form of remedy, the U.S. Trade Representative would have 60 days to approve, disapprove or take no action on that determination.
Mahindra, which previously has called FCA's claims without merit, on Thursday welcomed the commission's review.
""We are optimistic that the ITC will in its review conclude that FCA did not establish previously unclaimed U.S. rights in trade dress and that there was no infringement of either trade dress or registered trademarks,"" the company said in an emailed statement.
Mahindra said it has launched its model year 2020 Roxor with what it described as ""significant styling changes"" and said it would make additional changes if the ITC required it.
FCA was unconcerned the commission will overturn the judge's initial recommendation.
""Review is a part of the commission process,"" the Italian-American automaker said in an emailed statement on Thursday. ""Based on the facts and law, FCA US remains confident the administrative law judge's initial determination of violation by Mahindra will be adopted by the commission.""
The Roxor is assembled in Auburn Hills, north of Detroit, by Mahindra's North American subsidiary."
1556,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2020 11:27AM ET</span>",Comcast results beat forecasts on broadband growth; 'Cats' hits NBC Universal unit,"By Helen Coster and Neha Malara
(Reuters) - Comcast Corp (O:CSA) on Thursday beat Wall Street's revenue and profit estimates due to growth in broadband customers, but the company lost more cable TV subscribers than Wall Street expected and its NBC Universal unit revenues were hurt as the film ""Cats"" bombed at the box office.
Management said on the earnings call that it expected accelerating cable TV subscriber declines, which helped push the stock down 1.3%. Other media company shares were also down. 
""With the rate adjustments that we are implementing in 2020 as well as the ongoing changes in consumer behavior, we expect higher video subscriber losses this year,"" said Chief Financial Officer Michael Cavanagh. 
Pay TV companies have been raising rates instead of trying to hang on to bargain-chasers who are cutting cable service. In the fourth quarter Comcast lost 149,000 video customers, more than a loss of 139,000 estimated by research firm FactSet, but fewer than the 238,000 video customers it lost in the third quarter.
The company has been vocal about its effort to chase broadband customers to offset cord-cutting, as viewers who stream TV and film require a broadband connection to do so.
It gained 442,000 broadband subscribers in the quarter, beating analysts' average estimate of 378,000 net additions, according to FactSet. Revenue from that business grew 8.8% to $4.79 billion.
Comcast will enter the streaming video war on April 15, when it launches its advertising-supported Peacock streaming service to Comcast customers, followed by a launch across the United States on July 15.
The company reported fourth-quarter revenue of $28.4 billion, beating the Wall Street consensus estimate of $28.17 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Revenue growth was aided by British pay-TV group Sky, which the company acquired for $39 billion in 2018. The business generated fourth-quarter revenue of $5.04 billion, beating the average estimate of $4.82 billion.
For the fourth quarter Comcast's NBCUniversal segment, which includes NBC Entertainment and Universal Pictures, reported revenue of $9.15 billion, down 2.6% from a year earlier. Revenue at the filmed entertainment unit fell 21% from the same quarter a year earlier.
Net income attributable to Comcast rose to $3.16 billion, or 68 cents per share, from $2.51 billion, or 55 cents per share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, the company earned 79 cents per share. Analysts on average had estimated the company to earn 76 cents.

Comcast increased its dividend by 10% to $0.92 per share on an annualized basis for 2020.

1557,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2020 11:09AM ET</span>",Tesla overtakes Volkswagen as world's second most valuable carmaker,"By Josephine Mason
(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) has overtaken Germany's Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) as the world's second most valuable carmaker behind Japan's Toyota (T:7203), as the meteoric rise in the U.S. electric vehicle maker's shares reshuffles the global market.
Tesla's stock has more than doubled in value in the last three months, with its market capitalization piercing $100 billion on Wednesday, a first for a listed U.S. automaker.
During the rally, its value has leapfrogged more established global rivals: Honda (T:7267), BMW (DE:BMWG), General Motors (N:GM) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn). On Wednesday, it eclipsed VW's $99.4 billion value.
Toyota still holds pole position with a market cap of $233 billion.
The recent gains have been fueled by a surprise third-quarter profit, progress at a new factory in China and better-than-expected car deliveries in the fourth quarter.
Many investors remain skeptical that Tesla can consistently deliver profit, cash flow and growth.
But the gains highlight growing confidence among investors about the future of electric vehicles and Tesla's shift from a niche car maker into a global leader in cleaner cars.
A glance at its results shows it has a long way to go before it can eclipse larger rivals. 
Based on 12-month forward sales estimates, it doesn't even appear in the top 20 in the world. The company's sales will reach $31 billion, a slither of Toyota's $276 billion, VW's $283 billion and Daimler's $191 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

The authorities closed down public transport into and out of Wuhan and six other cities in the region around it, in an effort to stem the spread of the disease that has already been detected in most of China’s biggest cities.
But a loss of momentum in corporate earnings also played a part in the sell-off on Wall Street.
Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) fell 0.5% - although it pared earlier losses – after its upgraded guidance failed to meet the expectations of investors who have seen big improvements in profitability over the last two years.
Elsewhere, Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) fell 2.4% after reporting that it continued to hemorrhage cable TV customers and embarked on what could be an investment-heavy task of rivalling CNN in global news.
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) overcame an early stumble after its results to trade up 1.8% while American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) was flat, as strong guidance for 2020 offset weaker-than-expected figures for the three months through December.
  Union Pacific   (NYSE:UNP) rose 3.1% after its chief executive struck an upbeat note after a rocky fourth quarter, saying that the U.S.-China trade deal should help stop the slump in freight volumes.
Elsewhere, oil stock continued to suffer as U.S. crude futures tumbled another 3%, crashing through $55 a barrel for the first time in two months. Refiners Valero (NYSE:VLO) and Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) both lost 1.5%, while shale driller Continental Resources fell 2.3%.

The candidates include Kim Fennebresque, former chief executive of Cowen Group, and Jacob Katz, former chairman of Grant Thornton.
""HP shareholders have told us they believe our acquisition proposal will bring tremendous value, which is why we lined up $24 billion in binding financing commitments and a slate of highly qualified director candidates,"" said John Visentin, Xerox's chief executive officer.
In November, Xerox made the $33.5 billion cash-and-stock offer to HP, a company more than three times its size. HP had rejected Xerox's offer, saying it significantly undervalued the company.
On Thursday, HP responded to Xerox's decision to nominate candidates by again saying the bid undervalues HP. ""These nominations are a self-serving tactic by Xerox to advance its proposal, which significantly undervalues HP and creates meaningful risk to the detriment of HP shareholders,"" HP said in the statement.
Activist investor Carl Icahn, who has a 4.2% stake in HP and a 10.9% stake in Xerox, in December urged HP shareholders who agreed to the merger to reach out to the PC maker's directors for immediate action.

Earlier this month, Xerox said it had secured $24 billion in financing for the proposal. HP, however, rebuffed the talks again and said the proposal still undervalued the company.

(Reuters) - Indian airline SpiceJet Ltd (NS:SPJT) expects a ""substantial"" profit hit from the grounding of Boeing's (N:BA) 737 MAX aircraft, co-founder and chairman Ajay Singh said on Thursday.
The budget carrier is in active talks with the planemaker on compensation for 737 MAX-related costs, Singh told the Reuters Global Markets Forum, adding he expected a payment from Boeing to compensate some of the lost profit and he wants to give the U.S. firm ""every possible opportunity"" to recover before turning to rival Airbus (PA:AIR).
Below are excerpts from the interview, conducted on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland:
Question (Q) - How is the conversation with Boeing progressing on compensation? How much of a hit in profit do you think SpiceJet will take due to the 737 MAX delay?
Answer (A) - We are talking actively and hope to have an offer from them soon. It (the profit hit) is substantial but will hopefully be covered by the compensation.
Q - What feedback are you getting from Boeing on when the 737 MAX might be ready to fly again? After that, how soon do you expect to get all regulatory approvals?
A - Boeing has told us that they expect the test flight in February and certification by March or April. We expect (India's) Directorate General of Civil Aviation approval in April as well, and hope to be ready to fly in May or June.
Q - Do you see Airbus able to fill the gap created after the Boeing accidents? What sort of order are you looking at with Airbus, if it came to that?
A - We want to give every possible opportunity to Boeing to come through, given that they have been our long standing partners. But we continue to engage actively with Airbus.
(The order size) depends on the length of delay at Boeing and the offer from Airbus.
Q - How many planes have you had to take on a short-term lease because of the MAX grounding?
A - We were lucky that we got about 32 planes from Jet (Airways) (NS:JET) .
We have also taken 6 planes on a wet lease. Our capacity has grown by 50% this year despite the MAX grounding.
Q – Would you like the government to take any particular measures in the upcoming budget?
A - We hope that they can reduce excise duty on aviation turbine fuel back to 8%, with some movement on maintenance, repair, and overhaul.

1565,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2020 09:20AM ET</span>","Insys founder faces stiff prison sentence, $100 million-plus in forfeiture","By Tim McLaughlin
BOSTON (Reuters) - John Kapoor, the founder of  Insys Therapeutics Inc  (PK:INSYQ), on Thursday could be sentenced to several years in prison and ordered to forfeit up to $113 million for his role in a bribery and fraud scheme that contributed to the U.S. opioid crisis.
U.S. Attorney in Boston Andrew Lelling has asked the court to sentence Kapoor to 15 years in prison and seek more than $113 million from him.
U.S. District Court Judge Allison D. Burroughs already has sentenced four other former Insys executives, but her punishments have been less than three years in prison on government recommendations of more than 10 years. 
Kapoor is scheduled to become the highest-ranking pharmaceutical executive to be sentenced in a case linked to the opioid crisis. 
Last year, a federal jury in Boston found Kapoor guilty of racketeering conspiracy in a scheme that involved bribing doctors to prescribe the company's fentanyl-based painkiller, Subsys. The scheme also defrauded insurers into paying for the drug. 
From 1999 to 2017, some 400,000 people died from overdoses involving an opioid, including prescription and illicit drugs, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
""Kapoor was the company's founder ... who did not hesitate to use the authority of his financial position to dictate the criminal strategies employed by Insys,"" Lelling's office wrote in a filing with the court.
""He was the principal leader, who personally approved, and thereafter enforced, the corrupt strategies employed throughout the conspiracy. This crime would not have happened, could not have happened, without John Kapoor,"" the filing said.
Kapoor, who served as the Chandler, Arizona-based drugmaker's chairman and later chief executive, lost nearly $80 million through his association with Insys, according to court filings by his defense team. Insys filed for bankruptcy protection in 2019.
""He does not expect anyone to feel sorry for him for that loss, and he is of course facing other sentencing consequences that cannot be expressed in monetary terms,"" his defense team said in filings with the court.

In a letter to the judge, Mary Gauwitz, one of many friends who wrote in support of Kapoor, described him as a man who enjoys a $4.99 rotisserie chicken from Costco (NASDAQ:COST). He also made sure everyone at the Editha House in Phoenix, which provides housing and assistance to cancer patients, received rotisserie chickens, too, if they wanted one, Gauwitz wrote.

1567,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2020 08:56AM ET</span>",From Communist-era roots to cash cows: Poland's gaming industry takes on the world,"By Anna Koper and Michael Kahn
WARSAW/PRAGUE (Reuters) - The drab exteriors of a pair of 1970s buildings in an industrial Warsaw neighborhood belie the hive of high-tech activity inside where developers, screenplay writers and others at leading video game maker CD Projekt hustle to create the next global hit. 
Poland -- Eastern Europe's biggest economy -- has quietly developed into a leading video game exporter thanks to low labor costs, a young educated workforce and a thriving gaming tradition rooted in the Communist era.
After CD Projekt's top-selling Witcher series put the country on the map, foreign investors are keenly searching for promising game developers in a fast-growing market.
""People are starting to take notice of Poland,"" said Borys Musielak, founding partner at U.S.-Polish venture capital firm SMOK Ventures, which is in talks with two Asian investors to fund local gaming companies and in January made its first such investment alongside a Finnish partner.
""There have been mainly angel investors and some private equity but now global venture capital groups are looking into the region.""
Poland's booming video game and esports market was worth $664 million in 2019 -- up from $400 million in 2014 -- and is projected to climb to nearly $850 million over the next four years, according to data from PwC.
WITCHER 
The success of CD Projekt's medieval fantasy world Witcher has been a key driver. Based on a series of best-selling Polish books and the basis for a Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) show that premiered in December, the games have sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
The release later this year of the company's first person futuristic adventure game ""Cyberpunk 2077"" is likely to sharpen focus on a sector in which eight companies listed on the main market of the Polish stock exchange between 2015 and 2019.
On the NewConnect market -- the bourse's exchange for smaller companies -- 21 debuted during the same period.
""Historically, a lot of those companies chose the stock exchange to finance themselves because there were not many ways to raise capital,"" said Mariusz Gasiewski, head of mobile gaming and apps at Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in Poland. ""Now it is getting easier as more interest comes from abroad.""
The combined value of the listed gaming companies leapt 82% to more than 32 billion zlotys ($8.36 billion) last year, led by CD Projekt, 11 bit studios, PlayWay and Ten Square (NYSE:SQ) Games, according to exchange data.
Moreover, CD Projekt's roughly 27 billion zloty valuation is rapidly catching up with that of Poland's biggest company, refiner PKN Orlen, at 36 billion zlotys. 
KNOW-HOW
At CD Projekt -- whose headquarters feature Silicon Valley perks such as a gym, film studio and open plan offices -- the company has parlayed Poles' love of video games into a global brand.
""We have been working intensively on increasing the knowledge of CD Projekt among foreign investors,"" the company's president and one of its founders Adam Kicinski told Reuters.
""We are meeting with funds from around the world focusing on western markets, especially in the United States.""
Bigger funding rounds and the tapping of international investors will help Polish companies compete with industry leaders from countries such as China, Japan and the U.S..
""Due to their know-how and appropriate budgets, foreign investors help those companies go from the stage where they create very good games to the absolute top,"" said Stanislaw Just, a former board member of the Polish Games Association who recently started his own company.
Flying Wild Hog, a smaller developer known for the Shadow Warrior series, was acquired by London-based Supernova Capital in 2019, while Artificer, which is working on its debut game, was bought by Dutch-based Good Shepherd Entertainment.
A WORLD WE ALL DREAMED OF 
Poland's love of video games stems from the Communist era when students flocked to street markets to swap pirated games, building up a flourishing community.
""For the previous generation, Rock & Roll was a ticket to the world we all dreamed of, then came the games and we all played to touch what was happening in the West,"" said Grzegorz Miechowski, president of 11 bit studios, whose most popular title ""Frostpunk"" depicts a dystopian 19th Century England. 
Nearly half of Poland's 38 million population identify as gamers, while there are around 400 active gaming companies -- dwarfing an estimated dozen in Germany -- with some 100 Polish titles hitting the global market each year.
The country hosts a popular international video game festival as well as one of the largest esports events in the world - the Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Extreme Masters, which last year drew a record 232 million viewers worldwide.
Miechowski also pointed to Poland's education system which churns out computer science savvy graduates eager to work in game development. 

The government has taken notice too, doling out around 300 million zlotys through a European Union funded program -- the fourth round of which is underway -- to award developers early stage grants to help gaming projects get off the ground.

LONDON (Reuters) - World shares fell on Thursday, led by the biggest tumble in Chinese stocks in more than eight months, as concern mounted about a new coronavirus outbreak in China.
With millions of Chinese preparing to travel for the Lunar New Year, the potential for the disease to spread, along with the tendency of traders to reduce their exposure before holidays, left markets struggling.
Safe options such as Japan's yen and government bonds rose, Wall Street looked set to follow Europe and Asia lower [.EU][.N] and commodity markets saw both oil and metals prices buckle. [O/R][MET/L]
""Ultimately, the coronavirus is a slow-burning but important story for markets that is likely to last for months rather than just a few days,"" said TD Securities' European head of currency strategy, Ned Rumpeltin. ""And the natural go-to currencies when there are headlines like these are the yen and the Swiss franc."" 
The Swiss franc had skipped to a near three-year high against the euro overnight (EURCHF=) but paused in Europe as the focus turned to the day's big central bank action. [/FRX]
Norway had already left its interest rates unchanged, but the main event was the European Central Bank's first meeting of the year, where it is expected to give some pointers on its first formal policy review in 17 years.
Economists expect the review to take most of the year and will span topics from the bank's inflation target to digital money and the fight against climate change.
New ECB President Christine Lagarde has floated radical ideas such as the central bank buying bonds that fund environmental improvements, though the limited number of them at the moment could prove a hurdle. 
""Quite a lot has happened in the last 17 years,"" Rumpeltin added. ""They are due for a rethink.""

1573,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2020 07:52AM ET</span>",Blues health insurers fund U.S. non-profit's generic drug expansion,"By Caroline Humer
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A group of Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers is investing $55 million in a new venture with a non-profit generic drug manufacturer to try to offer cheaper prices on pharmacy drugs to their members, the companies said on Thursday.
The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association and 18 Blue Cross Blue Shield health insurers are working with Civica Rx, a non-profit formed two years ago to try to increase competition for hospital-based generic drugs.
The new subsidiary will focus on drugs that members can purchase via mail order or in retail pharmacies. It aims to launch new rivals starting in 2022 for about 7 to 10 expensive generic drugs where there is currently only one manufacturer, Civica Chairman Dan Liljenquist said. An advisory board will select the drugs.
Civica will be able to sell the drugs at a lower price than a current manufacturer by leveraging the volume of prescriptions among its Blues plans members to guarantee discounts, Liljenquist said. The company may also make drugs itself.
Members will benefit from those lower prices based on their plan design, BCBSA strategy head Maureen Sullivan said. The lower cost the Blues plan pays could mean lower out-of-pocket spending, savings on the overall premium or potentially a lower co-pay or a co-pay waiver for patients, she said.
About 78 percent of the U.S.'s $335 billion in annual drug spending is on copycat versions of branded drugs whose patents have run out, according to the generic industry trade group, the Association for Accesible Medicines.
Large generic drug manufacturers say price competition has driven down the profits of many generic drugs, leading to industry consolidation. That has increased the number of drugs with only one manufacturer, which can result in price spikes on lifesaving medicines.
The U.S. Food & Drug Administration has enacted new policies to try to ease the process for approving new rival generic drugs when there are only one or two existing drugs on the marketplace.
A Civica spokeswoman said that as of the beginning of this year, the company's existing venture was either supplying or producing a total of 18 hospital-based medicines including commonly used medicines like bacitracin, lidocaine and morphine. It uses several generic manufacturers to produce the drugs.
Participating Blues plans include Independence Blue Cross, Blue Shield of California and Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield among others."

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's stock market will not reach its goal to expand by nearly 50% from current levels by 2023, its president said on Thursday, as the country's economic slowdown is hurting share prices.
The Thai exchange took the top spot for new listings in Southeast Asia in 2019, with companies raising $4 billion according to Refinitiv data.
A number of big issues are also in the pipeline for this year, including Central Retail Corp's offering next month, which could raise up to $2.4 billion in the bourse's biggest ever IPO. But economic growth has slowed sharply and the benchmark stock index (SETI) has fallen 1.7% in the past 12 months.
""We consider this (the large number of listings) an unexpected plus .... but our long-term plans are based on the economy and industry growth rates,"" Pakorn Peetathawatchai, president of SET, told Reuters in an interview.
The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET), Southeast Asia's biggest bourse after Singapore, set a target in 2018 to achieve a combined market capitalization of all companies listed of 23 trillion baht ($757 billion) by 2023. That would be up from a market value of 16.6 trillion baht as of Wednesday's close.
However, the target was based on forecasts that Thailand's economy would grow by more than 4% annually over those years. The central bank now forecasts 2019 economic growth at 2.5%, a five-year low, and 2.8% for this year as exports have slowed.
""The underlying assumption at the time was 4.5% growth,"" Pakorn said.
""Reaching that market capitalization on a slowdown in the global economy is difficult,"" he said.
Corporate earnings have been hit by the slowdown, with top lender Siam Commercial Bank Pcl (BK:SCB) reporting a 22% drop in fourth quarter profits from a year earlier as lending shrunk 1.3%.
SET, which hosts 623 listed firms on its main index and another 200 on an alternative investment index, was assessing an adjustment of its goal, Pakorn said. For now it would still aim to add 550 billion baht to market capitalization each year with 250 billion from initial public offers, he said.
The biggest listing last year was hotelier Asset World Corporation (BK:AWC), owned by billionaire Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi, which raised $1.6 billion
Other upcoming listings include the packaging unit of the country's largest industrial conglomerate  Siam Cement  Group Pcl (BK:SCC), worth $1 billion, and PTT Oil and Retail, a unit of the state-owned energy firm PTT Pcl (BK:PTT)
""If other big families or conglomerates come in, we can reach our goal,"" Pakorn said.
New technologies are reforming businesses and companies are listing or spinning off smaller units to raise funds to adapt, SET Senior Executive Vice President, Manpong Senanarong, said.
""Companies need funds to invest because of the new economy, which is putting operators in a more competitive environment,"" he said."

Over the past two years, P&G has consistently grown sales, helped by a simplified organizational structure. Under Chief Executive Officer David Taylor, Cincinnati-based P&G has cut its roster of brands from 175 to 65, focusing on the 10 product categories where the margin is highest. 
“These measures are clearly helping the company to seek higher prices for its products despite a very benign inflationary environment,"" said Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar. ""P&G started implementing phased price increases last summer after failing to revive growth by doing the opposite.” 

Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) stock is up 1.1% for the year to date and closed Wednesday trading at $126.31, just below its 52-week high of $127.00 set on January 17.
“What’s fuelled the stock’s surge to a record high is the company’s success in its turnaround strategy to cope with changing consumer needs as well as its ability to put itself way ahead of competitors,"" Anwar added.

P&G announced core earnings per share of $1.42 on revenue of $18.24 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $1.37 on revenue of $18.41 billion.
That represents a 14% improvement in EPS from a year earlier. Analysts are expecting EPS of $1.11 and revenue of $16.98 billion in the next quarter.


Procter & Gamble's report follows an earnings beat by Constellation Brands B on January 8, who reported EPS of $2.14 on revenue of $2B, was in comparison with forecasts EPS of $1.82 on revenue of $1.95B.
Constellation Brands A had beat expectations on January 8 with third quarter EPS of $2.14 on revenue of $2B, was in comparison to anticipated for EPS of $1.82 on revenue of $1.95B.

Investing.com - U.S. stock markets are set to open largely unchanged Thursday, as traders react with understandable caution as the operation to curtail the spreading of the new pneumonia-like virus in China ramps up.
At 7:15 AM ET (1215 GMT), futures for the S&P 500 traded 1 point, or 0.1%, lower, Nasdaq 100 Futures 10 points, or 0.1%, higher, while the DJI futures contract fell 30 points, or 0.1%.
Earlier Thursday, China authorities issued a travel suspension in Wuhan, a city of 11 million at the center of the outbreak of the coronavirus. Later, they announced the stopping trains and buses leaving neighbouring Huanggang, a city of 7.5 million people, and the closure of many areas where people could congregate.
These were the latest attempts to stop the spread of the disease that has killed at least 17 people and infected hundreds of people in China, and as far afield as the U.S., Thailand, Taiwan, Japan and the Republic of Korea. 
That said, volumes and volatility could be limited with many in the market keeping an eye on the second day of opening arguments in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump.
In corporate news, several heavyweights are set to release numbers Thursday as the earnings season picks up. 
Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) released its second-quarter results ahead of the opening bell, and the company’s shares are over 2% lower premarket as its sales missed forecasts. Shares in Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) climb over 2% premarket after the release of its fourth-quarter earnings, to all-time highs, with eyes particularly on news about its Peacock service. Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) will also be in the spotlight after the chip maker reported disappointing quarterly earnings after hours Wednesday. 
Meanwhile, after the market close, chipmaker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) will deliver quarterly results, but many will be looking at its guidance for any read-across for the rest of the chip sector. 
Elsewhere, oil prices tumbled to their lowest in seven weeks after the release of another increase in U.S. crude stocks Wednesday. The American Petroleum Institute figures showed a 1.6 million barrel increase in supply, which may or may not be corroborated by official government data due at 10:30 AM ET (1530 GMT).
AT 07:15 AM ET (1215 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 1.6% lower at $55.84 and the international benchmark Brent contract was down 1.3% to $62.36. Gold futures for February delivery on New York’s COMEX dropped 0.2% to $1,554.15."
1580,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2020 07:13AM ET</span>",Mexico goes ghost as its oil hedge bill spirals,"By Stefanie Eschenbacher and Devika Krishna Kumar
MEXICO CITY/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mexico is playing a risky game of hide and seek with the oil market.
To frustrate speculators and contain an annual bill of more than $1 billion, Mexico is going to new lengths to mask its attempts to insure its revenue from oil sales against falling prices - no mean feat for a hedging program known as Wall Street's biggest oil trade. 
Getting the hedge right is crucial for Mexico as it offers stability at a time the government is planning to boost social welfare and security spending, the economy is stagnating and the country's credit-worthiness is under intense scrutiny.
Once an enigmatic agreement between a handful of finance industry officials and Wall Street banks, the hedge is now the most anticipated deal in the oil futures market, making it harder, and more costly, for Mexico to arrange.
For its 2020 hedge, however, Mexico has adopted a different strategy than in previous years, according to a Wall Street source with direct knowledge of the deal.
This time, an estimated two-thirds of the options Mexico bought in financial markets were indexed to the international Brent crude benchmark, shifting away from the Maya oil Mexico mainly produces, according to the source.
By using such a heavily traded contract as Brent, Mexico should have been able to cut costs by getting lower quotes for its trades and to place bets more unobtrusively to avoid prices shifting ahead of its moves, market sources said. 
But critics say the strategy creates new risks. By using international oil contracts based on a different kind of oil, the structure of the hedge may not fully reflect Mexico's export mix dominated by Maya, which is typically cheaper than Brent.
SWEET OR SOUR
""I would expect a divergence of prices over the long term. This pressure on Maya could move prices down faster than its hedge. This would cause a loss on the physical sale of Maya and minimal-to-possibly no benefit of the hedge,"" said Ryan Dusek, director at consulting firm Opportune LLP https://opportune.com based in Houston, who added that the trade could end up being ""worthless.""
The Mexican finance ministry declined to comment on the structure of the hedge.
The Wall Street source said the proportion of Maya crude hedged for 2020 was significantly lower than in previous years. 
For the 2009 deal, for example,  Barclays  (LON:BARC),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) hedged 305 million barrels of crude using Maya and only 25 million with Brent, data obtained by Reuters through a freedom of information request showed.
The Wall Street source said for 2020, Mexico had bought put options on Brent on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) at $54-$56 a barrel and hedged Maya at $42. 
Brent (LCOc1) is trading at around $63 a barrel while Maya's official selling price for deliveries to the U.S. Gulf Coast is about $55, according to S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Platts pricing data.
The options give Mexico the right to sell oil at the predetermined price, so if the actual market price is lower, the options pay out and make up the difference - acting effectively as an insurance policy.
But if the price of Maya, a heavy sour crude, falls faster than Brent, a light sweet crude - or Maya drops and Brent rises - Mexico could miss out on oil revenues without the hedge kicking in, analysts and market sources said.
Mexico has had to contend with the potential divergence in Maya and Brent crude prices before but the risk is now greater as demand for heavy crudes globally is expected to slump.
Reuters was unable to determine whether Mexico has taken additional steps to bridge any gaps between Maya and Brent.
'HACIENDA HEDGE'
Mere rumors of Mexico's ""Hacienda hedge,"" which gets its name from the country's finance ministry, can shift prices ahead of its anticipated deals and the government fears participants push up premiums when they suspect Mexico is about to trade.
""Banks have become much better at accumulating information about it,"" said Victor Gomez, a former Mexican finance ministry official involved in the hedge until 2018.
In part due to this, the hedge's cost has increased 10-fold in peso terms since 2001, even though the number of barrels hedged has barely changed, the data obtained from the freedom of information request showed.
Mexico spent the equivalent of $212 million to hedge 200 million barrels in 2001 but in 2016, hedging 212 million barrels cost $956 million. In 2017, Mexico stopped disclosing the number of barrels it has hedged. 
Now, for the first time in at least 19 years, finance ministry officials have declined to reveal how much they're spending to protect 2020 revenue, saying the information would give speculators insight into their strategy and raise costs.
""What we don't want is that they identify the moments that Mexico goes to the market, because that raises the costs of the premium,"" Gabriel Yorio, one of the main architects of the hedge under President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who took office a year ago, told reporters this month.
The cost of the hedge has also risen because the peso has declined versus the U.S. dollar and because options have become more expensive since many commodity-oriented funds, which were natural counterparties to the deal, have closed.
Officials have also declined to say how much of the 1.73 million barrels a day it produces they're protecting, nor to what extent they're using put options or a budget stabilization fund to guarantee government revenue.
All they have disclosed is that the 2020 hedge guarantees an average price for Maya of $49 a barrel.
(Graphic: Mexico oil hedge - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/MEXICO-OIL-HEDGE/0H001QEEL6ZW/eikon.png)
Since 2001, Mexico has received three payouts up until the end of last year: in 2009, 2015 and 2016, the data showed.
Nevertheless, those three payments were so large the finance ministry could argue it was still ahead - at least before including the cost of the 2020 program.
Mexico has also taken other steps to cover its tracks. In response to further questions in Reuters' records request, Mexico's transparency institute said additional information about the hedge had been sealed for five years.
It cited the finance ministry as saying revealing details could increase costs, affect Mexico's monetary policy and financial stability and create systemic financial risk.
""This is part of Mexico's strategy to leave banks and oil majors in the dark about what they are buying and how much they are paying,"" said Gomez.
Asked about specifics at a news conference on Jan. 9, Mexican official Yorio highlighted the importance of the overhaul of the crude oil pricing formulas that underpin Mexico's oil exports.
Last year, Mexico changed the pricing formula for Maya sales to the U.S. Gulf Coast to be based 65% on U.S. West Texas Intermediate in Houston - a light sweet crude which is the most traded U.S. Gulf Coast grade - and 35% on Brent futures.
Before, it had been derived from West Texas Sour, Dated Brent and other grades that have become less traded markets. The formula also previously included fuel oil rich in sulphur, which has been hit by new rules requiring ships to use cleaner fuel.
FUND OR OPTIONS
Mexican officials involved in the hedge in the past said the government may be considering increasing its use of the stabilization fund to guarantee oil prices as a supplement to financial instruments.
From the mid-2010s, Mexico started to lock in part of its target oil price with the fund to contain the costs of the options it buys from banks and major oil companies.
For example, Mexico locked in a price of $79 for its 2015 hedge, with $76.40 guaranteed by options and the remaining $2.60 backed by the fund. In 2017, the last time the ministry released such information, $4 of its $42 hedge was covered by the fund. 
Gomez and Julio Ruiz, another former official involved in the hedge until 2018, said Mexico was expected to expand this strategy in the coming years but cautioned it would struggle to keep enough money in the fund to hedge oil exports fully. 
""They would have to accumulate a larger amount of resources in this fund,"" Gomez said.
Nevertheless, those changes would do little to ease the concerns of some who believe Mexico spends too much on the hedge, said Ruiz, adding that guaranteeing oil revenue was still necessary given the pressures on Mexico and state-owned Pemex, the world's most heavily indebted oil company.
""In congress, many will say they don't agree with how this money is spent, and that it shouldn't be spent on the oil hedging program,"" Ruiz said. 

""But Mexico's finances would become a lot more volatile without it.""

1582,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2020 07:00AM ET</span>",Exclusive: India's HDFC Bank to tap Egon Zehnder to identify Aditya Puri's successor,"By Rupam Jain and Nupur Anand
MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's HDFC Bank (NS:HDBK) will retain global executive search firm Egon Zehnder to identify a successor to managing director Aditya Puri, the country's top private lender said on Thursday.
""Egon Zehnder has been recommended by the search committee and unanimously appointed by the bank's board,"" Neeraj Jha, a spokesman for HDFC Bank, said in an email, confirming a Reuters report on the matter from earlier on Thursday.
Reuters had earlier reported that the HDFC Bank board had tapped the global head-hunting firm in a bid to end a boardroom impasse over Puri's successor and zero in on a candidate.
Four sources familiar with the discussions told Reuters that a six-member internal search committee, appointed in November last year, has been unable to reach a consensus on selecting a successor to Puri, who has been at the helm of the country's largest private lender since its inception in 1994.
Puri, whose term comes to an end in October this year, is also an advisor to the search committee tasked with identifying a suitable candidate. 
""The latest decision to hire a global advisory firm has been taken after the search committee members realized that they have been struggling to come to a consensus on the final name,"" said a source familiar with the internal deliberations among members of the committee. 
""The deadline for Puri's successor is nearing ... the bank will have to appoint someone who can continue to push for growth despite an economic slowdown,"" the source added.
As per regulations, the bank will need to get approval from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), before any new appointment can be confirmed. HDFC Bank is one of three domestic lenders that the central bank has designated as ""too big to fail"". 
Egon Zehnder, which declined to comment on the matter, had in 2018 also helped  Axis Bank  (NS:AXBK), another private lender, to find its chief executive officer. 
A second source at HDFC said the differences between the top leadership over the succession has been the crucial reason for the delay in identifying a new managing director.
The sources said Puri and Deepak Parekh who is the chairman of India's largest housing finance company HDFC (NS:HDFC), which owns a minority stake in the bank, have been at loggerheads over the bank's succession plan, with both advocating their preferred candidates to secure the job.
Puri's preferred choices include HDFC's executive directors Bhavesh Zaveri, Sashidhar Jagdishan and Kaizad Bharucha, said three of the sources.
Two of those sources also said Parekh has been rooting to reinstate Paresh Sukhtankar, who resigned as Puri's deputy in 2018. 
Sukhtankar who joined the bank alongside Puri in 1994 was widely expected to be Puri's successor. Reasons behind his departure remain unclear.
Regarding questions about names in the fray and differences between Puri and Parekh, HDFC Bank's Jha said that ""information is speculative and incorrect"". 
Parekh and Puri personally did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday.
Sources said the search committee in a bid to defuse the tension had also contacted top banking executives working overseas to find a candidate acceptable to Puri and Parekh.
The board members held preliminary discussions with Indian-origin bankers Piyush Gupta, CEO of DBS Group (SI:DBSM), and Ajay Banga, CEO of Mastercard Inc (N:MA), about the job, two of the sources said. 
The outcome of these discussions was unclear.
Gupta and Banga were not immediately reachable for comment. 
Analysts tracking the financial health of the bank said Puri has run the bank with an iron hand, preventing it from accruing a high level of bad loans at a time when most of its peers were struggling. 
""The new successor needs to have a vision to be able to spot opportunities and constantly stay ahead of the curve which is what Puri has been doing,"" said Suresh Ganapathy, head of financial services research at Macquarie.
Puri, the highest paid banker in India with remuneration of 136.7 million rupees ($1.92 million) excluding stock options, had been seeking for another term, two of the sources said.

However, the central bank has been firm that the chief executives of private banks must retire at the age of 70.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) reported a 21% fall in fourth-quarter profit on Thursday due to Boeing 737 MAX costs and warned that it will likely extend flight cancellations beyond June as the jets look set to remain parked well into this year.
Southwest, the world's largest 737 MAX operator, is among the airlines hardest hit by the global grounding of Boeing Co's (N:BA) once fast-selling jet in March following two fatal crashes, forcing thousands of monthly flight cancellations.
Dallas, Texas-based Southwest said net income fell to $514 million, or $0.98 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $654 million, or $1.17 per share, a year earlier.
The profit figure was below a Wall Street consensus forecast for $1.09 per share, mainly because Southwest said it treated a $124 million profit-sharing payment to employees that stemmed from a partial compensation agreement with Boeing last month as an operating expense while most analysts treated it as a one-time item.
""I am pleased with the Boeing agreement for 2019. But, we continue to incur financial damages in 2020, and we will continue discussions with Boeing regarding further compensation,"" CEO Gary Kelly said.
Southwest has estimated a $828 million hit to operating profit from the MAX groundings in 2019. The airline has not factored future settlements into its 2020 outlook.
Total operating revenue rose 0.4% to $5.7 billion in the quarter, sustained by healthy travel demand -- which it sees continuing in the first quarter -- even as the company had to scale back its growth strategy due to a lack of airplanes.
Seat capacity fell 1.6% in 2019 from a year earlier versus an original plan to grow capacity by nearly 5%.
The airline had 34 MAX jets in its fleet at the time of the grounding and dozens more on order.
With the jets grounded, Southwest expects capacity to fall between 1.5% and 2.5% in the first quarter. It did not make a full-year estimate given continued MAX uncertainty.
Boeing said on Tuesday it does not expect to win approval for the 737 MAX to fly again until mid-year as regulators continue to scrutinize software and flight control updates and debate new pilot training requirements.
Based on that guidance, Southwest plans to take delivery of 27 MAX jets in 2020, though it warned the number could change and said it continues to plan for multiple return-to-service scenarios.
Southwest sees revenues per mile flown growing between 3.5% and 5.5% percent in the current quarter, though unit costs excluding fuel and profit-sharing expenses are seen spiking between 6% and 8% in the quarter.
Unit costs rose 5% in the fourth quarter versus the company's original estimate of a 2% decline before the MAX grounding, which is also hitting the company's fuel-efficiency."

It’s Still a Sell,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.’s price target was more than doubled at UBS to $410 from $160, even though the bank restarted its coverage of the electric-car maker with a sell rating.
UBS analyst Patrick Hummel said in a note that Tesla has the potential to become the most profitable original equipment manufacturer.

Investing.com - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares hit a big milestone on Wednesday, becoming the first $100 billion publicly listed U.S. carmaker in history.
At its current share price of $569, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is valued at $102.6 billion. Tesla shares have more than doubled in value since falling to a 52-week low of $176.99 in June 2019.
After topping the combined value of Ford and GM earlier this month, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) overtook Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) as the second most-valuable carmaker in the world. Japan's Toyota Motor, however, remains the world leader with a market value of around $199 billion.
The $100-billion valuation triggers a $346 million payday for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk if it holds on an average basis for at least six months, the first in a series of potentially huge bonuses for Musk.
For Musk’s subsequent tranches to vest under the terms of the 2018 compensation package, the company’s market cap would have to continue to sustainably rise by $50 billion increments over the agreement’s 10-year period, with the billionaire earning the full package if Tesla’s market capitalization reaches $650 billion and the electric car maker achieves several revenue and profit targets.
If Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) ultimately achieves a valuation of $650 billion by 2028, Musk would be in line for a whopping $50 billion in incentive payments.
Musk receives no salary or cash bonus, only options that vest based on Tesla’s market cap and milestones for growth.
The recent rally, which has seen shares soar 221% since June, was fueled by a surprise profit for the third quarter of last year, news of production ramp-up in its China factory and better-than-expected annual car deliveries.
However, there are a few risks to watch out for in the current quarter and beyond. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is set to report its fourth quarter earnings on Jan. 29 after markets close.

The Italian-born de Meo has served as chairman of Seat's executive committee for four years, overseeing a resurgence in the Barcelona-based company's sales and boosting its prominence within the Volkswagen group.
""We are very, very sad that Luca is leaving us because he played a very important role in the group,"" Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess told CNBC on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos.
""He did a great job with us but we accepted that he's going to leave and he's probably in talks with Renault, that's what he told us,"" Diess said.
Renault declined to comment on the matter on Thursday.
Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard said this week that a new CEO would be named shortly. 
De Meo has been in talks with Renault but faced a potential hurdle over a stringent non-compete clause in the contract, sources told Reuters previously.
The French state, which has a stake in Renault, has given its tacit backing to de Meo's possible appointment.
""There's no reason the state would oppose de Meo's nomination,"" a source at the economy ministry said.
In December, Spanish newspaper La Vanguardia cited anonymous sources as saying Renault - in the wake of the high-profile arrest of former boss Carlos Ghosn - had offered de Meo the job of chief executive.

The Russian government has been in talks with the central bank to buy the latter's 50% plus one share stake in Sberbank, the country's largest lender.
""When I came to this position, I came with a certain approach,"" said Gref, who has served as the bank's CEO since 2007.
""If this approach changes, I don't see my place in the company.""
Gref said he hoped a shareholder change would not modify the bank's strategy. ""We strongly believe that the strategy is the right one,"" he was quoted as saying.
""We have had interesting discussions with the government regarding the use of our platform for digital services. We are very interested (in this), I hope we will move in that direction,"" Gref added.
Management of Sberbank remains on track to recommend a dividend payment of 50% of net income for 2019, but the payment will be subject to final approval by board of directors and shareholders, Gref said.
Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseev said on Wednesday that the mechanism behind the central bank's potential exit from Sberbank's shareholder structure was being discussed and that a final decision had yet to be made.
If the government did in fact take over the central bank's shares, Sberbank would come under the control of Russia's federal government property agency, he said.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's Exchange Fund, which is used to back the Hong Kong dollar, posted investment income of HK$247.2 billion ($31.8 billion) in 2019, the second highest on record, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) said on Thursday.
In 2018, the exchange fund recorded adjusted investment income of HK$10.9 billion.
Easing trade tensions and accommodative monetary policies by major central banks had supported equity and bond markets, HKMA Chief Executive Eddie Yue said.
Gains in bonds rose 99.3% from a year ago to HK$114.4 billion in 2019. Gains in Hong Kong and other equities reached HK$22.1 billion and HK$100.3 billion respectively, compared with losses of HK$20.7 billion and HK$38.7 billion a year earlier.
However, the territory's de facto central bank said the investment environment this year would remain challenging, with the next phase of U.S.-China trade talks, implementation of Brexit and the Middle East's situation affecting market sentiment.
""As the market outlook for 2020 remains highly uncertain, the HKMA will continue to manage the exchange fund prudently and further diversify our investments as appropriate to receive higher long-term return for the exchange fund,"" Yue said.
The HKMA is the key manager of the Exchange Fund, which is under the control of the financial secretary and invests in equities, bonds, foreign exchange and other securities and assets."
1592,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 23, 2020 05:24AM ET</span>",StockBeat: STMicro Nudges the Chipmaker Rally Onward,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The momentum behind the recovery of the global chipmaker sector built a little more on Thursday as French-based STMicroelectronics, one of Europe’s largest chipmakers, posted a much brighter fourth-quarter result than forecast.
That comes hot on the heels of Taiwan Semiconductor's (NYSE:TSM) rousing update last week, which expressed confidence in the outlook for 2020. It also provides an upbeat prologue to Intel’s fourth-quarter update which is due after the closing bell on Thursday.
STMicro was guarded about its outlook, saying that it expected quarter-on-quarter declines in both revenue and gross margin in the first three months of this year. Nor did it give any guidance for the full year ahead. However, the market didn’t seem to care, and pushed the stock up 7.1% by 5:10 AM ET (1010 GMT), easily the best performer on the Paris exchange. The benchmark STOXX 600 was down 0.2 at 422.42.
Like many U.S. chip stocks, STMicro has had an excellent run over the last 12 months as the cycle has appeared to turn. It has been the best-performing stock in the CAC 40 in that time, rising 98%, surpassing even Bernard Arnault’s LVMH (PA:LVMH). (LVMH, like other luxury stocks on Thursday, underperformed with a 1.0% drop amid rising fears that the coronavirus will hit sales in China this year).
As Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar points out, World Semiconductor Trade Statistics, an industry group that monitors the sector, predicts the chip market will rebound from last year's decline to 6% growth this year. And while issues like global trade and the U.S. elections pose risks to the whole market, there are few megatrends as powerful as the demand for chips that is coming as a result of the upgrade to 5G technology worldwide.
That said, STMicro, like its German rival Infineon Technologies (DE:IFXGn), has pockets of weakness, notably in its reliance on sales to an auto industry that has lost momentum worldwide. The group’s Automotive and Discrete division saw sales fall 4.5% last year, and also posted the weakest rebound of STMicro’s three units in the fourth quarter, rising only 3.3%. (By contrast, the sensors division grew revenues by over 12%.)
The number of chips in the cars of the future may still be expected to rise, but the buzz around autonomous mobility, which underlay many of the most bullish scenarios for the growth in chip sales in recent years, has cooled off drastically in the last year after high-profile accidents involving Tesla’s Autopilot feature and Uber’s self-driving taxi experiments."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Macquarie's (AX:MQG) chief executive and her predecessor are among 60 present and former staff to be named as suspects by German authorities, the Australian bank said, as Germany's biggest post-war fraud probe into sham trades unfolded. 
German prosecutors and tax authorities are seeking to recover billions of euros from traders and banks that prosecutors say profited from such schemes. 
The country estimates the schemes cost it more than 5 billion euros in total, although leading experts estimate that the damage may be twice as high.
Prosecutors allege that players in the so-called cum-ex scheme misled the state into thinking a stock had multiple owners who were each owed a dividend and a tax credit. Two bankers are now on trial, with many more expected to follow. 
The Australian investment conglomerate said in a statement it had been responding to requests for information about its activities but that no current staff had yet been interviewed by prosecutors.
""Macquarie continues to cooperate with German authorities in relation to an historical German lending transaction in 2011,"" the statement said.
Most of the 60 staff ""are no longer at Macquarie and some of whom were already named in relation to the 2011 lending matter, including the MGL CEO,"" the bank added.
Macquarie acted as a lender to a group of funds involved in the share trading in 2011 and has previously said it was one of over 100 financial institutions involved in this market, from which it withdrew in 2012.
Prosecutors in Cologne made a major breakthrough in 2017 when a group of bankers, including a former Macquarie employee, offered information that showed Santander (MC:SAN), Macquarie and others profited from the scheme. [https://reut.rs/36iCQuT]
On Thursday, Macquarie said the ""amount at issue"" was not considered material and that it had ""provided for the matter"". 
It has said prosecutors would likely want to interview Macquarie's former chief executive Nicholas Moore and Shemara Wikramanayake, the previous head of asset management who replaced Moore in December 2018.
Germany changed and clarified the law in 2007, 2009 and 2012 to prevent cum-ex trades, but the case has fueled mistrust of banks among ordinary Germans.

The discovery of the trades in Germany and Denmark, where tax authorities say they lost $2 billion in rebates, prompted investigations by other countries including Austria and Belgium, which have found they were also affected, albeit on a far smaller scale.

(Reuters) - Chinese private equity firm CITIC Capital is actively bidding for a 22% stake in McDonald's Corp's (N:MCD) mainland China and Hong Kong businesses, its chairman and chief executive told Reuters on Thursday.
The stake is being sold by state-owned CITIC Ltd (HK:0267), which together with CITIC Capital and  Carlyle Group  (O:CG) bought 80% of McDonald's China business in 2017.
Zhang Yichen, talking to Reuters Global Markets Forum participants on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, said the final result of the sale should be known in early February.
""Getting an additional stake will consolidate the control of the company in the hands of CITIC Capital which will facilitate (the) long-term stability of the company,"" said Zhang, who is also chairman of McDonald's China and Hong Kong.
Reuters reported earlier this month CITIC Capital would be the most likely buyer of the stake.
CITIC Ltd is the main listed arm of state-owned conglomerate CITIC Group while CITIC Capital is the group's flagship PE arm.
The firm, which raised $2.8 billion last August in its fourth China buyout fund, will launch fundraising for a Japan-focused mid-market buyout fund toward the end of 2020, Zhang said.
CITIC Capital plans to raise $200 million for a special purpose acquisition company in a U.S. initial public offering, according to its filing to the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.

LONDON (Reuters) - Financial firms in Britain should be ready in case no trade agreement is struck with the European Union by December, a senior UK regulator said on Thursday.
Britain leaves the EU next week, followed by a ""business as usual"" transition that ends in December. Britain and the EU will formally begin trade talks in coming weeks.
""Firms still need to ensure they are prepared for a range of scenarios that may happen at the end of 2020,"" said Nausicaa Delfas, executive director of international at the Financial Conduct Authority.
Britain's banks, trading platforms and insurers hope to get access to the EU market after December under the EU equivalence system, through which Brussels grants access to countries whose regulatory regimes it deems comparable to its own.
Britain has already put all EU financial rules into UK law, which means it will have ""the most equivalent framework to the EU of any country in the world,"" Delfas told an event held by law firm BCLP.
Britain will also need to decide whether EU-based financial firms can have access to UK investors under the same equivalence system it has inherited by adopting the EU laws.
""This provides a strong basis for the EU and UK to find each other equivalent across the full range of equivalence provisions,"" Delfas said.
The EU's financial laws include about 40 equivalence provisions, ranging from trading shares to insurance, but access remains more limited than the unfettered ""passporting"" UK firms enjoyed inside the EU.
""As both the UK and EU are committed to open markets, there is also a strong rationale for both sides to discuss broadening their respective equivalence frameworks,"" Delfas said.
The EU is committed to completing its equivalence assessments by the end of June, but banks fear it will be overshadowed by broader UK-EU trade talks.
""We believe that equivalence decisions should be based on technical assessments,"" Delfas said.

Equivalence should be determined on the ""outcomes"" of respective rules rather than a need to be written identically, Delfas said.

Investing.com - European stock markets weakened Thursday, weighed by losses in Asia as the battle to contain the spread of a deadly virus intensifies.
At 06:15 ET (1015 GMT), the DAX traded 51 points, or 0.4% lower. France's CAC 40 was largely unchange, while the FTSE 100 in the U.K. dropped 18 points, or 0.2%. The STOXX 600 benchmark fell 0.2% to 422.30.
In China, the Shanghai Composite closed 2.8% lower and the Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 dropped 3.5%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index lost 1.8% by the close.
Earlier Thursday, China issued a travel suspension in Wuhan, a city of 11 million at the center of the outbreak of the coronavirus, as its latest attempt to stop the spread of the disease. The virus has killed at least 17 people and infected hundreds of people in China, and as far afield as the U.S., Thailand, Taiwan, Japan and the Republic of Korea. This has sparked fears of a pandemic.
In corporate news, shares in STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) climbed over 7% as investors took a positive view of its higher sales even as net profit for the fourth quarter fell year-on-year.
Shares in online fashion house ASOS (LON:ASOS) climbed around 5% after it posted strong sales figures for the holiday period. The retailer has had a difficult year, issuing two profit warnings, but it stated overall sales grew 20% in the four months to the end of December.
However, the sectors most exposed to the Chinese consumer suffered.
Luxury stocks were hard hit, with   Burberry   (LON:BRBY) down 1.4% a day after releasing its latest sales figures. High fashion house Hermes (PA:HRMS) dropped 0,5% while puffa jacket maker Moncler (MI:MONC) fell 2.4%.
Airlines also fell, with Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) down 1.4%,SAS (ST:SAS) off 1.2% and IAG (LON:ICAG), the parent company of British Airways, among others, down 2.6%.
Later Thursday, the European Central Bank meets and is widely expected to keep interest rates on hold--at -50 basis points and 0 bp for the deposit rate and the main refinancing rate, respectively--and quantitative easing at 20 billion euros ($22 billion) a month.
The main focus will be on the strategic review promised by ECB President Christine Lagarde, in her second meeting in this role.
“We expect her to give more details as to the parameters that will be included in the review,” according to analysts at Nordea, in a research note, “but she will not jump to any conclusions ahead of the process.”
Elsewhere, the price of oil has retreated sharply after the American Petroleum Institute reported that crude inventories rose last week, by 1.6 million barrels, adding to the picture of an oversupplied market. Official government data are due at 10:30 AM ET.
At 5:00 AM ET (1020 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 1.7% lower at $55.77 and the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.4% to $62.31. Gold futures for February delivery on New York’s COMEX was 0.3% lower at $1,553.45."

LONDON (Reuters) - Global commodities trader Trafigura is in advanced talks to buy over 10% of Angolan general's stake in its fuel retail arm Puma Energy by the end of the year, sources familiar with the matter said.
Retired general Leopoldino Fragoso do Nascimento, known as General Dino, currently holds a 15% stake in the firm through his company Cochan Holdings while Trafigura has 49% and Angola's state firm Sonangol holds 28%.
Puma's shareholding structure was put together under Trafigura's former CEO and founder Claude Dauphin, who was close to the former ruling Angolan elite. However, the Swiss firm's dream of listing Puma hit compliance hurdles owing to the general's presence as a significant stakeholder.
Trafigura has wanted to restructure Puma's ownership for years but the move to buy out Cochan only began in earnest after Emma Fitzgerald took over as Puma's chief executive in January last year.
Puma and Trafigura declined to comment. Cochan did not respond to a request for comment.
The move comes at a time when Angola itself is reviewing its assets. The government announced a cross-sector privatization drive last year, including its aim to list state oil firm Sonangol by 2022 and divest its stake in Puma.
In a first step, Cochan agreed last year to no longer be represented on Puma's board. A source familiar with the matter said this had already allowed Puma to somewhat widen its pool of banks as some were spooked by his presence.
Fitzgerald took the helm at difficult time for Puma that has been loss-making since 2018. After a Mckinsey review, the firm has been selling off assets such as its business in Paraguay and more recently its Australian assets that had become a drag on its finances.
One source said that Trafigura planned to reduce General Dino's stake to less than 5% with the aim of attracting more global banks and new equity investment. The deal will not be a pure cash exchange.
Trafigura will likely spend between $357 million and $535 million. In its 2019 annual report, Trafigura reduced the value of its stake in Puma by $200 million to $1.75 billion, making the value of the company as a whole $3.57 billion.
The trading firm has other business links with Cochan, namely a joint venture called DTS Holdings that is the main holding company of DT Group that focuses on sub-Saharan and Angolan investments.
Puma, which traces its roots to Argentina, has around 3,000 fuel retail stations in Latin America, Africa and Asia-Pacific.
Rival Vitol Group listed its Africa-focused fuel retail unit Vivo Energy on the London Stock Exchange in 2018 raising just over 2 billion pounds, around $2.7 billion at the time."

The disruption represents around 3.7% of available production capacity as of Thursday morning, data from RTE and state-controlled power group EDF (PA:EDF) showed.
Electricity demand is forecast at around 81 GW due to cold weather. France was a net power importer during the morning peak demand period, the data showed.
President Emmanuel Macron wants to simplify and streamline France's existing set-up of 42 different pension schemes, in a move which he argues will make the system fairer but which critics say will result in people having to work for longer.

Panic coursed through the world’s second-largest equity market as investors sold stocks on concern a deadly virus will worsen over China’s week-long trading break.
The Shanghai Composite Index settled 2.8% lower after the close of trading, its worst end to a Lunar Year in its three-decade history. More than 90% of the mainland’s 4,000 stocks fell on volumes that were 20% above average, with foreign traders selling $1.7 billion worth of the shares. The yuan weakened as much as 0.4% and government bond futures rose to the highest level since 2016.
Pressure is building on Beijing to contain a new SARS-like virus that’s killed at least 17 people and infected hundreds. The coronavirus first appeared last month in the city of Wuhan in central China, a city with 11 million residents -- more than in London or New York -- that’s now essentially in lockdown after officials halted public travel.
“Fear and panic are rampant,” said Wang Daixin, a fund manager at Bristlecon Pine Asset Management Ltd. “It’s hard to tell how bad things will get before a turn for the better. I didn’t get out when I had the chance to, so now I might as well sit it out rather than lose money. Others are offloading at whatever cost.”
The virus and its potential impact on the economy and financial system pose a growing challenge for President Xi Jinping. It comes at a time when the Communist Party is seeking to maintain stability in the face of a trade war with the U.S., the spread of swine fever, a debt mountain, rising corporate defaults and protests in Hong Kong.
China was criticized during the SARS epidemic 17 years ago for initially providing limited information and denying the scope of the problem.
A gauge of consumer-staples stocks -- some of last year’s top performers -- extended this week’s loss to 6.4%, the worst since October 2018. The Lunar New Year is a typically strong season for traveling and spending as families gather for the celebrations. Macau casino stocks also tumbled as the city reported its second case of the novel coronavirus and announced it would cancel all Lunar New Year festivities.
In Hong Kong, where two cases have also been confirmed, the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index dropped 2.3%. China Life Insurance Co. slumped to its lowest level in a month.
The final day before the Lunar New Year break is historically a good one for stock investors: since its launch in 1991, the Shanghai Composite Index had ended the session lower on only six occasions.
Shutting down Chinese markets has trained attention on the offshore yuan, as well as markets in Hong Kong and exchange-traded funds tracking Chinese stocks in New York or Europe. It will add an element of speculation to their prices when mainland bourses are closed. Hong Kong traders will return to their desks on Wednesday, while exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen will reopen Jan. 31.
In the U.S., owners of the more than $19 billion that tracks Chinese stock ETFs will have less information in deciding how much the securities are worth. The reaction from foreign investors can often be more severe: the Xtrackers Harvest CSI 300 China A-Shares fund, which holds mainland listed-shares only, fell twice as much as the underlying gauge earlier this week.
Without being able to trade for a week, investors are heading into the holiday blind. After an extended break last May, the Shanghai Composite fell 5.6% as investors reacted to escalating trade tensions with the U.S. The sell-off wiped out almost half a trillion dollars from Chinese equity values.
Bullishness Fades
“There’s going to be no way for investors to make a decision or change positions until post-Chinese New Year,” said Gavin Parry, chief executive at Parry Global Group in Hong Kong. “Either you’re going to have last minute moves today and tomorrow to get positions in place and take them off, or when we come back -- we’re going to get some decent volatility then.”
The virus has dented what had been growing enthusiasm toward equities. Confidence was riding high as Beijing signed a phase one trade deal with the U.S. and data signaled China’s economy was stabilizing. Margin debt had topped 1 trillion yuan as investors took on leverage to chase the rally, while privately-offered funds boosted their stock positions to the highest since early 2015.
“Markets were too heated up and there is room for profit taking,” said Nader Naeimi, head of dynamic markets at AMP Capital Investors Ltd. “We have sold Hong Kong shares, China A futures against the long broad EM basket this week. We’re just waiting for some heat and froth to come out before closing the shorts.”"

LONDON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Boeing Co's (N:BA) new chief executive has sent the aerospace giant back to the drawing board on proposals for a new mid-market aircraft, effectively shelving in their current form plans worth $15 billion-$20 billion that had been overtaken by the 737 MAX crisis. 
A decision on whether to launch a New Midsize Airplane (NMA) seating 220-270 passengers, which seemed imminent barely a year ago, had already been postponed as Boeing gave all its attention to the grounding of the smaller 737 MAX after two fatal crashes.
But days after taking the helm with a mandate to lift Boeing out of its 10-month-old reputational crisis, Chief Executive Dave Calhoun said the competitive playing field had changed.
""Since the first clean sheet of paper was taken to it, things have changed a bit ... the competitive playing field is a little different,"" he told journalists on a conference call on Wednesday.
""We're going to start with a clean sheet of paper again; I'm looking forward to that,"" Calhoun said. 
He also spoke of a fresh approach to the market.
A Boeing spokesman said Calhoun had ordered up a new study on what kind of aircraft was needed. New aircraft typically take 6-7 years or more to bring to market once a decision is made, though Boeing aims to shorten that in part through digital technology and new business models designed around the NMA.
Calhoun ""has asked the team to do an assessment of the future market and what kind of airplane is needed to meet the future market,"" spokesman Gordon Johndroe said.
Noting that the original assessments on the NMA were made about two and a half years ago, he said the new study would ""build upon what has been learned ... in design and production."" 
In further evidence of a change of pace, people familiar with the matter said a meeting between Boeing and a major potential supplier, originally scheduled for next week, had been abruptly canceled with no new date set. 
That contrasts with the approach just weeks ago when Boeing was still presenting new details of the NMA to some airlines, including a working logo - ""theNMA"" - and details of an ""advanced composite"" structure, according to a slide seen by Reuters.
The NMA had been designed to address a slender gap between single-aisle workhorse jets like the 737 MAX and long-haul wide-body jets like the 787. 
But most of the effort revolved around a new production system designed not only to support the NMA but to lay the groundwork for the next single-aisle aircraft after the 737 MAX.
Calhoun said he expected the MAX, whose return to service was delayed again earlier this week, to resume its previous place in the market and remain in service for a generation.
Traditionally toe-to toe-with Europe's Airbus SE (PA:AIR), Boeing has fallen behind in sales for the largest category of single-aisle planes, such as the 200-240-seat Airbus A321neo, which overlaps with the niche being targeted by the NMA.
By delaying a decision on the NMA, Boeing already risked losing the sweetest part of the market, especially after Airbus seized contracts with two major U.S. airlines, analysts said.

Analysts have also questioned whether Boeing, facing costs equivalent to a new program to repair the MAX crisis, as well as delays on its large new 777X jet whose maiden flight is set for Friday, would have appetite for such a costly project now.

""They are getting more optimistic for the second half of the year than they have for the first half and actually 2019,"" Kaeser said in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos.
He said he wanted Siemens, which employs 60,000 people directly in the United States, to be treated equally to U.S. companies when it came to reconstruction projects in the Middle East, and called on Germany's government to increase infrastructure spending.
""We have good American workers, working for us in the U.S. If we go to Iraq and if we go to Syria and we help rebuild those countries, I want to be treated as a U.S. company going out to help these people,"" said Kaeser, who raised the issue with U.S. President Trump at a dinner."

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to open lower Thursday, weighed by losses in Asia as the battle to contain the spread of a deadly virus intensifies. 
At 02:15 ET (0715 GMT), the DAX futures contract traded 9 points, or 0.1% lower. France's CAC 40 futures were down 14 points, or 0.2%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 10 points, or 0.1%. Futures on the pan-eurozone Euro Stoxx 50, slipped 4 points, or 0.1%.
In China, the Shanghai Composite fell 2.8% and the Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 dropped 3.6%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index lost 2%.
Earlier Thursday, China issued a travel suspension in Wuhan, a city of 11 million at the center of the outbreak of the coronavirus, as its latest attempt to stop the spread of the disease that has killed at least 17 people and infected hundreds of people in China, and as far afield as the U.S., Thailand, Taiwan, Japan and the Republic of Korea. This has sparked fears of a pandemic.
Wuhan is a major transportation hub with roads and railways connecting it to the rest of the country and is often referred to as the Chicago of China, Robert Carnell, Chief Economist, Asia-Pacific at ING, said in a research note. In 2018, Wuhan produced GDP of $224 billion. 
“In China at least, and for sure in Wuhan, the economic impact of the disease is now manifesting itself not just in households' precautionary behavior, but in the authorities' quarantine efforts,” Carnell added.
However, the World Health Organization postponed a decision over whether to declare the virus a ""public health emergency of international concern,"" which might merit a coordinated global response.
The organization's emergency committee met Wednesday in Geneva, but decided more information was needed. It is expected to take up the matter again on Thursday.
“This is an evolving and complex situation,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the WHO, in a briefing with reporters in Geneva.
“Today, there was an excellent discussion during the committee meeting, but it was also clear that to proceed we need more information,” he added.
Aside from news from Asia, the European Central Bank meets later Thursday and is widely expected to keep interest rates on hold--at -50 basis points and 0 bp for the deposit rate and the main refinancing rate, respectively--and quantitative easing at 20 billion euros ($22 billion) a month.
The main focus will be on the strategic review promised by ECB President Christine Lagarde, in her second meeting in this role. 
“We expect her to give more details as to the parameters that will be included in the review,” according to analysts at Nordea, in a research note, “but she will not jump to any conclusions ahead of the process.”
In corporate news, STMicroelectronics (PA:STM) will be in focus Thursday after the European semiconductor chip maker said that net profit for the fourth quarter fell year-on-year, while revenue rose amid higher sales.
Elsewhere, the price of oil has retreated sharply after the American Petroleum Institute reported that crude inventories rose last week, by 1.6 million barrels, adding to the picture of an oversupplied market. Official government data are due at 10:30 AM ET.
At 2:15 AM ET (07:15 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 1.7% lower at $55.78 and the international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.4% to $62.31. Gold futures for February delivery on New York’s COMEX was flat at $1,556.40."

""Alstom is a very strong company, healthy and that's why we have to think about the future of Alstom. But we are all aware that there will be a move in the direction of consolidation in the railway industry in the coming years"", Le Maire told Reuters TV at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss resort of Davos.
Alstom shares hit a two-year high Wednesday following a report of a potential deal with Bombardier.
Trainmakers have explored various combinations in recent years, with the idea of creating larger industry champions to head off competition from Chinese firms.
Last year the European Union blocked a deal between Alstom and Germany's  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) to merge their rail assets, highlighting some of the antitrust hurdles the sector faces.
""I deeply regret that the merger between Siemens and Alstom did not go to the end because it was really a great purpose for all of us, for the European industry"", Le Maire said."

1607,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2020 01:26AM ET</span>",Explainer: Global airlines on high alert as virus outbreak spreads,"By Jamie Freed
(Reuters) - Airlines and passengers are on guard against a new flu-like virus that originated in Wuhan, China.
Here's an explainer on the airline industry's response to the outbreak so far and its potential financial exposure compared to SARS in 2003, which killed nearly 800 people:
WHAT IS THE EXPECTED FINANCIAL IMPACT ON AIRLINES?
The biggest concern is a sharp drop in travel demand if the virus becomes a pandemic.
During the height of the SARS outbreak in April 2003, passenger demand in Asia plunged 45%, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). 
Cathay cut nearly 40% of its flights and reported a financial loss, as did Singapore Airlines Ltd (SI:SIAL),  Japan Airlines Co Ltd  (T:9201) and ANA Holdings Inc (T:9202).
The industry is now more reliant on Chinese travelers.
For example, in Australia, Chinese travelers account for more than 15% of international arrivals, up from just 4% in 2003, according to Moody's ratings service.
Those travelers, who arrive mostly via mainland carriers, often take domestic flights once they arrive in Australia, pointing to the potential for knock on effects for the likes of local airline Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN) if there is a fall in travel demand.
Since 2003, the number of annual air passengers has more than doubled, with China growing to become the world's largest outbound travel market.
In 2003, 6.8 million passengers from China traveled on international flights, and that number has grown by close to 10 times to 63.7 million in 2018, according to data from the country's aviation authority.
Global airline industry revenues more than doubled to $838 billion in 2019 from just $322 billion in 2003, according to IATA data.
""Whether only one secondary market, an entire country or the wider region is impacted is obviously unpredictable and outside of the industry's control,"" said Brendan Sobie, an independent aviation analyst in Singapore.
WHICH AIRLINES ARE HEAVILY EXPOSED?
Many airlines, including Korean Air Lines (KS:003490), Singapore Airlines' budget carrier Scoot, Taiwan's China Airlines Ltd (TW:2610) and Japan's ANA, announced they were cancelling flights in and out of Wuhan after authorities announced a lockdown.
South Korean budget carrier T'way Air (KS:091810) earlier this week postponed the scheduled launch of a new route to the city.
Flight tracking website FlightRadar24 showed that as of 0600 GMT on Thursday, 184 Wuhan flights, or 60% of the departures listed for the day, had been canceled. 
Wuhan's Tianhe airport serves around 2% of China's total air traffic and mainly serves domestic routes. Broker Jefferies estimated 88.8% of overall flights are domestic, with China Southern (NYSE:SO) Airlines Co Ltd (SS:600029) holding the largest market share at 30%.
ARE PASSENGERS CANCELLING TRIPS TO CHINA?
Hanatour Service Inc (KS:039130), South Korea's largest travel agency, said that cancellations of trips to China increased about 20% this week compared to same period last year. The figure includes postponements and switches to other destinations, a company official said.
Rajeev Kale, country head for Thomas Cook India's holidays division, said some customers were raising concerns about traveling to China. ""Most of our customers are adopting a wait and watch approach to see further developments,"" he said.

Philippine Airlines, Garuda Indonesia (JK:GIAA) and Japan Airlines said there was no slowdown in bookings to and from China yet, while low-cost Filipino carrier Cebu Pacific said some passengers had expressed concerns about whether it was safe to fly but had not canceled bookings.

The new, flu-like virus, first discovered in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has killed 17 and infected nearly 600 people. Cases have been detected in other major population centers, including Beijing and Shanghai, as well as overseas, triggering a public scramble for face masks and flu medicines.
Chinese President Xi Jinping has ordered all-out prevention and control efforts to fight the new virus, and urged governments at all levels to make people's safety and health a top priority.
Tianjin TEDA Co (SZ:000652) said in an exchange filing on Thursday that its subsidiary, TEDA Filters, is stepping up production of filtration materials used in facial masks to meet surging demand.
Biotech firm Xilong Scientific Co (SZ:002584) said late on Wednesday that it has developed diagnostic devices for the new virus and will send the products to disease control centers in some parts of China.
Wuhan Guide Infrared Co (SZ:002414) told the official China Securities Journal that the company has donated 4 million yuan worth of infrared thermometer devices to the government of Hubei, the province where Wuhan is located.
Shares in TEDA, Xilong Scientific and Guide Infrared have jumped roughly 40%, 24%, and 9% this week, respectively. The blue-chip index CSI300 (CSI300) is down nearly 4% during the same period.
Other firms, including biotech firm BGI Genomics Co (SZ:300676), mask producer Guangzhou Improve Medical Instruments Co (SZ:300030) and drugmaker Guangdong Zhongsheng Pharmaceutical Co (SZ:002317), have also disclosed efforts to help in the fight against the spread of the virus.
E-commerce platforms, including Alibaba's Taobao, JD.com (O:JD),  Pinduoduo  Inc (O:PDD) and Suning.com (SZ:002024), have announced crackdowns on price hikes of products needed to fight the virus as demand surges."

The Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component both dropped 0.5% by 10:30 PM ET (02:30 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index lost 0.9%.
China issued a travel suspension in Wuhan, a city of 11 million, as its latest attempt to stop the spread of the coronavirus that has killed at least 17 people and infected hundreds of people in China, the U.S., Thailand, Taiwan, Japan and the Republic of Korea, according to WHO and Chinese state media.
The travel ban was reported by state broadcaster CCTV late Thursday.
The news came after the World Health Organization postponed making a decision on whether the mysterious virus is a global health emergency.
 
“This is an evolving and complex situation,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the WHO, in a briefing with reporters in Geneva.

PG&E said its creditors, led by Elliott Management and Pacific Investment Management Co, would drop their reorganization plan and support PG&E's proposal, pending approval by a bankruptcy court.
The bondholders had previously opposed PG&E's reorganization plan and in December came out with an updated proposal that included a sweetened offer to California wildfire victims, no debt at the reorganized holding company and a new board with residents from California forming the majority of directors.
New notes to be issued under PG&E's plan will save its customers about $1 billion, the company said.
California Governor Gavin Newsom on Wednesday reiterated his objection to the bankrupt utility's restructuring plan, adding that the company has not done enough to address the concerns that he had raised last month.
PG&E filed for Chapter 11 protection in January, citing potential liabilities in excess of $30 billion from deadly wildfires in 2017 and 2018 linked to its equipment.
Separately, it came under renewed criticism last year for precautionary power outages to guard against the risk of wildfires posed by extremely dry and windy weather."

Investing.com - Here are three things that could rock the markets tomorrow.
1. P&G and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Weigh In
Earnings tomorrow are a dichotomy, with the definitive legacy consumer products giant reporting before the bell and the definitive legacy tech company up after the close.
Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) will weigh in ahead of trading.
Analysts, on average, expect P&G to earn $1.37 per share on sales of about $18.4 billion, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
But investors should be cautious going into earnings, Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar said.
The “pace of growth that P&G is showing is unusual for a company which produces everyday consumables in categories where the competition is intense and margins are low,” Anwar said. “From a big consumer staple giant like P&G it wouldn’t be fair to expect a blowout quarter every time.”
After the bell, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) will be up.
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is expected to report a profit of $1.25 per share, with revenue coming in at $19.2 billion.
Earlier this week Jefferies upgraded its rating on Intel to hold from underperform,
2. ECB Press Conference Takes the Stage/
It’s fairly quiet on the U.S. economic calendar tomorrow. But early hours will bring the European Central Bank’s interest rate decision.
The ECB is expected to keep rates at negative 0.5%, a record low, but of more interest will be the tone of ECB President Christine Lagarde, where the sighting of a hawk could boost the euro.
The decision is at 7:45 AM ET (12:45 GMT), while the press conference with Lagarde is scheduled for 8:30 AM ET.
Also at 8:30 AM ET the weekly initial jobless claims numbers arrive.
The Labor Department is expected to report a bounce back to 215,000 of claims for first-time unemployment benefits after last weeks surprisingly low 204,00.
3. Supplies Are Running the Oil Market
Oil prices have been pressured by a huge build-up in oil products in the U.S. in the last two weeks, indicating that supply is continuing to get ahead of demand.
Today the American Petroleum Institute, reported that its measure of oil inventories rose by 1.6 million for the week ended Jan. 17.
The Energy Information Administration will report its weekly inventory numbers tomorrow at 11:00 AM ET (16:00 GMT), slightly later than usual due to the Martin Luther King Day Holiday on Monday.
Traders are looking for a decline of about 1 million barrels for oil inventories, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
They are also forecasting a rise of about 1 million barrels in gasoline inventories and a build of about 3 million barrels in distillate stockpiles."

The smaller request by Japan's corporate bellwether could be a setback for the economy, as companies hesitate to raise wages out of fear of committing to higher costs.
Toyota last year offered a pay raise of 10,700 yen on average, which was down 1,000 yen from the previous year.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's regulators should have a formal role after Brexit to keep the financial sector globally competitive and less prone to ""gold-plating"" international norms, an industry think tank said on Thursday.
The International Regulatory Strategy Group (IRSG) said new thinking and targeted reforms were required after Britain leaves the European Union on Jan. 31. UK regulators will write its own financial rules instead of applying those fashioned by Brussels.
""Brexit does change the structure around regulation and we need to reflect that,"" Mark Hoban, chair of the IRSG and a former UK financial services minister, told Reuters.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Bank of England are responsible for keeping markets and financial firms safe and stable.
But in a report on regulation after Brexit, the IRSG called for a secondary remit of ensuring that rules do not put the financial sector at a competitive disadvantage to New York, Frankfurt or other rival centers.
British regulators have resisted such calls, fearing it would increase pressure to ease rules.
Their predecessors had to ""have regard"" to Britain's global financial role and were tarnished by a ""light-touch"" reputation after the financial crisis a decade ago.
""The use of the word competitiveness is often quite loaded,"" said Julian Adams, regulatory and government relations director at insurer M&G, and chair of the IRSG report.
""This is not code for a race to the bottom,"" said Adams, also a former senior insurance regulator at the Bank of England.
The IRSG is sponsored by the City of London financial district and TheCityUK, which promotes Britain as a financial center.
Britain will remain a member of international financial standard setters after Brexit, whose norms typically form the basis for national or EU laws that Britain has often ""gold-plated"" - or toughened up.
The report calls for Britain to formally take into account international norms when writing rules to avoid exceeding them unnecessarily in a way that would harm UK competitiveness.
""You make sure the global standard is as good as you want it to be and need it to be as a regulator, and then you would try and limit to the extent possible any gold-plating,"" Adams said.
UK rulemaking in isolation could also have implications for access to EU investors after Brexit, said Lucy Fergusson, lead author of the IRSG report and a lawyer at Linklaters.
The report called for a new parliamentary committee to directly focus on financial rules.
The competitiveness call is likely to get a sympathetic hearing from government, mindful that finance is Britain's biggest tax-raising sector which may not secure good future access to the EU, its biggest export customer."

The pension arm of Australia's biggest bank has been hit with at least three such lawsuits, highlighting the intense scrutiny the sector faces after a government-backed inquiry showed systemic over-charging of fees.
The law firm, Shine Lawyers, had said in a statement earlier this week that Colonial First State encouraged customers to pick policies by CBA's insurance unit CommInsure, leaving them with higher premiums.
""These customers were forced to pay more for life insurance as well as total and permanent disability insurance, and this has eaten into their superannuation,"" its class actions practice leader Rebecca Jancauskas had said.

The country's biggest bank said it was reviewing the claim, while the law firm said it acted on behalf of ""hundreds of thousands of Australians"".

WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Chief Executive Dave Calhoun told reporters on Wednesday the U.S. planemaker expects to resume 737 MAX production months before its forecasted mid-year return to service and said it did not plan to suspend or cut its dividend.
The company announced a production halt in December, when the global grounding of the fast-selling 737 MAX following two deadly crashes in five months looked set to last into mid-2020 -- a timeline pushed back after Boeing endorsed new simulator training for pilots.
Calhoun said the company is not considering scrapping the MAX and expects it will continue to fly for a generation. ""I am all in on it and the company is all in on it,"" Calhoun said, adding Boeing will not launch a marketing campaign to get customers to get back on 737 MAX planes.
The company said on Tuesday it now expects regulators to approve the plane's return to service in the middle of the year. Calhoun said he did not see recent issues raised about wiring or software as ""serious problems.""
The production delay threatens to cut U.S. gross domestic product by as much as 0.5 percentage points. President Donald Trump on Wednesday told CNBC Boeing is a ""very disappointing company."" 
United Airlines (O:UAL) said Wednesday it does not expect to fly the Boeing 737 MAX this summer.
Boeing shares closed down 1.4% on Wednesday.
Calhoun said Boeing is not planning to cut or suspend the dividend because Boeing has the ""financial capacity and capability to do the things we need to do."" Calhoun said he ""will stay on that path unless something dramatic changes.""
Calhoun declined to provide a specific date for resumption of production, but said it ""will be reinvigorated months before that moment in June because we have to get that line started up again."" He also said the company would make some changes to the 737 MAX production line to make it more efficient.
The CEO said the company ""will slowly, steadily bring our production rate up a few months before that date in the middle of the year."" He said the company was not planning to lay off any employees because of the latest MAX delay.
The latest push back in the forecasted return to service is due to the company's decision to endorse simulator training for pilots before they resume flights, Calhoun said. ""We can get this thing back on its horse and we will,"" he added.
Calhoun was a director at Boeing for a decade before taking over as CEO earlier this month. The board ousted Dennis Muilenburg in December amid rising anger by regulators, politicians and customers.
He said the company should have not have repeatedly revised the plane's forecasted return. ""It was hard for anybody to trust us,"" Calhoun said.

Calhoun said before certification there will be ""a few more things somewhere along the way that the FAA and us will determine need a little extra work and we'll do it. They won't be big emergencies things, they won't be things that take the airplane down.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Technology shares led the S&P 500 marginally higher on Wednesday, as a healthy forecast from  IBM  helped mitigate worries over the developing coronavirus outbreak.
The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closed barely in the black after approaching, then backing down from record highs the day after virus fears prompted a sell-off. The Dow closed nominally lower.
""The market's had a big run, that's made some investors a bit skittish, cautious,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. ""So we're not seeing a really strong day."" 
""Earnings season is always volatile and unpredictable,"" Ghriskey added. ""Every new earnings report that gets released is another piece of the puzzle."" 
Optimism was boosted by International Business Machines (N:IBM), which posted surprise quarterly revenue growth and forecast higher-than-expected full-year profit. Its shares advanced 3.4%.

Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, six ended the session in positive territory. Tech (SPLRCT) was up the most, while energy (SPNY) was the biggest laggard.
Fourth-quarter earnings season is well under way, with 58 companies in the S&P 500 having reported, 67.2% of which have beaten analyst expectations, according to Refinitiv data.
Analysts now expect fourth-quarter earnings to have contracted by 0.8% year-on-year.
Streaming pioneer Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) acknowledged stiffer competition in the United States, where quarterly growth fell short of analyst estimates. Its shares closed down 3.6%.
Shares of  Boeing Co  (N:BA) extended their fall, dropping 1.4% in the wake of the planemaker's announcement that it does not expect approval for its 737 MAX aircraft to return to service until summer.

On the economic front, sales of existing homes in December blew past economist estimates to reach a near two-year high.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.10-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.03-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

(Reuters) - Shares of  Sarepta  Therapeutics Inc (O:SRPT) were down around 4% Wednesday after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration revealed documents detailing concerns it had about the safety and efficacy of one of the company's recently approved Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) drugs. 
The drug, Vyondys 53, also known as golodirsen, was originally rejected by the FDA last year before the agency reversed that decision in December and approved it. 
It was the second controversial drug approval for Sarepta. The company saw its first drug, Exondys 51, which also treats DMD, approved in 2016 despite concerns raised by experts about its effectiveness. 
The newly released documents outlined concerns ranging from kidney toxicity, to infections, to low levels of effectiveness as reasons for the FDA's original rejection of the drug. The FDA cited some of these concerns at the time of its original rejection of Vyondys 53 but the documents provide further detail. 
The documents added that Vyondys 53 comes with greater risk of kidney toxicity than Exondys 51 and that the risks of infection, which exist for both drugs, were not as well understood at the time Exondys was approved. Therefore, while Exondys was approved based on assumptions that it had ""essentially no risk,"" Vyondys 53 has a less favorable risk profile. 
""I have reached the conclusion that this small benefit, which has not yet been verified, does not outweigh its risks,"" Ellis Unger, a director at the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, wrote in his letter. 
Sarepta successfully appealed the FDA's decision in 2019. The company said it addressed the kidney toxicity issue in the drug’s label, which recommends monthly monitoring of patients.
The FDA said in a statement to Reuters that its eventual approval of Vyondys 53 demonstrates its flexibility in approving new drugs for serious diseases that have no satisfactory treatments available. It added that it stands by its eventual decision to approve the drug. 
Both of Sarepta's drug approvals are contingent on it conducting additional post-marketing studies to show their efficacy and submitting them to the FDA.

The pipeline, which can transport 2 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd), came into service in September last year when drillers were burning off natural gas at record rates due to lack of transportation capacity from the shale-rich Permian Basin.
Earnings from natural gas transport volumes rose 14% and from NGL transport volumes jumped 23% from a year earlier.
The pipeline operator generated $1.35 billion, or 59 cents per share, in distributable cash flow (DCF) in the fourth quarter, higher than $1.14 billion, or 50 cents per share, in the prior quarter. On a year-over-year basis, DCF rose 6%.
Investors have been pushing U.S. oil and gas pipeline operators to deliver positive free cash flow as low energy prices and idle shale rigs pressure earnings.
The Houston-based company, which has pipelines as well as storage terminals, said net income attributable to shareholders rose to $610 million, or 27 cents per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $483 million, or 21 cents per share, a year earlier.
However, the company's weighted average natural gas liquids (NGL) price for the quarter fell to $5.34 a barrel, or 19%, and realized weighted average crude oil price fell 10% t $49.90 a barrel. It also said profit was partly hurt by weakness in its CO2 segment.
Excluding one-time items, Kinder Morgan earned 26 cents, missing the Street's view by a cent, according to Refinitiv IBES data. 

The segment, which ships carbon dioxide to oilfields where it is used to extract crude, came under pressure from lower production due to volatile oil prices.

The appointment comes less than two months after the bank got embroiled in the scandal and at a time of wider gloom for Australia's ""Big Four"" banks following the damaging revelations from a government-backed inquiry into financial sector misconduct.
The scandal came to light in November and regulator AUSTRAC launched legal action against Westpac, accusing it of enabling 23 million payments in breach of anti-money laundering laws, including the facilitation of offshore payments relating to child exploitation. 
It led to the resignation of Chief Executive Brian Hartzer and forced current Chairman Lindsay Maxsted to bring forward his retirement.
In last month's annual meeting, the lender's shareholders had voted down executive pay for a second year due to investor outrage over the scandal.
Last week, mining giant BHP Group (AX:BHP) said Maxsted will not stand for re-election as a director on its board.
McFarlane, who was chairman of British bank  Barclays  (L:BARC) until May last year, will assume charge on April 2 and oversee the search for a new CEO, the lender said. 
""My focus initially will naturally be on resolving the company's current issues but equally important, to position it as quickly as possible for long-term success,"" McFarlane said in a statement, adding that the appointment of a CEO may take more time.

(Reuters) - Prosecutors in Canada on Wednesday proposed a $196.5 million (CAD) ($149.5 million) fine against Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) after the company pleaded guilty to dozens of counts of diesel emissions violations, a company spokesman confirmed on Wednesday.
Volkswagen was charged in December with importing nearly 128,000 vehicles into Canada violating emissions standards. VW pleaded guilty after being charged with 60 counts of breaching the Canadian Environmental Protection Act and providing misleading information. The company said last month it had reached ""a proposed plea resolution"" without disclosing details.
Volkswagen admitted to using illegal software to cheat U.S. pollution tests in 2015, triggering a global backlash against diesel vehicles that has so far cost it 30 billion euros ($33.3 billion) in fines, penalties and buyback costs. In May 2019, it set aside an additional 5.5 billion euros in contingent liabilities as it continues to face penalties and lawsuits around the world.

The Chinese city at the center of a widening respiratory-virus outbreak suspended outbound flights and rail service, as China ramps up efforts to contain an illness that’s killed at least 17 people and infected hundreds.
The travel halt by the city of Wuhan was reported by state broadcaster CCTV. The city also suspended travel by bus, subway and ferry. Citizens shouldn’t leave the city without special reasons, the report said.
CCTV reported earlier that the death toll has nearly doubled from a previous total of nine. There were two “preliminary positive” reports of the pneumonia-causing virus in Hong Kong, with one diagnosis in the U.S. and patients under examination in Mexico and Russia.
Health officials around the world are racing to control the SARS-like virus that first appeared last month. The World Health Organization will decide Wednesday whether to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, a designation used for complex epidemics that can cross borders.
After volatility Tuesday, Asian markets calmed Wednesday as China’s National Health Commission detailed actions to contain the disease. The number of cases has climbed to at least 550, according to the People’s Daily.
One 39-year-old Hong Kong patient was found by temperature screening after traveling from Wuhan to Shenzhen, and then to Hong Kong via rail, according to Sophia Chan, Hong Kong’s secretary for food and health.
While final test results are still forthcoming, the man’s case is “highly suspicious,” according to Constance Chan, head of Hong Kong’s Department of Health. Four family members who didn’t have symptoms stayed overnight at a hotel in a popular tourist area and then departed for Manila.
In a briefing in Beijing Wednesday, health officials said China has stepped up monitoring of transportation links and ordered a near-complete shutdown of Wuhan, where the virus originated. Officials acknowledged that they’re still grappling to understand the pathogen, which has infected multiple medical workers.
“We are still on a learning curve,” said Gao Fu, head of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. “The disease will continue to develop.” It has already changed from the early stages of detection, he said in the briefing.
China said it had seen no evidence yet of “super spreaders,” infected people who pass on the disease rapidly to many other people, but could not rule out that some would emerge. Super spreaders played a key role in the SARS pandemic 17 years ago, which killed almost 800 people and hurt economies across the region.
The 17 deaths from the new virus have been in Hubei province, whose capital is Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, CCTV said.
About 4,000 people in Wuhan may be currently infected, based on the number of known cases and the estimated mean time between infection and detection, according to a study by Neil Ferguson, a researcher at Imperial College London.
While Ferguson’s group released an estimate of 1,700 infections over the weekend, the new total doesn’t mean that the outbreak has doubled in size, according to the study. Factors such as delays in reporting and confirming cases make it difficult to estimate the epidemic’s growth rate, the researchers said.
Fever, Cough
Symptoms include fever, cough or chest tightness, and difficulty breathing. Both the Wuhan virus, known as 2019-nCoV, and SARS belong to the family of coronaviruses, so called because of their crown-like shape. Many such viruses cross the barrier between animals and humans.
Gao said in the Beijing briefing that the source of 2019-nCoV was wild animals sold in so-called wet markets. Some of the first group of patients in Wuhan worked or shopped at a seafood market where live animals and wildlife parts were reportedly sold.
A WHO declaration of a public health emergency can help mobilize an international response and focus government attention. The body most recently declared such an emergency last year, as an Ebola outbreak worsened in Congo.
An emergency declaration for the Wuhan virus case could include recommendations to restrict travel or trade. Such a move would come as concern grows that the virus could spread rapidly during China’s Lunar New Year break, which starts at the end of this week. Hundreds of millions of people are poised to travel for the holidays in the biggest annual migration of humans on the planet.
The WHO has formed teams at its Geneva headquarters to study the virus, its spread and its symptoms and is sending experts to China to help gather information, according to David Heymann, an infectious disease researcher in the U.K. who advises the agency.
As they did during the SARS and Ebola outbreaks, health officials and scientists globally are tracking patients and testing samples of saliva and other fluids to determine the exact cause and severity of their ailments. They’re identifying and monitoring people with whom the patients were in contact to see if the virus is spreading easily from person to person. And they are placing restrictions on travel to try to limit the exposure to scores of new people.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, expanded its inspection of airline passengers who had spent time in China to airports in Atlanta and Chicago on Tuesday, building on the 1,200 people who had been screened in California and New York over the weekend. No new cases were uncovered.
U.S. Patient
The U.S. case is a man in his 30s who was traveling in Wuhan and arrived back in the U.S. on Jan. 15, Washington state health officials said on a call with the CDC Tuesday. The resident of Snohomish, Washington, said he hadn’t spent any time at the live-animal market where the virus is believed to have originated and didn’t have contact with anyone who was sick.
The man sought care quickly after monitoring news about the virus and is in good condition, though he has been hospitalized out of an abundance of caution, the officials said.
President Donald Trump told reporters at the World Economic Forum in Davos that the U.S. has a plan to deal with the virus.
“The CDC has been terrific,” he said. “We’re in very good shape and I think China is in very good shape also.”
U.K. health officials raised the risk level of the virus to low from very low and issued guidance to airports. The focus of concern is about three flights a week that arrive from Wuhan at London Heathrow, according to a statement from the Department of Health and Social Care.
A message will be broadcast during those flights to encourage reporting of illness, and the planes will be received in an isolated area of the airport. Passengers will be met by health officials who will check for symptoms.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention said there’s a “moderate likelihood of imported cases being detected” in Europe.
The U.S., South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Thailand and the Chinese territory of Macau have already reported cases.
“This is an evolving situation,” said Nancy Messonnier, director of the U.S. CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. “We do expect additional cases in the United States and globally.”"

The company said https://www.dropbox.com/sh/a8d448rg2ia38wb/AADm73yA_KTatQr7C4RmZHTEa/Press%20releases?dl=0&preview=Series+B+press+release.pdf&subfolder_nav_tracking=1 the latest round took total funding to over $180 million and drew investment from new and existing investors such as Bill Gates, Richard Branson and meat producer  Tyson Foods  (N:TSN).
The company did not disclose the valuation at which the funding was made.
Memphis Meats makes its products from animal cells in labs, differing from companies like Beyond Meat (O:BYND) and Impossible Foods, which develop their meat alternatives from plant-based proteins.
Berkley, California-based Memphis Meats said it would use the funds to build a pilot production facility and launch new products.
Plant-based meat and other meat alternatives are soaring in popularity, with millennials and Gen Z consumers increasingly shunning beef, poultry and pork for environmental and health reasons.
Beyond Meat shares have risen five-fold from their May IPO price and the company has benefited from partnering with Subway and McDonald's (N:MCD). Rival Impossible Foods has tied up with Burger King (TO:QSR) and White Castle."

U.S. and Canadian oil and natural gas exploration and production company bankruptcies totaled 42 in 2019, up from 28 in 2018, the law firm said.
""Following a steep drop in oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2018, there was a sharp increase in the number of filings in 2019,"" the report said.
A total of 208 oil and gas production companies have filed for bankruptcy between 2015 and 2019, according to the report.
""This increase in year-over-year filings indicates that the reverberations of the 2015 oil price crash will continue to be felt in the industry through at least the first half of 2020,"" Haynes and Boone said.
Midstream companies that provide storage and pipelines to producers fared better with only two bankruptcies in 2019 out of a total of 28 since the beginning of 2015.
Oilfield service companies were again hit hard with the number of bankruptcies nearly doubling from 12 in 2018 to 21 in 2019, the largest being the $7.4-billion filing by Weatherford International in July."

Investing.com – The S&P continued to flirt with record intraday highs Wednesday, led by a rally in tech on the back of bullish earnings from   IBM   (NYSE:IBM) and improved sentiment on chip stocks.
The S&P 500 rose 0.3%. The Dow gained 0.15% and the Nasdaq Composite was up almost 0.6%.
 IBM  (NYSE:IBM) led the rally in tech, rising 3% as Big Blue's better-than-expected quarterly results were greeted by several endorsements from Wall Street.
Morgan Stanley raised its price target on  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) to $164 from $155, but said the return to revenue growth for the company was driven by ""less sustainable"" tailwinds like the new Red Hat unit and currency gains.
Cantor Fitzgerald and   Citigroup   (NYSE:C) also raised their price targets on IBM.
Chip stocks also powered the broader averages to intraday highs as a sunnier outlook from chipmaker ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) stoked sentiment on the sector ahead of key earnings from chip bellwether Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) after the closing bell.
But Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) fell 2% as its weaker outlook on growth for the first quarter raised concerns about the impact of rising competition from rivals like   Disney   (NYSE:DIS) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).
Against the backdrop of gains in tech, industrials remained under pressure as Boeing (NYSE:BA) struggled to gain its footing following an announcement that its 737 Max would likely be grounded until mid-2020.
Boeing said its decision to advise customers its grounded 737 Max jet was unlikely to be recertified until mid-year was not due to any new technical issues
Energy, meanwhile, was the worst-performing sector as oil prices slumped after the International Energy Agency warned of surplus in crude at a time when concerns about softer demand persist. "

No reason was given but relations between the Czech Republic and China have deteriorated sharply in the past months following a series of diplomatic spats. Flights to China by other carriers are not affected, the airport said.
""We don't have any official information why this step was taken,"" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zuzana Stichova said. ""We don't know whether this is a temporary or definitive decision and whether this step is commercially or politically motivated.""
""In forthcoming negotiations, whether in Prague or Beijing, we are going to ask our Chinese partners about the reasons for this decision.""
Hainan Airlines and China's embassy in Prague did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
Hainan Airlines has operated the Beijing-Prague route since 2015 with, currently, three flights weekly.
Relations between the Czech Republic and China took a turn for the worse last year after city authorities in Prague showed support for Tibet and demanded changes to an intercity partnership agreement with Beijing over a reference to China's 'one-China' policy on Taiwan.
The agreement was eventually canceled, and Prague last week instead signed a cooperation deal with Taiwan's Taipei, further infuriating Beijing, which regards Taiwan as a renegade province. [nL4N29J2QS]
An initial blow came in December 2018 with a warning by the Czech cyber-security watchdog over risks about using network technology provided by Chinese telecoms equipment makers Huawei and ZTE (HK:0763).
Building closer links with China had been among the priorities for Czech President Milos Zeman who visited China five times in the past seven years.
But Zeman said earlier this month he would skip a planned summit between China and central and eastern European countries in April, after planned Chinese investments failed to materialize.
Apart from Hainan's flights to Beijing, China Eastern Airlines operate flights between Prague and Shanghai and Prague and Xi'an, and Sichuan Airlines fly between Prague and Chengdu.
Hainan's website was offering direct Beijing-Prague and Prague-Beijing flights until Friday Feb. 28 when checked on Wednesday."

1641,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2020 01:00PM ET</span>","Google CEO eyes major opportunity in healthcare, says will protect privacy","By Greg Roumeliotis
DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc and its Google subsidiary, said on Wednesday that healthcare offers the biggest potential over the next five to 10 years for using artificial intelligence to improve outcomes, and vowed that the technology giant will heed privacy concerns.
U.S. lawmakers have raised questions about Google's access to the health records of tens of millions of Americans. Ascension, which operates 150 hospitals and more than 50 senior living facilities across the United States, is one of Google's biggest cloud computing customers in healthcare.
""When we work with hospitals, the data belongs to the hospitals,"" Pichai told a conference panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
""But look at the potential here. Cancer if often missed and the difference in outcome is profound. In lung cancer, for example, five experts agree this way and five agree the other way. We know we can use artificial intelligence to make it better,"" Pichai added.
Google has spent several years developing artificial intelligence to automatically analyze MRI scans and other patient data to identify diseases and make predictions aimed at improving outcomes and reducing cost.
The U.S. lawmakers asked the company in November to provide information about other health systems that provide information to Google, whether Ascension clients will be allowed to opt out of the project, and whether the data be used for advertising.
Pichai said there was already strong privacy protecting regulations in place that provide a framework for Google to operate.
Google clinched a deal in November to acquire Fitbit Inc for $2.1 billion, aiming to enter the wearables segment and invest in digital health. The acquisition is expected to be scrutinized closely by regulators before it is allowed to close.

Bloomberg Economics sees the danger that China will hit its $200 billion extra purchases commitment in its trade deal with the U.S. by shifting purchases from other countries. In 2017, the baseline year for the deal, the U.S. share of China’s imports in the target categories was 9% -- adding the target commitments would take the share to 17%. Angola, the Republic of the Congo and Mongolia face the highest risk, with 57%, 49% and 47% of their total exports in 2017 coming from sales to China in categories covered by the deal, while focusing on major economies exporting agriculture and energy products -- where substitution is easiest -- Brazil, Saudi Arabia and Australia are most exposed.

1643,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 22, 2020 12:46PM ET</span>",Wall Street’s Bond Transparency Letters Are Revealing,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In most bond-market battles, if BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). and Pacific Investment Management Co. are on the same side, it’s a safe bet to assume they’ll come out victorious. After all, the two behemoths oversee about $9 trillion in assets combined and loom large in both actively managed fixed-income mutual funds and exchanged-traded funds.
However, their push to delay reporting of large corporate-bond trades was so audacious — and against the grain of just about every other move toward transparency across markets — that it seems to have left the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority with little choice but to side against them, at least for the moment.
As a reminder, Finra in April proposed a pilot program that would give bond traders 48 hours to disclose large block trades to other investors instead of the 15 minutes required under current rules. The initiative, as I wrote at the time, would serve to provide some empirical evidence in the debate about the trade-offs between bond-market liquidity and transparency. The regulator held an open comment period for a few months, during which it received 31 letters. I inquired about the status of its proposal in late October and was told there was no update.
Well, there is now. Bloomberg News’s Ben Bain, citing two people familiar with the matter, reported Wednesday that Finra informed the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association that the study had been put on the back burner, pending further discussions with the Securities and Exchange Commission and a bond advisory panel called the Fixed Income Market Structure Advisory Committee. Finra spokesman Ray Pellecchia told Bain, “we’re continuing to review the comments received and consider potential next steps.” But at the very least, it seems the plan has hit a wall.
It takes only a quick glance at the comment letters to Finra to understand why. There’s real concern that this proposal was an attempt by the biggest investing firms to tilt the playing field to their advantage and that of large dealers.
This passage from Federated Investors, for example, summarizes the general sentiment:
The 48 hour delay appears to be intended to accommodate the circumstances of the largest buy-side participants in executing large trades. This may simply reflect the possibility that these institutions have reached their capacity limit in managing fixed income funds. The 48 hour delay would therefore improve liquidity for these institutions while impairing market efficiency for other market participants. This is per se contrary to the SEC’s statutory missions of promoting competition and market efficiency.
The purpose of reapportioning this transactional cost is not to significantly improve liquidity, but rather to provide a relief valve for the largest asset managers in the U.S. corporate bond market… market structure should not favor large traders to the detriment of smaller traders.
As far as Finra comment letters go, that’s quite spicy. For some context, Federated manages about $527 billion of assets overall. BlackRock has $565 billion in just its fixed-income iShares ETFs, to say nothing of its actively managed bond funds and other investment options. BlackRock expects that number will reach $1 trillion within the next five years, Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said last week in an earnings conference call, calling the bond ETFs “a modernizing force in financial markets.”
The backlash doesn’t stop there, though. T. Rowe Price Group Inc., which has twice as many assets as Federated at $1.12 trillion, also cautioned against carrying out the pilot program:
The 48-hour delay would create an unlevel playing field in the fixed income markets because it would only apply to the most sizeable trades. As a result, the largest investment advisers and broker-dealers would have an information advantage over other market participants when negotiating trades, effectively creating a two-tier system of haves and have-nots.
Let that sink in for a moment. A trillion-dollar investment firm is concerned about “have-nots.” T. Rowe either believes that a two-tier system would be bad for the corporate-bond market as a whole or that it would be at risk of becoming a “have-not” itself.
Still, the biggest dagger to the heart of the pilot program might have been from Vanguard Group Inc. and its $5.6 trillion in assets under management. “The Proposed Pilot is a harmful solution to an unsubstantiated problem,” the letter signed by Chief Investment Officer Gregory Davis said. “We routinely trade corporate bond blocks much larger than the current dissemination caps and... have observed that liquidity for corporate bond block trades has generally improved over time.”
Citadel LLC and AQR Capital Management also voiced opposition. Citadel faulted some members of the SEC’s advisory committed for simply asserting that bond trading would improve despite “little evidence to suggest that the Proposed Pilot will meaningfully improve liquidity conditions.” That’s similar to how AQR put it:
While we are strong supporters of making policy decisions based on the type of data-driven analysis afforded by pilot programs, the reality is that all pilots are disruptive to the workflow of market participants and thus have inherent costs. In order to justify imposing such costs on the marketplace as a whole there should be clear evidence that the changes being tested have at least a reasonable likelihood of achieving the desired outcome. We do not believe that the Proposed Pilot meets this basic standard.
Of course, this argument presents something of a Catch-22. The reason there’s no evidence that delayed disclosure of large corporate-bond trades improves overall liquidity is because it hasn’t been tested. And without trying it out, there will never be the empirical data needed to get a program like this off the ground. 
For this reason, I’m not sure I’d entirely rule out the possibility of some sort of corporate-bond experiment, even if the details aren’t quite the same as the earlier proposal. A person familiar with the matter told Bain that Finra could still make changes and go forward after consulting with the SEC.
Overall, though, the comment letters reveal real concern — and borderline fear — about what might happen to the bond market if big investment managers are afforded even more power when they’re already gobbling up ever-larger shares of just about every asset class. One firm even went so far as to say that hiding block trades creates “the potential for many victims.” That alone should be enough to give Finra pause."

French magazine Challenges was first to report the inspection but gave no further details. 
There was no initial indication that the checks were explicitly linked to judicial investigations into Ghosn, the former head of the Renault-Nissan alliance arrested in Tokyo in late 2018 on financial misconduct charges which he denies. 
Ghosn fled to Lebanon in late December, and the anti-corruption agency's probe began shortly before then, a source familiar with the matter said. 
The company has been in the limelight over the Ghosn scandal for the past year, however, and the source did not rule out this had raised questions over governance at Renault and prompted a closer look. 
One of the anti-corruption agency's remits is to ensure that French regulations from 2016 - known as the loi Sapin and aimed at improving financial transparency and helping firms detect irregularities - are being implemented correctly. 
Other businesses have also been targeted by routine checks into internal procedures, which can lead to financial sanctions if serious flaws are found. 

""Renault confirms that it has been informed by (anti-corruption agency) AFA that it is carrying out an inspection of the measures contained in 'loi Sapin',"" a spokeswoman for the carmaker said, adding that the company was cooperating with AFA to provide the necessary information and documents.

1645,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2020 12:40PM ET</span>",Argentine bonds fall as Buenos Aires province extends creditor deadline,"By Adam Jourdan and Rodrigo Campos
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentine sovereign and provincial bonds dipped on Wednesday as the provincial government in Buenos Aires was forced to extend a deadline for creditors to agree or reject a plan to delay a $250 million bond repayment originally due on Jan. 26.
The province said on Wednesday, minutes after the consent solicitation deadline had elapsed at 1pm (1600 GMT), that it would extend the cut-off for responses related to a 2021 bond until the same time on Jan. 31.
The province needs to receive consent from holders of over 75% of the principal amount of debt.
""To date we have received the support of a significant number of bondholders, and we continue in dialogue with institutional investors whose participation would allow us to arrive at the desired result,"" Pablo Lopez, the province minister of treasury and finance, said in a statement.
The payment on the 2021 bond marks the first major test for the South American country as it grapples with far more complex talks to restructure about $100 billion in public debts that the new Peronist government says it cannot currently pay.
Ilya Gofshteyn, a senior emerging markets strategist at  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Bank, said that if Buenos Aires could not get sufficient bondholder support, it likely reflected the ""difficulties facing the sovereign restructuring discussions.""
The provincial government said the terms of the bond gave it a grace period of 10 days for capital payments and 30 days for interest payments without triggering a default.
Buenos Aires province, Argentina's largest by far, said this month it was seeking ""temporary financial relief"" from holders of the 2021 bond, and requested an extension to May 1 to make the repayment due this month.
Without consent, the province - and the national government - will be in something of a bind, analysts said.
""The alternatives are to either reach 75% agreement for consent solicitation to postpone the payment to May 1 or otherwise risk a hard default,"" Amherst Pierpont said in a note on Wednesday, adding the question would be whether the state would intervene at the last minute.
""It's a game of brinkmanship on whether either side caves in to avoid a hard default next week.""
Prices for Argentina's over-the-counter (OTC) bonds were down on average around 1.3%, while Buenos Aires bonds fell across the board, led by a 3.5 point drop in the 2021 bond.

1646,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2020 12:36PM ET</span>",Divisive 'dividend recap' deals return in red hot debt market,"By Abhinav Ramnarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - Two buyout firms are raising debt this week at companies they own to pay themselves dividends, using a deal structure criticized by some investors as putting short-term rewards ahead of long-term business interests.
German pharmaceuticals firm Neuraxpharm and Spanish car parking provider Empark are both looking to raise money primarily to refinance existing borrowings. 
However, both are also seeking to take on additional debt to pay dividends to their private equity owners, according to sources familiar with the matter. 
So-called ""dividend recapitalisations"" are often seen as a signal of a peak in bond markets, as well as a trough in the market for stock market fundraisings, as private equity firms often use them in lieu of an initial public offering (IPO).
Critics say that, by doing dividend recaps, buyout firms are piling more debt on their companies to pay themselves.
Defenders argue this is little different from any other dividend payout, which also siphons off funds that could have been used for the company's benefit. 
Neuraxpharm has secured a 541 million euro ($600 million) private loan arranged by  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), according to a document seen by Reuters. 
About 90 million euros of that will go towards paying dividends to owner Apax Partners, according to a source familiar with the matter. 
The owner had received some buying interest but opted to hold the company instead, and added the dividend recap element to help meet its return targets, the source said. 
""It makes sense to hold on to a profitable company rather than exit just yet, particularly as company has further potential to grow,"" said the source. 
A spokesman for Apax declined to comment.
Empark has launched investor roadshows this week ahead of a potential issue of eight-year and seven-year bonds to raise 575 million euros, according to an investor memo seen by Reuters. 
The proceeds of the issue, led by JP Morgan and  Barclays  (LON:BARC), will be used to refinance an existing 475 million euro facility, to pay transaction costs and for a distribution to shareholders, the message stated. 
About 92 million euros will go towards paying a dividend to owner Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets (MIRA), said a second source familiar with the matter. 
""We are merely returning leverage to where it was at time of leveraged buyout (6.9x) and the company has been levered higher in the past pre-MIRA – so this is a fairly sensible dividend,"" said the source.
A second source familiar with the deal stressed that the dividend recap element of the transaction was only a small portion. ""It is incremental rather than transformational, and therefore there is healthy investor appetite for these deals.""
MIRA declined to comment.
A string of deals priced in 2019 with a dividend recap portion, prompting some analysts to suggest that the European bond market was overheating and could be heading for a fall.

1647,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2020 12:35PM ET</span>",Russia's RDIF likely to become limited partner of Baring Vostok: RDIF chief,"By Dmitry Zhdannikov
DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - The head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), Kirill Dmitriev, said it was likely to become one of the limited partners of private equity group Baring Vostok, should the firm decide to raise new funds.
U.S. investor Michael Calvey and other executives at the private equity group were detained in February 2019 on charges of embezzlement and placed under house arrest, which upset western investors who have complained for years about the lack of the rule of law in Russia. 
Calvey's house arrest was extended until Feb. 13 earlier this month and Dmitriev has been a vocal critic of the continued detention.
Dmitriev described Baring as a ""very reputable firm"" in an interview with Reuters in Davos on Wednesday, suggesting the RDIF could continue to work with the company as co-investors.
""We continue to co-invest with Baring Vostok, we've done a number of deals recently,"" Dmitriev said. 
""Actually going forward, we are quite likely to become one of the limited partners of Baring Vostok if they decide to raise new funds. And we'll be happy to bring our co-investors to co-invest with us in Baring Vostok.""
Baring Vostok told Reuters it was grateful to the RDIF for its long-term cooperation and support.
""We will be happy to welcome the RDIF and other co-investors as limited partners of our new fund as soon as the criminal case against our employees, initiated as part of a commercial dispute, is dismissed, and we can fully focus on what we know best - investing in leading Russian businesses,"" a Baring Vostok spokesman said.
The RDIF was set up by the Russian state to co-invest with sovereign wealth and private equity funds in Russian companies.
Calvey and his French colleague Phillipe Delpal deny wrongdoing and say the charges against them are being used to pressure them in a business dispute over control of mid-sized bank Vostochny. 

Vostochny Bank filed a new lawsuit against Baring and Calvey for more than 8.8 billion roubles ($142 million) in November.

1650,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2020 12:26PM ET</span>","Auto industry seen consolidating as falling demand, higher costs bite","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The auto industry faces further consolidation and jobs will migrate to lower-cost countries as companies struggle to develop cleaner vehicles in an economic downturn, European Auto Industry (ACEA) President Mike Manley said on Wednesday.
Tighter emission rules introduced in the wake of Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) diesel pollution cheating scandal are forcing carmakers to cut average fleet emissions of carbon dioxide to 95 grams per kilometer in 2021, from an average 118.5 grams per kilometer in 2017.
The investments in low-emission powertrains are being made at a time when European passenger car sales are set to drop by 2% this year after six consecutive years of growth, so carmakers will have to cut cost to offset the expense, Manley told reporters in Brussels.
""There will be a migration of jobs to lower-cost countries,"" Manley said, explaining that the cost of low-emission hybrid and electric powertrains are higher than those for combustion engine variants. ""This needs to be rebalanced,"" Manley said.
Carmakers and suppliers will need to make greater use of lower-cost manufacturing locations and seek broader partnerships to share the costs of the investment.
""We want to ensure a thriving industry. This will require some consolidation,"" Manley said. ""People are looking more rationally at regional requirements and regional scale. In terms of number of carmakers that survive, your guess is as good as mine.""
The European Union's Green Deal should be used to strengthen the EU's industrial base and the global competitiveness of its automobile industry.
Any efforts to shift towards a carbon-neutral economy need to be carefully thought through and reviewed. ""There will be unintended consequences. Employment is an example,"" he said, explaining that electric cars take less time to assemble than combustion-engined equivalents.
""The transition to carbon neutrality must be well managed, taking into account social and economic dimensions. Mobility must remain affordable for all European citizens, regardless of where they live or their financial means,"" Manley said.
Manley called for an EU-wide network of charging points and refuelling stations for both passenger and commercial vehicles."

AT&T (NYSE:T) stock is up more thean 27% in the past 12 months and barely above water so far this year.
The focus on costs should help the company to “return to a more shareholder friendly capital allocation strategy featuring share repurchases,”  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) added.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -  Fiat  Chrysler's (MI:FCHA) chief executive Michael Manley said on Wednesday that merger talks with  Peugeot  owner PSA (PA:PEUP) to create the world's No. 4 carmaker are progressing well and he hopes to have a deal within 12-14 months.
Speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of an industry meeting, he said he doesn't expect any major obstacles that could delay a final agreement.
""Talks are progressing really well,"" Manley said about negotiations with the French carmaker ahead of a briefing by the European automotive association (ACEA), of which he is president.
His comments come a month after the two carmakers agreed a binding deal worth about $50 billion to combine forces in response to a slowdown in global demand and mounting costs of making cleaner vehicles amid tighter emissions regulations.
Manley's timeline for completing the deal by early 2021 is in line with a forecast made by the companies in December.
Fiat and Peugeot are now getting into the details of how the merger will work, including choosing which vehicle platforms - the technological underpinnings of a vehicle - will fit which products in a combined company.
Because customers in different locations still prefer vastly different cars, there is room for multiple platforms in a combined group, Manley said. 
""That global platform is an elusive beast,"" he added. ""This concept of a massive global platform in my mind is almost a myth but that doesn’t mean to say we’re not going to recruit significant volume.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. financial regulators are wrapping up work on a proposal that would ease restrictions around relationships banks can have with companies like hedge funds and private equity funds, according to a top bank regulator.
A new proposal simplifying the rules around how banks invest in those so-called ""covered funds"" is expected to come in the first quarter of 2020, according to U.S. Comptroller Joseph Otting.
Otting told reporters that the five regulators charged with implementing the ""Volcker Rule,"" a post-crisis rule aimed at curbing risky activity by banks, have struck an agreement on the upcoming proposal, which could be unveiled in weeks.
""There is unity amongst the five regulatory agencies on this topic,"" he said on Wednesday.
The proposal is expected to wrap up years of work by the Trump administration to ease restrictions around the rule, which Wall Street has lobbied to curtail since its creation in 2010.
In August, regulators voted to ease rules policing riskier trading by banks under the rule, giving firms more leeway and simplifying requirements for permitted trading activity.
At the time, regulators said they planned to propose further Volcker simplification on the ""covered funds"" portion of the rule sometime in the future.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission share responsibility for the rule.
Those rules are aimed at limiting the exposure traditional banks have to riskier financial firms, but banks have complained that the limits are overly restrictive and can prevent them from investing in new ventures.

Otting did not detail what could come in the upcoming proposal, but the Treasury Department recommended in 2017 that the requirement be drastically simplified and give banks more leeway in their investment options.

Shares of the electric carmaker were up 8.1% at $591.78 in late morning trading, continuing their furious rally that has more than doubled the share price in the last three months.
It ""speaks to the inflection in electric vehicle demand globally,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in an email.
""The skeptics have been proven wrong, and the $100 billion market cap is sending the bears into hibernation mode.""
The milestone comes less than a month after Tesla's stock crossed $420, the price at which Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk had tweeted he would take the electric-car maker private.
Musk tweeted he had ""funding secured"" to take the company private in August 2018, when its shares were trading in the mid-$330s, only to later give up under investor pressure and regulatory concerns.
""The liquidity concern for now is off the table, and that opens up the ... base to new investors,"" said Ben Kallo, senior research analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co., which on Jan. 9 downgraded its rating on the stock to neutral.
A higher stock price also helps attract employee talent, Kallo said. ""In a technology sector where it is very hard to recruit and retain employees, especially in the Bay Area, the stock price helps.""
Tesla's market value also puts Musk a step closer to earning the first $346 million tranche of options in a record-breaking pay package.
The $100 billion market capitalization needs to stay for both a one-month and six-month average in order to trigger the vesting of the first of 12 tranches of options granted to Musk to buy Tesla stock.
The recent rally in Tesla's shares was fueled by a rare quarterly profit in October, news of production ramp-up in its China factory and better-than-expected annual car deliveries.
In a bullish report Wednesday, Wedbush analysts said that robust demand in China and Europe alongside ""aggressive"" trajectory of Gigafactory 3 production will boost fourth-quarter earnings. Wedbush has a neutral rating on the stock.
Tesla is set to report its earnings on Jan. 29 after markets close."

(Reuters) - Veteran  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) executive Rich Portogallo, who was key in building the bank's prime-brokerage business, is retiring, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters on Wednesday.
Portogallo spent more than three decades at the Wall Street investment bank, and was well liked by colleagues for what one executive described as his tireless work ethic and calm, wise approach to stressful situations.
""There is no name more synonymous with the prime brokerage business at Morgan Stanley than Rich Portogallo,"" Ted Pick, the bank's chief of trading and investment banking, said in the memo.
Pick wrote that Portogallo's ""humility and calm in the storm"" will live on through the ""enduring ... personal client relationships"" he forged and that the bank now benefits from.
Portogallo started at Morgan Stanley's prime brokerage business in 1986, and over two decades made it the industry's go-to firm for hedge funds and big trading customers, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier on Wednesday.
Morgan Stanley is usually at or near the top of prime brokerage and equities trading rankings. Prime brokers provide services to hedge funds and other large investors, including help with trading and raising money. 
Portogallo most recently served as the bank's global head of institutional equities, clients and services. 

He is expected to be out of the office by mid-March, according to the memo. The bank has not yet named a successor.

BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Proxy solicitor Morrow Sodali this week hired Paul Schulman from rival MacKenzie Partners, a prominent shakeup in the tight-knit world of vote-counting for corporate battles.
Schulman will be co-head of Mergers & Acquisitions, Activism and Contested Situations along with Michael Verrechia, a Morrow veteran, according to his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile and two sources who could not speak publicly about the personnel matter.
A spokeswoman for Morrow, which worked with Newell Brands (O:NWL) during its fight with activist investor Starboard and dining chain Luby's (N:LUB) when it was targeted by Bandera Partners, was not immediately available for comment.
Schulman spent the last decade steeped in corporate battles at MacKenzie where he was widely seen as one of founder Dan Burch's top two lieutenants. Alongside Burch, Schulman worked on corporate fights at Procter & Gamble (N:PG),  SandRidge Energy  (N:SD) and Dell among others. He resigned on Tuesday.
Separately Charles Koons, who had been a managing director for Activism & Contested Situations at Morrow Sodali resigned from Morrow last week to move to another position, two sources said. Koons declined to comment.
Last year was the biggest on record for campaigns by new activist investors as newcomers joined seasoned veterans like Nelson Peltz, Daniel Loeb, Barry Rosenstein, Jeffrey Smith, Jesse Cohn, and William Ackman in pressing for changes at corporations.
The number of firms targeted decreased in 2019 but activism is fast becoming a tool for investment managers to help make their bets more valuable over time, widening the playing field for firms like Morrow, MacKenzie and competitors Innisfree and Okapi Partners who offer shareholder intelligence, strategic advice and solicitation services to companies."

But executives largely brushed off the long-term global impact of rivals that also include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Corp's NBCUniversal and AT&T Inc.
So too did Wall Street analysts on Wednesday.
""Despite new services on the horizon from  Disney  and Apple (and probably others), we expect minimal long-term impact to Netflix subscriber addition and retention,"" Piper Sandler analyst Michael Olson said.
At least four brokerages raised their price targets on the stock, with Monness Crespi Hardt being the most bullish, hiking it by $50 to $400, in-line with the median price target.
Netflix beat global paid subscriber estimates in the fourth-quarter, boosted by returning series ""The Crown"", Oscar contender ""The Irishman"" as well as its adapted series ""The Witcher"".
In the United States, however, the company's growth missed Wall Street's targets. Shares of the company were down 2% in morning trade.
The crowded market for video streaming is currently dominated by Netflix, but investors have worried about the impact of increasing competition from the roll out of Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) Co's Disney+ and Apple Inc's Apple TV+.
This year, consumers will also have to choose among new entrants that include AT&T's HBO Max and NBCUniversal's Peacock streaming video services.
Disney+, which launched in November, reached 10 million sign-ups on its first day and features roughly 500 movies and 7,500 TV episodes from the company's family entertainment catalog as well as new programming. It also includes ""The Mandalorian,"" the first live action TV series in the ""Star Wars"" franchise.
Disney also said on Tuesday it had moved up the launch of Disney+ by a week to March 24 in the United Kingdom and in regions across Western Europe.
The company is scheduled to report its first-quarter earnings on Feb. 4.
On Tuesday, Netflix executives said new competitors hurt traditional television businesses more than Netflix and its rivals.
An analyst at Pivotal Research agreed, calling Disney+ ""positive for Netflix as it is complementary and a likely accelerant to traditional pay TV losses."""

Between 2013 and 2018, the company, founded around 70 years ago in southern California by Leo Fender, required its guitars be sold at or above a minimum price in Britain, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said on Wednesday.
This kind of practice means that when customers shop around, they find retailers tend to be selling the same products for roughly the same price, the regulator said, leading it to impose its biggest such fine yet.
Aside from its eponymous brand, Fender Musical Instruments Corporation's line-up also includes Squier, Gretsch, Jackson, Charvel and EVH.
Its guitars, including the legendary Stratocaster and Telecaster, have been the choice of musicians ranging from Eric Clapton to Jimi Hendrix and Rory Gallagher.
""It is absolutely essential that companies do not prevent people from being able to shop around to buy their products at the best possible price,"" said Andrea Coscelli, CMA Chief Executive.
""This is especially important for expensive and popular items like guitars, and so Fender’s actions could have had a big impact on customers.""
Fender said it cooperated with the CMA and has made changes to its practices.

SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a contender for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination, is asking the biggest U.S. banks for details on their assessments of and preparations for risks related to global warming.
""To protect themselves and the economy from climate-driven catastrophes, large financial institutions must act quickly to address risks,"" Warren, a frequent critic of big banks, said in letters sent on Tuesday to top executives at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JP Morgan,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS),  State Street  (NYSE:STT) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC). 
""I write to ask for more information about the risks caused by the climate crisis on the financial industry and your institution's practices, including what steps, if any, your institution is taking to adapt to mitigate these risks,"" she said in the letters, provided to Reuters. 
She asked for detailed written responses by Feb. 7.
Over the past year a surge in natural disasters caused or exacerbated by warming temperatures, including bushfires in Australia, have driven climate change up the political agenda around the world and sparked protests demanding action. 
The threat has caught the attention of financial regulators concerned with how rising seas and other consequences of the build-up of human-generated greenhouse gases could impact financial stability by, for instance, eroding the value of homes against which banks have lent hundreds of billions of dollars. 
Regulators are also focused on assessing the potential impact of political responses to climate change on bank profitability and even viability, even as the world's largest banks are increasingly targeted by activists for providing funding to fossil-fuel intensive industries, a major contributor to global warming. 
Led by the Bank of England, dozens of central banks have called for better disclosure of risks related to climate change and have begun mapping out approaches to banking sector supervision that take such risks into account.
At its first-ever conference on climate change and economics last November, the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled it too may look at how to incorporate climate change risk into its assessments of financial stability. A panel convened by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission has begun its own effort to examine climate threats to the financial system. 
But overall, U.S. financial regulators lag their peers abroad. 
The current Republican U.S. administration has played down research on the risks of global warming and rolled back regulations designed to limit greenhouse gas emissions.
STRESS TESTS
On Tuesday, at the World Economic Forum in Davos where environmental issues have taken center stage, President Donald Trump dismissed those worried by climate change as ""perennial prophets of doom."" 
Warren is among a group of leading Democrats vying for the party’s nomination to take on Trump in the November contest for U.S. president, but trails former Vice President Joe Biden and fellow U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders in most opinion polls.
All three are in favor of more government action to reduce U.S. carbon dioxide emissions to limit impacts on the U.S. economy.
Warren last year was a co-signer of a bill that would direct the Fed to ""stress test"" banks' resilience to climate-related financial risks.
In her letter, Warren asked the banks for details on how the proposed legislation would affect their operations as well as investments in oil companies, and whether they would support such a law. 
She also asked whether they formally assess climate-related risks and what changes they may have made in response.
""As climate change continues to affect our economy, it is critical to understand your bank's adaptation and mitigation strategies,"" Warren wrote. 
Many large U.S. banks, including those receiving Warren's letter, acknowledge that climate change poses a business risk and some make some disclosures about their own climate-related risks in line with recommendations from the international Financial Stability Board. 
Reuters asked each bank for comment on Warren's letter after normal business hours. 

A JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) spokesman said the bank was reviewing the letter. A Wells Fargo spokeswoman pointed to the environmental sustainability section of its website, which touts its financing of clean technology and environmental education, and a State Street spokesman, while declining comment, noted the bank's track record on the issue, which includes support for carbon pricing.

WeWork also sold a minority stake in The Wing, a community space provider designed for women, to a group of new investors including Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Ventures and American actress Mindy Kaling. Existing investor Sequioa Capital also participated.
The company did not reveal the financial terms of the transactions.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets advanced to new record highs on Wednesday as fears about the potential impact of the coronavirus outbreak eased, while tumbling energy costs promised greater spending power for consumers and wider profit margins for businesses.
By 10:25 AM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had risen 111 points or 0.4%, while the S&P 500 was up 11 points or 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 61 points or 0.7%.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) led a broad advance, breaking through the $100 billion valuation milestone for the first time as a squeeze on the many hedge funds that have shorted it over recent months and years became increasingly painful. CEO and founder Elon Musk will be eligible for up to $346 million in stock awards, although one imagines the satisfaction of thwarting the doomsters who have been his chief bugbear for the last four or five years will count for more for him.
Wedbush became the latest house to raise its price target on Wednesday, hoisting it to $550 from $370. That's the latest in a series of analyst upgrades that have followed the commissioning of Tesla's new plant in China, the world's largest market for electric vehicles.
  IBM   (NYSE:IBM) also rose 4.1% to its highest since October after finally breaking a sequence of 20 straight year-on-year declines in quarterly earnings. The acquisition of Red Hat last year has helped it accelerate its repositioning as a Cloud-based service provider.
At the other end of the performance scale, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) fell 3.6% and was on course to wipe out all its gains for the year to date after market participants chose to focus on the downbeat part of a mixed earnings update which suggested increasingly tough competition in the streaming space.
Boeing (NYSE:BA), meanwhile, fell another 0.3% but didn’t threaten the new 13-month low that it posted Tuesday after pushing back yet again the timeline for getting its 737 MAX aircraft back in the air. The company said it now expects U.S. regulators to declare the plane airworthy in the middle of the year, raising the risk that airlines will have to go another summer without enough capacity to meet demand.
Oil and gas stocks came under pressure after U.S. crude prices tumbled on a report by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) saying that the coronavirus outbreak, which has now claimed nine lives, could cut global oil demand by 260,000 barrels a day – at a time when the market is already expected to be oversupplied for at least the first half of the year.
  Exxon Mobil   (NYSE:XOM) stock fell 0.3% to its lowest since October, while shale players   Devon Energy   (NYSE:DVN) and Whiting Petroleum fell 2.0% and 4.5% respectively.
Gold futures continued to drift in a narrow range around $1,550 an ounce, while the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of developed-market currencies, rose 0.1% to 97.385."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) said on Wednesday it is recalling 361,000 older vehicles worldwide for potentially defective air bag inflators.
The defect involves a different type of Takata inflator than those that have prompted the largest-ever auto safety recalls worldwide covering more than 42 million U.S. vehicles by 19 automakers with Takata air bag inflators.
Honda Motor Co (T:7267) said on Tuesday it will recall 2.7 million older U.S. vehicles in North America for the same type of Takata inflator that Toyota is also recalling. Takata issued a new defect notice in November for inflators from four automakers, including Honda and Toyota.
Toyota's new recall covers some 1998-2000 Toyota RAV4, 1998-1999 RAV4 EV, 1998-1999 Celica and 1997-1998
Model Year Supra vehicles with a non-azide front driver airbag inflator, including 139,000 in the United States.
The notice came after BMW recalled more than 200,000 vehicles in the United States for the same type of inflator after the death of a driver in Australia from an air bag rupture involving one of the inflators, along with two other injury incidents in Australia and Cyprus.
In total, at least 25 people have been killed and 290 injured from the inflators, which can explode when deployed and spray deadly metal fragments. U.S. regulators say the cause of the inflator explosions is propellant breaking down after long-term exposure to high temperature fluctuations and humidity."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Belgium's financial services and markets authority (FSMA) said on Wednesday it had opened an investigation into suspected insider trading against the chief executive of Mithra Pharmaceuticals (BR:MITRA).

Liege-based Mithra was not immediately available to comment, while the Liege prosecutor declined to comment on the case.
Fornieri was quoted in Belgian business daily L'Echo as saying the allegation was nonsense, asking why he would do such an elaborate move to buy 40,000 shares when he already owned almost 13 million.
Mithra develops women's health products, focused on contraception and the menopause, and had a market capitalisation of 1.01 billion euros ($1.12 billion) at Tuesday's close, according to Refinitiv data.

(Reuters) - Boeing Co's (N:BA) bill for the 737 MAX grounding could balloon to more than $25 billion, analysts estimated on Wednesday, a day after the U.S. planemaker warned of further delay in returning its once best-selling jet to service.
The company has already booked $9 billion in costs related to the grounding, including $5.6 billion as compensation for airline customers and $3.6 billion in charges to cover additional production costs.
Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu said Boeing may now need to boost its compensation package for customers by another $10 billion and revise its cost estimate related to the 737 MAX's production by an additional $5.4 billion.
""Our estimates assume 737 MAX deliveries restart in Q3 2020,"" Kahyaoglu said, lowering the brokerage's price target on the stock to $390 from $420.
Boeing said on Tuesday it did not expect to win approval for the return of the 737 MAX to service until mid-year due to further potential developments in the certification process and regulatory scrutiny on its flight control system.
Added to the delay, weak Chinese demand for its widebody 787 Dreamliners as well as production problems with its new 777X jetliner have also made investors jittery, Vertical Research analyst Robert Stallard said, downgrading the stock to ""hold"" from ""buy"" and lowering his target price to $294 from $388.
""We are expecting Boeing's up-coming results to be 'an absolute disaster', and that now looks guaranteed,"" Stallard said.
""We don't see Boeing being in a position to increase cash returns to shareholders until 2022.""
The company, which is expected to report its fourth-quarter results on Jan. 29, could not be immediately reached for comment.
Of 23 brokerages covering the stock, 13 rate it ""hold"", seven ""buy"" or higher and three ""sell"" or lower. Their median price target is $356.50.
Shares of the company were down 1% at $310.02. Up to Tuesday's close, Boeing's shares fell nearly 26% since the fatal crash of an Ethiopian Airlines plane on March 10, after which the 737 MAX fleet was grounded."

""(Weatherly) are looking at an alternative investor, however, if they don't get one, over 400 workers will lose their jobs,"" Paul Situmba, assistant secretary-general of the Mine Workers Union, told Reuters.
""Weatherly hosts a total of 150 permanent employees, as well as subcontractor workers from Basil Read and B & E Mining, which make up the bulk of the employees that will face the axe.""

Sisay was not available for immediate comment on Wednesday.
But he is on record saying the miner's debt to Orion and the depressed copper market made it unlikely that mining would continue at Tschudi in the foreseeable future.
He was, however, optimistic that new investors could potentially come on board.
""We are talking to several interested parties. They just need to understand the asset better, the ore body better. We hope for a stronger market in 2020. The asset in terms of mining equipment is still fairly new and working well,"" Sisay said."

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's PT  Bumi Resources  (JK:BUMI) is looking into building a coal gasification plant potentially worth more than $1 billion, a director said on Wednesday, noting such a move would support Indonesian plans to reduce its reliance on energy imports.
President Joko Widodo's main economic agenda for his second term in office is to have more of the country's resources processed at home to increase the value of exports.
Among his targets is processing coal into gas to help reduce energy imports, one of the biggest contributors to Indonesia's current account deficit. 
Bumi Resources, the country's largest coal miner, is conducting a feasibility study into building a plant to process coal into gas, company director Dileep Srivastava said in an interview. 
The study is expected to be concluded this year, which Bumi will take up to their shareholders and lenders for consideration.
""We are actually very seriously and actively engaged,"" he told Reuters. 
Depending on the plant's capacity, Srivastava said Bumi could be looking at between $1 billion to $2 billion in investment. 
He said Bumi, which in 2019 produced around 87 million tonnes of coal, will supply coal from its units such as Kaltim Prima Coal for the potential plant as feed stock and to power the facilities.
""We believe that about 4 million to 5 million tonnes of coal can be easily consumed here,"" he said. 
DEBT SETTLEMENT
The company, however, needs to convince its creditors to allow Bumi to make such investments. 
""It is not something we can raise right now. We need an endorsement,"" Srivastava said.
Bumi is aiming to settle a $1.7 billion debt in 2022 and conclude a mandatory bonds-to-equity conversion by 2024 following its debt restructuring process in 2017. 
Srivastava believed incentives planned by the government for downstreaming coal would be attractive for investors. 
As part of a draft bill known as an ""omnibus law"" aimed at attracting investment, the government will offer incentives for coal miners investing in gasification, Indonesia's Coordinating Ministry of Economic Affairs said last week. 
The incentives could include removal of coal miners' mandatory sales to domestic power plants, removal of royalty charges, and an extension of mining permits for as long as a mine's lifespan.
Bumi will likely wait for more certainty on its mining license extension status before making any investment decision.
""Certainty on coal license status would make it easier to catalyse future investment decisions including gasification,"" Srivastava said.
State coal miner PT Bukit Asam (JK:PTBA) is planning to develop a plant with state oil and gas company PT Pertamina to process coal into dimethyl ether in Riau province. 
The plant is expected to start production in 2025 and estimated to consume 8.7 million tonnes of coal per year.
Bukit Asam is also planning to build gasification facilities in South Sumatra which may consume another 8 million tonnes of coal.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish renewables and infrastructure firm Acciona (MC:ANA) has launched a joint bid for a hotly contested 1.2 billion euro ($1.33 billion) project to widen a key Slovenian railway link to its only deepwater port, a company spokesman said on Wednesday.
Acciona has teamed up with Italian counterpart Pizzarotti and Slovenian construction company Makro 5 Gradnje to put forward the proposal.
""We are still at the early stages of the bidding process, and it's a big project, which has received 29 other bids,"" said Alberte Gonzalez Patino, Acciona's communications director.
The project aims to build a second track on the 27-km-long (17-mile) railway linking the port of Koper to the town of Divaca, improving the port's connection to the wider European railway network and increasing freight capacity and volumes.
The government-funded infrastructure project will be one of the largest undertaken in Slovenia since an economic crisis in 2013.
The existing single track line between Divaca and Koper passes through rocky uneven terrain and introduces a bottleneck on two busy European rail corridors, Slovenia's infrastructure agency said in publicly-available documents.
""We will define which parts of the tender go to Acciona, which to Pizzarotti, and which to Makro 5 over the next three months,"" said Peter Smekar, commercial director for Makro 5 Gradnje. ""We don't know what kind of works the project will involve yet - tunnels, galleries.""

(Reuters) - Oilfield services provider Baker Hughes Co (N:BKR) missed analysts' estimates for quarterly profit on Wednesday, hit by lower orders in its business that supplies turbines and compressors to liquefied natural gas (LNG) producers.
Orders in the unit fell 10% year-over-year, with equipment orders dropping 16% and service orders decreasing 4%, amid concerns that demand for LNG will decline this year.
The unit, turbomachinery & process solutions, was one of Baker Hughes' strongest in the earlier quarters of 2019, as U.S. LNG developers built a record amount of capacity to tap into a push by Asian countries for a cleaner alternative to coal-fired power plants. Last quarter, CFO Brian Worrell had forecast stronger revenues and margins in that unit versus the prior year's quarter. 
U.S. exports of LNG hit record levels in October and November of last year, averaging 5.8 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) and 6.3 Bcf/d, respectively, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. 
Baker Hughes also reported North America revenue in its oilfield services unit fell 15% from a year earlier to $1.04 billion, echoing results from rivals Schlumberger NV (N:SLB) and  Halliburton Co  (N:HAL).
The three companies kicked off this year by putting up some units on the block in a bid to reshape their businesses to cope with sharp declines in U.S. shale activity, Reuters reported last week.
The shale slowdown also forced Halliburton to take a $2.2 billion charge in the fourth quarter, following a $12-billion charge taken by Schlumberger last year. Both companies have also warned that spending by U.S. land customers would fall around 10% this year from 2019.
""As we look ahead to 2020, we see a macro environment that is slowly improving, Lorenzo Simonelli, Baker Hughes' chief executive, said in a release. 
Shares were down 1.5% to $22.40 in thin pre-market trading. 
Total revenue from the company's oilfield services business, which accounts for roughly half of total sales, rose 7.5% to $3.29 billion.
Adjusted net income attributable to the company was 27 cents per share in the three months ended Dec.31.
Analysts on average had expected a profit of 31 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Baker Hughes also booked $216 million of restructuring charges related to its separation from  General Electric  Co (N:GE), up from $116 million a year earlier.

Total revenue rose about 1% to $6.35 billion, but missed estimate of $6.47 billion.

1677,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2020 08:42AM ET</span>",Pension protest at France's biggest hydro-dam creates power shortfall,"By Bate Felix and Sudip Kar-Gupta
PARIS (Reuters) - Energy workers temporarily halted power generation at France's biggest hydro-electricity plant on Wednesday in protest at President Emmanuel Macron's overhaul of the pension system.
Macron has largely stood his ground during weeks of street marches and strikes that closed schools and crippled public transport.
With those large-scale actions petering out, hard-left unions are resorting to wildcat actions to demonstrate against a reform they say will force workers to stay in employment for longer.
Wednesday's disruption at the Grand'Maison plant in the Alps was carried out by members of the CGT, a day after workers from the same union cut power to the world's largest fresh food wholesale market, Rungis, outside Paris.
The Grand'Maison outage left France needing to import power early in the morning in order to maintain uninterrupted supplies as a cold snap gripped the country.
At 0530 GMT power demand stood at 82.6 gigawatts (GW) as sub-zero temperatures pushed up heating needs, while available capacity was 82.4 GW, data from grid operator RTE showed.
BLURRED LEGALITY
The right to strike is enshrined in France's constitution but the legality of wildcat actions can be more blurred. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe on Tuesday accused protesters who blockaded plants and cut power supplies of ""disrespecting democracy and the law"".
After Tuesday's deliberate outage at Rungis, RTE and state-run utility EDF (PA:EDF) said they would take legal action against those behind such acts.
CGT boss Philippe Martinez denied power cuts were an act of sabotage. 
""When there are strikes, things don't work,"" Martinez told BFM TV. ""EDF management is pursuing through the judiciary those behind the outages. They refuse to recognize the discontent.""
Macron's proposed pension reform would be the biggest overhaul of the system since World War Two.
He wants to streamline the existing set-up of 42 different pension schemes, each with different levels of contributions and benefits, into a single system that gives every pensioner the same rights for each euro contributed. 
The myriad special benefits currently handed out to different types of workers deter job mobility, says Macron, for whom the reform is central to his drive to create a more flexible labor market.
Unions, which say the reform will require people to work longer for a full pension, launched a wave of public sector strikes in early December that hit transport networks and lasted more than six weeks. 
Catering company Elior saw its shares fall on the Paris stock exchange after it announced the December strikes cost it about 9 million euros ($10 million).
While the rail and metro strikes have lost steam, industrial action persists in some sectors. 
Dockers on Wednesday began another three-day authorized walkout. Vessels exporting about 188,000 tonnes of wheat and 10,000 tonnes of malt barley are currently held up in the port of Rouen. 
Macron's government has made some concessions, including over the age of retirement, as it seeks to drive a wedge between hardline unions and those more amenable to reforms.

1679,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2020 08:38AM ET</span>","Airbus hits record highs, 737 MAX buyers fall on latest Boeing news","PARIS/LONDON (Reuters) - Airbus' (PA:AIR) shares hit record highs on Wednesday, after U.S. arch rival Boeing (N:BA) warned of further delay in returning its grounded 737 MAX airliner to service, while Boeing customers and suppliers fell on the news.
Boeing said on Tuesday that it did not expect to win approval for the 737 MAX to return to service until mid-year.
Airbus was up by 1.85% at 138.9 euros at 1215 GMT, the top performer on France's benchmark CAC-40 index (FCHI) after hitting a record high 139.32.
But shares in airlines waiting to fly the 737 MAX including TUI Group (L:TUIT) and Norwegian (OL:NWC), fell.
TUI shares fell 5% to their lowest level since September and led losers on London's FTSE 100 (FTSE). The delay means TUI will not have all the planes it hoped to have in time for the summer when it makes the bulk of its profits.
In December, TUI warned that if the 737 MAX was not back in service by May that could wipe off as much as 400 million euros ($444 million) from its annual earnings.
Norwegian shares were down 1.9%. It said that it was in close dialogue with both Boeing and the authorities.
""We are continually taking steps to minimise any disruption to the journeys of our passengers during our summer 2020 program,"" a spokesman for Norwegian said.
Shares also fell in Boeing suppliers, including France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) and Britain's Senior (L:SNR) which make the engines for the 737 MAX with  General Electric  (N:GE).
Boeing said that the delay was due to further potential developments in the certification process and regulatory scrutiny of its flight control system.
The 737 MAX, Boeing's best-selling aircraft, was grounded last March following two crashes which claimed 346 lives.
British Airways parent firm IAG (L:ICAG), which announced a non-binding order for 200 MAX jets last June in a rare piece of good news for Boeing since the grounding, is ""still progressing with Boeing"", Chief Financial Officer Steve Gunning told Reuters in Dublin on Wednesday.
""I think we're still confident Boeing will get this back in the sky,"" Gunning said, adding that the 2024 delivery timeframe left IAG with some room for manoeuvre.
Another top 737 MAX buyer, Ryanair , declined to comment. Its chief marketing officer said this month the Irish budget carrier thought it was possible it might take delivery of up to 10 737 MAX aircraft by April.

1680,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2020 08:28AM ET</span>","With record profits on Wall Street, small bonuses will annoy bankers: experts","By Scott Murdoch, Elizabeth Dilts Marshall and Imani Moise
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Most Wall Street banks announced their fourth quarter profits beat industry expectations last week. But by the end of this week, bank sources and compensation experts told Reuters, most of their staff will be underwhelmed by their bonuses. 
Many dealmakers, traders and even one big bank CEO are getting flat-to-down bonuses and total compensation for their performance in 2019 even though overall profits grew, the sources and experts said. 
 Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) reduced incentive compensation for staff and cut Chief Executive Officer James Gorman's total compensation by 7% for last year compared to 2018, as the bank worked to reduce expenses, which climbed in the fourth quarter.(https://reut.rs/2NylFio )
Last week and throughout this week, managers at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS), Bank of America Corp (N:BAC)  Citigroup  Inc (N:C), and JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) are getting similar news, sources said. All five banks declined to comment. 
With M&A revenue down significantly and underwriting and trading results spotty across different banks, many employees will be disappointed by the size of their bonuses. Bond trading businesses performed well compared with a bad year-ago quarter, but that may not spell big paychecks for those traders.
""Markets can go up, earnings can go up, but that doesn't mean pay has to go up,"" said Alan Johnson, who advises financial firms on pay. He expects bonuses to be flat at best for most Wall Street workers. 
Many have gotten used to this dynamic on Wall Street.
Since the financial crisis, banks have automated lots of functions that previously needed skilled professionals — from executing big blocks of equities trades to figuring out which corporations to target for investment banking services. (https://reut.rs/2NIAwEg ) (http://reut.rs/2nclxVR )
They have also shifted focus to steadier businesses, like managing wealth, handling corporate cash, processing transactions and expanding basic loan books.
Hiring is now centered around new technologies or high-margin businesses that do not require much capital. ""Front-office"" employees in market-sensitive businesses like trading, dealmaking and underwriting know their bonuses can be unreliable, and their jobs uncertain.
After years of underwhelming bonuses, some bankers have left or say they are considering leaving for private equity and other types of investment companies that pay more and are not subject to the same restrictions as banks.
""There's going to be a lot of conversations happening right now"" with recruiters, said one frustrated Morgan Stanley banker. ""The stock is up... and they've crimped everyone's pay for the year.""
Morgan Stanley let go of 1,500 employees in the fourth quarter, mostly in investment banking and trading, and the cost of those employees' severance packages was another reason the bank sought to reduce expenses. 
While some are disappointed by their bonuses, many admit they are still richly rewarded. Morgan Stanley's CEO Gorman's total pay for 2019 was $27 million, compared to $29 million in 2018.

""No one is expecting a windfall this year,"" a source at one big bank said on condition of anonymity because he does not have permission to discuss bonuses with media. ""But a bonus is just that -- a bonus.""

1681,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2020 08:27AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Eurazeo hires banks for $2.2 billion sale of payments firm Planet - sources,"By Pamela Barbaglia and Arno Schuetze
LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - European buyout fund Eurazeo (PA:EURA) has hired  Citigroup  (N:C) and Evercore to prepare the sale of its payments business Planet in a deal that could value the Irish firm at up to 2 billion euros ($2.22 billion), three sources told Reuters.
Eurazeo wants to launch an auction process in March as it seeks to capitalize on the rise of online shopping and mobile phone payments, two sources with knowledge of the matter said.
Citi and Evercore won a contest in December to handle the sale, which comes just days after U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake agreed to merge Planet's rival Global Blue with Far Point - a vehicle set up by hedge fund Third Point and led by the former president of the New York Stock Exchange.
Eurazeo declined to comment. Citi and Evercore were not available for immediate comment.
Planet, based in Galway on Ireland's west coast, serves more than 400,000 merchants and 100 partner banks and provides both tax refunds and a wide range of payments services.
Paris-based Eurazeo took control of New York-listed Planet Payment in 2017 through Fintrax Group, a portfolio company which specialized in currency-conversion services that enabled card holders traveling abroad to pay for goods in their own currency.
The combined group was rebranded Planet and has since grown its international presence, employing more than 1,500 staff in 64 markets across five continents.
Eurazeo is looking to cash out at a multiple of 15 to 20 times Planet's core earnings of more than 100 million euros, two of the sources said, with the final price tag expected to be comfortably above 1.5 billion euros.
The sale will target Asian and Western companies as well as other investment funds, one of the sources said.
Planet's closest competitor is Dutch payments specialist  Adyen  (AS:ADYEN) which was listed in Amsterdam in 2018 by a pool of investors including General Atlantic and Temasek. 
Adyen, which processes payments for companies including Airbnb and Netflix (O:NFLX), has a market value of 23.5 billion euros and trades at 56 times its expected core earnings.
Other European payments firms such as Worldline (PA:WLN) and Nexi (MI:NEXII) trade at roughly 18.5 times their expected core earnings, according to Refinitiv data.
Growth in payment systems has kept deals rolling even as potential mergers in other sectors have stalled on concerns about trade tensions and a global economic slowdown.
Once a backwater of banking, the payments sector is now lucrative and fast-growing and is attracting growing interest from private equity investors.

Blackstone (NYSE:BX) and CVC are currently exploring a possible listing of Britain's Paysafe Group.

Shares of the healthcare giant, which were trading at a record high prior to the results, fell about 1.5% to $147 in premarket trading.
J&J's pharmaceuticals unit, which makes up half of the overall sales and produces blockbuster drugs such as Imbruvica and Stelara, has powered much of the company's recent growth even as it works to improve the performance of its medical device and consumer health units.
However, intense competition for some off-patent drugs such as prostate cancer drug Zytiga, coupled with pressure on prescription drug prices in the United States, has weighed on revenue at the top-earning unit.
Revenue at the pharma unit, which also makes antidepressant Spravato and plaque psoriasis drug Tremfya, rose 3.5% to $10.55 billion in the fourth quarter, but missed the average estimate of $10.63 billion, according to two analysts polled by Refinitiv.
Sales of psoriasis drug Stelara rose 17.7% to $1.70 billion, missing Credit Suisse's estimate of $1.79 billion. Cancer drug Imbruvica's sales rose 24.5% to $875 million, although they missed the brokerage's estimate of $907 million.
Medical device sales fell to $6.63 billion from $6.67 billion, also missing the average estimate of $6.69 billion according to Refinitiv data.
The company said it expects full-year 2020 adjusted earnings per share in the range $8.95 to $9.10, with the top end of the range meeting analysts' average estimate.
Litigation expenses fell to $264 million in the fourth quarter, from $1.29 billion a year ago.
J&J's net earnings rose to $4.01 billion, or $1.50 per share, in the quarter, from $3.04 billion, or $1.12 per share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, it earned $1.88 per share, beating the average analyst estimate by a cent, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Total sales rose 1.7% to $20.75 billion, below the average estimate of $20.80 billion. That was the company's first revenue miss in at least eight quarters.

Jaguar Land Rover will eliminate 500 posts or about 10% of the workforce at its Halewood plant near Liverpool, northern England, as the luxury automaker seeks to cut costs amid mounting spending on electric cars.
The reductions come as the factory, which makes the Land Rover Discovery Sport and the upgraded Range Rover Evoque SUVs, moves from a round-the-clock three shift pattern to two, JLR said in a statement Wednesday.
“This is about efficiency, not loss of volume,” the unit of India’s Tata Motors Ltd. said, adding that the change was agreed as part of pay negotiations last year and that it will seek voluntary departures.
The U.K.’s biggest carmaker said a year ago that it planned to slash 4,500 jobs worldwide as it struggled with a sales slowdown caused by uncertainty around Brexit, flagging demand for diesel vehicles and a downturn in China. Tata has since said it’s open to finding partners for JLR to share the burden of investing in electric vehicles.
The Unite union said the latest cuts amount to a “fresh blow” for a U.K. car industry that’s been in retreat for the past few years, amid concern about Britain’s future relations with the European Union and frictionless trade required by companies’ just-in-time manufacturing systems.
Halewood has around 4,000 full-time staff and 500 contract workers and the cuts will involve both categories, according to a JLR spokeswoman. The plant will adopt a two-plus shift pattern under an agreement that allows it to extend some workdays to accommodate extra demand, she said.
JLR has moved production of the Land Rover Discovery, a different model to the Sport, to Slovakia from Solihull in Birmingham, England, to make room for future electric cars at a cost 1,200 jobs."

The warning follows a separate notification about 599 potential job cuts at its smelting operations and corporate offices, and highlights how the struggles of state power utility Eskom are dragging on the economy.
Samancor, a private company, produces more than 1 million tonnes of ferrochrome, used to make stainless steel, per year, according to its website.
It told unions it would hold talks over 2,438 potential job cuts at its Eastern Chrome and Western Chrome mines. It needed to cut costs and was facing increased power tariffs and problems with electricity supply, the letter stated.

Mozambique sued the investment bank last year, alongside a number of other defendants, in a bid to cancel the guarantee and seek compensation for losses related to the debt saga, which tipped its economy into crisis.
Credit Suisse rejected Mozambique's arguments in its defense papers and submitted a counter claim, dated Jan. 21, requesting the court declare the guarantee binding and arguing it is entitled to seek interest and damages, namely the money it says it is owed.
""The claims against CSI and CSLB are denied in their entirety,"" the papers said, referring to Credit Suisse International and its London branch. ""CSI and CSLB are not liable to pay any damages, compensation or indemnity.""
Credit Suisse and Russia's VTB (MM:VTBR) bank provided or helped arrange financing, granted in 2013 and 2014, for a project spanning tuna fishing, maritime security and shipyard development, which U.S. authorities now say was an elaborate front for a bribery and kickback scheme. Hundreds of millions of dollars went missing.
Mozambique is trying to claim hefty sums that the country has paid or still owes under the agreements, which also included an $850 million eurobond, now restructured, and a $535 million loan from VTB (MM:VTBR), as well as compensation for economic losses.
A series of court cases spanning three continents has ensnared three former Credit Suisse bankers, Mozambique's former finance minister and its former president's son. However, Mozambique's action against Credit Suisse is the only one to target the bank itself.
The country says Credit Suisse employees, and therefore the bank, knew that large bribes were being paid and that guarantees for the loans exceeded limits set out in law, or were wilfully blind to it.
Mozambique's Attorney General's Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
VTB earlier this month lodged its own lawsuit in Britain's High Court suing a Mozambique state-owned company over the $535 million loan.
All of the lending for the project was guaranteed by Mozambique's government, though some of it was not disclosed. The International Monetary Fund and other donors cut off support to Mozambique when the additional borrowing came to light in 2016, triggering a currency collapse and debt default it is yet to fully recover from."

Under the new system, due to launch on March 2 after several months of delays, domestic bank transfers worth up to 10 million forints ($33,050) will be settled within five seconds, seven days a week, as the banks respond to increased competition from fintech providers.
Andras Becsei, chairman of the Hungarian Banking Association, said the project - at a total cost of 30-40 billion forints - was the biggest investment the lenders had ever made.
""To make instant payments a success, it is important for local lenders not to be at a competitive disadvantage to foreign service providers,"" he said, reiterating the banks' call for a tax on financial transactions to be repealed.
Levente Kovacs, secretary general of the association, said banks had struck a gentlemen's agreement with the central bank that customers would not face increased charges to cover the cost of the new system.
But the association - including OTP Bank (BU:OTPB) and foreign players such as Austria's Raiffeisen (VI:RBIV), Belgium's KBC Groep (BR:KBC) and Italy's UniCredit (MI:CRDI) - said the government should reduce the annual tax by 10 billion forints ($33 million) to take account of their extra costs.
The financial transaction tax is expected to raise 226 billion forints this year. The finance ministry did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment.
The association said the sector's net profit rose by 10% to 560 billion forints in the first nine months of 2019 as lending expanded by 20%."

U.S. stocks were the standout asset class of 2019, with low global bond yields helping to drive the benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) index almost 29% higher for its best year since 2013.
That has left a lot of investors nervous about the rally ending but also reluctant to sell while it continues.
""It's still the right asset class to be in, especially with bond yields quite low,"" said Paul Sandhu, Asia-Pacific head of  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Asset Management's multi-asset quant solutions team, which manages $150 billion globally. ""But we see a lot of tail risk.""
He rated a worldwide slowdown as his top concern and is advising clients to diversify by adding new assets.
""Japanese investors have been starting to look at different ways of protecting themselves from a downturn, without actually selling their equity investments,"" Sandhu said.
One such strategy, he explained, is to buy options or straddles that protect against sharp price movements, or to use products that increase exposure to equity performance not correlated with the broader market.
An option contract, in basic terms, allows investors to sell a stock at a fixed price in the future, essentially putting a floor under potential losses or even a cap on gains. A straddle involves buying protection in both directions.
A recent rise in the implied volatility priced into stock market options to sell or buy at prices well off current levels indicated a pick up in such hedging, Sandhu said. (SURF)
""It means that fear is starting to go up in the market.""
Nevertheless, the S&P 500 has already spent January logging fresh highs, even as risks from Mideast tensions to uncertainty on global growth have clouded the outlook.

Boeing said on Tuesday it now does not expect to win approval to return the 737 MAX to service until mid-year.
The MAX jet had recently been expected to be approved by regulators to return to service in February or March.
""We are looking at short to medium-term leasing options to add more capacity for the coming few months,"" a flydubai spokeswoman said on Wednesday.

The Dubai-based carrier had received only a fraction of those before the MAX was grounded last March.
To help offset that missing capacity, flydubai leased four previous model 737-800 jets from Dec 14 to Jan 25.
It has warned the MAX grounding is putting significant financial pressure on the airline, and said it could replace MAX jets with aircraft from rival planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR).
Boeing’s best-selling airliner was grounded after being involved in two crashes which killed all 346 passengers and crew aboard.

Elliott held more than $1 billion (£710.6 million) worth of shares in Hyundai Motor (KS:005380), Kia Motors (KS:000270) and  Hyundai Mobis  (KS:012330), an Elliott unit said in April 2018. But it was not on the December 2019 year-end list of shareholders in any of the companies, the Korea Economic Daily reported, citing an unidentified investment banking source.
An Elliott spokesman could not be immediately reached. Hyundai Motor declined to comment, saying that the company is not able to disclose detailed shareholder information.
A recent recovery in Hyundai share prices may have influenced the move, the newspaper said, citing the source.
Hyundai Motor shares, which at end-March 2018 were at 143,500 won per share, dipped as low as 92,500 won in November 2018 before recovering to 122,500 won near end-December 2019.
Kia Motors and Hyundai Mobis shares rose about 34% and 7%, respectively, in that time.
A 2018 shareholder vote on a proposal to restructure Hyundai Motor Group, seen aiding the handover of the group's reins to heir apparent Euisun Chung, had been canceled after Elliott put forth its own agenda for changes at the group.
But in March 2019, the companies' shareholders rejected Elliott's demands for a massive special dividend and board seats, dealing a blow to the hedge fund’s campaign to shake up South Korea’s second-biggest family-run conglomerate.
As of November 2018, Elliott held more than 2.5 percent of common stock in Hyundai Mobis, 3 percent in Hyundai Motor and 2.1 percent in affiliate Kia Motors, the fund previously said."

The plant produces the Range Rover Evoque and Land Rover Discovery Sport vehicles but the Unite Union warned that the challenges facing the company are also being experienced at other British car factories. 
JLR posted a 6% decline in 2019 sales, hit by the weakening Chinese auto market and falling demand for diesel vehicles in Europe. But it has bounced back in China in recent months and overall company sales rose by 1.3% in December. 
""Jaguar Land Rover is taking action to optimize performance, enable sustainable growth and safeguard the long-term success of our business,"" the company said in a statement.
""Central to the Halewood manufacturing strategy, we are moving from a three-shift to a “two-plus” shift pattern from April 2020.""
Around 4,5000 people work at the Halewood factory, one of three JLR car factories in Britain, with roughly 500 jobs affected by Wednesday's announcement.

JLR, like much of the car industry, has also faced the challenge of stepping up investment in zero and low-emission vehicles as regulations tighten while simultaneously dealing with a drop in demand for some conventionally powered models.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) will recruit about 50 bankers for its investment banking team in Asia this year, as it pushes to bolster its dealmaking business and shore up revenues from the unit, three people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Bank of America's (BofA's) Asia headcount expansion comes against the backdrop of a subdued recruitment outlook for the broader investment banking business as global lenders grapple with cost pressures and slowing M&A momentum. 
A third of BofA's new hires in Asia will be senior bankers, including managing directors, for its merger and acquisitions advisory and capital markets businesses, mainly in Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia, the people told Reuters.
BofA's hiring tally for the year could change depending on the deals' momentum, said two of the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the plans are still confidential.
A BofA spokesman in Hong Kong declined to comment. 
Deals involving Asia-Pacific firms worldwide fell in 2019 amid the U.S.-China trade war and tighter regulatory scrutiny. But after a Phase 1 agreement between the world's two biggest economies, trade tensions have eased, which should bode well for dealmaking.
Bankers see Chinese state-owned companies playing a major role in dealmaking in 2020, and expect large floats including a potential listing of Ant Financial, an  Alibaba  (N:BABA) (HK:9988) affiliate, to buoy capital markets activity.
With the renewed focus on investment banking, BofA is aiming to break into the top four of Asian investment banking advisory league tables in the next few years, the people said.
""The bank's coverage footprint (in Asia Pacific) is smaller than bigger rivals,"" one of the three people said, adding BofA's hiring has to increase to reduce the gap in coverage of industrial sectors and clients in the region.
BofA is the second largest bank in the United States, with consumer banking its biggest business. 
INVESTMENT BANKING FOCUS
BofA's recruitment drive for the investment banking unit comes as it struggles with falling market share and revenue, as well as a string of departures of senior leaders in the United States and Asia in the recent past.
The Wall Street bank promoted its Asia Pacific president Matthew Koder to global head of corporate and investment banking in late 2018 and tasked him with revitalizing its corporate and investment banking business. 
Koder, an Australian who started out at Goldman Sachs (N:GS) in the mid-1990s, has made significant changes to the business in the past year and stepped up hiring in the bank's home market as well as in Europe.
In Asia, senior hires in 2019 included Patrick Steinemann, who came on board as BofA's head of industrials investment banking team, while Monica Chang joined the China coverage team from  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).
Overall, BofA expanded its investment banking headcount in Asia last year by hiring about a dozen senior bankers, making it one of the most aggressive recruiters among other global banks in the region, one of the people said.
The Charlotte, North Carolina-based firm reported a 9% rise in investment banking fees in the fourth quarter ended December to $1.5 billion, on higher income from debt and equity underwriting deals.

BofA was third in the Asia Pacific M&A advisory league table including Japan in 2019, but it was ranked ninth in the equity capital markets table and did not feature in the top 20 debt capital market rankings, according to Refinitiv data.

1698,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2020 06:06AM ET</span>","Hong Kong regulator pursues officers of company whose shares jumped 3,500%","HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's markets regulator said on Wednesday it will begin legal proceedings for market manipulation against one or more officers of a company whose shares jumped over 3,500% in 18 months.
The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) also said in a statement that trading in shares of company, China Ding Yi Feng Holdings (HK:0612), which has been suspended since March 2019, can resume.
An angry group of investors protested outside the SFC's Hong Kong offices late last year, urging the regulator to lift the suspension so they could trade their shares.
China Ding Yi Feng uses a combination of modern investment techniques and traditional Chinese culture to guide investment decisions, and each morning its staff read the Daoist philosopher, Laozi, according to its website.
The SFC twice last year ordered groups of nine brokers to freeze trading in the company's shares. Those shares, which account for 32% of the total, remain frozen, the regulator said on Wednesday.
""We only have two goals: immediately resume trading and safeguard the interests of investors. Even if they don’t resume trading, I want my money,"" said Jacky Zhang, from the neighboring mainland Chinese city of Shenzhen, told Reuters in December, saying he owned Ding Yi Feng shares worth HK$3.6 million ($460,070).
Company officials were not immediately available for comment."
