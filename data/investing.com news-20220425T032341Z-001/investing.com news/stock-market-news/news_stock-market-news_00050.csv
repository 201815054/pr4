0,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2018 11:26AM ET</span>",Trump says will probably meet with Putin at G20 summit,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he will probably meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin at a G20 summit in Argentina over the weekend, despite having expressed displeasure with Russian actions against Ukraine.
""I probably will be meeting with President Putin,"" he told reporters as he left Washington to fly to Buenos Aires. ""They would like to have it. I think it's a very good time to have the meeting,"" Trump said.
He said he would get a final report during the flight on the tension in the region after Russia seized Ukrainian vessels near Crimea on Sunday.
""I'm getting a full report on the plane as to what happened with respect to that and that will determine what I'm going to be doing,"" he said.
Relations between Washington and Moscow became the most strained since the end of the Cold War during the administration of President Barack Obama who imposed sanctions for Russia’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. 
U.S. intelligence agencies accused Russia of interfering in the 2016 U.S. election, an allegation Moscow has repeatedly denied. A U.S. special counsel is investigating whether Trump's election colluded with Moscow, something he denies. 

Trump also said on Thursday he would have been willing to meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Argentina but there was no time in his schedule. Trump has been under pressure from Congress to punish the crown prince over his suspected involvement in the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) stock tumbled about 7% at 11:12 AM ET (16:12 GMT), with traders and investors speculating about the catalyst on, of course, Twitter itself (among other places).



One possibility raised by Briefing.com is that investors are taking into account a recent story by Politico that Fox News in not tweeting as a protest against users revealing host Tucker Carlson’s home address.
But the boycott by Fox has been going on for weeks.
Others speculated that a recent suspension of an account impersonating Russian President Vladimir Putin, which had around 1 million followers, was the reason. That could lead to more accounts being purged, including parody accounts of public figures.
""We suspended @putinRF_eng for impersonation based on a valid report we received from Russian officials,"" Twitter said on Wednesday.
Twitter spokesman Ian Plunkett said in an email that the suspended account was not affiliated with Putin.
According to archived images of the account, it was created in November 2012, had about 1 million followers and mainly posted official government links to Putin's public appearances.
The S&P 500 Communication Services index was down about 0.6%, mainly due to the Twitter slide.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (TO:CM) on Thursday reported quarterly earnings which missed market expectations for the first time in four years, sending its shares lower, while larger rival  Toronto-Dominion Bank  (TO:TD) marginally beat forecasts.
Shares in  CIBC  were down 3.1 percent in mid-morning trading with TD shares up 0.1 percent.
CIBC, Canada's fifth-biggest lender, also warned earnings growth could come in toward the bottom of its target range of 5 percent and 10 percent next year, citing geopolitical tensions and slowing economic growth north and south of the border.
The bank said earnings per share rose by 7 percent to C$3.00, short of analysts' forecasts for earnings of C$3.04, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
CIBC's results suffered from an increase in funds set aside to cover bad loans, lower margins in its U.S. commercial banking and wealth management business and softer growth at its investment bank, said Eight Capital analyst Steve Theriault.
""We'd expect near-term underperformance in CIBC's shares,"" Theriault said.
CIBC reported a 10 percent rise in earnings for the full-year but Chief Executive Officer Victor Dodig told analysts on a conference call that could fall to closer to 5 percent in 2019.
""If the political headwinds continue we'll still be within our range, but probably to the lower end,"" he said.
TD, Canada's second-biggest lender which also has substantial U.S. operations, said earnings per share increased by 20 percent to C$1.63 in the quarter, ended Oct. 31. Analysts had, on average, forecast earnings of C$1.62, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Interest rate hikes in the U.S. and Canada have helped boost TD's net interest margin (NIM), the difference between the interest it gets from borrowers and what it pays to savers. 
In an interview, Chief Financial Officer Riaz Ahmed said rising rates gave the bank confidence it would deliver earnings within its previously stated target of 7 to 10 percent next year.
The bank's NIM rose by two basis points to 1.68 percent in the year to Oct. 31 and Ahmed said he expected further improvement in 2019 despite rising competition for customer deposits.
TD's U.S. retail business saw a 44 percent increase in net income to C$1.14 billion, reflecting higher margins and beneficial tax reforms.

For the full year, TD reported net income of C$12.2 billion, up 15 percent.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co’s (T:7201) former representative director Greg Kelly denies allegations of financial misconduct at the automaker, his lawyer said on Thursday.
Kelly and former Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn were arrested on Nov. 19 on suspicion of falsifying the Japanese firm's annual reports to understate Ghosn's remuneration over several years, rocking Nissan's alliance with  Renault  (PA:RENA).
""There was no additional compensation that needed to be stated"" in the annual reports, the lawyer, Yoichi Kitamura, told Reuters.
""All Ghosn received in compensation was included in Nissan's annual financial statements,"" he said.
Kitamura said Nissan's top management had discussed making some payments to Ghosn after he left the company to prevent him from being hired by rivals.
But no agreement had been made between Nissan and Ghosn on such payments and no amount had been set, he said, and Nissan itself had not decided to make the payments.
Kelly and Ghosn have not been formally charged. They are being held in the Tokyo Detention Center, and have been unable to speak publicly. They can be detained for 23 days under Japanese law before being charged.
Japanese media have reported that Ghosn also denies the allegations. He is reportedly represented by former prosecutor Motonari Otsuru, but he has not responded to requests for comment.

From March 2019, Albert Heijn's private-label brand ""Delicata"" will be made from fully traceable cocoa, bought at a higher price from ethical chocolate company Tony's Chocolonely's partner cooperatives in Ghana and Ivory Coast, the three partners said in a statement.
Barry Callebaut has been making chocolate for both Albert Heijn and Tony's Chocolonely for years and will in the future use the separate sourcing chain it set up for Tony's to make Albert Heijn's chocolate, representatives of the three companies told Reuters on a call. 
""The new Delicata chocolate will have the yellow-orange label with the open chain Tony's uses to indicate to consumers it was sourced sustainably,"" said Jeroen Hirdes, responsible for chocolate sourcing at Albert Heijn, which belongs to grocery group Ahold Delhaize (AS:AD).
As consumers increasingly care more about how their food and drink is produced, companies are trying to make their supply chains more sustainable and transparent.
Hirdes said Albert Heijn would pay Barry Callebaut a bit more for using traceable chocolate from Tony's ""open chain"". It will pass on part of the costs to consumers by increasing prices for its Delicata range that has annual sales of around 30 million euros ($34 million). He was not more specific.
Barry Callebaut, which also supplies chocolate to Nestle (S:NESN) and Mondelez (O:MDLZ), has vowed to eradicate child labor from its supply chain by 2025. It hopes more of its customers will follow the Dutch supermarket chain's example.
""The bigger the scale, the more efficient it becomes. We invite others to join,"" said Wim Debedts, sales director Benelux & Nordics at Barry Callebaut.
Henk Jan Beltman, chief chocolate officer at Tony's Chocolonely, which has turned its ""slave-free"" chocolate into a commercial success, said industry partnerships were key to accelerating sustainability in the whole sector.
""You can only have an impact if you work together,"" he said.
Tony's generated a net profit of 2.7 million euros on net revenue of 44.9 million in 2016/17.

The teen retailer earned an adjusted $0.33 a share on revenue on revenue of $861.2 million, easily beating the $0.21 and $853 million that analysts surveyed by Bloomberg were expecting. Same-store sales jumped 3% versus a year ago, outpacing the 1.7% gain that Wall Street was looking for. Abercrombie said that both its flagship business and its Hollister brand had solid quarters.

Police and the public prosecutor's office raided Deutsche Bank's offices in Germany, including the head office at Taunusanlage in Frankfurt, the bank said. 
""We confirm that the police are currently conducting an investigation at a number of our offices in Germany,"" Deutsche Bank said in a  statement. ""The investigation relates to the Panama Papers. We will be issuing further details in due course. We are cooperating fully with the authorities.”
Deutsche Bank is suspected of aiding some 900 customers in setting up offshore companies in tax havens, Frankfurt  prosecutors said, according to Germany's media Deutsche Welle. Prosecutors added that some €311 million ($354 million) is believed to have been laundered.
In August, Deutsche Bank uncovered shortcomings in its screening process to  fully identify clients and the source of their wealth, according to Reuters. And in 2017, the bank was fined nearly $700 million for  allowing money laundering.
Deutsche Bank has been under pressure after three consecutive years of losses. Its shares have been hit particularly hard this year, down nearly 48% through Wednesday, after several executive changes and massive layoffs.
In April, John Cryan was replaced by Christian Sewing as CEO. Then, in May,  Sean Bates, the bank's London-based global head of emerging market debt trading, left the bank. Its head of the Americas,  Tom Patrick, will reportedly leave the bank by year-end.

13,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2018 10:02AM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank offices raided in money laundering probe,"By Arno Schuetze and Tom Sims
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Police raided six  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) offices in and around Frankfurt on Thursday over money laundering allegations linked to the ""Panama Papers"", the public prosecutor's office in Germany's financial capital said.
Investigators are looking into the activities of two unnamed Deutsche Bank employees alleged to have helped clients set up offshore firms to launder money, the prosecutor's office said. It focuses on the years 2013 through to 2018, a spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office said.
Around 170 police officers, prosecutors and tax inspectors searched the offices where written and electronic business documents were seized.
""Of course, we will cooperate closely with the public prosecutor's office in Frankfurt, as it is in our interest as well to clarify the facts,"" Deutsche Bank said, adding it believed it had already provided all the relevant information related to the ""Panama Papers"".
The news comes as Deutsche Bank tries to repair its tattered reputation after three years of losses and a drumbeat of financial and regulatory scandals.
Christian Sewing was appointed as chief executive in April to help the bank to rebuild. He trimmed U.S. operations and reshuffled the management board but revenue has continued to slip. 
Deutsche Bank shares were down more than 2 percent by 1409 GMT and have lost almost half their value this year.
OFFSHORE LINKS
The investigation was triggered after investigators reviewed so-called ""Offshore-Leaks"" and ""Panama Papers"", the prosecutor said.
The ""Panama Papers"", which consist of millions of documents from Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca, were leaked to the media in April 2016. 
The prosecutors said they are looking at whether Deutsche Bank may have assisted clients to set up offshore companies in tax havens so that funds transferred to accounts at Deutsche Bank could skirt anti-money laundering safeguards. 
In 2016 alone, over 900 customers were served by a Deutsche Bank subsidiary registered on the British Virgin Islands, generating a volume of 311 million euros, the prosecutors said.
They also said Deutsche Bank employees are alleged to have breached their duties by neglecting to report money laundering suspicions about clients and offshore companies involved in tax evasion schemes.
Prosecutors began the investigation in August.
It is separate from another money laundering scandal surrounding Danske Bank, where Deutsche Bank is involved. 
Danske is under investigation for suspicious payments totaling 200 billion euros from 2007 onwards and a source with direct knowledge of the case has told Reuters Deutsche Bank helped to process the bulk of the payments. A Deutsche Bank executive director has said the lender played only a secondary role as a so-called correspondent bank to Danske Bank, limiting what it needed to know about the people behind the transactions.
UNDER SCRUTINY
Weaknesses in Deutsche Bank's controls that aim to prevent money laundering have caught the attention of regulators on both sides of the Atlantic. The bank has publicly said that it agreed it needed to improve its processes to properly identify clients.
In September, Germany's financial watchdog - BaFin - ordered Deutsche Bank to do more to prevent money laundering and ""terrorist financing,"" and appointed KPMG as third party to assess progress.
In August, Reuters reported that Deutsche Bank had uncovered further shortcomings in its ability to fully identify clients and the source of their wealth.
Last year, Deutsche Bank was fined nearly $700 million for allowing money laundering through artificial trades between Moscow, London and New York. An investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice is still ongoing.
""It is the sum of incidents that give cause for serious concern,"" said Lisa Paus, a member of the German Bundestag. ""Something seems to be basically wrong in the compliance and anti-money laundering area of ​​the bank.""

Deutsche Bank has been under pressure after annual losses, and it agreed to pay a $7.2 billion settlement with U.S. authorities last year over its sale of toxic mortgage securities in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis.

(Reuters) - U.S. teen apparel retailer Abercrombie & Fitch Co (N:ANF) forecast same-store sales for the holiday quarter above analysts' estimates on Thursday, driven by strong sales at its Hollister and flagship stores, sending its shares soaring 24 percent in early trading.
""We saw a solid start to the holiday season in November, with strong double-digit growth on Singles Day on Tmall, and a record performance over the peak Holiday period from Thanksgiving Day through Cyber Monday,"" Chief Executive Officer Fran Horowitz said on a call with investors. 
Tmall is Alibaba’s (N:BABA) giant online marketplace. 
Horowitz emphasized the steep investments the company has made in better managing its supply chain and product assortment to serve customers faster.
Abercrombie has changed its namesake fashion brand in recent years, doing away with risque advertising and logo-emblazoned apparel, which fell out of fashion in the late 2000s. It has relied on Hollister to generate the majority of its revenue as its denim and Gilly Hicks intimates collections prove to be a hit with younger customers.
The New Albany, Ohio-based retailer now expects to close fewer stores in the current year based on improved performance and successful lease renegotiations. It anticipates closing up to 40 stores by year-end, primarily in the United States, down from its previous expectation of closing up to 60 stores.
Ken Perkins, founder of research firm Retail Metrics, said the company was well-positioned for a strong holiday but Abercrombie's namesake brand has some work to do to resonate with shoppers.
The company promoted the head of Hollister, Kristin Scott, to a newly created position of Global Brands president. Stacia Andersen, brand president of Abercrombie & Fitch, would be leaving the company, it said.
The apparel retailer said it expected fourth-quarter same store sales to rise in the low single digits. Analysts had expected an increase of 0.6 percent. 
Sales at established stores rose 3 percent in the third quarter ended Nov. 3, well above an increase of 1.6 percent estimated by analysts, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Net income rose to $23.9 million, or 35 cents per share, from $10.1 million, or 15 cents per share, a year earlier.
Excluding one-time items, the company earned 33 cents per share, while net sales rose 0.2 percent to $861.2 mln.

Analysts, on average, expected adjusted earnings of 20 cents per share on revenue of $853 million.

LONDON (Reuters) - Carmaker Ford backed Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal on Thursday to avoid a no-deal ""catastrophe,"" but said she still needed to guarantee long-term frictionless trade, which is key to the future of its plants in Britain.
Ford Europe boss Steven Armstrong told Reuters the company was considering importing more vehicles into Britain ahead of Brexit to avoid any disruption if May's deal is not approved by lawmakers.
It is also working with suppliers to minimize delays and looking at potentially adapting its own port at Dagenham in southeast England, he added. 
Britain is due to leave the world's largest free trade bloc on March 29, but there are concerns over what happens if lawmakers reject May's withdrawal agreement with the European Union in a key vote next month, including possible snarl-ups at ports and motorways that would hit trade. 
Armstrong said May's deal with Brussels ""isn't perfect"", but allowed the firm to plan. 
""A no-deal Brexit would be a catastrophe ... It’s important that we get the agreement ratified that’s on the table at the moment,"" he said. 
Manufacturers are also seeking a guarantee of free-flowing trade to avoid delays and extra customs checks at ports when future trading rules kick in. Under the terms of May's agreement, that should be when a transition period ends in 2020. 
""I keep pushing the point that we need frictionless trade at the borders as well,"" Armstrong said. ""That's not quite crystal clear in the withdrawal agreement.""
CONTINGENCY PLANS 
Britain's car industry employs over 850,000 people and relies on the speedy movement of lorries, engines, vans, cars and components to and from the continent every day. 
Carmakers are taking steps to prepare for major disruptions after Brexit, which is one possibility if parliament rejects May's plan and Britain crashes out of the EU on World Trade Organization terms. 
Ford operates two engine plants but builds no vehicles in Britain. The country is its third-largest market, and the destination for roughly one in three cars made at its German Cologne plant as well as one in four vans from a Turkish site. 
""We would look to see what the opportunity would be to bring more vehicles in ahead (of Brexit),"" said Armstrong. ""It would help us through April, May and into June.""
The firm also operates its own port near its east London Dagenham engine facility and is considering how to handle any additional bureaucracy. 

""We're planning how we would use that,"" Armstrong said. ""What would the physical infrastructure changes need to be if we had to do different customs checks at the port there.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union finance ministers could next week approve a broad reform of EU banking rules that set the level of buffers banks must raise to absorb losses, but states remain divided over the amount of subordinated debt large lenders should issue.
The possible agreement at the Dec. 4 Ecofin meeting would come after two years of talks on a reform that would adapt EU rules on capital requirements to agreements reached at global level with United States and Japanese regulators.
But the final deal is still conditional on a compromise over the amount of subordinated debt big banks would be required to issue under the new rules.
That junior debt would be wiped out if a lender is in trouble, to avoid taxpayers footing the bill of banking rescues as it happened after the 2007-08 global financial crisis. 
However, with investors increasingly worried of the stability of banks in the bloc's high-debt countries, like Italy and Greece, the cost of issuing junior debt could grow prohibitive for some lenders.
In its latest issuance, Italy's top bank UniCredit (MI:CRDI) paid a hefty interest on a $3 billion, five-year subordinated bond sold to Pacific Investment Management Co (Pimco), two sources said on Wednesday.
Italy is among EU states who want subordinated debt to be set at a maximum of 27 percent of total risk-weighted assets held by large and systemic banks, such as Unicredit or  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).
But northern European governments, led by Germany, call for a 30 percent binding cap, two EU officials told Reuters on Thursday. 
Currently, the subordination requirement is not binding.
The European Parliament, which has also a say on the matter, supports the lower requirement at 27 percent, although it has agreed the cap would be ""discretionary"".
""This means that the resolution authority can require an even higher level of subordinated debt if it is justified,"" said Gunnar Hoekmark, the EU lawmaker in charge of the issue. 
An official for the Austrian presidency of the EU said he was ""confident"" a compromise could be reached on Tuesday by finance ministers. 
But in a sign that the issue remains highly controversial, diplomats are not expected to solve the matter before the ministerial meeting as it usually happens for technical dossiers. 
BAD LOAN SALES
If ministers failed to reach a compromise on the subordinated debt, the approval of the whole legislative package would be delayed.
Among the measures that could be stuck is a rule to facilitate large disposals of bad loans.
Under a draft compromise, seen by Reuters, banks which sell more than 20 percent of their non-performing loans (NPLs) could face lower capital requirements to offsetting the losses caused by the resulting downwards revaluation of their assets.
The easier terms, meant to favor the offloading of a 800-billion-euro ($909 billion) pile of soured loans still burdening EU banks, would be possible from Nov. 23, 2016, - which is when the EU Commission published its banking reform proposal - until three years after the new rules enter into effect, the document shows although key dates and figures remain between brackets and could be changed.
Another reform at risk is the freeze of deposits at failing banks. EU lawmakers have agreed to allow this ""moratorium"" for a maximum of ""two business days"" at banks being wound down. 
Under a preliminary compromise, insured savings below 100,000 euros and deposits of small firms could also be frozen, although ""certain payments"" could be authorized, the EU document says.
The measure is meant to prevent bank runs at failing lenders and give authorities the time to find a buyer for an ailing bank or sell its assets. 
Critics have however said the measure could further reduce consumers' trust on banks and in the worst cases trigger a liquidity crisis and even bank runs.

The Danish company is the turbine maker most exposed to the U.S. market, where it competes with  General Electric  (N:GE) and Siemens  Gamesa  (MC:SGREN).
Strong interest from utilities looking to replace retiring coal assets and big companies looking to buy renewable power will ensure U.S. demand does not fall off a cliff, as some analysts have predicted, Vestas' North American chief said.
""There's no such thing as a cliff,"" Chris Brown said at the firm's capital markets day on Thursday.
""I think that 2020 is going to be the peak of where the demand is and you're going to see it fall off a little bit as you lose the PTC (production tax credit). And then you're probably going to see it come back,"" he later told Reuters.
The PTC scheme has been critical to enabling wind projects to compete with fossil fuel plants but will start being gradually phased out from 2020.
Brown pointed to 22 gigawatt (GW) of unmet demand by 2030 from so-called RE100 companies, which is an alliance of firms including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) that aims to get 100 percent of electricity from renewable sources to combat climate change.
Another 11 GW of unmet demand comes from utilities across the United States looking to replace coal plants with new wind generation, Brown added.

(Reuters) - In October, the U.S. government issued Axim Biotechnologies Inc a patent for a cannabis-based suppository to treat irritable bowel syndrome.
Britain's GW Pharmaceuticals Plc, which recently brought to market a drug derived from marijuana for epilepsy, is now seeking patent protection for another one to treat eczema.
With marijuana now fully legal in Canada and at least partially legalized in the majority of U.S. states, companies are rushing to patent new formulations of the age-old botanical. This year, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has issued 39 patents containing the words cannabis or marijuana in their summaries, up from 29 in 2017 and 14 in 2016.
(Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Ri9sON)
How well the patents hold up in court remains to be seen. If they do, a handful of companies could be in position to demand licensing fees from the rest of the industry.
The first U.S. case is now winding its way through the courts. In a July lawsuit, Colorado-based United Cannabis Corp , accused Pure Hemp Collective Inc of infringing its patent covering a liquid formulation with a high concentration of CBD, a non-psychoactive cannabis ingredient touted for its health benefits.
One of the key issues in this case and others, experts say, is whether the patent is overly broad or obvious in light of ""prior art,” the existing level of science or technology against which an invention's novelty can be judged.
Given the long history of experimentation with marijuana, patents claiming new formulations or methods of using the drug could have trouble withstanding legal challenges, said John Stewart, a board member at Canadian cannabis company Emblem Corp.
Still, one factor that could help patent holders defend their products is the lack of documented previous research. Because marijuana has been illegal, many of its uses have not been written about in the sort of scientific articles typically presented as prior art in patent cases.
""Because of 80 years of prohibition, there is a massive lack of prior art documentation for cannabis,"" said Beth Schechter, executive director of the Open Cannabis Project, a nonprofit that opposes cannabis patents. ""Folk knowledge and information that is clear to the industry might not be seen or considered by the patent office.""
OBVIOUS OR INVENTIVE?
Marijuana-based patents could never really be put to the test as long as cannabis was broadly illegal. Even if companies had potential grounds to challenge a rival's product for patent infringement, they were often reluctant to call attention to potentially criminal activities.
But in a climate of increasing tolerance the number of marijuana formulas and extracts being brought to market has exploded, opening the door to challenges from patent-holders. The worldwide cannabis industry is expected to reach $75 billion by 2030, according to Cowen & Co, making it one of the world's fastest growing industries.
At the center of the United Cannabis case is the patent covering its formulation of CBD, which has become trendy as a health supplement and is widely available in U.S. cafes and wellness shops.
While the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency considers CBD products to be illegal, federal prosecutors are not bringing criminal cases against sellers.
United Cannabis' patent covering a highly-concentrated CBD formulation could potentially apply to most of the CBD products now on the market, said Neil Juneja, a patent lawyer in Seattle.
United Cannabis general counsel Jesus Vazquez declined a request for an interview but referred to a blog post from August in which he defended the company's patented technology as ""novel and inventive.""
Others say similar formulations have been used for decades.
""There are plenty of people who know the facts about cannabis extracts and biochemistry who are just up in arms over this patent,"" said Dale Hunt, a patent lawyer in California.
Donnie Emmi, a lawyer for Pure Hemp, said he believed the company had a good chance of invalidating United Cannabis' patent. In a court filing, Pure Hemp said highly concentrated liquid CBD formulations are ""ubiquitous"" and ""were not invented in this millennium.""
INDUSTRY NEEDS TO ‘WAKE UP’
Still in its infancy, experts say the marijuana industry is largely ill-prepared for patent litigation and battles over licensing fees that may lie ahead.
""The cannabis industry needs to wake up to this business reality,"" said Reggie Gaudino, a vice president at cannabis research firm Steep Hill Inc.
Part of the reason companies have been slow to recognize the threat, analysts and investors say, is that patents are foreign to the open-source, laissez-faire culture that has historically surrounded marijuana.
""This industry has traditionally been made up of people who really believed in this cause, this plant, and the health benefits,"" said Kris Krane, a cannabis industry consultant.

""Most of the new players getting involved now are getting into it from a business perspective and they will look at patents as more of a business consideration.""

(Reuters) - U.S. agriculture suppliers are stockpiling the Chinese chemicals that farmers need to kill crop pests and boost yields - before tariffs on them more than double on Jan. 1. 
The additional tariffs, threatened by U.S. President Donald Trump, are part of an eight-month trade war between the United States and China affecting $250 billion worth of Chinese products and $113 billion in U.S. goods.
The duties could disrupt supply lines for U.S. companies that sell chemicals and fertilizers, part of a $28-billion U.S. farm chemical industry. The sector relies on Chinese imports for 40 percent of the ingredients and materials needed to make crop chemicals, according to consultancy Informa.
Nutrien Ltd (TO:NTR) - the biggest U.S. retailer of farm supplies - is stockpiling enough chemicals to last into the busy 2019 planting season, the company said in a statement. Nutrien is carrying $300 million more in chemical inventory than it had a year earlier.
Other distributors are doing the same, said Daren Coppock, CEO of the Agricultural Retailers Association. Those who have the means to stock up will do so, he said.
Higher tariffs on farm chemicals would deal another blow to an agricultural industry that has already seen prices for staple crops plummet because of the trade war between the world’s two largest economies. China has imposed import taxes on U.S. crops including soybeans - effectively shutting off an export worth $12 billion in 2017.
The Trump Administration imposed 10 percent tariffs starting Sept. 24 on about 5,700 Chinese exports, ranging from pork to bicycle tires. The duties are scheduled to rise to 25 percent on Jan. 1, and the potential economic damage adds urgency to a meeting expected between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit in Argentina that starts Friday.
Trump has lately sounded more hopeful of resolving divisions with China, saying on Nov. 16 that higher tariffs may not be needed.
Small U.S. chemical-makers like Willowood USA and Albaugh, however, say they have already raised prices to account for a continued standoff. 
The prospect of higher pesticide costs on top of weak crop prices is ""worrisome,"" said Joe Ericson, president of the North Dakota Soybean Growers Association. The state's farmers depend on China to buy soybeans, but the oilseeds have piled up in elevators - storage facilities that buy from farmers - as the world's biggest buyer has instead turned to countries such as Brazil.
""We're hit probably more than anybody with the Chinese tariffs,"" Ericson said. ""That's a big blow to our economy when the elevators can't get rid of them."" 
Retailers have seen farmers cutting back on chemical and fertilizer purchases in the wake of tariffs, Coppock said.
Farmers' costs for such supplies are a big part of that equation: U.S. soy farmers spent $52 per acre applying chemicals and fertilizer in 2017, or 12 percent of their total costs, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
WINNERS AND LOSERS
Most chemicals formulated in China - including those containing the widely used weed-killers glyphosate, dicamba and 2,4-D - have incurred new tariffs since September, along with some chemical ingredients, said Sanjiv Rana, editor-in-chief of the crop protection news service Agrow, part of Informa.
The same products hit by tariffs in September will see even higher duties in January, said a spokesperson for the U.S. Trade Representative's office. The spokesperson said the tariffs are designed to discourage China's ""market-distorting actions"" and defend the United States from unfair trade practices.
The tariffs are having an uneven impact on chemical companies.  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGn), which makes glyphosate and dicamba pesticides in the United States, is largely unaffected, spokeswoman Christi Dixon said. 
Tariffs do apply to glyphosate formulations made by Chinese companies, however. They directly benefit Bayer if the prices of the Chinese products exported to the United States rise because the firm sells glyphosate branded as Roundup at a premium over generic brands from China, said Jonas Oxgaard, analyst at Bernstein.
A 25 percent tariff may result in U.S. glyphosate prices rising by 15 or 20 percent, he said.
The tariffs would affect Syngenta (NS:SYNN), which imports Chinese products for its crop protection formulations, said spokesman Paul Minehart. The company is seeking alternate sources, he said.
BASF SE (DE:BASFn) is concerned about the tariffs but still analyzing their potential impact, spokeswoman Odessa Hines said.
Nutrien, the retailer that sells to farmers, has already stockpiled chemicals including dicyandiamide (DCD), a fertilizer ingredient made almost exclusively in China.
""If the tariffs do come in, you're going to have higher costs for most of the major agri-chemicals,"" Chief Executive Chuck Magro said in an interview. ""This will be something that ultimately affects the farmer.""
PASSING ON COSTS
Since the Trump administration applied 10 percent tariffs in September, The Chemical Company, based in Rhode Island, has raised its DCD chemical price about 8 percent, said general sales manager AJ Petrarca.
With 25 percent tariffs coming, the company ordered more from Chinese manufacturers including Ningxia Jiafeng Chemicals Co and Beilite, swelling inventories by about 10 percent over normal levels, he said.
Those stockpiles may only last until February or March, however. 
""I don't think we'll have enough to keep everybody whole throughout the season,"" Petrarca said.
U.S. customers, not Beilite, will absorb the tariff cost, said the Chinese company's export manager, who gave his surname as Wang.
""It is not good to do business in the U.S. market now,"" he said.
U.S. chemical-maker Willowood has little choice but to pass higher costs of buying Chinese chemicals on to retailers who sell to farmers.
""There's not enough margin to eat that difference,"" said Joe Middione, Willowood's strategic business manager. ""We're seeing fairly significant increases across the portfolio.""
December is typically a brisk sales period, when farmers stock up before a new tax year. 

""It's caused a lot of confusion,"" Middione said. Farmers, he said, are ""shell-shocked.""

28,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2018 06:10AM ET</span>",British funeral industry faces investigation into 'exploitative' prices,"By Arathy S Nair
(Reuters) - Britain's funerals industry could face formal investigation after the UK competition watchdog found that high prices were taking advantage of grieving families.
An initial market study launched six months ago revealed above-inflation price rises for more than a decade, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said on Thursday, hitting the shares of funeral services company  Dignity  (L:DTY).
The CMA also said it found that larger chains in particular have consistently raised prices year on year and that efforts by some to introduce cheaper funerals do not go far enough.
The funeral services market is dominated by Dignity and Co-op Funeralcare, part of mutually-owned Co-Operative Group .
Dignity, the shares of which slumped 18 percent to 827 pence, said it was considering the recommendations in detail, adding that it has engaged with the CMA since the study was announced in June.
Co-op Funeralcare said it had worked closely with the CMA throughout the watchdog's market study, adding that there was ""still more to do"" and reiterating its commitment to providing more affordable funerals.
The CMA said in its interim report that Dignity's profit margins have been well above those of similar businesses operating in some other countries.
Britons generally spend between 3,000 pounds and 5,000 pounds ($3,831-$6,385) organizing a funeral, with the price of essential elements having increased by more than two thirds in the past 10 years, the CMA said.
The scale of these price rises -- at almost three times the rate of inflation -- does not appear to be justified by cost increases or quality improvements, the regulator added.
""People mourning the loss of a loved one are extremely vulnerable and at risk of being exploited. We need to make sure that they are protected at such an emotional time and we're very concerned about the substantial increases in funeral prices over the past decade,"" said CMA Chief Executive Andrea Coscelli.
The regulator also said it was difficult to compare options as prices are often not available online. Dignity said in a statement that it was committed to making funeral prices for all its branches available online by April next year.
CMA said it would be consulting on a proposed market investigation and welcomed views on the issues identified in its report by Jan 4.
""The best-case scenario is that the CMA just ends up asking for greater visibility on pricing. However, the tone of the statement suggests greater remedies will be required,"" said Peel Hunt analyst Charles Hall.
A CMA spokesman said it is too early to say what specific remedies the watchdog might pursue.

Tran Bac Ha, former head of the state-owned  Joint Stock Commercial Bank  for Investment and Development of Vietnam (HM:BID), or BIDV, was accused of ""violating regulations on banking operations"", the Ministry of Public Security said on its website. 
Police have arrested two other former senior executives at the bank and placed another under house arrest for alleged involvement in the case, the ministry said without elaborating.
BIDV did not immediately respond to a request from Reuters for comment. Ha was not reachable by phone.
The arrests come amid a widening crackdown on corruption in Vietnam, which has seen the Communist-ruled government launch investigations into hundreds of public officials, and several executives at state-owned enterprises jailed. 
BIDV, 95.28 percent owned by the central bank is Vietnam's second-largest listed bank by market value after Vietcombank (HM:VCB).
Last month, BIDV said it wanted to issue new shares to KEB Hana Bank, a unit of  Hana Financial  (KS:086790), which would give the South Korean bank a 15 percent stake.
In June, the Communist Party of Vietnam said Ha and two other executives at the bank had committed violations in lending 4.7 trillion dong ($201 million) to 12 companies involved in a corruption case at Vietnam Construction Bank.

Vietnam has opened 427 corruption cases this year to investigate 889 officials, its chief government inspector said this month.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares joined an overnight rally on Wall Street after dovish comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell boosted investor sentiment towards stock markets despite uncertainty over a possible escalation in the U.S./China trade dispute.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) benchmark was up 0.6 percent by 0940 with all major bourses and most sectors trading comfortably in positive territory.
Traders believe the risk of fast-rising interest rates hurting the U.S. economy and the stock market is now on the downside after Powell said monetary policy rate is now ""just below"" estimates of a level that neither brakes nor boosts a healthy economy. 
""If you were looking for a trigger for a December rally in equities, we got it last night from the Federal Reserve"", wrote Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com.
The new-found optimism comes after sell-offs in February and October prompted markets analysts to question the sustainability of the longest bull market in recent history. 
A Reuters survey published on Thursday shows however that a majority of analysts believe that the upward trend isn't over just yet with over 40 percent of strategists saying the current run has more than a year to go. 
Tech and cyclical stocks, which have been some of the hardest hit in the recent sell-off, were leading indexes higher across the continent on Thursday morning.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) made a sudden 4 percent fall after it emerged in morning trading that roughly 170 criminal police officers, prosecutors and tax inspectors searched six of its offices in and around Frankfurt on money laundering allegations.
Elsewhere in the banking sector, British banks made moderate moves, from HSBC (L:HSBA) down 0.3 percent to Lloyds (L:LLOY) rising 1 percent, after all seven lenders passed this year's Bank of England stress tests. 
Shares in Swedish radiation therapy gear maker Elekta (ST:EKTAb) posted one of the worst performances, down 7.7 percent after reporting an unexpected drop in operating profit for a second straight quarter. 
Real estate (SX86P) was one of the rare sectors in the red. Britain's Intu (L:INTUP) sank 36 percent after deputy chairman John Whittaker abandoned a plan to buy the British shopping center group. This reignited worries about the outlook for the battered sector and Intu's rival  Hammerson  (L:HMSO) fell 6.5 percent.

STOCKHOLM/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Volvo Cars, owned by China's Geely, has no current plans to go for a stockmarket listing, its chief executive said, more than two months after the Swedish carmaker postponed its flotation blaming trade tensions and an automotive stocks downturn.
Volvo and its parent had been working on an initial public offering, potentially valuing the carmaker at $16 billion to $30 billion.
In September, the company dropped the IPO plans but said that a listing was still possible in the future.
""There are no plans or time schedule for entering into the equity market,"" Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson told Reuters on the sidelines of the Los Angeles Auto Show on Wednesday.
When asked if the company might instead consider raising funds via convertible bonds, he said: ""It's not the right timing and also it's a turbulent market."" 
An IPO would have helped bolster Volvo's coffers at a time when carmakers need cash to back their plans to develop electric and driverless cars. 
Samuelsson reiterated on Wednesday that Volvo, which is developing Polestar as an electrified performance brand and owns a stake in Geely stablemate Lynk & Co, would finance its development using existing cash flows.
He had said in September when the IPO was dropped that the company had ""other alternatives"" to raise finance.
Conditions in the automotive industry remain tough with the trade conflict between China and U.S. creating headwinds, China car sales falling and new emissions test standards hitting the European market. China is Volvo's largest market.
Profits at Volvo have been squeezed by rising costs due to product launches plus the impact of higher tariffs from a trade spat between Washington and Beijing has escalated.
The U.S./China trade war could also hurt the pace of expansion at Volvo's new U.S. factory in South Carolina, where it has plans to invest $1.1 billion and hire about 4,000 people, a spokesman said on Wednesday, confirming comments in U.S. media.
""The plans for Charleston... remains, however trade issues may impact the pace of the expansion, although we cannot quantify the effects,"" he said.
The company said last week that it had decided to split production of its S60 luxury sport sedan between U.S. and China, changing an original plan to manufacture the vehicle only at its U.S. factory and export it to China.

The spokesman said the S60 would be manufactured in Chengdu from next year to cover domestic sales and exports to some Asia-Pacific markets. The Chengdu plant already manufactures Volvo's top-selling SUV, the XC60, and an old generation of S60L cars.

European bonds also gained.
U.S. money-market pricing showed traders had scaled back expectations for Federal Reserve hikes to just one in 2019, from as many as two estimated earlier this month, after Chairman Jerome Powell said borrowing costs are “just below” a range of estimates of the so-called neutral level.
Across the Atlantic, investors were already ruling out any rate increases next year by the European Central Bank amid stalling euro-area growth and elevated political risks, most notably from Italy.
“Rates markets seem to be coming back down to earth,” said Richard Kelly, head of global strategy in London at Toronto-Dominion Bank. “This is almost the reverse of September when it was overreacting hawkishly and we kept pushing rates higher.”
U.S. 10-year yields dropped as much as 6.4 basis points to 2.9952 percent, the lowest level since Sept. 18. Rates on similar-maturity German bonds declined three basis points to 0.32 percent, and those on U.K. gilts fell six basis points to 1.32 percent.
The spread between Eurodollar futures expiring next month and those due a year later, a proxy for Fed rate hikes priced for 2019, slipped three basis points to 22 basis points, signaling a cut-back in tightening expectations.
The outlook for bunds, among this year’s best-performing assets globally, still remains positive for many in the market, with the ECB likely to face significant hurdles in its quest to normalize policy. Germany’s economy contracted for the first time since 2015 in the three months through September.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Middle East funds have become more defensive after November's oil price plunge and now expect on balance to trim their equities exposure slightly while increasing their holdings of fixed income, a monthly Reuters poll showed on Thursday.
Hit by oversupply worries, Brent oil (LCOc1) tumbled to below $60 a barrel at the end of this month from around $75 at the end of October and peaks around $85 in early October.
The poll of 13 leading regional fund managers, conducted over the past week, found 15 percent now expect to raise equity allocations in the next three months and 23 percent to reduce them.
That is not an extremely bearish balance by historical standards, but it is a significant shift from the October poll, when 23 percent expected to raise regional equity allocations and 8 percent to cut them.
Several fund managers said they were not changing their fundamental view of the markets in response to oil's slide. Some saw the rise to $85 as overshooting on the upside, and now see the sharp drop as overshooting on the downside, which could be corrected by fresh production restraint among global producers.
""Despite an extraordinary 30 percent fall in Brent crude over the last month, regional equities and fixed income markets have remained pretty relaxed,"" said Akber Khan, head of asset management at Al Rayan Investment in Doha.
""Investors are pricing the drop to $60 as a correction rather than a new normal.""
Recent reforms to strengthen state finances mean most Gulf governments will probably still be able to deliver anticipated spending increases next year, fund managers said. For example, Saudi Arabia's government has said it expects to increase spending by over 7 percent in 2019.
However, managers acknowledged the risk that if oil did stay low in coming months, governments could become more conservative about spending and sentiment among the region's businessmen might be hit, further depressing weak real estate prices and other assets in the region.
Khan said low oil prices would not co-exist with relatively resilient asset prices in the region indefinitely.
""This dislocation is unlikely to last too long; either oil will have to begin its recovery, or asset prices will need to re-adjust,"" he said.
The latest poll also showed managers becoming moderately more positive about regional bonds after the oil price slide. Twenty-three percent now expect to increase fixed-income allocations and 8 percent to reduce them, compared with ratios of 8 percent and 15 percent in the previous poll.
Outside the Gulf, the latest poll showed improvement in sentiment towards Turkish equities, which have been shunned for many months because of economic and political instability and a weak local currency.
Fifteen percent of managers now expect to raise their Turkish equity allocations in the next three months and none to reduce them -- not a very bullish balance compared with other markets, but Turkey's most positive balance since December 2014.
The Turkish lira <TRY=> has been recovering steadily against major currencies over the past several months.

The technology sector in particular has been an important target as China is intent on developing its own semiconductor production to lessen its dependence on foreign technology.
EU negotiators last week approved the first bloc-wide rules to prevent foreign investments from threatening national security, largely driven by unease over acquisitions by Chinese companies.
Under the new rules, authorities are likely to intensify their scrutiny of so-called dual-use technology that can be tapped by both the civilian and military sectors, according to Mikko Huotari, deputy director at the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin. France and Germany in particular are likely to train their eyes more closely on acquisitions from China, he said.
Chinese acquirers have been behind $4.4 billion-worth of European deals so far this year, up almost two times the volume for 2017, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Under the new law, EU governments will be allowed to request information and offer comments on a foreign direct investment in a particular member country. The nation in which the investment was planned would have to take any remarks and opinions into account when deciding on the deal.
EU officials hope the mechanism will provide a broader overview of Chinese investment in Europe amid concerns that companies with indirect ties to the state are snapping up strategically important businesses.
Economy Minister Margarete Schramboeck of Austria, which holds the EU’s rotating presidency and negotiated the Nov. 20 accord on behalf of the bloc’s national governments, called the 2016 acquisition of German robotics company Kuka by Chinese appliance maker Midea Group a “wake-up call” for the bloc’s politicians.The attempted purchase of Aixtron SE, a German supplier of semiconductor equipment, by a consortium of Chinese investors also fanned concerns in both Europe and the U.S. The deal derailed in late 2016 after the Obama administration blocked it on national security grounds.
Schramboeck stressed that the EU mechanism isn’t aimed only at Chinese investments. Still, China appears to feel targeted by the measures.
In reaction to last week’s agreement, the Mission of China to the EU said investments in Europe by the nation’s companies aren’t part of a political strategy and that it hopes the EU can “steer clear of trade protectionism.”
The new rules still need official approval from the EU governments and the European Parliament. The legislation is on track to take effect at around the end of 2020.
While deals like Kuka and Aixtron sparked heated debate, many other Chinese acquisitions in Europe’s tech sector have flown through with little alarm. That could change under the future system, which is designed to raise awareness among officials about who is investing where.
“Step by step, we are creating a bloc-wide method for raising questions,” said Franck Proust, a French member of the European Parliament who helped negotiate the agreement. “We are determined under the new system to gain information about the ultimate investor and to understand the context of the investment.”
Sweden’s Silex Microsystems, which manufactures sensors that are used in handsets, cars, medical and other devices, was indirectly acquired in 2015 via a holding company by NAV Technology Co, Ltd. The Chinese parent is an investment company that invests in navigation systems, which can be used both for civilian and military purposes.
In one of the largest ever Chinese acquisitions in the Netherlands, JAC Capital, a subsidiary of a state-owned investment company, and Wise Road Capital in 2016 jointly bought a spin-off of  NXP Semiconductors  NV (NASDAQ:NXPI) called Nexperia. The company, which manufactures semiconductors for the automobile industry, has since become the target of Chinese smartphone manufacturer Wingtech Technology Co., which in late October said it’s acquiring the firm for 25.2 billion yuan ($3.6 billion.)
For many European companies, Chinese ownership has meant access to much-needed capital that is sometimes hard to come by in Europe. But greater regulatory scrutiny on such deals in the future could restrict those options.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has scrapped plans for a high-speed passenger tunnel under the West side of Los Angeles but is moving ahead with a similar proposal across town designed to whisk baseball fans to and from Dodger Stadium.
Musk's aptly named underground transit venture the Boring Company gave up on its development of a 2.7-mile (4.4-km) tunnel in West L.A. to settle litigation brought by community groups opposed to the project, the two sides said in a joint statement on Wednesday.
The move came six months after Musk, the high-tech baron better known as founder of electric car company Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, made a rare personal appearance at a Los Angeles public event to promote his controversial tunnel project.
At the time, Musk boasted of his intention to offer free rides through the tunnel under Sepulveda Boulevard to elicit public feedback before proceeding with a much larger network he has envisioned for the L.A. metropolitan area. 
But opponents accused Musk of trying to evade a lengthy environmental review required for such projects by seeking an exemption based on what his company insisted was a small-scale demonstration of a wider concept. 
Precise terms of the court settlement were confidential, according to a company official along with a lawyer for plaintiffs of the lawsuit, John Given.
""The parties ... have amicably settled the matter,"" the statement said. ""The Boring Company is no longer seeking the development of the Sepulveda test tunnel and instead seeks to construct an operational tunnel at Dodger Stadium.""
Plans for Boring's so-called ""Dugout Loop,"" an underground high-speed transit corridor between Dodger Stadium and one of three existing subway stations along the city's Metro Red Line, were first unveiled months ago on the company's website.
An initial public scoping hearing for the project, the first major step in a full-scale regulatory review of the Dugout Loop, was held by the city's Public Works Department in late August.
Meanwhile, the company has said a separate, shorter tunnel it has dug beneath the tiny neighboring municipality of Hawthorne, where Boring and SpaceX are both headquartered, would be completed by Dec. 10. 
""Based on what we've learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we're moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA,"" Musk tweeted on Wednesday, adding, ""Won't need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.""
Boring said the Hawthorne tunnel and its Dugout Loop would serve as proof-of-concept sites for a traffic-easing system of subterranean tubes that will move pedestrian vehicles called ""skates"" from place to place at up to 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).
The Dodger Stadium tunnel will initially be limited to some 1,400 passengers per event, about 2.5 percent of the ballpark's capacity, but ridership could eventually be doubled, Boring's website said. It said fares would run just $1 a ride.
In June, Boring was selected by the city of Chicago to build a 17-mile underground transit system connecting that city's downtown to O'Hare International Airport. The company also has proposed an East Coast Loop that would run from downtown Washington, D.C., out to the Maryland suburbs. 
Musk, known for aggressively taking on large-scale technical challenges with which he has had little previous experience, launched his foray into public transit after complaining about L.A. traffic on Twitter in late 2016, vowing then to ""build a boring machine and just start digging.""

46,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2018 02:15AM ET</span>",France's Safran aims to topple U.S. rival as no.1 aerospace supplier,"PARIS (Reuters) -  Safran  (PA:SAF) unveiled ambitions to become the world's leading aerospace supplier in 15 years, overtaking United Technologies (N:UTX), as it pledged a research and development (R&D) spending drive while increasing cash returns to shareholders.
The French aerospace engine and equipment supplier added that it did not plan major new acquisitions after buying Zodiac Aerospace to become, according to its calculations, the world's second-largest aerospace supplier behind United Technologies.
""The priority will focus on organic development,"" it said in a statement ahead of a capital markets presentation.
The event comes days after conglomerate United Technologies completed its acquisition of Rockwell Collins (NYSE:COL) and announced plans to split itself into three by 2020. 
Safran, which co-produces engines for narrowbody jets with  General Electric  (N:GE), said it was gearing up for a new cycle of research and development (R&D) partly driven by a new mid-market jet being studied by Boeing (N:BA), depending on whether it goes ahead.
It also pledged ""targeted"" R&D efforts at Zodiac and a 30 percent increase in broader research and technology spending as it laid out plans for better propulsion aircraft with more electrics and connected cabins, and wider use of 3D printing.
It predicted like-for-like revenue percentage growth in mid-single digits over 2019-2022 and a recurring operating margin ""trending to a 16-18 percent range"" by 2022 after the engine model switch and the recovery of Zodiac's interiors business.
Safran made a 14.6 percent margin in the first half.
The company plans to invest in more maintenance and repair activities as it relies more heavily on power-by-the-hour contracts for its new 'LEAP' engine, underpinning a forecast of high single-digit growth in civil aftermarket sales in 2018-22.
Safran said it was accelerating the operational recovery of Zodiac Aerospace from the repeated production problems that forced it into Safran's arms earlier this year. 
It confirmed a goal of 200 million euros ($228 million) of annual pre-tax cost savings from the merger by 2022 and said ""further upside has been identified"".

TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian stocks rose on Thursday, tracking gains on Wall Street, after the chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve suggested it may nearing an end to its three-year rate tightening cycle, boosting interest in riskier assets.
Spreadbetters expected European stocks to open higher, with Britain's FTSE rising 0.5 percent, Germany's DAX adding 0.6 percent and France's CAC gaining 0.65 percent.
The dollar and U.S. Treasury yields fell after Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that U.S. policy rates were ""just below"" neutral, less than two months after saying rates were probably ""a long way"" from that point.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.6 percent. 
Australian stocks gained 0.6 percent and Japan's Nikkei climbed 0.4 percent. But the Shanghai Composite Index bucked the trend and slipped 1 percent.
Gains in Asia were tempered by investor jitters ahead of high-stakes trade talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Saturday on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Argentina.
Economists at ANZ pointed out that policy hawks in the Trump administration who want Washington to take a tough stance against Beijing appear to be in the ascendancy.
""They will want some concessions from China, not least of all on what they perceive is theft of intellectual property and forced technology transfer,"" wrote the ANZ economists.
""Thus, it would seem the prospect of the Trump-Xi meeting ending without a sustainable resolution to their differences is relatively high.""
Analysts believe any signs of a thaw in U.S.-China tensions could trigger a knee-jerk rally, but say the move would likely be short lived unless there are substantive concessions -- most notably if Xi can persuade Trump to postpone a sharp tariff hike on Chinese goods due to take effect Jan. 1. 
The Dow rallied 2.5 percent and Nasdaq surged nearly 3 percent on Wednesday as Powell's comments eased fears of a faster pace of rate hikes in 2019. (N)
""Equities gained as Powell hinted of implementing fewer rate hikes when the economy is still doing well,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.
""The likelihood of slower U.S. monetary tightening caused the dollar to slump against currencies, particularly the euro, which could soon benefit from an ECB rate hike.""
The euro was 0.15 percent higher at $1.1384 after advancing 0.7 percent the previous day.
The dollar dipped 0.35 percent to 113.26 yen after being knocked down from a two-week high above 114.00 scaled overnight.
The Australian dollar, sensitive to shifts in broader risk sentiment, jumped more than 1 percent on Wednesday and last stood at $0.7319 for a gain of 0.15 percent.
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies inched down to 96.731 following an overnight loss of 0.6 percent.
The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 3.013 percent, its lowest since Sept. 18, following Powell's comments. The two-year Treasury yield was down for the third straight session.
Oil prices clawed back some ground from losses in the previous session, but an increase in U.S. crude inventories and uncertainty in the run to an OPEC meeting next week kept markets under pressure. [O/R]
U.S. crude futures were up 0.3 percent at $50.41 per barrel after sliding 2.5 percent the previous day.

Brent crude inched down 0.1 percent to $59.69 per barrel. It has slumped 21 percent this month, during which it fell to a 13-month trough of $58.41.

Hong Kong gave up early gains and traded with losses through much of the morning. The Hang Seng Index was down 0.29% to 26,06 by 1:40 AM EST (06:40 AM GMT). The Shanghai Composite Index was down 0.12% to 2,598.61 and the SZSE Component gave up 0.46% to 7,721.61.
Investors into China and Hong Kong stocks could not hold on to the generally upbeat mood. Investors in mainland China stocks have taken advantage of a recent rally in the Hong Kong market to cash out.
Bloomberg reported that investors from mainland China have sold the equivalent of $637 million worth of Hong Kong shares over the last six days through programs that link exchanges in mainland China and Hong Kong.
Still, the Hang Seng is poised for its biggest monthly recovery in six years with a 6.7% gain through the month of November.

52,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 29, 2018 12:03AM ET</span>",Australian banks lick their wounds as misconduct inquiry concludes,"By Byron Kaye
SYDNEY (Reuters) - An inquiry that has exposed rampant greed and wrongdoing in Australia's major banks and wealth managers wraps up this week ahead of a final report which could trigger sweeping reform of the financial sector of the world's 12-largest economy.
Dismissed initially as a ""populist whinge"" by the ruling conservative party, the quasi-judicial inquiry known as a Royal Commission has revealed branch-to-boardroom misconduct which will almost certainly trigger tougher regulation.
In 69 days of hearings, the inquiry heard shocking tales of brazen rip-offs, callous mistreatment of customers and even taking money from the dead. Its final hearings are scheduled for Friday.
In one hearing, commission lawyers played a recording of a life insurance salesman cold-calling a man with Down Syndrome and convincing him to sign up for a policy he did not need or understand. When the man's father tried to cancel the policy, the company refused until the father coached his son to ask for the cancellation himself.
In another, a blind, partly deaf pensioner described being led into a bank branch office and handed ""pre-filled"" documents to guarantee her daughter's pool business. When the business failed, the bank went after the pensioner's house.
The country's biggest-listed wealth manager, AMP Ltd (AX:AMP), admitted to doctoring a supposedly independent report to a regulator about how it had charged thousands of clients fees without providing a service. Inquiry lawyers suggested such fraud amounted to a criminal act, and criminal charges could be among Commissioner Kenneth Hayne's final recommendations.
""What happened to us I had always felt was immoral, but I had no idea that what they did was actually not legal,"" Ross Dillon, who testified to the inquiry that the proceeds of his house sale had been misappropriated by his bank, told Reuters.
Investors have wiped about A$40 billion ($29 billion) from the market value of Australia's four largest banks and AMP in the nine months since the inquiry began, and some analysts expect further falls in response to the inquiry's formal recommendations due by Feb. 1.
Reputational and financial costs are piling up, crimping margins at some of the world's most profitable banks.
The four major lenders - Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA), Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC), Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (AX:ANZ) and National Australia Bank Ltd (AX:NAB) - and AMP have promised to pay back a combined A$1.3 billion to wronged customers. 
Commonwealth Bank's CEO stood down during the inquiry, as did AMP's CEO, chairwoman and three directors. Commonwealth Bank has since fired 41 staff for misconduct and cut A$100 million in bonuses. Industry-wide, hundreds of staff have lost their jobs.
""There is going to be more cost go into the banks, and it's going to be profitless cost because it's going to go into compliance,"" said John Guadagnuolo, head of investment at Antares Capital.
""There's a culture problem, there's a recruitment problem, there's a remuneration problem, and I'm not sure that the banks themselves know how to address it.""
MORE PAIN AHEAD
The public outrage will make it impossible for the government to ignore the commission's final recommendations, given that most polls show it losing an election expected in May.
Banks have pre-empted some recommendations by cracking down on loose consumer lending practices, chopping executive bonuses and exiting non-core businesses. Any statutory limits on bonuses would put Australia at the international vanguard of efforts to limit extravagant executive pay.
Australia's banks have also started to unwind their once-fashionable ""vertical integration"" models, which were found by the inquiry to create conflicts of interest for financial advisers.
Pension funds have started cancelling rolling fees known as trailing commissions - deducted from customers' accounts over many years regardless of any service being provided - in anticipation they will be outlawed.
Though Britain has banned financial planners from taking trailing commissions sold since 2013, an outright ban in Australia would be stronger still.
Australia's regulators too are under pressure to get tough, having been exposed as timid and far too reluctant to take strong action against law-breakers. 
The Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the corporate watchdog, has already filed lawsuits against each of the ""Big Four"" banks and AMP this year, in a sign of its new-found muscle.

The Hang Seng Index slipped 0.1 percent Thursday, lagging most of Asia and reversing an early rally of as much as 0.9 percent that had been spurred by dovish comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The gauge is still up 6.7 percent in November, the top major equity benchmark worldwide. Tencent Holdings Ltd. has contributed a quarter of the gains.
Mainland investors have been selling Hong Kong’s latest rebound, dumping a net $637 million of the city’s shares via exchange links in six days, the longest selling streak since August. While the Hang Seng Index is on track for its biggest month-on-month comeback in seven years -- a recovery that’s taken a gauge of buying momentum to a five-month high -- obstacles remain before bulls can take back control. Traders are also waiting for this weekend’s meeting between presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump.
“Hong Kong stocks have largely priced in expectations of fewer U.S. rate hikes,” said Daniel So, a strategist with CMB International Securities Ltd in Hong Kong. “The key event to watch remains the G20 meeting, so investors choose to lock in profits amid uncertainties.”
As one of Asia’s largest and most open equity markets, Hong Kong typically acts as a barometer of global liquidity expectations and macroeconomic concerns. Throw in a currency peg to the greenback and a property bubble, and the city’s stocks become even more sensitive to the pace of Fed hikes. China’s economy is a concern given rising bond defaults and real estate jitters.
Some strategists remain cautious. JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). have underweight ratings on the MSCI Hong Kong Index, which doesn’t include Chinese companies such as Tencent that dominate the Hang Seng Index.
This month’s rally comes after the gauge was bludgeoned by concern that tightening U.S. monetary policy and a slowing Chinese economy will hurt earnings. The Hang Seng gauge is still down 11 percent this year, though it’s done a lot better than the Shanghai benchmark, which languishes at the bottom with a 21 percent loss. The Shanghai gauge rose 0.3 percent Thursday.

(Reuters) - Short positions on most Asian currencies eased over the past two weeks, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday, on hopes for a thaw in U.S.-China trade friction at the upcoming G20 summit, and as a plunge in crude prices boosted major importers.
Bearish bets on the Indonesian rupiah  fell the most among regional peers as they declined to their lowest since May, according to a survey of 12 fund managers, currency traders and analysts.
""Our view change (on the rupiah) is premised on the view that the central bank is now prioritizing stability over growth,"" a Jakarta-based analyst said. 
Meanwhile, short positions on the Indian rupee  slackened to their lowest since April. 
The rupee, which is the worst performing Asian currency this year, has gained 5.2 percent so far this month, bolstered by falling oil prices and easing tensions between the Indian government and central bank.
Bearish bets on the Philippine peso  dropped to their lowest since May. 
The Thai baht , however, bucked the trend with short positions increasing marginally. 
Most Asian currencies have ticked up in the last two weeks on rising optimism that the United States and China would call a truce at the upcoming G20 summit in Argentina, while a collapse in oil prices boosted countries with large oil bills.
The poll was conducted before Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said late Wednesday that U.S. interest rates were just below neutral, which hinted that a rate hike cycle was nearing its end.
The Reuters survey is focused on what analysts believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar , Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht.
The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3.

A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars. The figures included positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).

56,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2018 08:20PM ET</span>",Altria in talks to take minority stake in Juul: sources,"By Harry Brumpton and Chris Kirkham
(Reuters) - Tobacco company  Altria Group  Inc (N:MO) is in talks to take a minority stake of 20 to 40 percent in e-cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
The companies declined to comment.
Big tobacco companies, including Marlboro-maker Altria, have been investing in e-cigarettes as U.S. smoking rates decline, but those products have lost significant market share over the last year as Juul's popularity has surged.
The talks have been ongoing over the last few months, and the size of the stake could change, the sources said. The talks could still fall apart because of the many shareholders and regulators involved, one source said.
Such a deal could allow Juul to continue to grow with reduced risk, the people said, without losing control of the company.
Privately held Juul's vaping devices, which resemble a USB flash drive, have helped the company quickly become the market leader in the U.S. e-cigarette business, growing from 13.6 percent of the market in early 2017 to more than 75 percent this month, according to a  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analysis of Nielsen retail data.
Juul's sleek design and sweet flavors, including mango and creme, made it particularly popular among high schoolers. ""Juuling"" has become synonymous with vaping, with young people posting videos and photos of themselves using the product at school or with friends, often under the hashtags #doit4juul or #juullife.
Juul's e-liquid also has a much higher nicotine content than earlier versions of U.S. e-cigarettes. The company says its products are meant only for adults looking to convert from traditional cigarettes.
Earlier this month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced new curbs on sales of flavored tobacco products, including Juul's mango and cool cucumber, to age-restricted stores and online merchants that use age-verification checks.
But Juul, launched in 2015, was valued at more than $16 billion based on a July 2018 funding round, according to venture capital database PitchBook Data Inc.
Early Juul investors included Tao Capital Partners, headed in part by Nicholas Pritzker, who formerly ran the Hyatt hotel empire. Other investors include Fidelity Investments Inc and Tiger Global Management, according to PitchBook. 
Altria has invested in the e-cigarette sector in recent years through its Nu Mark subsidiary, which sells devices such as the MarkTen e-cigarettes in convenience stores and tobacco shops across the country. In 2014 Altria acquired e-cigarette startup GreenSmoke Inc for $110 million.
Altria's products, however, have lost significant ground to Juul over the last year, as have e-cigarette brands from other major tobacco companies.
The market share of  British American Tobacco  Plc (L:BATS), which sells Vuse e-cigarettes, fell from 21.4 percent of U.S. e-cigarette sales in February to 9.6 percent this month, while Altria's share fell from 11.1 percent to 4.4 percent over the same period, according to the Nielsen data.
Any potential investment in Juul carries its own set of risks.
San Francisco-based Juul has faced heightened pressure from U.S. regulators as the growing popularity of flavored e-cigarettes among teenagers has sparked fears of a new generation of nicotine addicts.
Federal data released earlier this month showed a 78 percent increase in high school students who reported using e-cigarettes in the last 30 days, compared with the prior year, coinciding with the rise in Juul's popularity. 
Altria's shares have fallen by more than 20 percent over the year as cigarette smoking continues to decline in the United States. Federal data from earlier this month showed cigarette smoking among U.S. adults reached an estimated 14 percent in 2017, the lowest level ever.
Altria's shares rose 1 percent to $55.55 after the bell on Wednesday.

The Wall Street Journal first reported on the negotiations earlier on Wednesday.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - An end to the bull run in global stocks is not far away, according to a Reuters poll which also showed a broad cut to forecasts for next year on concerns over global growth and tightening financial conditions.
World stocks tested lows at the end of October during a brutal rout that wiped off trillions of dollars of market value, driven by a U.S.-led trade war and a hawkish Federal Reserve.
The recent turbulent sell-off in stocks is more or less over, according to nearly 250 equity strategists polled Nov 13-28. But they mostly said 2018 would end up a forgettable year with most markets set to finish off in the red.
While all but one of the 17 stock market indexes polled are forecast to gain by end-2019 from now, about half were not expected to recoup this year's losses. Strategists also lowered their outlooks compared to three months ago, when almost everyone missed the recent rout.
Shanghai Composite index was the only exception, where strategists raised their outlook from three months ago. But even China stocks will not completely recoup this year's losses of more than 20 percent by end-2019.
The latest predictions for most stock indexes were below what strategists penciled in early this year and clearly show the blistering rallies of 2017 are well in the rear-view mirror.
The risks that have driven stocks lower recently - trade tensions, Brexit negotiations, trouble in emerging markets - could hurt the U.S. financial system, the Fed said in a first-ever report devoted to financial stability.
Still, over 40 percent of strategists who answered an additional question, 48 of 110, said the current bull run in global stocks has more than a year to go. About 25 percent expect it to end within a year.
But nearly a third of respondents said the bull market has already ended.
""While volatility will remain elevated - we've seen two 10 percent corrections this year already - we don't feel that a true bear market will begin until we are in a recession or entering a recession,"" noted Mona Mahajan, investment strategist at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors. 
""We don't expect a recession in the U.S. over the next 12 month period. That being said, markets do start to price in recessions one to six months prior, so we could technically see a bear market start to emerge towards the end of next year.""
Fears the U.S.-China trade war will escalate even further have left Wall Street strategists less optimistic about gains the S&P 500 makes next year, but they still expect the index to close higher next year from here. 
""While the cycle isn't over until it's over, building in strong defenses now will help navigate late-cycle volatility and uncertainty,"" noted Richard Lacaille, global chief investment officer at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors.
""Although the S&P 500 marked its longest bull run in August 2018, a severe correction in October reminded us that we are closer to the end of the cycle than the beginning and that investors should be prepared for heightened volatility.""

Slowing economic growth, political risks and worries over Washington's protectionist policies will keep a lid on key European stock markets in 2019. 
After a bruising year so far, Britain's top stock index will recover some ground in 2019 but gains will be much more subdued than previously thought as investors try to navigate the country's pending split from the European Union. 
While trade worries, concerns about China's economic slowdown and currency volatility are expected to persist, emerging market stocks, which have had a very difficult year, were forecast to outperform equities in developed economies.
Major Latin American bourses are forecast to extend a recent rally into 2019, led by Brazil's Bovespa stock index, which is forecast to gain over 25 percent by end-2019 from here. 
But the outlook for Indian stocks was downgraded for the first time this year. 
Despite a sharp fall in global equities in recent months only about 27 percent of nearly 120 strategists responding to a question described their local market as cheap. Around 40 percent said it was fairly priced and about a third said they were expensive.
While many companies globally have missed profit estimates and several have also lowered their outlook broadly, a majority of strategists who answered a separate question - 64 of 114 - said company earnings growth has not peaked. The remaining 50 respondents said it already has.
""The earnings growth rate has peaked, but the absolute level of earnings should continue to increase over the coming year as solid sales growth should continue to drive earnings at a lower, more sustainable pace,"" said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute in St. Louis, referring to the S&P 500.

58,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2018 06:57PM ET</span>",Trump studying new auto tariffs after GM restructuring,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that new auto tariffs were ""being studied now,"" asserting they could prevent job cuts such as the U.S. layoffs and plant closures that General Motors Co (N:GM) announced this week.
Trump said on Twitter that the 25 percent tariff placed on imported pickup trucks and commercial vans from markets outside North America in the 1960s had long boosted U.S. vehicle production.
""If we did that with cars coming in, many more cars would be built here,"" Trump said, ""and G.M. would not be closing their plants in Ohio, Michigan & Maryland.""
The United States currently has a 2.5 percent tariff on imported cars and sport utility vehicles from markets outside North America and South Korea. The new North American trade deal exempts the first 2.6 million SUVs and passenger cars built in Mexico and Canada from new tariffs. 
Several automakers said privately on Wednesday they feared GM's action could prompt Trump to take action faster than expected on new tariffs.
GM did not directly comment on Trump's tweets, but reiterated that it was committed to investing in the United States. On Monday, the company said it would shutter five North American plants, stop building six low-selling passenger cars in North America and cut up to 15,000 jobs. The company has no plans to shift production of those vehicles to other markets.
The administration has for months been considering imposing dramatic new tariffs on imported vehicles.
The U.S. Commerce Department has circulated draft recommendations to the White House on its investigation into whether to impose tariffs of up to 25 percent on imported cars and parts on national security grounds, Reuters reported earlier this month.
""The President has great power on this issue - Because of the G.M. event, it is being studied now!"" Trump said.
The prospect of tariffs of 25 percent on imported autos and parts has sent shockwaves through the auto industry, with both U.S. and foreign-brand producers lobbying against it and warning that national security tariffs on EU and Japanese vehicles could dramatically raise the price of many vehicles.
'ALL AVAILABLE TOOLS'
Trump has also harshly criticized GM for building cars in China. The United States slapped an additional 25 percent tariff on Chinese-made vehicles earlier this year, prompting China to retaliate.
China currently imposes a 40 percent tariff on U.S. automobiles, while the United States has a 27.5 percent tariff on Chinese vehicles.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a statement on Wednesday that he ""will examine all available tools to equalize the tariffs applied to automobiles.""
Additional tariffs on Chinese-made vehicle and parts would have a limited impact, said Kristin Dziczek, an economist at the Center for Automotive Research. She noted only a small number of vehicles were exported from China to the United States annually.
The White House previously pledged not to move forward with imposing national security tariffs on the European Union or Japan as long as it was making constructive progress in trade talks.
Trump wants the EU and Japan to buy more American-made vehicles. He wants the EU and Japan to make trade concessions including lowering the EU’s 10 percent tariff on imported vehicles and cutting non-tariff barriers.

The White House in recent weeks has reached out to the chief executives of German automakers including  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), BMW AG (DE:BMWG) and Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) about meeting to discuss the status of auto trade.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia will buy Lockheed Martin's (N:LMT) $15 billion missile defense system, a U.S. Department of State spokesman said on Wednesday, after aggressive lobbying by the administration to close the deal that included a personal call between President Donald Trump and Saudi King Salman.
The State Department said the Saudis and U.S. officials signed the letters of offer and acceptance documents on Monday, formalizing terms for Saudi's purchase of 44 Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) launchers, missiles and related equipment. 
In recent weeks the Trump administration and the U.S. defense industry worked to save the few actual deals in the much-touted $110 billion arms package for Saudi Arabia amid rising concerns about the role of the kingdom's leadership in the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a prominent Saudi critic. 
The THAAD deal had been under discussion since December 2016 and is now completed, the spokesperson said.
Trump and King Salman discussed in a late September phone call the THAAD missile defense system deal, a Saudi official told Reuters in October. The official said at that time that the deal could well be closed by the end of the year. 
The State Department spokesman said the deal, first reported by CNBC, supports the ""long-term security of Saudi Arabia and the Gulf region in the face of the growing ballistic missile threat from the Iranian regime and Iran-backed extremist groups.""

Defying the White House, the Senate voted on Wednesday to advance a resolution to end U.S. military support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen's civil war, setting the stage for a possible final vote on the measure within days. Congressional approval for the THAAD missile defense system sale was given in 2017.

Lighthizer said in a statement he was taking such action at the direction of President Donald Trump.
Auto tariffs on both sides have been increased amid a worsening trade war between the United States and China. The United States imposed a 25 percent tariff on Chinese vehicles on top of the 2.5 percent it normally charges. China had lowered tariffs for all other countries to 15 percent, but imposed an additional 25 percent retaliatory tariff on U.S. vehicles.

""China's corporate sector has some of the highest debt levels in the world,"" the report, dated Tuesday, stated, though it said businesses based in the world's second-largest economy also have significant ""cash holdings (that) provide an important cushion against risk.""
Canada, India and Mexico rank first in nonfinancial corporate debt relative to cash holdings, the report said, while a ""significant proportion"" of Brazilian, Canadian, American and Chinese corporations still struggle to pay interests on their debt.
IIF wrote in the report that one-third of small firms in France, the United States and China have an interest coverage ratio under levels generally accepted as optimal, meaning a sharp hike in interest rates could hurt their ability to stay current in their debt payments.
Bankers, executives and investors have warned the U.S. central bank that record leveraged lending to companies from lightly regulated corners of Wall Street could make any economic downturn harder to manage.
The total liabilities of nonfinancial corporations across the globe amount to about 92 percent of the world's gross domestic product, the IIF report said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal judge in San Francisco on Wednesday ordered the U.S. Justice Department and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) to hold new talks with a court-appointed settlement master to try to settle the government's civil suit over the Italian-American automaker's diesel vehicle emissions.
The Justice Department is seeking ""substantial"" civil fines from Fiat Chrysler in a suit filed in May 2017 accusing the company of illegally using software that led to excess emissions in 104,000 U.S. diesel vehicles sold since 2014.
A person briefed on the matter said the government and Fiat Chrysler have reached agreement on almost all aspects of a settlement after months of lengthy talks but remain ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" apart on how big the fines will be.
In a written order, Judge Edward Chen directed both sides to ""fully cooperate and communicate"" with settlement master Ken Feinberg ""in light of the delay in resolving the United States’ case."" Feinberg was ordered ""to engage directly with the parties and employ his best effort in facilitating settlement negotiations, including terms of any monetary relief.""
Feinberg has scheduled a new round of talks with all sides for Dec. 3 in Washington, the person briefed on the matter said.
Feinberg declined to comment, saying Chen's order speaks for itself. Fiat Chrysler had no immediate comment.
U.S. and California regulators stepped up scrutiny of diesel vehicles after Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) admitted in 2015 to illegally installing software in U.S. vehicles for years to evade emissions standards.
VW has agreed to pay more than $25 billion in the United States for claims from owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers.
Regulators have said Fiat Chrysler diesel vehicles had undisclosed emissions controls that allowed vehicles to emit excess pollution during normal driving.
The company has denied any wrongdoing and said there was never an attempt to create software to cheat emissions rules. Last month, the company set aside 713 million euros ($810 million) to cover potential costs related to the case.
Reuters reported in February that a settlement offer sent to Fiat Chrysler lawyers by the Justice Department on Jan. 27 would require the company to offset excess pollution and take steps to prevent future excess emissions. The letter included language that a settlement must include very substantial civil penalties.

The Justice Department has a separate ongoing criminal investigation into the excess emissions.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell boosted U.S. stock markets on Wednesday when he said the policy rate is now ""just below"" estimates of a level that neither brakes nor boosts a healthy economy, comments that many took as signaling the Fed's three-year tightening cycle is drawing to a close. 
The S&P 500 and Dow posted their biggest percentage gains in eight months, while the Nasdaq saw its largest advance in just over a month following Powell's speech to the Economic Club of New York.
Powell said that while ""there was a great deal to like"" about U.S. prospects, ""our gradual pace of raising interest rates has been an exercise in balancing risks.""
Earlier in the day, in its first-ever financial stability report, the Fed cautioned that trade tensions, Brexit, and troubled emerging markets could rock a U.S. financial system where asset prices are ""elevated.""
""(Powell is) now acknowledging he's close to neutral, which suggests maybe not quite as many rate hikes in the future as investors believed,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors in Chicago. ""It's certainly a change of language and welcome news to investors.""
The U.S. Commerce Department affirmed that U.S. GDP  grew in the third quarter at a 3.5 percent annual rate, but the goods trade deficit widened, consumer spending was revised lower and sales of new homes tumbled, suggesting clouds are gathering over what is now the second-longest economic expansion on record. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 617.7 points, or 2.5 percent, to 25,366.43, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 61.61 points, or 2.30 percent, to 2,743.78 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 208.89 points, or 2.95 percent, to 7,291.59.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, all but utilities (SPLRCU) were positive. Technology (SPLRCT) and consumer discretionary (SPLRCD) were the biggest percentage gainers, each up more than 3 percent. 
The S&P 500 Automobile & Components index <.SPLRCAU> was up 1.4 percent after President Donald Trump said he was studying new auto tariffs in the wake of General Motors Co's (N:GM) announcement that it would close plants and cut its workforce.
Health insurer  Humana Inc  (N:HUM) cut its 2019 forecast for Medicare drug plan enrollment, but upped its estimated enrollment in the company's Medicare Advantage plan. Its stock ended the session up 6.2 percent. 
Salesforce.com Inc (N:CRM) beat analysts' earnings estimates and forecast better-than-expected 2020 revenue, sending its shares up 10.3 percent. Other cloud software makers rose on the news, with the ISE Cloud Index (CPQ) gaining 3.5 percent.
 Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) briefly surpassed Apple Inc (O:AAPL) in market cap but Apple took back its lead by closing. Nevertheless, Microsoft closed 4.0 percent higher as it benefited from optimism regarding demand for cloud computing services. 
Among losers, Tiffany & Co (N:TIF) shares dropped 11.8 percent after the luxury retailer missed quarterly sales estimates on slowing Chinese demand.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.95-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.58-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 17 new 52-week highs and six new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 37 new highs and 129 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 8.04 billion shares, compared with the 7.82 billion-share average over the last 20 trading days.

70,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 28, 2018 04:40PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Fed Minutes Come After Powell’s Dovish Speech
The market certainly treated Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s speech today as a dovish tilt, raising the possibility of fewer interest rate hikes next year.
Tomorrow, investors will get the chance to parse the minutes of the last FOMC meeting for further signs the Fed is stepping away from its slow-and-steady hike plan.
The Fed kept its benchmark rate in a range of 2% to 2.25% at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Nov. 8, but signaled a plan for further rate hikes in a bid to keep inflation in check, including three likely in 2019.
But Powell’s comments that rates are currently just below neutral led equity investors to speculate that maybe just two more hikes could leave the Fed in the sweet spot.
Traders are currently pricing in a 40.5% chance of a fed funds range of 2.5% to 2.75% following the Fed’s Oct. 30, 2019 meeting, higher than the day before, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool. Those predicting rates hitting 2.75% to 3% declined from the previous day.
2. Inflation Data, Pending Home Sales Scheduled
On the economic calendar, the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge, personal consumption expenditures (PCE), excluding food and energy, arrives before the opening bell.
Released with the October personal income and spending numbers at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT), the core PCE price index is expected to come in with a 0.2% rise for the month, an annual gain of 1.9%. The Fed likes to target core PCE inflation below 2%.
Spending and income are both forecast to rise 0.4%.
At the same time, weekly initial jobless claims come out, with economists predicting a slight drop to 221,000.
At 10 AM ET, the National Association of Realtors will release the October figures on pending home sales, coming off disappointing new home sales data today.
On average, economists are looking for a rise of 0.8% for the month.
3. Dollar Tree, Abercrombie on Tap to Report
Retail earnings keep rolling in, with discount store Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) reporting ahead of trading. Those long the stock will be hoping to avoid a repeat performance of the previous quarter’s results, where lower guidance slammed shares.
Analysts are predicting a profit of $1.15 per share on sales of about $5.5 billion.
Shares have languished around the same area since the warning on Aug. 30 pushed the stock from the mid-$90s to the low $80s.
Also before the bell in retail, Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF) will release its latest quarterly numbers.
HP (NYSE:HPQ) will report after the close of trading."
71,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 28, 2018 04:31PM ET</span>",Stocks - Dow Rides Powell's Dovish Comments to Triple-Digit Gains,"Investing.com - The Dow soared Wednesday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said interest rates were close to neutral, easing fears that ongoing rate hikes will trigger an economic slowdown.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.50%. The S&P 500 rose 2.34%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 2.95%.
For months, market participants have feared that the Fed may overshoot on policy tightening, choking economic growth. But Powell allayed those fears, saying interest rates were ""just below"" neutral.
""Interest rates are still low by historical standards, and they remain just below the broad range of estimates of the level that would be neutral for the economy ‑‑ that is, neither speeding up nor slowing down growth,"" Powell said.
Market participants will look to the Federal Reserve's minutes from its November meeting slated for Thursday for further evidence on whether the Fed has pivoted to a more dovish stance on policy.
Beyond monetary policy, stocks were also supported by techs, led by a surge in shares of cloud companies including Salesforce.
Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) soared 10% after it smashed Wall Street estimates on both the top and bottom lines.
Cloud software company Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX) reported a narrower loss for the fiscal first-quarter than analysts had expected, sending its share price 5% higher.
Energy, meanwhile, shrugged off a drop in oil prices, which had followed a bearish petroleum report from the Energy Information Administration showing a larger-than-expected build in crude inventories.
On the economic front, a penultimate estimate of third-quarter GDP fell short of estimates, while woes in the housing market continued as new home sales undershot economists' forecasts.
The strong rally in the broader market, however, helped homebuilders shrug off the downbeat housing data.
KB Home (NYSE:KBH),  Lennar  Corporation (NYSE:LEN) and DR Horton (NYSE:DHI) ended the day more than 1% up.
On the corporate news front, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) rose 4% after Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh said GPU pricing was starting to pick up from the September lows as excess inventories were shrinking.
Top S&P 500 Gainers and Losers Today:
Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Abiomed (NASDAQ:ABMD) were among the top S&P 500 gainers for the session.
Tiffany & Co (NYSE:TIF), JM Smucker (NYSE:SJM) and CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) were among the worst S&P 500 performers of the session."

73,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2018 04:29PM ET</span>","Apple's iPhone XR is company's best-selling model, executive says","By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Inc's iPhone XR has been the company's best-selling iPhone model every day since it went on sale in mid-October, a company executive told Reuters on Wednesday.
The iPhone XR, which costs $749, was announced alongside two other models, the iPhone XS and XS Max, which start at $999. The XR brings many key features of those phones to a lower price point, and analysts widely viewed it as Apple's effort to bring facial recognition unlocking and its newest processing chip to a wider set of buyers.
But a string of negative forecasts from smartphone suppliers in recent weeks has sparked concerns that the model might not be performing as Apple had hoped. 
Those reports, alongside investor anxiety over Apple's Nov. 1 disclosure it will no longer provide investors with iPhone unit sales data, have contributed to a more than 20 percent drop from Apple's peak share price in October. 
While Apple is still not giving absolute unit sales figures, the company does occasionally disclose to investors which models are selling the best out of its lineup, which currently includes older models such as the iPhone 7 and iPhone 8. Greg Joswiak, Apple's vice president of product marketing, told Reuters that the iPhone XR is currently Apple's ""most mainstream product and our most popular iPhone.""
""Since the iPhone XR became available, it's been the best-selling iPhone each and every day that it's been on sale,"" Joswiak told Reuters.
In addition to including many of the features from its higher-priced models, Apple also made the iPhone XR available in the broadest color palette for iPhones since the iPhone 5C released in 2013.
Apple is planning to promote the red version of the iPhone XR as part of Product Red, the charity effort that gives a portion of sales of red-colored products to the Global Fund for programs to address HIV and AIDS.
Apple offered the red iPhone XR at launch while in the past the company has offered a mid-spring upgrade of a red iPhone model to support the charity.
Joswiak said the company has raised $200 million for the Global Fund so far. Apple plans to promote the red products during and after World AIDS Day on Dec. 1.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. fund investors pulled the most cash out of bonds in three weeks during the latest seven-day period, according to Investment Company Institute (ICI) data on Wednesday that revealed increased concern by retail investors.
Mutual funds, heavily used by retail investors, reported a 22nd straight week of withdrawals as $17 billion flowed out in the seven days through Nov. 20.
Exchange-traded funds (ETFs), whose sales are traditionally driven more by institutional investors, attracted $10 billion, the trade group said.
Including both mutual funds and ETFs, U.S.-based bond funds posted $3.8 billion withdrawals while $354 million fled stock funds, according to the ICI.
Investors who use bonds as a stable source of income have been reviewing statements showing negative returns this year. The average U.S.-based bond fund is down 1.35 percent for the year, according to Lipper data earlier this month.
The U.S. Federal Reserve has pushed rates higher in an effort to stanch inflation but the higher yields this year have also eaten away at bond prices.
In more recent weeks fears that corporate credit could deteriorate - as the U.S. economy slows from strong growth rates - has also walloped debt markets.

78,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2018 03:42PM ET</span>",Pimco buys all of $3 billion UniCredit bond: sources,"By Elvira Pollina and Valentina Za
MILAN/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. fund Pacific Investment Management Co (Pimco) has bought all of a $3 billion, five-year bond offered with a hefty return by Italy's top bank UniCredit (MI:CRDI) to comply with capital buffer rules, two sources familiar with the matter said.
In comments to the Financial Times, UniCredit Chief Executive Jean Pierre Mustier said the price of the issue was ""not ideal"" but was worth it to secure demand at a time when Italian banks are under siege due to the government's battle with European authorities over next year's budget.
""And by doing such a large transaction with a single investor, it also conserves the capacity of the market for new transactions,"" he was quoted as saying.
UniCredit is Italy's only globally systemically important bank and as such is subject to rules that require lenders to issue securities that can be written down or converted into equity to cover potential losses.
A sell-off of Italian assets has sent borrowing costs soaring for the country's lenders and shut all but the strongest names out of international funding markets.
UniCredit took advantage of a partial respite in market pressure this week following reports that the government may seek a compromise with the European Union over the budget.
Since the sell-off started in mid-May, only rival heavyweight Intesa SanPaolo (MI:ISP) has issued unsecured debt.
Back in January, UniCredit sold Italy's first senior-non preferred bond, placing 1.5 billion euros in five-year notes at a premium of 70 basis points (bps) over the swap rate - a spread which has now swelled to 320 bps on the secondary market.
The latest bond was issued at 420 bps over the swap rate, commanding an 80 bps new issue premium when adjusting the duration of the two bonds.
A Milan-based debt banker said the decision to place the bond with a single buyer had spared UniCredit the need for roadshow presentations with investors, reducing market risks.
Pimco oversaw $1.72 trillion in assets under management, as of September 2018. Pimco remains cautious on Italy and underweighted in Italian risk. But Pimco's purchase of UniCredit reflects a ""good, narrow, opportunistic"" trade, one of the sources familiar with the situation said on Wednesday. The source also said the $3 billion UniCredit bond will be spread across Pimco portfolios, which will amount to less than 1 percent exposure.
Normally bonds are sold to a number of buyers through a syndicate of banks that gathers orders from investors. Caught up in the market storm, UniCredit had stalled the launch of its senior non-preferred bond. 
In presenting its third-quarter earnings earlier this month, the bank's chief financial officer said UniCredit aimed to sell between 3-5 billion euros of loss-absorbing securities by the first quarter of next year.
Mustier had said at the time that meetings with investors confirmed strong interest for the bank's debt.
Pimco already has a relationship with UniCredit as together with rival Fortress, the U.S. asset manager, it last year invested in a jumbo 17.7 billion-euro bad loan securitization sale carried out by the Italian bank. 

News of Pimco buying the bond was first reported by Il Sole 24 Ore daily. A Pimco spokesperson declined to comment.

Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) soared 10% after it smashed Wall Street estimates on both the top and bottom lines.
Analysts attributed the upbeat report to strong performance in billings, which grew 27%, well above consensus of 19%.
""Billings was driven by strength across all clouds as both renewals and new business led to outperformance in the quarter,"" William Blair said in a note.
But the outlook for the current quarter came in just below expectations, though analysts at Baird said CEO Mark Benioff's comments ""around strong macro in Americas and APAC should remove portions of bear case around uncertain 2019.""
Cloud software company Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX) reported Tuesday a narrower loss for the fiscal first-quarter than analysts had expected, sending its share price more than 9% higher.
The strong quarter appeared to reassure investors that the company's strategy to phase out its hardware business and move entirely into higher-margin software products would eventually spur growth.

The Dow jumped more than 500 points, rising about 2.2% at 2:20 PM ET (19:20 GMT). The S&P 500 was up 1.8% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.3%.
“Interest rates are still low by historical standards, and they remain just below the broad range of estimates of the level that would be neutral for the economy ‑‑ that is, neither speeding up nor slowing down growth,” Powell said in prepared remarks in New York.
Many investors believe that the Fed can end its steady tightening cycle once a neutral rate is reached.
Powell said the Fed’s “gradual pace of raising interest rates has been an exercise in balancing risks,” but added “there is no preset policy path.”
Stocks were already in the green before the Powell boost after White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow on Tuesday held open the possibility that the U.S. and China would reach a trade deal.
""Trade has been an issue for a long time and any hint that the China-U.S. trade dispute could be resolved could make a pick up in global growth,"" said Kim Forrest, senior portfolio manager at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's (O:MSFT) stock market value surpassed Apple Inc's (O:AAPL), pulling ahead by as much as $3 billion on Wednesday as the Windows software maker benefited from optimism about demand for cloud computing services.
Shares of Microsoft jumped 3 percent, pushing its market capitalization up to $848 billion. With the broad market rebounding from a recent slump, Apple also rose, but less than Microsoft. Its 2.17 percent increase put Apple's market capitalization at $845 billion, just four months after the iPhone maker breached the $1 trillion mark for the first time.
Microsoft and Apple briefly traded at about the same level after the bell on Monday, but Microsoft's intraday lead over Apple on Wednesday was more substantial. 
Both companies' market capitalizations were calculated using outstanding shares reported in their most recent 10-Q filings.
(Graphic: Microsoft chases Apple - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Rq2U0J)
Apple's market capitalization overtook Microsoft's in 2010 as the Windows seller struggled with slow demand for personal computers, due in part to the explosion of smartphones driven by Apple's iPhone. 
Since then, Microsoft has not ended an official trading session with a stock market value greater than Apple's. 
(Graphic: Blue chip market caps for past 20 years - https://tmsnrt.rs/2RkOtLf)
Shares of several cloud software makers also rose on Wednesday after Salesforce.com Inc's (N:CRM) upbeat quarterly earnings boosted Wall Street expectations for the fast-growing sector, which faced pressure in the recent sell-off in technology stocks.
Since Satya Nadella took over as chief executive in 2014, Microsoft has reduced its reliance on Windows software for PCs and became a major player in cloud computing, second only to Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN). 
In recent months, technology shares have been punished as investors worried about rising interest rates and fallout from the U.S.-China trade war. 
But Apple has suffered more than other Silicon Valley stalwarts, losing 19 percent since the iPhone maker warned on Nov. 1 that crucial holiday-quarter sales would likely miss Wall Street expectations.
Global demand for smartphones has slowed in recent years, making it more difficult for Apple to increase its revenue.
Thirty-three analysts recommend buying Microsoft's stock, while just one has a negative rating and another has a neutral rating, according to Refinitiv data. 
Twenty-six analysts have positive ratings on Apple, another 16 are neutral, and none recommend selling its stock.

For fiscal 2019, analysts on average expect Microsoft's revenue to increase 11 percent, compared with an estimated 5 percent for Apple, with iPhone sales growing less than 1 percent, according to Refinitiv data.

86,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2018 02:01PM ET</span>",Car market collapse outruns GM moves to keep up,"By Paul Lienert
DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors (NYSE:GM) Co's monumental announcement on Monday that it will close three car assembly plants in North America and slash its workforce will only partially close the gap between capacity and demand for the automaker's sedans, according to a Reuters analysis of industry production and capacity data.
Sales of traditional passenger cars in North America have been declining for the past six years and are still withering. After GM ends production next year at factories in Michigan, Ohio and Ontario, it will still have four U.S. car plants, all operating at less than 50 percent of rated capacity, according to figures supplied by LMC Automotive.
In comparison, Detroit-based rivals Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV will have one car plant each in North America after 2019.
The Detroit Three are facing rapidly dwindling demand for traditional passenger cars from U.S. consumers, many of whom have shifted to crossovers and trucks. Passenger cars accounted for 48 percent of retail light-vehicle sales in the United States in 2014, according to market researchers at J.D. Power and Associates. This year, sedans will account for less than a third of light vehicle sales.
That shift in turn has left most North American car plants operating far below their rated capacities, while many SUV and truck plants are running on overtime.
The collapse in passenger-car demand is a challenge for nearly all automakers in the United States, including Japan's Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co Ltd, which have the top-selling models in the compact and midsize car segments. Toyota executives said last month they are evaluating the company's U.S. model lineup. But Toyota also plans to build compact Corolla sedans at a new $1.6 billion factory it is building in Alabama with partner Mazda Motor Corp.
The obstacles facing GM in its plans to close more auto factories became apparent on Tuesday as U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to block payment of government electric vehicle subsidies to GM. While it is not certain that Trump unilaterally has the power to do that, he made it clear he intends to use his office to pressure the company to keep open a small car plant in Ohio that GM says will stop building vehicles in March. 
Asked whether GM's plans to close factories and cut jobs might not solve the demand problem for its sedans, GM spokeswoman Kimberly Carpenter said on Tuesday: ""We continuously look at our operations for opportunities to improve our efficiency and capacity utilization. We believe the actions announced yesterday move us in the right direction and we will continue to monitor the market and consumer trends and adjust accordingly.""
Shares of the No. 1 U.S. automaker closed 2.5 percent lower at $36.69 on Tuesday, after rising nearly 5 percent the previous day.
ABANDONMENT ISSUES
GM executives have said they do not intend to abandon cars to the extent that Ford and FCA have. GM car plants that will remain open include Fairfax, Kansas, which builds the Chevrolet Malibu and Cadillac XT4 compact SUV. But that plant is operating at 48 percent of capacity, well below the 80 percent that GM Chief Executive Mary Barra is targeting as the average for North America.
A GM plant in Lansing, Michigan, that builds the Cadillac ATS and CTS and Chevrolet Camaro is running at just 33 percent capacity, while the GM Orion Township, Michigan, facility that builds the Chevrolet Bolt electric car and the Chevrolet Sonic subcompact runs at 34 percent capacity. A Bowling Green, Kentucky, plant that builds the Chevrolet Corvette sports car works at just 27 percent of its potential output, according to LMC data.
“Until GM gets more flexibility in its platforms, it will continue to have to play whack-a-mole with its plants as the market transitions – and it will happen again,” said LMC analyst Bill Rinna.
In all, the four GM car plants that will remain open have a combined capacity of more than 800,000 vehicles a year, but are expected to produce only 360,000 cars this year, according to LMC.
Industry analysts have said the general break-even point for running an assembly plant profitably is around 80 percent. Barra said on Monday GM's North American plants are running at 70 percent capacity - including truck and SUV plants that are working overtime.
Ford plans to end production in March of the Taurus at its Chicago plant, which also builds the Explorer and Aviator SUVs. That will leave the automaker with only one U.S. car plant, in Flat Rock, Michigan, which currently builds the Ford Mustang and the Lincoln Continental. The Mustang is due for a mild redesign around 2021, but the Continental is scheduled to be phased out then, according to two sources familiar with the company's plans. Flat Rock is running at just 49 percent of capacity, but Ford has said it plans to add new products to the plant, including its first automated vehicle, in 2021.

Fiat Chrysler still builds the full-size Chrysler 300 and Dodge Charger and Challenger at its Brampton, Ontario, plant. Demand for those large cars remains robust, and the plant is running at nearly 80 percent capacity.

87,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2018 01:55PM ET</span>","Ford reshuffles U.S. plants to beef up SUV, truck production","By Nick Carey
DETROIT (Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) said on Wednesday it will reshuffle workers at several of its plants to meet rising demand for pickup trucks and large SUVs, a process that will require finding new positions for 150 workers displaced by the changes but not result in job cuts.
The changes also will not require adding new jobs.
The No. 2 U.S. automaker said it will shift 500 workers from one Kentucky plant making crossover vehicles to another that makes its best-selling F-Series pickup trucks, plus the Ford Expedition and the Lincoln Navigator, both large SUVs.
In addition, Ford has a new midsize pickup, the Ranger, coming to the market next year.
The Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker also said it would move 500 jobs to a Michigan plant making transmissions for popular pickup trucks from one nearby that will reduce production to one shift making Mustangs and the Lincoln Continental. 
Ford said an additional 150 workers from the Flat Rock, Michigan, assembly plant would receive job offers at other plants. A company spokeswoman said Ford was ""highly confident"" that jobs would be found for all those workers and there would be no job losses as a result of this reshuffling.
The United Auto Workers union, which represents hourly workers at Ford, said in a statement, ""after working with Ford, we are confident that all impacted employees will have the opportunity to work at nearby facilities.""
The news comes two days after Ford's crosstown rival General Motors Co (N:GM) said it would cut 15,000 jobs and mothball five North American factories, including four in the United States, in response to slumping consumer demand for traditional passenger cars.
That announcement has drawn the ire of Republican President Donald Trump, who has threatened to eliminate subsidies for GM. One of the four U.S. plants expected to close is a car factory in northeast Ohio, a state critical to victory in the 2020 presidential campaign.
According to a Reuters analysis of industry production and capacity data, GM's plans will only partially close the gap between capacity and demand for the automaker's sedans.
Sales of the Ford Expedition were up 4 percent through the first 10 months of 2018, while sales of the high-margin Lincoln Navigator spiked nearly 81 percent during that period.

Earlier this year, Ford said it would drop production of increasingly unpopular, traditional sedan models in North America.

105,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2018 12:18PM ET</span>","Tiffany sales to Chinese tourists disappoint, shares fall sharply","By Melissa Fares and Uday Sampath Kumar
(Reuters) - Tiffany & Co's (N:TIF) on Wednesday reported quarterly sales that missed estimates as Chinese tourists spent less than expected at the jeweler's stores in the United States and Hong Kong, a shortfall that sent the company's shares down as much 13 percent. 
Investors were also disappointed by the 181-year-old company's failure to raise its full-year profit outlook ahead of the holiday season and by growth of same-store sales at a slower pace than expected.
Tiffany shares were down 11.8 percent at $92.58 in mid-day trade.
Chief Executive Alessandro Bogliolo tried to reassure investors that while spending outside of China was down, sales in the country were robust. 
""We can speculate on the reasons for the tourist spend down outside of China but the reality is that the Tiffany brand is appealing to Chinese customers as evidenced by the continued strong sales growth in mainland China in the quarter,"" he said on an investor call.
Some of the increase in demand in mainland China could be attributed to Tiffany lowering prices in the country after the Chinese government cut tariffs on luxury goods, he said.
Bogliolo said Tiffany was shifting more inventory to mainland China, where customers are spending more than abroad.
""When it comes to tourism, what we do is try to follow the customers while they spend ... We are increasing our inventory in China because demand there has grown,"" Bogliolo said.
""Declining Chinese tourist spending is concerning and may be reflective of strained relations with the U.S.,"" said research firm Retail Metrics founder Ken Perkins, referring to the U.S.-China trade dispute. ""China’s growth has been slowing so to see strong spending on the mainland is encouraging.""
Tiffany forecast full-year profit between $4.65 and $4.80 per share. Analysts on average had estimated $4.83 per share.
The unchanged outlook, among other things, reflected Tiffany's planned increases in marketing expenditure to entice younger shoppers into its stores and expenses related to the renovation of its flagship store in New York, the company said.
The jeweler has refreshed its collections with more affordable items such as pendants and earrings to appeal to millennials who have been gravitating to lower-priced competitors such as Denmark's  Pandora  A/S (CO:PNDORA) and Signet Jewelers (N:SIG).
Bogliolo said the company has also invested in marketing to reach Chinese customers and tourists specifically.
""Of course if there are less Chinese tourists traveling, we divert our media from traveling locations - airports etc - more to domestic media, typically digital,"" he said, citing the recent launch of its platinum and diamond collection Paper Flowers in China.
The New York-based company's net income fell to $94.9 million, or 77 cents per share, in its fiscal third quarter, ended Oct. 31, from $100.2 million, or 80 cents per share, a year earlier.
Total revenue rose 3.7 percent to $1.01 billion.
Analysts on average expected earnings of 77 cents per share on revenue of $1.05 billion.

The company's comparable-store sales, excluding the impact of currency changes, rose 3 percent, while analysts on average were expecting a rise of 5.3 percent, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

114,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2018 11:46AM ET</span>",Danske Bank charged over alleged violations of money laundering law,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Denmark's state prosecutor has filed preliminary charges against  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE) for alleged violations of the country's anti-money laundering act in relation to its Estonian branch.
The country's biggest lender was placed under investigation in August over concerns that transactions worth billions of Danish crowns might have been part of criminal money laundering.
Danske Bank is involved in a money laundering scandal at its Estonian branch, involving 200 billion euros ($225 billion) in suspicious transactions between 2007 and 2016.
""We are still working intensively with the investigation,"" general prosecutor Morten Niels Jakobsen said in a statement on Wednesday.
The prosecutor will now seek to clarify whether it can pursue criminal charges against Danske Bank or whether individuals can be held responsible, Jakobsen said.
Shares in Danske Bank, which have shed nearly half of their value since March, were largely unaffected by the news, trading 0.7 percent higher at 1618 GMT.
""The possible financial consequences of a fine are relatively small in relation to the damage already inflicted and the risk of U.S. authorities entering the case,"" said Nordnet economist Per Hansen.
Investors have already priced in a fine of about 30 billion Danish crowns ($4.5 billion) or more, he said.
As a consequence of the scandal, Danish lawmakers in September agreed to tighten anti-money laundering laws and increase financial penalties by up to 700 percent.
The state prosecutor for serious economic and international crime has brought charges on four counts based on the result of the investigation so far, addressing violations both at the Estonian branch and at the bank's Copenhagen headquarters.
The charges include the bank having insufficient knowledge about the branch's non-resident customers, failure to train local staff in how to prevent money laundering and failure to integrate the Estonian branch into the bank's risk-management and control systems.
""The money laundering case is very serious. It is reasonable and necessary that Danske Bank now be accountable in court,"" Danish business minister Rasmus Jarlov wrote on Twitter.
Acting Chief Executive Jesper Nielsen said the bank had expected preliminary charges in connection with a report it presented in September.
Thomas Borgen resigned as chief executive in September when Danske published an internal report on the suspicious money flows through its Estonian branch.

Microsoft’s market cap rose to about $833.02 billion at 10:17 AM ET (15:13 AM GMT), above Apple’s figure of about $830.54 billion, according to figures from Yahoo! Finance.
Apple and Microsoft have been racing neck and neck to hold the title as U.S. President Donald Trump’s comments about tariffs on iPhones and laptops hit Apple, which had breached $1 trillion just four months ago.
Trump told The Wall Street Journal on Monday that among his plans to move ahead with tariffs on China he could place a 10% levy on iPhones imported from China.
Coming after Monday’s close, shares in Apple slid nearly 2%, falling to match Microsoft’s market capitalization of $814 billion, according to calculations made by Reuters using outstanding shares in the companies’ most recent 10-Q filings.
Tuesday saw Microsoft briefly pass Apple, reclaiming a title it had held 16 years ago, although the iPhone maker managed to recover from intraday lows to defend its crown.
According to S&P Dow Indices’ data, Apple claimed the lead in 2012 when it ousted  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM)."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Talks between the European Union and Switzerland have not made enough progress to extend EU recognition of Swiss stock-exchange regulations beyond this year, European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said in a letter.
No accord on so-called ""equivalence"" rules by the end of December would result in SIX Swiss Exchange, the country's main stock exchange, and other trading venues losing access to EU business. 
The letter was sent to EU lawmaker Markus Ferber on Nov. 27, two days after Swiss voters rejected a referendum proposal to give the country's laws priority over international law.
The vote was seen as a positive development for the talks with the EU, but new negotiations have still to begin in earnest. The Swiss cabinet is expected to discuss its next moves on Friday. 
""At this point in time there is not sufficient progress in our discussions with the Swiss authorities to allow for the extension of the equivalence decision for Swiss stock exchanges beyond December 2018,"" Dombrovskis said in the letter.
The Swiss Finance Ministry and the SIX Swiss Exchange declined to comment on Wednesday.
The EU and Switzerland have been negotiating for four years a new, overarching treaty to govern their relations, which are currently regulated by about 120 sectorial accords. So far, the talks have not led to a breakthrough. 
Switzerland is integrated in the EU market but is not a member of the 28-country bloc.
The EU wants an overall framework agreement before extending recognition of Swiss exchanges beyond this year, when it would otherwise expire.
The new general agreement ""aims to bring legal certainty and a level playing field in EU-Swiss relations, to the benefit of both EU and Swiss market operators,"" Dombrovskis said.
He acknowledged that some progress was made in past months but concluded that ""there are still some major unresolved issues"", without providing details.
Ferber, who is a member of the economic affairs committee of the EU parliament, said he had hoped last weekend's referendum would break the deadlock.

He said the framework agreement and the equivalence decision should be kept separated. ""The Swiss equivalence status should be judged merely on the basis of the technical analysis of the Commission services,"" he said.

The report said around 1,800 jobs, 1,200 at three sites in France, and 600 in Germany, could be affected by the cost-cutting measure.
A spokesman for the company declined to comment.
The company, which supplies the oil and gas industry, has struggled to recover since oil prices crashed in 2015.
In its third quarter results on Nov. 15, the company said it was continuing its transformation plan and was generating significant cost reductions, but did not give details.
S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings said on Nov. 21 that although it expected Vallourec's performance to continue to improve in the coming quarters, it believed this will happen at a slower pace than previously anticipated.
S&P lowered Vallourec's rating to ""B-"" from ""B"" with a negative outlook.
""The negative outlook reflects that we may further lower the rating over the next three to 12 months if improvement in Vallourec's quarterly profits stalls following setbacks in the company's cost reduction programs,"" it said.
As of Sept. 30, the company had reported net debt of 2.1 billion euros ($2.37 billion), the ratings agency said, adding that Vallourec's key weakness remains its high cost position, notably in European assets.
Vallourec said after the rating announcement that its liquidity situation was sound.
The company's shares are down 56.6 percent year-to-date.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Kremlin's latest standoff with Ukraine in the Azov Sea is forcing foreign investors to reconsider Russia, which faces the possibility of even more stringent Western sanctions.
European Union leaders are expected to soon extend existing sanctions on Russia, although some senior politicians have also called for imposing fresh ones.
But the bigger risk is that Washington could opt to bar Russian banks such as Sberbank and VTB from operating in the United States and restrict their dollar access.
Somewhat less painful could be measures to restrict investors on buying new Russian government bonds.
The following charts show how foreign investors and Russian assets prices and fundamentals have reacted in recent years: 
EBB AND FLOWS 
Domestic OFZ sovereign bonds have been a lightning rod of sentiment towards Russia. A U.S. inquiry into election meddling and the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain this year have seen an almost 10 percent drop in foreign OFZ ownership.
Graphic: Russia portfolio flows - https://tmsnrt.rs/2PYLZFT
A drop in the rouble (RUB=) and a halt to central bank rate cuts mean Russian bonds have lost 12 percent in overall returns terms this year, compared to a 7 percent drop for JP Morgan's emerging markets bond index <.JGEGDCM>. 
In the 4-1/2 years since Moscow's annexation of Crimea, both equity and debt markets have seen outflows and although OFZs had begun performing again, this year has knocked them back down. 
Graphic: Russia's local debt markets - https://tmsnrt.rs/2PDlPrU
STOCKS
Non-Russian investors own 50-60 percent of the freefloat of Russian stocks and account for around half of 'secondary market' trading in Russian equities, the Moscow Exchange estimates.
An exodus of foreign investors could affect the largest and most traded stocks such as Sberbank (MM:SBER), VTB (MM:VTBR) or energy giants such as Rosneft (MM:ROSN) and Gazprom (MM:GAZP).
Some analysts point out that with more state-backed and other Russian firms now paying dividends than ever before, the overall dividend yield on Russia equities is now around 8 percent, compared with the emerging market average of 3 percent.
Sberbank offers 10 percent, or an even higher 12-13 percent on 'preferred' shares.
Analysts estimate this to be an all time high, whereas traditional price to earnings are around the historical average. 
WEIGHT LOSS
Sanctioning Russian sovereign debt transactions would be one Washington's biggest financial levers. However, Moscow's slide down the investment league table means it wouldn't pack the same punch it once did.
Russia comprises currently around 3.6 percent of JPMorgan's EMBI Global ""hard currency"" sovereign bond index compared to 9 percent just over a decade ago. 
It does have a higher 7.6 percent weight in the index for emerging local currency bonds, the GBI-EM - well off the 10 percent index-maximum it hit during the 2012-14 oil boom. On the CEMBI corporate debt index, Russian firms account for 5 percent, down from 14 percent 10 years ago. 
Russia's financial institutions have also reduced their foreign currency exposure, Oxford Economics says, making them less vulnerable to external pressures. Credit institutions' foreign currency liabilities were just under $300 billion in October, compared to more than $400 billion in mid-2015. 
Graphic: Russia weighting in global bond indexes - https://tmsnrt.rs/2K7y48s
RESERVES JUDGEMENT
Russian authorities have been praised for changes over the last six years designed to make Russia's economy less captive to oil's fortunes but also helped it navigate the sanctions stress.
A system in which the central bank buys dollars when oil and gas prices rise has seen it build up roughly $100 billion of extra reserves over the last 18 months, giving it roughly half a trillion dollars in total.
Meanwhile Russia has also ditched its holdings of U.S. Treasuries in the past few months as relations between Moscow and Washington have soured.
FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT
Foreign direct investment stopped suddenly following the annexation of Crimea in 2014, though has since shown signs of recovery. Yet geopolitical tensions are just one part of the puzzle with investors also wary of tepid economic growth. 
Russia's central bank predicted the economy could expand by no more than 2.0 percent. Evghenia Sleptsova at Oxford Economics calculated that sanctions had reduced potential growth, estimated at 1.3-1.4 percent, by around 0.4 percentage points.

145,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 28, 2018 09:10AM ET</span>",Goldman Crunches Data to Pick the Best Trades for a G-20 Rally,"(Bloomberg) -- It’s no secret that global trade tensions have spurred market volatility, which means this week’s G-20 meeting is likely to offer both peril and opportunity for investors.
The gathering in Buenos Aires, which will include a much-watched dinner between U.S. President Donald Trump and China’s Xi Jinping amid heightened trade tensions, offers one of the year’s last remaining potential catalysts for a big move in markets. So,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). looked at previous trade-related stock moves to figure out what might be winners this time around.
“We see an opportunity in the options market for investors to express a view that trade news could be more constructive than feared by buying calls on the stocks that have lagged,” Goldman strategists led by Katherine Fogertey and John Marshall wrote in a note Wednesday. “If this scenario does materialize, we see the potential for shares that have been most exposed to trade news to trade higher, benefiting buyers of calls,” they said, offering the caveat that they “are not making a call on the outcome of trade talks and the G-20.”
The Goldman strategists identified about 20 stocks that have shown unusually high volatility around seven periods of trade news since March, and have sufficiently liquid options. A call that’s 5 percent out of the money is cheapest on eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY)., Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK). and  Fluor Corp  (NYSE:FLR)., they said, with companies like Applied Materials Inc (NASDAQ:AMAT)., Las Vegas Sands Corp. and Huntsman Corp. also making the list.
On average, stocks in that group have lagged the S&P 500 Index by nearly 40 percent since March 21, but one 5 percent out-of-the-money call option costs just 3 percent, the strategists said. They noted that call buyers risk losing the premium paid if shares close below the strike price at expiration.
Sector exchange-traded funds might also be good places to try trading the G-20 meeting, as some industry groups have shown more volatility than others around trade news, Goldman said, recommending the purchase of calls on industrials (ticker XLI), materials (XLB), semiconductors (SMH) and technology (XLK) funds.
“Calls on certain country ETFs (i.e., China and Emerging Markets) as well as S&P 500 could perform well if trade talks are constructive in the coming days,” the strategists added.

The figure takes into account all different forms of reward, including Kaeser's fixed salary as well as elements of stock-based compensation at their value on the grant date. 
The salary increase of roughly 160,000 euros comes as Siemens reported a decrease in net profit to 5.81 billion euros during 2018, a year in which Kaeser unveiled a new strategy to make the trains-to-turbines maker more nimble and profitable.
Kaeser, who has led Siemens since 2013, unveiled a new plan which will trim the number of Siemens' industrial businesses to three from five and give them more autonomy. 
During 2018 the company has been battling a severe downturn in its power and gas business and floated part of its Healthineers medical business.

150,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2018 07:44AM ET</span>",Seeds of Renault-Nissan crisis sown in Macron's 'raid',"By Laurence Frost and Michel Rose
PARIS (Reuters) - The arrest of Renault-Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn has triggered new attempts by the Japanese carmaker to shake off the control of its French parent - adding to the problems piling up on President Emmanuel Macron's desk in the Elysee Palace.
But this one, more than most, may be of Macron's own making.
In April 2015, as a 37 year-old economy minister with then-unknown presidential ambitions, Macron ordered a surprise government stake increase in  Renault  (PA:RENA), designed to secure double voting rights for the state. The overnight move profoundly rattled the Japanese end of the Renault-Nissan alliance.
In the ensuing eight-month boardroom fight between Macron's ministry and Hiroto Saikawa - Nissan's second-in-command at the time - many now see the seeds of today's crisis.
When Ghosn's Gulfstream touched down in Tokyo on Nov. 19, prosecutors were waiting. Nissan, the company he rescued from bankruptcy and had overseen for almost two decades, outlined allegations of financial misconduct against its chairman and said governance had been eroded by Renault's control.
Saikawa has since contested Renault's right to appoint executives and directors under the alliance master agreement, in correspondence seen by Reuters. Such fundamental differences now threaten the future of the partnership, which rivals Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Toyota on the global auto industry stage.
""President Macron himself has skin in the game,"" Max Warburton, an analyst with New York-based asset manager AllianceBernstein, said this week.
""He must recognize that his decision in 2015 to increase the French state's holding in Renault ... likely impacted Japanese perceptions of the alliance and heightened concerns that Nissan was ultimately within the control of the French government.""
The Elysee declined to comment, but an adviser said the president had ""no regrets"" about the events of 2015. 
Macron, who surged to victory in elections last year to became France's youngest president, now finds himself battling street protests and record low approval ratings. The Renault-Nissan crisis may draw more attention to the risks of his bold interventionism, once seen as refreshing.
The year before his move on Renault, the government under Socialist President Francois Hollande had passed the Florange law. Named after a steel furnace whose closure became a symbol of decline, it doubled voting rights for long-term investors - chief among them the French state - in any listed companies that did not opt out via a shareholder vote.
COURTESY CALL
Over several months starting in late 2014, Macron, a former Rothschild dealmaker, tried in vain to dissuade Ghosn and the Renault board from proposing an opt-out at the company's April 30 general meeting. With a 15 percent stake in the carmaker and an only slightly larger share of the vote, the government seemed likely to lose such a face-off.
Then, on the evening of April 7, Macron called Ghosn to let him know - as a courtesy - that the state had bought another 4.73 percent of Renault for 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion), would announce its maneuver in the morning and planned to sell back down to 15 percent only after defeating his opt-out.
""He would always go in with guns blazing,"" a former minister said of Macron. ""Only then would the real power dynamics of the situation register.""
With that step, seen by detractors and admirers alike as an unprecedented government ""raid"", the simmering battle of egos between Ghosn the global CEO and Macron the wunderkind banker-turned-minister had burst into the open.
Brushing aside warnings, Macron pressed ahead and defeated the opt-out. The vote handed France an effective blocking minority at Renault, which in turn controlled Nissan shareholder meetings via its 43.4 percent stake in the Japanese firm.
Alarm bells rang in Tokyo as that sank in, ratcheting tensions higher over the months that followed. Nissan threatened to exit the Restated Alliance Master Agreement (RAMA) - a radical step that would have freed it to buy up shares in its smaller French parent, and end or reverse Renault's control.
""The governance of Renault and consequently the autonomy of Renault management, which have been the basis of trust (for) the alliance, will be significantly impacted,"" Saikawa wrote in a Sept. 3, 2015, note to the Renault board obtained by Reuters.
A Nissan spokesman declined to comment for this story. 
Macron's staff initially dismissed Saikawa's demands - that Renault sell down its controlling Nissan stake, restore voting rights to Nissan's 15 percent Renault holding and relinquish control of the alliance - seeing them as dictated by Ghosn, who at that point remained Nissan CEO.
""When Ghosn talks about what Nissan and Japan think, he's speaking for himself,"" an official at the French agency that oversees state shareholdings said at the time. ""It's all rubbish as far as I'm concerned.""
MACRON MISJUDGED
Fast-forward three years: Ghosn is gone, detained for now in a Tokyo cell to face accusations that he misappropriated Nissan assets, misrepresented company investments and - partly as a result - massively under-reported his real compensation. He denies the allegations, according to NHK television.
And yet the same Nissan demands are back on the table.
""The terminology, the phrases and vocabulary we're hearing today are much the same as in 2015,"" said another former French government official, now an investment banker.
""We didn't believe Ghosn when he presented the Japanese position, but in fact it was no invention.""
Macron's pressure for a full Renault-Nissan merger also raised hackles in Japan months before the Nissan whistleblower probe that led to Ghosn's arrest and ouster as chairman.
Having previously insisted that France would first have to sell its Renault stake, Ghosn agreed this year https://www.reuters.com/article/renault-nissan-alliance/renault-nissan-ready-to-merge-if-france-exits-stake-ceo-idUSL5N1FV1U4 to explore a closer tie-up in return for the renewal of his Renault CEO contract with government backing, and he then revived deal talks.
This week, executives from Renault, Nissan and Nissan-controlled Mitsubishi (T:7211) are gathering for the first time since Ghosn's arrest. The Amsterdam meetings are aimed at keeping shared plants and programs ticking over in the sudden absence of a global leader, and averting conflict.
But as the appointments dispute threatens to escalate into a new boardroom fight, Renault's hand is critically weakened by another deal Macron struck to end the last stand-off.
At the end of 2015, as tension mounted over Nissan's threat to sever alliance ties, France agreed https://www.reuters.com/article/us-renault-nissan/renault-nissans-french-peace-deal-leaves-investors-underwhelmed-idUSKBN0TU17R20151212 to cap its Renault voting rights at 18 percent for most non-strategic decisions.
But the Macron-backed ""stabilization"" agreement went further, with a binding pledge by Renault never to oppose the Nissan board at a company shareholder meeting. In the now-unfolding tussle over directorships, that is a handicap.
The reversal was a staggering ""failure of oversight"" from a government that had intervened to protect what it saw as Renault's interests, according to Loic Dessaint, CEO of Proxinvest, a Paris shareholder advisory firm.
""It's nothing less than the abandonment of Renault's rights over its main asset,"" Dessaint said on Tuesday. ""Renault has effectively forfeited its votes in Nissan.""
He added: ""Now we're approaching a situation where they realize too late it's had an impact on their negotiating position. The alliance power balance is already upended.""
DISTRACTIONS
When approached by Reuters, former president Hollande declined to comment on his administration's handling of the voting rights saga of three years ago.
But Macron's cabinet colleague said he seemed distracted towards the end of the year when - as is now known - he was preparing to launch En Marche, the political party that eventually carried him to the presidency. The web address en-marche.fr was registered on Jan. 7, 2016, less than four weeks after the Renault-Nissan deal was brokered.
""It didn't prevent him from being very engaged with his dossiers, given his intelligence and capacity for work,"" the ex-minister said. ""But they were no longer his main concern.""
Ghosn also bears some responsibility for escalating his 2015 battle with the economy minister, he added.
""Ghosn had the absolutely insufferable conviction that he was above dealing with ministers, so he'd only ever consider talking to a prime minister - which I doubt endeared him much to Macron, who was also rarely unaware of his own significance.""
At least part of that verdict was shared by another cabinet colleague, Christophe Sirugue, when asked about his relationship with Renault's CEO a year after the dispute was settled.
""With Carlos Ghosn? You have got to be kidding,"" said Sirugue, then industry minister for Europe's third-ranked economy - and Renault's biggest market. ""As far as he's concerned I don't exist.""

TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Mexican industrial group  Mexichem  (MX:MEXCHEM) is establishing an innovation hub in Israel, building on this year's acquisition of Israeli drip irrigation pioneer Netafim.
The company has a team scouting for technology and start-ups that fit Mexichem's main businesses - building and infrastructure, agriculture and data communications and basic materials, Chief Executive Daniel Martinez-Valle said.
The hub will also help develop new business models for the company's customers and examine investment opportunities for Mexichem's new corporate venture capital fund.
""Israel will be a significant source of deals,"" Martinez-Valle told Reuters on Wednesday during a trip to Israel.
He declined to provide financial details but said this would be a significant investment priority for the next five years, adding: ""Israel is the priority for building innovation.""
In February, Mexichem acquired 80 percent of Netafim, the world's largest provider of drip irrigation systems, for $1.5 billion in cash and debt. The rest of Netafim, which has a 30 percent market share, is held by Kibbutz Hatzerim.
Netafim and the new innovation hub will work closely together. Both are part of Mexichem's drive to address global challenges such as water scarcity and flooding.
Martinez-Valle said that despite recent volatility in financial markets he was ""very optimistic for the short and long term of the company"".
In mid-year Mexichem raised its 2018 outlook for growth in EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) to 25-30 percent from 20-25 percent forecast at the beginning of the year.
""Today we feel optimistic we will fall within this range by the end of the year,"" he said.
EBITDA in 2017 was $1.1 billion.
The CEO said he does not foresee any major impact from global trade wars on the company's businesses. Mexichem operates in 110 countries, with Mexico accounting for 11 percent of its business and the United States 20 percent.
Netafim had EBITDA of $133 million in 2017 on sales of $949 million. Its CEO Ran Maidan said on Wednesday that in 2019 he expects double-digit EBITDA growth as Netafim capitalizes on Mexichem's strong presence in Mexico, Brazil and other Latin American countries.
Netafim is collaborating with Mexichem to improve the Mexican company's existing water distribution business while also reaching new customers, he said.

Netafim recently launched its management system that ensures crops receive the right amount of water and fertilisers. ""It enables a farmer practically to grow his crops on his cellphone,"" Maidan said.

To unclog the developed world's most congested roads, the government will partner with private contractors and banks, both Israeli and foreign, marking a shift in policy after a series of transport projects were criticized for delays and mismanagement. 
Accountant General Rony Hizkiyahu, who oversees government spending, told Reuters the infrastructure push could double investment to some $16 billion a year.
Projects like a Tel Aviv subway, expanding Jerusalem's light rail system and construction of highways and toll roads are drawing interest from banks and global contractors. 
""These are companies that were never before interested in Israel. The moment you create this certainty, they are here,"" said Hizkiyahu, who declined to name the firms he has met.
Israel is a high-tech powerhouse but years of underinvestment and bungled state management have left its transport network lagging. Road traffic density, measured by the number of vehicles per kilometer of road, is three times the average among the 36 industrialized countries of the OECD. 
Road users lose on average an hour a day in traffic congestion, a hit to productivity that costs the economy about 1.5 percent of annual gross domestic product, according to the International Monetary Fund. That comes out at about $5 billion. Until a few months ago, the only train connecting Tel Aviv and Jerusalem still used a track built during the Ottoman Empire and the 57 km (35.42 mile) journey between Israel's two largest cities took nearly two hours.
A replacement has cost $2 billion to build and still isn't finished after 17 years. The 125-year-old Ottoman line was completed in around two years.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut the ribbon in late September, rushing to meet a promise to inaugurate the fast train by the Jewish holidays. But for now it runs only as far as Ben Gurion Airport, 23 km from Tel Aviv.
Commuters elsewhere in the country have meanwhile complained they have to cram into crowded trains and stand in bathrooms after the government borrowed carriages for the intercity trains from other lines. 
Most commuters still choose to drive or take the bus, causing major jams in and out of the cities. A designated fast lane on the final stretch of the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway costs $30 to use in rush hour.
Public transport does not operate on Friday evenings and Saturdays, the Jewish Sabbath, or on religious holidays, creating a strong incentive to own private vehicles.
PRIVATE SECTOR The new strategy, officials said, relies on the private sector to deliver efficiency. Last month, Israel chose Italy's Impresa Pizzarotti and local engineering firm Shapir (TA:SPEN) to build, fund and operate a new entry road into Jerusalem for more than $260 million. Bids for the $2.7 billion expansion of Jerusalem's light rail will be taken in the first quarter of 2019. The Finance Ministry has already screened groups that include Canada's Bombardier (TO:BBDb) and Greece's GEK Terna (AT:HRMr).
Until now the government has preferred to finance most projects through the state budget, giving it more control and access to cheaper financing than the private sector.
But that strategy has often backfired, said Lior Mentser, head of project finance and infrastructure at the country's biggest bank, Hapoalim (TA:POLI).
""It's double the time and money if the government does the project,"" he said.
With the $4.6 billion first line of the Tel Aviv metro delayed and over budget, the next two lines, a combined investment of $7.6 billion, will be built in partnership with the private sector. Bidding is open until the end of January.
Israel says it will now consider Public Private Partnerships (PPP) for all projects over 250 million shekels ($67 million). Mentser said foreign banks are learning the market, with many willing to participate in a syndicate of lenders but not yet as arrangers.
""Israel is an interesting market. The economy is strong and the government provides a higher safety net than in the rest of the world,"" said, citing guarantees offered for schemes such as toll roads where car numbers might fall short of projections. 
With only a limited number of Israeli institutional investors able to handle big projects, the sector is seeing growing interest from banks in Germany, Italy and Japan, said Ido Gonen, a director at  Deutsche Bank . 
""Israel's rail projects certainly have the right attributes and will attract international attention. Tel Aviv definitely will be attractive,"" he said. 
Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn) tested the waters a few years ago when it helped finance some of the cross-Israel toll highway.
But even the planned jump in investment may not help Israel catch up with other OECD members whose transport networks are more established and only require maintenance.

""Looking forward at the plans for the next 10 to 15 years, it doesn't seem that the scope of investment will manage to close the gap,"" said Bank of Israel economist Shay Tsur.

The S&P 500 futures rose 7 points or 0.28% to 2,691.0 as of 6:40 AM ET (11:40 GMT) while Dow futures rallied 80 points, or 0.32%, to 24,822.0. Meanwhile tech heavy Nasdaq 100 futures increased 26 points, or 0.40%, to 6,739.25.
Market sentiment was boosted after U.S. President Donald Trump’s economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the president is open to a deal with China but is ready to increase tariffs on Chinese imports if there is no progress in the talks.
“There’s a good possibility that we can make a deal, and (Trump) is open to it,” Kudlow said of Trump’s meeting on the sidelines of the G20 summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the end of the week.
Investors will also pay close attention to comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who speaks to the Economic Club of New York later today.
On Tuesday, Trump once again criticized Powell, whom he picked last year to lead the bank, and the Fed’s rate hikes, which he said were harming the economy.
“Whether the subject matter allows for policy insight remains to be seen, but any dovish nuances will be taken by some as further evidence that the Fed “put” is back in play following Mr Powell’s subtle tonal shift in mid-November,” Neil Mellor, senior currency strategist at BNY Mellon emailed in a research note.
Powell’s speech follows less dovish comments from Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida on Tuesday.
Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE:CRM) was among the top gainers in premarket trading, jumping 8.59% after its financial results came in higher than expected. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) rose 0.48%, while Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) inched up 0.32% and AMD gained 1.71%. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) was up 1.26% and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) increased 1.08%.
Elsewhere, Papa John's International Inc (NASDAQ:PZZA) stock slumped 1.49% after news that Trian Fund Management has decided to not pursue an acquisition of the company.

163,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2018 06:10AM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank Americas head expected to leave: sources,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank's (DE:DBKGn) head of the Americas, Tom Patrick, is likely to leave the bank, possibly by the end of the year, two people with knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday.
The change comes as Germany's largest lender restructures its U.S. business and struggles with regulators.
A U.S.-based spokeswoman for Patrick declined to comment.
 Deutsche Bank  has made a raft of senior management changes this year, including its chief executive officer, as the bank seeks to become profitable after three years of losses. 
Patrick was appointed under Deutsche's previous chief executive John Cryan. Deutsche has since announced plans to streamline its U.S. operations, and it has failed a U.S. Fed stress test.
Pressure is also growing on Sylvie Matherat, Deutsche's Frankfurt-based chief regulatory officer, amid growing internal criticism, said two people with knowledge of the matter. 
No move was expected, however, at the bank's next supervisory board meeting in early December, said one of the people. The supervisory board makes decisions on senior management changes.
A spokeswoman for Matherat declined to comment.
Last week, Matherat sought to distance Deutsche Bank from scandal-hit  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE), Denmark's largest bank, which is facing allegations of money laundering through its Estonia branch. 
Matherat said the German lender played only a secondary role as a so-called correspondent bank for Danske, limiting what it needed to know about the people behind the transactions.
The Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources, reported on Tuesday that Deutsche Bank was weighing a shakeup that could result in Matherat's departure.
Matherat had expressed unhappiness with what she described to some associates as constraints on improving financial-crime controls and mending Deutsche Bank's relationships with regulators, The Journal said.
Germany's financial watchdog - BaFin - has asked Deutsche Bank to provide information on its dealings with Danske, a person close to the matter said last week.
Christian Sewing became CEO in April with the mission of making the bank profitable again and improving its reputation after years of financial problems, as well as hefty fines for its role in the U.S. mortgage crisis and a trading scheme that allowed money laundering from Russia.
On balance, analysts expect Deutsche to post a net profit for 2018, its first since 2014, according to a consensus forecast report on the bank's website. But revenue is expected to decline this year and next.
Deutsche Bank's shares were down 0.5 percent at midday in Frankfurt, marking a 46 percent decline so far this year. 
The personnel debate comes even as some outsiders grow more confident in the board under Sewing.
""There was a tremendous degree of arrogance on Deutsche Bank's management board, but that's not the case now with Sewing and the others on the board,"" said a senior banker in Frankfurt. 

""I fully back them and even like them all,"" said the person, who competes with Deutsche Bank and is also a customer. ""They should be given the time they need to turn the bank around.""

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pepsi and Coca Cola are set to invest $1.4 billion in Pakistan in coming years, a statement from Prime Minister Imran Khan's office said, after executives from the two companies met with Khan.
Pepsi planned to make "" a further investment of $1.2 bln"" in next five years, Khan's office said on Wednesday, after the company's chief executive for Asia, Middle East and North Africa, Mike Spanos, led a Pepsi delegation that met Khan.
Coca Cola, which has a $500 million business already in Pakistan, also pledged a planned $200m investment in the coming two to three years, Khan's office added in a separate statement on Tuesday.
Coca Cola did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Pepsi could not be reached for comment.
Khan, who assumed power in August, has inherited a wobbly economy reeling from a ballooning current account deficit, which has prompted the government to seek loans from allies China and Saudi Arabia, as well as enter bailout talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 
But many consumer companies see Pakistan, the world's sixth most populous country, as a hot consumer market due to its fast-growing population of 208 million people.
Khan told the delegations that Pakistan was committed to facilitate businesses and investors in Pakistan, where 100 million people are below the age of 30.
""It is this youth bulge which we believe is attracting global companies in Pakistan along with the increasing affluence of the middle class,"" said Suleman Rafiq Maniya, head of research at local brokerage house Shajar Capital.
Pakistan's economy has been rising in recent years due to a sharp reduction in electricity blackouts and a steep drop in militant attacks, which was a major deterrent to foreign investment. China's pledge to loan $60 billion in infrastructure spending has also helped growth.
Despite this, growth, which hit 5.8 percent growth in 12 months to end of June, is due to fall below 5 percent in coming years, according to the IMF.

The IMF predicted in October that Pakistan's growth will slow to 4 percent in 2019 and fall to about 3 percent in the medium term.

PARIS (Reuters) - AXA (PA:AXAF), Europe's second-biggest insurer, expects its profitability to improve in the next two years thanks to U.S. business brought in by its new XL arm, and said it would now focus on expanding in Asia. 
The French insurer said profits should be boosted by its $15 billion acquisition of Bermuda-based XL earlier this year, which helped to broaden AXA's range of business. 
AXA also lifted its expected synergies from the XL acquisition to 500 million euros ($564 million) from 400 million, and raised its dividend payout range to between 50-60 percent from 45-55 percent.
Following the XL deal and the stock market listing of its U.S. operations, AXA is now looking to develop more in Asia in areas such as China, health insurance and its branch network.
The company has already hired a series of leading managers in the region, such as Gordon Watson, chief executive officer for Asia.
""In just nine months, Gordon has attracted some of the best leaders in Asia with significant local expertise to propel AXA to become the next insurer of choice in the region,"" AXA CEO Thomas Buberl said.
Buberl said last year that he wanted the company, the number two insurer in Europe after Germany's Allianz (DE:ALVG), to focus on six emerging countries, with four of them in Asia.
Even though Asia represents about half of the world insurance market's growth, ""AXA in Asia has underperformed over the past few years,"" Buberl said during a presentation to investors.
Earlier this month, the company said it had agreed to buy the 50 percent stake it didn't own in its Chinese unit AXA Tianping for 584 million euros.
AXA also raised on Wednesday its expected adjusted return on equity (ROE) to between 14-16 percent in 2019 and 2020, up from a previous target of 12-14 percent.
It confirmed its target for underlying earnings per share to rise by 3-7 percent a year over the same period and expressed flexibility over possible future share buybacks.
AXA shares were up 1.3 percent in early trading, as analysts welcomed AXA's latest financial targets.
""In our view, AXA are reassuring the market by raising adjusted ROE target of 14-16 percent and rewarding investors with a step-change in the payout ratio from the current 45-55 percent to 50-60 percent (we had forecasted 51 percent in 2020), more than exceeding our base case for the investor day,"" wrote analysts at Jefferies, which kept a ""buy"" rating on AXA.

172,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2018 05:15AM ET</span>",Asian firms set for first quarterly profit drop since mid-2016,"By Patturaja Murugaboopathy and Gaurav Dogra
(Reuters) - Holiday-quarter profit at Asian companies is likely to drop for the first time in more than two years, following a small rise in the July-September period, as slowing exports, falling factory output and the Sino-U.S. trade war take their toll.
Analysts expect profit to drop by an average 8 percent for about 2,000 Asian companies over October-December from a year ago, weighed down by slowing growth for firms in the technology, telecommunications and auto sectors, Refinitiv data shows. 
The last time things were so dire was the second quarter of 2016, when profit fell 9.4 percent as oil prices recovered from multi-year lows hit earlier that year, pressuring profit margins, a Reuters analysis of more than 5,000 firms showed.
""Fundamental risks that investors have anticipated since Q2 are starting to show in numbers,"" Mixo Das, a strategist at JP Morgan said, adding that signs of margin pressure were emerging.
Profit growth in the September quarter had slipped to 2.4 percent after a 15.7 percent rise in the first two quarters of the year, on an average.

The outlook for global growth in 2019 dimmed for the first time last month, according to Reuters polls of economists who said trade protectionism and tightening financial conditions would trigger the next downturn.
Markets worldwide are bracing for a chill.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) has slumped 14.6 percent so far this year, more than double the decline in the World index (MIWD00000PUS).
Analysts for Asian companies slashed their fourth-quarter and 2019 earnings expectations by 7.3 percent and 3.7 percent, respectively, in the last 90 days, Refinitiv data showed.
""Growth slowdown is coming from a very high base as 2017 was a year of recovery,"" said Frank Benzimra, head of Asia equity strategy at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), adding that companies are likely to cut their 2019 outlook after a disappointing fourth quarter.
The effects from higher tariffs and softer growth in China are more tangible in the fourth quarter, he said.
Graphic: Asian firms - profit growth by country: https://tmsnrt.rs/2PUjDwl
China and the United States have been locked in a debilitating trade war for months, in which the countries have imposed tit-fot-tat tariffs on billions of dollars of imports.
The effect has been felt most keenly by tech companies and firms that supply them with components, as well as auto makers who do not produce cars locally. 
Corporate earnings in Japan are expected to plunge by nearly a quarter over October-December, their first drop since early 2016, on slowing profit growth at telecom firms SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) and NTT Docomo Inc (T:9437) and the three top carmakers - Toyota (T:7203), Nissan (T:7201) and Honda (T:7267). 
Echoing a slowing economy, China corporate earnings growth is expected to fall 4.4 percent versus a 3.5 percent growth in the third quarter, as companies including tech giants Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700) and Baidu Inc (O:BIDU) register softening profits.
With oil (LCOc1) at its lowest in over a year, analysts expect energy firms' profits to come under pressure in the current quarter, taking away what was the brightest spot in the third quarter.

175,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2018 04:48AM ET</span>","Bangladesh factory safety group seeks to delay closure, flags lingering risks","By Zeba Siddiqui and Ruma Paul
DHAKA (Reuters) - A group set up by European fashion brands to improve factory safety in Bangladesh has sought a stay on a court order that calls for its local operations to end this week, its executive director said on Wednesday.
The group comprises more than 200 firms - including global clothing giants such as H&M (ST:HMb) and Zara-owner  Inditex  (MC:ITX) – who are signatories to the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh, formed after the Rana Plaza factory collapse in 2013, which killed more than 1,100 people.
The five-year pact was set to expire in May 2018 but its brand signatories agreed last year to extend it to 2021 to complete remaining safety fixes, while the Bangladesh government set up a national regulatory body to take over its work.
A High Court in Bangladesh in May, however, ordered the Accord to shut down by Nov. 30, following a petition filed by a local readymade garments supplier against the pact.
The group's inability to inspect factories through the agreement may prompt brands to cut ties with Bangladeshi suppliers, which would hit the country's economy, which is heavily reliant on garment exports.
""We have submitted an appeal to the Supreme Court...and are working to have a stay issued against the High Court judgment that would close down our office,"" Rob Wayss, the Accord's executive director told Reuters.
The appeal is likely to be heard on Thursday, a government official said, declining to be named as the information was not public. Shamsuzzaman Bhuiyan, head of the department of factory inspections at the labor ministry declined to comment, saying the matter was before the court. 
Low wages have helped Bangladesh build the world's second-largest garment industry, behind China, with some 4,000 factories employing about 4 million workers. The sector exports more than $30 billion worth of clothes a year, mainly to the United States and Europe.
Wayss said the group would move its work to its Amsterdam office if it is forced to shut down in Bangladesh, as the legally-binding contract signed between its brand members extends up to 2021.
However, moving operations out of Bangladesh would likely increase the Accord's costs and also harm suppliers, said Wayss. 
""Right now, they can come to the office any day of the week, we can review designs together, we can give them feedback,"" said Wayss. ""Our ability to do that when we don't have an office and infrastructure is reduced, so the industry is harmed.""
Bangladeshi Commerce Minister Tofail Ahmed told Reuters last week the Accord was no longer needed as the government's national regulatory body, the Remediation Coordination Cell, was able to do the job. 
However, Wayss said that body still has work to do before it is ready to fully police standards in the sector.

""It's in its infancy, they have just hired their staff, they really don't have their systems in place, their engineers need a lot of additional training just like ours did,"" he said, adding safety fixes at over 500 of the factories the Accord oversees are still incomplete.

176,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 28, 2018 04:20AM ET</span>",Mnuchin Asked About Fed Option That Could Avoid Rate Hikes,"(Bloomberg) -- Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin privately asked bond dealers and investors in October whether they want the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy by raising interest rates or through faster cuts in its securities portfolio, six people familiar with the matter said.
Mnuchin’s question could be seen as suggesting a way for the central bank to accomplish its goal of preventing a strong economy from overheating without triggering the ire of President Donald Trump, who has blasted Fed Chairman Jerome Powell for raising rates. For his part, Mnuchin has refrained from commenting on monetary policy, citing the importance of the Fed’s independence.
In an Oct. 30 meeting with a Treasury advisory committee that makes recommendations to the government quarterly on its debt sales, Mnuchin asked which they favored -- an accelerated balance sheet run-down or further rate hikes -- if they had to choose one or the other, according to the six people, who asked not to be identified because the conversation was private. One of the people said that Mnuchin asked the question out of curiosity of what bond market participants thought of the two alternatives before the Fed.
The committee was split in response, two of the people said.
Mnuchin raised the question during a regularly scheduled quarterly meeting with the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee, or TBAC, which includes representatives from investment funds and banks. Its members include executives from  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., Citadel LLC and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).
The TBAC provides the secretary a chance to engage with bond market participants to help inform debt management plans, a Treasury spokesman said, declining to elaborate further.
Trump’s Nominee
Trump has broken with decades of precedent by commenting on Fed policy with repeated attacks on the central bank’s rate increases. He has also recently blamed Mnuchin for recommending Powell for the job, two people familiar with the president’s thinking said.
Still, Mnuchin hasn’t been the target of any direct, public criticism from Trump and, despite reports he may leave the Treasury Department as part of a broader Cabinet shakeup, is likely to stay in the administration for now, according to people familiar with the plans.
On Monday, Trump told the Wall Street Journal that “the Fed right now is a much bigger problem than China,” which is locked in a trade war with the U.S. He also seemed to widen his criticism of the Fed to include its ongoing balance-sheet reduction. “I don’t like what they’re doing,” the president said. “I don’t like the $50 billion.”
The Fed is currently reducing the bond holdings on its $4.1 trillion balance sheet by a maximum of $50 billion per month -- $30 billion of Treasuries and $20 billion of government agency debt and mortgage-backed securities.
Fed watchers voiced skepticism that the independent central bank would change its monetary strategy along the lines Mnuchin talked about, noting that Powell and his colleagues are much more comfortable altering interest rates to steer the economy than they are tinkering with the balance sheet. Fed officials have repeatedly said the target range for the federal funds rate -- not the balance sheet -- is their main tool for setting policy.
Any acceleration in the balance sheet unwind wouldn’t be without consequences for the Treasury either, given that part of the government’s increased debt issuance has been a result of the central bank’s waning purchases.
Powell, whom Mnuchin meets regularly to discuss economic issues, has described gradual rate increases as an effort to strike a balance between tightening credit too much, thus triggering a recession, and not enough, subsequently spurring inflation and asset-price bubbles.
December FOMC
The central bank is widely expected to boost rates by another quarter percentage point next month. But the path in 2019 is less clear.
Powell himself laid out a scenario earlier this month for a pause in the rate hiking campaign sometime next year by highlighting potential headwinds to the U.S. economy.
The Fed in October 2017 began its program to methodically shrink its balance sheet by allowing some of the bonds it holds to mature without reinvesting the proceeds. It started off small, with bond drawdowns initially limited to $10 billion per month, and then gradually raised that to the current $50 billion maximum.
Paring the portfolio puts some upward pressure on long-term interest rates by adding to the supply of bonds that investors must absorb. It thus effectively tightens financial conditions and acts as a drag on economic growth, just as increases in short-term interest rates do.
But it’s much less visible and has attracted little attention outside of the financial markets since it was launched. Indeed, several Fed officials have said that their aim was to make the balance sheet unwind the equivalent of “watching paint dry.”
Powell told reporters in June that the program was “proceeding smoothly” and evinced little desire to change it. The balance sheet has shrank $354 billion since the plan began.

177,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2018 04:15AM ET</span>","Brazil stocks to surf far-right wave past 100,000; Mexico lags: Reuters poll","By Bruno Federowski
BRASILIA (Reuters) - As a year marked by pivotal presidential elections across Latin America wraps up, a familiar strategy is gaining favor in equity trading desks: buy Brazil, sell Mexico.
The latest Reuters poll showed Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index (BVSP) extending this year's rally into 2019 to end the year at 107,500, according to the median of 10 forecasts from traders and strategists.
If their prediction that the index will end this year at 92,000 proves true, that would represent a 17 percent yearly increase in 2019, totaling a nearly 150 percent rally since the end of 2015.
In comparison, Mexico's S&P/BVM IPC index would end 2018 at 45,100 and then rise 11 percent next year to 50,000, delivering a return just slightly exceeding the nation's benchmark 8 percent interest rate.
That would continue this year's divergent trend for both countries, which led poll respondents to raise their end-2018 Brazil stocks forecast since the previous poll, taken in August, and cut Mexico's.
""The performance of the past few weeks is a taste of what we expect for LatAm equities in 2019,"" strategists at Itaú BBA wrote in a report. ""Our discussion of the individual LatAm markets is increasingly relevant given the highly divergent paths followed by these markets since October 1.""
The comments highlight how leftist and rightist victories in the Mexican and Brazilian presidential elections, respectively, have once again tipped the scales of investment between Latin America's two largest markets -- which often compete for investors looking for Latin American exposure.
The Brazilian index is up nearly 12 percent this year after far-right lawmaker Jair Bolsonaro, who has named a University of Chicago-trained banker as his prospective Economy Minister tasked with plugging a ballooning budget deficit, won the vote.
Brazil's recovery from its deepest recession in decades, though slow and underwhelming, underpinned those gains, particularly as the central bank drove interest rates to all-time lows.
Shares of state-owned companies, such as oil firm Petróleo Brasileiro SA (SA:PETR4), lender Banco do Brasil SA (SA:BBAS3) and privatization target Centrais Elétricas Brasileiras SA (SA:ELET3), have been among the largest gainers as part of a wider politics-driven bet.
Yet addressing Brazil's fiscal woes would require that Bolsonaro negotiate an unpopular overhaul of the nation's costly pension reform with a fragmented Congress. Contradictory statements from Bolsonaro's own team mean that is hardly a done deal.
The Itaú economists acknowledged the continuation of the stocks rally will depend on that success. ""If the reform effort stalls, the perception of fiscal unsustainability will likely affect asset prices, jeopardizing the recovery in economic activity,"" they wrote.
In contrast, the Mexican stock index fell 20 percent this year, most of which took place in the last two months. Many respondents who usually participate in the poll, in fact, declined to respond this time as they were still revising their forecasts in the wake of the sharp slump.
The main trigger for the selloff was the cancellation of a partly-built new airport in Mexico City by President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador. Obrador decided to heed the results of an informal referendum that called for abandoning the current project in which billions of dollars have already been invested.
His team plans to conduct a public consultation - the second of its kind - on a variety of subjects including a new refinery, in a perceived policy misstep to investors looking for an agenda of fiscal austerity and deregulation.
Mexico's central bank earlier this month warned that the incoming government's policies risked fanning inflation and raised interest rates to a nearly 10-year high.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Investors see value in Toronto's commodity-linked stock market and expect it to rebound in 2019 as the global economy continues to grow and on hopes for the price of Canadian heavy crude to recover, a Reuters poll shows.
The median forecast of 28 portfolio managers and strategists polled was for a more than 9 percent increase in the S&P/TSX composite index from its Monday close to 16,425 by the end of 2019. The TSE dipped 0.3 percent to 14,967 on Tuesday. 
Of 10 investors who answered a separate question on the index's valuation, six said it was cheap and four said it was fairly valued. None said it was expensive.
""We view the equity market in Canada to be attractively valued not only against its own history but also relative to the S&P 500 Index,"" said Philip Petursson, chief investment strategist at Manulife Investments.
The price-earnings ratio, a measure of valuation, for the TSX is 14.2, according to Refinitiv Eikon data, much less than the 18.6 price multiple for the S&P 500. 
Toronto's index has declined 9.5 percent since it notched a record high of 16,586.46 in July as a slump in oil prices, rising global trade tensions and higher bond yields offset a boost to sentiment from a deal to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement. Since the start of the year, the index is down more than 7 percent. 
Investors expect economic growth to remain strong enough for companies to continue to increase profits even if some expect earnings growth to be slower.
""We are staying quite positive for the coming quarters,"" said Mathieu D'Anjou, a senior economist at Desjardins Securities. ""Profit levels are high and we are expecting a generally positive economic context next year and a rebound in Canadian and international oil prices.""
The price of oil has slumped more than 30 percent since October while a large discount for Canadian heavy crude has added to the headwinds for Canada's energy sector.
Western Canadian Select (WCS) traded last month as much as $52.50 per barrel below West Texas Intermediate light oil, the biggest differential in data going back to 2010, according to Shorcan Energy Brokers. The discount has since narrowed to about $37.
""If energy differentials can narrow we could see another move higher in the energy group,"" said Greg Taylor, a portfolio manager at Purpose Investments. ""Energy stocks look attractive at these levels as the companies continue to improve their operations in the low price environment.""
The energy sector has fallen 22 percent since the start of the year, while financials, which account for about one-third of the weight of the TSX, have declined 7 percent. U.S. crude was up 0.7 percent to $52.03 on Tuesday. 
Competition for deposits among Canada's biggest banks is heating up for the first time since the global financial crisis, leading to higher funding costs that could crimp profit growth in their domestic businesses over the next two years, analysts said.
The Bank of Canada has been raising interest rates to help cool the domestic economy, which has been operating near capacity. But auto production, one of the country's biggest industries, could be hurt after General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said on Monday it would close its plant in Oshawa, Ontario, east of Toronto.
Still, Canada's housing market has not had the hard landing some investors have feared and the federal government announced measures last week that could help make businesses more competitive at a time when the United States is aggressively cutting taxes.
Ottawa will reduce the average overall tax rate in Canada on new business investment to 13.8 percent from 17.0 percent, the lowest level in the Group of Seven large industrialized nations.

182,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2018 02:15AM ET</span>",Auditor had questioned Nissan on payments to Ghosn at heart of scandal: source,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co’s (T:7201) auditor had repeatedly questioned transactions at the heart of allegations of financial misconduct by former chief Carlos Ghosn but Nissan said they were proper, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday.
Ernst & Young ShinNihon LLC questioned Nissan's management several times, chiefly around 2013, about purchases of overseas luxury homes for Ghosn’s personal use and of stock-appreciation rights that were conferred on him.
But the Japanese automaker said the transactions and financial reporting were appropriate, the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
The revelation shows Nissan and its auditor were discussing the transactions, in apparent contrast with Nissan’s contention that the alleged misreporting of benefits for Ghosn was masterminded by Ghosn and a key lieutenant.
A spokesman for EY ShinNihon, the Japanese affiliate of global accounting firm Ernst & Young, said he could not comment on specific cases. A Nissan spokesman declined to comment.
Ghosn was arrested on Nov. 19 as he arrived in Japan. Prosecutors accuse him of falsifying Nissan’s annual reports to understate by about half his total compensation of some 10 billion yen ($90 million) over several years. 
The high-profile former executive has denied the allegations, according to Japanese media. Ghosn remains in custody and is unable to speak publicly. He is represented by former prosecutor Motonari Otsuru, according to Japanese media.
Otsuru’s law firm declined to comment on Wednesday, and Otsuru has not responded to requests for comment.
Nissan has largely pinned the blame on Ghosn and Greg Kelly, a former representative director who was arrested along with Ghosn on the same allegations.
“As a result of the investigation, we are certain these two are the masterminds,” CEO Hiroto Saikawa told a news conference on Nov. 19, referring to Ghosn and Kelly. He declined to say whether others at Nissan were involved in the alleged wrongdoing. An internal investigation is ongoing, and Nissan says it is cooperating with prosecutors.
Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211) have removed Ghosn as chairman in the wake of his arrest. The French member of the three-firm alliance,  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), retains him as chairman and CEO.
EY ShinNihon questioned Nissan management about Zi-A Capital BV, asking whether the Dutch unit - which purchased the overseas homes for Ghosn's use - was conducting business in line with its stated aim as an investment company, said the source, who is not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. 
The car maker said Zi-A was conducting its business appropriately, the source said. Japanese media have valued the transactions at more than 2 billion yen.
Similarly, the source said, the auditor asked whether the stock-appreciation rights – which are like stock options but pay out in cash if a share rises to a certain price – should be declared, but Nissan replied that was not necessary. Japanese media say the rights were worth some 4 billion yen.

EY ShinNihon had been auditor for Toshiba Corp (T:6502) and Olympus Corp (T:7733) during financial scandals at the two Japanese companies in recent years. The auditor’s questioning of Nissan on the transactions was first reported by Japanese public broadcaster NHK.

183,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2018 02:10AM ET</span>","Old habits die hard: European equity traders still prefer the dark, defy Mifid","By Josephine Mason
LONDON (Reuters) - Tough rules aimed at boosting European equity trading volumes on regulated public exchanges appear to have failed a crucial test, data shows, undermining regulators' efforts to raise transparency almost one year after the reforms were introduced. 
In March, the European Union's Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, or MiFID II, introduced temporary caps - on trading volumes in dark pools - non-transparent venues where trades do not contribute to price formation.
They applied to more than 600 stocks including the majority of European and FTSE 100 index components.
Regulators had hoped the curbs would be enough of a slap on the wrist to deter investors for good and trading would remain in so-called 'lit exchanges' -- where prices and trades are clearly visible - even after the limits expired in September.
But data compiled by brokerage Rosenblatt Securities and seen by Reuters shows the market has returned to its old habits, with trading volume shifting almost immediately back to dark pools.
In February, the first full month before the caps took effect, dark multilateral trading facilities (MTFs)- alternative dealing systems born from the first iteration of MiFID - accounted for 4.51 percent of consolidated turnover across Europe.
In the month before the first set of caps expired, dark pools traded just 2.16 percent of volume in banned stocks.
But in the month after the caps were lifted, dark pool market share for capped stocks had more than doubled to 5.13 percent, while lit venues for capped stocks lost 349 basis points to 33.04 percent and periodic auctions fell by almost half to 1.17 percent on the same basis.
Trading at over-the-counter (OTC) and bank-run trading venues called systematic internalizers (SI) grew a combined 256 basis points on the same basis, but inconsistent trade-reporting practices make this data unreliable, the Rosenblatt report said.
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), which designed and implemented the reforms, declined to comment on the report.
The findings undermine Brussels' ambitious plan to reduce trading ""in the dark"" and boost transparency, revealing for the first time that investors are adjusting to the reforms and still flocking to private venues.
""Our analysis of trading data before and after (the expiry) suggests that the caps have not dampened appetites for non-displayed venues or achieved European policymakers' goal of growing lit-exchange market share,"" said the report.
Many market participants argue that the less transparent venues offer a helpful service for large investors who want to avoid prices moving against them when executing big trades.
For this reason, large blocks of shares are exempt from the caps.
Trading volumes also show a jump in dark pool activity after the caps were lifted. Last month's dramatic sell-off boosted turnover in equities across the region, but dark pools' volumes saw an outsized bounce.
The share of trading on lit exchanges hit 931.6 billion euro ($1.06 trillion) in October, up 36 percent from September, according to data from Refinitiv's Market Share Reporter.
Dark pool turnover soared by 59 percent to 62.1 billion euro from a month earlier, its highest since February. 
(GRAPHIC - Dark vs Light: Investors return to dark pools - https://tmsnrt.rs/2RiErtU) 
WHIPLASH
The data also has exposed the flaws in the design of the legislation, which lawyers and experts say is too blunt an instrument to deal with a complex, nuanced market structure.
Most criticism is aimed at so-called double volume caps: over a rolling 12-month period, just 4 percent of total trading in an individual stock can take place in any dark pool, whilst trading in any share across dark pools is limited to 8 percent of total volume.
Once those quotas are exceeded, trading in that security in dark pools is banned for six months.
Investors switching in and out of the dark pools as those limits are imposed and lifted creates market ""whiplash"", said Nathaniel Lalone, partner at Katten Muchin Rosenman UK LLP.
""The design of the caps seems to be creating a see-saw effect that will likely move many stocks in and out of dark MTF every 10-12 months,"" said the Rosenblatt report by vice presidents Anish Puaar and Alex Kemmsies and managing director Justin Schack.
They said the data highlights how the market prefers the lower execution fees in dark pools compared with exchanges. Regulatory scrutiny of periodic auctions and SIs may be deterring some traders from using them, they said.
If see-saw trading volumes are sustained, lawyers and experts say regulators may have to adjust the model to disincentivize investors from returning to the dark pools.
""If it becomes clear the system as it was intended isn't working, then they (the regulators) have to stop it,"" said Lalone.
""The aim might be right, but the lived reality might not be.""
The European Commission could extend the period of the timeout for banned stocks to deter investors for longer or adopt rules that are more in line with Canada and Australia where legislators opted for rules that required a big price or size improvement in dark markets, experts said.
""Absent the push to have trading on non-dark mechanisms, people fall back into old habits,"" said Lalone.
The Commission is due to submit a report to the European Parliament on the impact of the volume cap mechanism, among other aspects of the rules, by March 3 2019, according to MiFID legislation.
""Brexit preparations may cause this review to be shunted down the list of European regulators' priorities. Nevertheless, regulators will have an opportunity to tweak the rules,"" the Rosenblatt report said.
Earlier this month, ESMA said it would look at the growth in periodic auctions - closed intra-day auctions on exchanges - and asked for market feedback by Jan. 11.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's stock market will post small gains by the end of this year in the absence of more Western sanctions, but the theme of penalties and global trade conflict are likely to dominate the mood next year, a Reuters poll found.
Russian financial markets have proved vulnerable to U.S. sanctions and threats of more curbs to punish Moscow for what Washington calls ""malign activities."" 
Polled by Reuters before the latest tensions between Russia and Ukraine, analysts saw some upside for the Russian market, arguing that the inevitability of more sanctions being imposed this year had faded.
The rouble-based MOEX stock index (IMOEX) is seen ending this year at 2,440 points, according to the median forecast of eight analysts polled by Reuters.
That is almost six percent above Monday's close of 2,308.5, and closer to the upper boundary of the forecast range of 2,250 to 2,480 points. It is also above the year-end level of 2,230 predicted in the previous quarterly stock poll. 
""We expect a slow rise, a New Year mini-rally,"" said Dmitry Alexandrov, an analyst at Univer Capital.
""The main risks are an inability of OPEC-plus allies to reach a deal at the Dec. 6 meeting and a further drop in Brent crude prices to $50 per barrel,"" said Alexandrov.
OPEC meets in Vienna on Dec. 6 to discuss output policy together with some non-OPEC producers, including Russia.
Brent crude futures, a benchmark for Russia's key exports, have fallen around 20 percent since the previous Reuters stocks poll in late August (LCOc1).
A summit of 20 members of the group of industrialized nations due in Argentina later this week is also in focus. U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are set to meet there and are likely to discuss global trade.
TRADE WAR
The trade war may continue, which will put pressure on the global economy, said Viktor Veselov, an analyst at Globex Bank.
""This is the key theme for the rest of 2018,"" he said.
The dollar-based RTS index (IRTS) was predicted at 1,160 points by the end of this year, the poll showed, with forecasts ranging from 1,050 to 1,215. RTS closed Monday at 1,084.
Looking forward, analysts warn next year may bring respite to the market, given Russian economic growth is expected to slow to 1.2-1.7 percent in 2019 from 1.5-2.0 percent expected this year, according to the central bank's forecast.
""It is better to focus on companies' shares that offer nice dividend yields and are less vulnerable to risks of a cooldown in the global economy and commodity markets, that can also partly hedge risks of a further rouble weakening,"" said Eugeny Loktyukhov, an analyst at Promsvyazbank.
Among such companies Loktykhov mentioned are giant Gazprom (MM:GAZP), diamond maker Alrosa (MM:ALRS) and shares in largest lenders Sberbank (MM:SBER) and VTB (MM:VTBR) that look undervalued compared with their global peers.
Since the analysts were consulted, several European politicians have raised the possibility of sanctions over Russia's capturing of three Ukrainian vessels, a move the West fears could ignite a wider conflict.

Stock markets are up for a third day in a row, setting the scene for the first monthly gain since July.
Volatility on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index has been on a downward trajectory and is currently sitting at a level not seen in seven weeks -- basically before the major sell-off that happened in the U.S. Chinese assets have also been the calmest in months: the yuan is the least volatile since December, and the Shanghai Composite Index is the most placid since May.
So where’s this sense of peace coming from? Simple: the big dinner that Donald Trump and Xi Jinping will have on Saturday in Buenos Aires. That’s really what everyone’s waiting for. This marks a pivotal moment in the escalating trade war between the world’s two largest economies.
But before you get your hopes up, it’s worth mentioning that some investors are staying cautious ahead of the big day. To Ronald Wan, chief executive at Partners Capital International Ltd., investors don’t have big expectations for a major breakthrough at the meeting.
“The slightly-better performance in some markets lacks fundamental support,” he said, adding that the absence of development in trade so far has contributed to the low-volatility environment. “Investors aren’t convinced that the market will make a turnaround.”
Larry Kudlow has said the U.S. president is hopeful for a breakthrough with Xi, but reiterated that he is ready to impose more tariffs if the upcoming talks don’t yield progress.

"
189,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2018 12:20AM ET</span>",Election fog clouds Indian stocks' outlook: Reuters poll,"By Vivek Mishra and Indradip Ghosh
BENGALURU (Reuters) - The outlook for Indian stocks for 2019 has been downgraded for the first time this year, according to a Reuters poll of strategists who expect the market to recoup its recent losses only once uncertainty around next year's elections fade.
Pressured by a steep sell-off in global equities along with dwindling credit supply, India's main stock index, the BSE Sensex (BSESN), has fallen about 10 percent since hitting a life-high of 38,989.65 on August 29.
October was its worst monthly decline since the financial crisis a decade ago.
With state elections slated over coming months and a general election scheduled for May, Indian shares could remain subdued until the results become clear, according to a Nov 13-26 poll of 50 strategists.
""The political uncertainty plus the correction in global stocks can take the local market down in the short-term and once these concerns go away, we can expect it to recoup most of the losses,"" said CA Rudramurthy, managing director at Vachana Investments.
Yet even by the middle of next year the BSE Sensex is forecast to have regained only about half its recent losses to trade at 37,000 from Tuesday's close of 35,513.14. 
While it is expected to rise to a new record high of 39,400 by end of next year, thanks to strong corporate earnings, the strategists lowered 2019 predictions in the latest poll, the first downgrade in Reuters surveys this year. The August poll had a median forecast of 41,200 as the record-high.
Over 60 percent of 26 common contributors from the previous poll cut end-2019 forecasts and two did not make any change. Only eight were more optimistic.
The less bullish forecasts for next year underscored anxiety over a range of factors including the elections, the rupee currency's sharp losses this year, capital outflows from emerging markets including India, and a tussle over policy between the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the government.
The rupee has lost about 10 percent this year making it Asia's worst performing major currency.
The RBI board's decision on November 19 to ease liquidity conditions by giving banks more time to shore up capital and increase lending to small businesses, in addition to open market operations, has helped the rupee gain about 2 percent since then.
""Keeping aside the political uncertainty, markets have already corrected significantly, recovery in corporate earnings and strong macro-economic factors will push the index further up as the dust will settle around the liquidity situation probably next year,"" Vachana Investments' Rudramurthy said.
STRETCHED VALUATIONS?
Over 80 percent of 45 equity strategists who answered an extra question said company earnings growth has not yet peaked in India, though there are signs the pace will slow over the next year.
""The long wait on earnings growth is finally coming to an end, as they are expected to grow above 20 percent in 2018 and 2019, though the expectations have been somewhat moderated in the second half of the year,"" said Kunal Kundu, India economist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
Given many companies have missed profit estimates over the last four years and several have lowered their outlook for last quarter, a significant pickup in earnings growth is unlikely, some strategists said.
Seven respondents also said company earnings growth has already peaked.
""The downside risks to earnings estimates have increased over the past two months, given the liquidity concerns, the rising cost of funds and input cost inflation,"" noted Gautam Duggal, head of research at Motilal Oswal.
The price-to-earnings ratio - a widely used measure for stock valuation - for the BSE Sensex is currently well above its long-term average.
And despite a sharp fall in recent months, nearly two-thirds of 47 strategists who answered a separate question said Indian shares were expensive. While 17 analysts said they were fairly priced only one said they were cheap.
""Domestically, concerns over the scale of balance sheet problems in the shadow banking sector will rumble on for a while yet. And even with the recent slump, valuations continue to look stretched,"" said Shilan Shah, senior India economist at Capital Economics.

191,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2018 09:42PM ET</span>",Trump threatens to cut GM subsidies in retaliation for U.S. job cuts,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump threatened on Tuesday to eliminate subsidies for General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) in retaliation for the automaker cutting U.S. jobs and plants, and the automaker also took fire from Canadian political and labor leaders for cutbacks there.
""The U.S. saved General Motors, and this is the THANKS we get! We are now looking at cutting all @GM subsidies, including ... for electric cars,"" Trump said on Twitter.
Trump did not explain what ""subsidies"" he was referring to. 
GM electric vehicles are eligible for a $7,500 tax credit under federal law, but it is not clear how the administration could restrict those credits or if Trump had other subsidies in mind. 
Trump's harsh words rattled investors, who bid down GM shares by 2.6 percent on Tuesday after sending them up on Monday in response to the automaker's cost-cutting.
Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau ""discussed their disappointment in the announced closures of General Motors plants in their respective countries"" during a phone call on Tuesday, White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said. 
The wrath of the leaders of the United States and Canada dramatized the challenges GM and its Detroit rivals will face as they restructure to cope with the most dramatic technology and market shifts in decades.
Trump has made boosting auto jobs a key priority during his almost two years in office and has often attacked automakers on Twitter for not doing enough to boost U.S. employment.
The Republican president on Tuesday escalated his attacks on GM's plan to cut 15,000 jobs and mothball five North American factories, including four in the United States. Among those four is a car factory in northeast Ohio, a state critical to victory in the 2020 presidential campaign.
GM said in a statement following Trump's comments that it was ""committed to maintaining a strong manufacturing presence"" in the United States after investing $22 billion in operations here since 2009 and will add new jobs in electrification and autonomous vehicles.
The cuts will ""position the company for long-term success and maintain and grow American jobs,"" GM said, adding that many workers at impacted plants will be able to move to other GM factories.
GM Chief Executive Mary Barra spoke to Trump over the weekend to discuss the cuts and was at the White House on Monday to meet with economic adviser Larry Kudlow.
Kudlow told reporters on Tuesday that the administration had helped GM with fuel efficiency standards and other regulations.
""We’ve done this to help you and I think his disappointment is, it seems like that they kind of turned his back on him,"" Kudlow said.
It was not the first time that Trump made threats against a U.S. company. In June he threatened Harley Davidson with higher taxes after the motorcycle maker announced it would move some production overseas. Trump has also threatened to take action against Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), saying repeatedly in April, without providing evidence, that the online retailer was not paying the U.S. Postal Service a fair rate and saying that he would look at policies to address what he said were Amazon's unfair business advantages.
Trump has not followed up on these threats.
WORKERS DISCUSSING ""MASS ACTIONS""
Trump also criticized GM for not closing facilities in Mexico or China. 
""General Motors made a big China bet years ago when they built plants there (and in Mexico) - don’t think that bet is going to pay off. I am here to protect America’s Workers!"" Trump wrote on Twitter.
GM currently builds just one vehicle in China that it exports to the United States, the Buick Envision, and had sold about 22,000 through September. GM sold nearly 2.7 million vehicles in China through September, nearly all built in China. 
White House spokesman Sarah Sanders told reporters on Tuesday that the president is looking at options. 
""The president wants to see American companies build cars here in America not build them overseas and he is hopeful that GM will continue to do that here,"" she said.
GM has been lobbying Congress, along with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, to lift the current cap on electric vehicles eligible for tax credits, but any action by Congress before 2019 is a long shot, congressional aides said.
Currently, once a manufacturer sells 200,000 electric vehicles, the tax credit phases out starting in the following quarter. GM has said it expects to hit the 200,000-vehicle threshold by the end of the year. Tesla hit the cap in July. 
In Canada, workers returned to the assembly line at General Motors' Oshawa, Ontario, plant on Tuesday, as their union president met with Trudeau and said he was ready for ""mass actions"" at GM facilities. GM said on Monday that the Oshawa plant would close in December 2019. ""We're dealing with a corporation that doesn't have any respect for Canadian and American workers, and I think we should treat them in the same vein,"" said Jerry Dias, national president of Unifor, which represents GM workers in Canada. Dias said he would meet with the United Auto Workers on Wednesday and discuss the possibility of ""mass actions"" in GM plants across the two countries. 
Democrats are seizing on the plant closing and have repeatedly attacked Republicans in the past two days for giving large companies a tax cut.
Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer on Tuesday criticized Trump for ""overpromising"" as a candidate about protecting against plant closures if he was elected. “GM pocketed the tax break we gave them and are closing up shop anyway, with nary a word from the president until after the fact,” Schumer said.

GM declined to comment on Schumer’s remarks.

192,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2018 09:38PM ET</span>",Growth and trade worries to keep a lid on European stocks in 2019: Reuters poll,"By Danilo Masoni
MILAN (Reuters) - European shares will move in a tight range going into the year-end and throughout 2019, a Reuters poll showed, as slowing growth, political risks and worries over Washington's protectionist policies keep investors on the sidelines.
European and euro zone indices have fallen 8-10 percent so far this year, lagging Wall Street, as analysts have been slashing their earnings growth forecasts amid a weakening economic outlook and tensions over Italy's budget.
The pan-European STOXX 600 benchmark index is expected to reach 365 points by year-end, according to the poll of 27 brokers, fund managers and analysts, 1.9 percent above Monday's close of 358 points but 6.2 percent down on the year. 
The Euro STOXX 50 index of top companies is expected to reach 3,250 points by the year-end, 2.4 percent above Tuesday's close of 3,172 points but down 7.2 percent on the year.
""Compared to U.S. stocks nobody really wants too much of a risk exposure to euro zone equities as Brexit uncertainty and a possible trade war with the U.S. are continuing to spook investors,"" said Markus Huber, a trader at City of London Markets.
""Short-term bounces are always possible and likely but a complete turnaround won't be possible until there is less uncertainty prevailing in the markets,"" he added.
The poll was taken between Nov. 19-26 when world stocks tested lows hit at the end of October following a brutal sell-off that wiped off trillions of dollars of market caps.
The latest forecasts are weaker than in the previous August poll, which forecast the STOXX 600 climbing to 400 points by end-2018 and Euro STOXX 50 hitting 3,575 points.
At the time European corporate earnings were expected to rise more than 6 percent in 2018 but growth expectations have since been scaled back to a rate of below 5 percent.
""We do not see euro zone equities performing next year as (we) expect the earnings cycle to continue to deteriorate,"" said Stephane Ekolo, strategist at Tradition in London. 
On top of that, the normalization of monetary policy by the European Central Bank, which is seen ending its massive 2.6 trillion-euro monetary stimulus scheme at the end of this year, is unlikely to provide any support. 
""Investors are already pricing the end of the ECB easing policy, mostly anticipated for the end of 2019, which will give a boost to the euro currency, putting even more pressure on stocks,"" said Guy Foster, head of research at Brewin Dolphin. 
Relatively cheap valuations for some euro zone companies however could provide support, even though European benchmarks are expected to remain next year well below the highs hit earlier in 2018.
On price-to-earnings multiples, the STOXX 600 trades at a 17 percent discount to the S&P 500, well above the 20-year average gap of 12 percent. 
""(The outlook) is mixed because valuation multiples are cheap but there is little momentum,"" said Marco Vailati, head of research at Italy's Cassa Lombarda.
According to the poll, the Euro STOXX 50 is seen reaching 3,325 points in 2019, up 2.3 percent on the year, while the STOXX 600 is expected to reach 373 points, up 2.2 percent.
Among domestic markets, Italy's FTSE MIB, which has been hit hard by worries over Rome's spending plans, is seen at 19,000 points by end-2018, down 1.2 percent from Monday's close, before rising to 19,056 at the end of next year. 
The exporter-heavy German DAX index is seen reaching 11,670 points this year and 11,850 points in 2019, while France's CAC is expected to hit 5,139 points this year and 5,300 points the next. 
Investors also said much of Europe's performance will depend on Wall Street. ""This means if the U.S. recovers, euro zone stocks will recover too but to a lesser degree,"" said City of London's Huber.

193,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 27, 2018 09:21PM ET</span>",Asian Stocks Rise on Hopes of U.S.-China Trade Truce; Powell’s Speech in Focus,"Investing.com - Asian stocks rose in morning trade on Wednesday as market sentiment was boosted by hopes for a thaw in the U.S.-China trade war.
U.S. National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said Tuesday the White House was having ""a lot of communication with the Chinese government at all levels"" and that President Donald Trump thinks there is a “good possibility” the two countries could reach an agreement.
“As you can imagine this is a big deal, this meeting -- the stakes are very high,” Kudlow said. “It’s an opportunity to turn a new page, a breakthrough. President Xi can step up and come up with some new ideas for us.”
Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are expected to meet on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Buenos Aires on Saturday.
In Asia, China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component were up 0.9% and 1.3% by 9:45 PM ET (02:45 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index also gained 0.9%.
Meanwhile, Trump renewed his criticism of the Federal Reserve and said he is “not even a little bit happy” with his selection of Jerome Powell. In an interview with the Washington Post, Trump said he thinks the U.S. central bank is ""way off-base with what they're doing.""
""I'm doing deals and I'm not being accommodated by the Fed,"" Trump told the Post. ""They're making a mistake because I have a gut and my gut tells me more sometimes than anybody else's brain can ever tell me.""
Powell is due to deliver a speech later in the day as markets look forward to hints on future rate hike paths.
“In our view, the likelihood that Powell will signal that the Fed is preparing to stop and take a timeout on rates is very low,” said Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI. Guha added that the speech “may be the most consequential of his tenure to date.”
The speech, to be delivered shortly after noon ET at the Economic Club of New York, “will continue the process of softening the Fed’s message,” he said.
The Fed hiked rates three times this year and is expected to raise rates one more time. Trump has repeatedly argued these rate hikes were hurting the U.S. economy, and that the recent stock market sell-off and General Motors (NYSE:GM)' plans to close plants and cut more than 14,000 jobs were due to the Fed’s aggressive rate hike plans.
Elsewhere in Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 traded 1.0% higher, and South Korea’s KOSPI inched up 0.1%.
Down under, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.1%.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian shares dithered on Wednesday and the dollar jumped to a near 1-1/2-year top as risk assets rowed back amid conflicting signals on prospects for de-escalating the Sino-U.S. trade dispute.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan see-sawed between positive and negative territory and last was flat. Australian and South Korean stocks were both down 0.2 percent.
Japan's Nikkei gained 0.7 percent. Chinese indices shed small early gains. The blue-chip index was flat.
Asian markets had slipped on Tuesday after U.S. President Donald Trump told the Wall Street Journal it was ""highly unlikely"" he would accept China's request to hold off on a planned increase in tariffs to 25 percent from 10 percent.
However, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow sought to brighten the mood by confirming a dinner powwow between Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at an coming G20 gathering in Argentina. He also held open the possibility that the two countries would reach a trade deal.
The news boosted Wall Street's main indexes, which finished in positive territory after spending much of the session in the red.
It was still unclear whether the two sides had agreed on a formal agenda for the leaders' meeting after the G20 summit and Kudlow said there were no scheduled talks on the ground for their advisers.
At the same time, a German magazine reported citing EU sources that Trump could impose tariffs on imported cars from next week, sending European auto stocks sharply lower.
Also on Tuesday, a German magazine published a report citing European Union sources saying Trump could impose tariffs on imported cars from next week, which sent European auto stocks sharply lower.
""The market mood has turned cautious once again amid a flurry of trade headlines pointing to the prospect of a new round of trade tariffs ahead,"" said Rodrigo Catril, senior strategist at National Australia Bank.
""The market seems to be jumping at shadows at the moment and against this backdrop of uncertainty the USD remains the preferred option for weathering the storm.""
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, jumped overnight to 97.497 to edge toward a 1-1/2 year top of 97.661 earlier this month. It was last at 97.412.
Investors will now turn attention to a speech on Wednesday by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for further clues on how many more times the U.S. central bank is likely to raise interest rates.
The event has become more critical as signs of a global slowdown and nearly two months of market volatility have clouded an otherwise rosy U.S. picture, prompting speculation the Fed will go slow on rate hikes next year.
Traders will watch the speech in light of Trump's criticism of Powell in a newspaper interview in which the president said interest rates and other Fed policies were damaging the U.S. economy.
Elsewhere in the foreign exchange market, the pound was among the worst performing major currencies overnight. It was last down 0.1 percent at $1.2733.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will take her Brexit sales pitch to Scotland on Wednesday where she will likely face an uphill struggle to convince skeptical voters of the benefits of her deal for businesses.
May needs to win a Dec. 11 parliamentary vote on her Brexit deal but that looks difficult with an apparent large majority of lawmakers - including the Scottish National Party with 35 of Scotland's 59 seats in parliament - opposed to it.
In commodity markets, oil was cautiously higher ahead of an OPEC meeting next week at which the producer club is expected to decide on some form of supply cut to counter an emerging glut. [O/R]
U.S. crude futures added 28 cents to $51.84 a barrel. Brent climbed 28 cents to $60.49.

Despite a rise early Wednesday, oil prices have still fallen by almost one-third since early October, weighed down by the supply overhang and widespread weakness in financial markets.

195,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2018 07:52PM ET</span>",Stock options traders brace for volatility ahead of G20 summit,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. options traders have their eyes firmly fixed on Buenos Aires this week, and they are increasingly confident the meeting there of the heads of the world's 20 largest economies means one thing: more volatility.
The persistent trade tensions between the United States and China are likely to dominate the G20 summit hosted by Argentina on Nov. 30 and Dec. 1, with U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese Premier Xi Jinping set for direct talks on Saturday.
On Monday, Trump said he expected to move ahead with raising tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports to 25 percent from the current 10 percent and repeated his threat to slap tariffs on all remaining imports from China.
Given the sensitivity U.S. stocks have displayed of late to any trade-related headlines, traders are braced for an additional dose of volatility around the meeting. After their biggest gain in more than two weeks on Monday, Trump's salvo after the market closed has re-established an air of caution on Wall Street, and on Tuesday stocks were weak.
The options tied to the S&P 500 Index's tracking fund, known as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (P:SPY) are exhibiting higher volatility in the short-term expirations ahead of the G20 meeting, according Chicago-based volatility and options data firm ORATS.
""The elevated levels suggest a market expected move of 2 percent this week,"" said ORATS founder Matt Amberson.
S&P 500 contracts expiring on Dec. 7 also exhibit elevated volatility levels, data from Trade Alert showed.
While a 2 percent move is roughly in line with the S&P 500 Index's weekly gyrations over the last 10 weeks, the volatility premium embedded in these near-term contracts underlines how important the summit could be to shaping expectations for how the fraught trade relationship between the United States and China will weigh on equities.
Stocks have already had a rough two months, with major U.S. benchmarks sliding back into their second correction of the year and rising worries over the trade scene a big contributor to investor unease.
""If the U.S. still continues on a path toward escalation of the trade dispute with China after the G20 meetings, we can infer that economic considerations are slipping in the administration’s policy agenda,"" UBS Global Wealth Management Chief Investment Officer Mark Haefele said in a note on Monday.
""Against such a backdrop, investors would be right to demand higher risk premia,"" he said.
To be sure, the summit might not be the only event on traders' minds.
Close attention will be paid to a speech on Wednesday by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and to minutes from the central bank's Nov. 7-8 meeting to be released on Thursday for clues to the path of future interest rate hikes.
""What I look for is volatility to begin to increase as we head into Fed minutes and then the G20. Those back-to-back events will be the primary volatility driver this week,"" said J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago.
""I would look for more premium buyers on both sides as many start to collar their risk,"" he said.
While it was difficult to say whether anxiety ahead of the G20 meeting was wholly responsible for the volatility premium embedded in the near-term options, the summit certainly was one thing playing on options traders' minds, said Jon Cherry, global head of options at  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) Capital Markets in Chicago.
""Our clients in particular have been proactively hedging over several months of 2018 and we see that trend continue,"" he said. ""Hedging out to the end of the year and protecting gains is definitely something we have seen.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's top stock index will claw back some ground next year after a bruising 2018 but gains will be much more muted than originally expected, brokers, fund managers and analysts predicted in a Reuters poll on Wednesday.
Investors must navigate Britain's formal exit from the European Union in March and some see a likelihood of a snap general election next year too, opening the possibility of a Labour government replacing the ruling Conservatives. 
While the previous Reuters poll in August saw the FTSE 100 (FTSE) almost reaching its May 2018 record high of over 7,900 by the end of next year, the Nov. 13-27 survey knocks 400 points off that estimate.
The median forecast of almost 30 respondents was for the FTSE 100 to end 2019 at 7,500 points. The index was expected to end this year at 7,185 points and reach 7,357 points by mid-2019. 
Those results are in keeping with a progressive worsening of sentiment around Britain's top stock index. In a survey taken six months ago, respondents had expected the FTSE 100 to hit 7,900 already by the middle of next year.
Respondents see the FTSE 100, which closed at about 7,016 on Tuesday, rising roughly 2 percent into the end of this year. However, this won't be enough to turn around the rough ride of 2018 which delivered volatility shocks and growth worries as well as political uncertainty in the UK.
BREXIT CRUNCH LOOMS
Fears that Britain would fail to reach a Brexit deal with the EU have been eased by an agreement signed last Sunday. But these have been replaced by worries that the Westminster parliament will vote down the deal which Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May is describing as the ""best possible"". 
""The market is currently transfixed by whether the UK ends up with a 'Deal Brexit', 'No Deal Brexit', or even 'No Brexit' – each of these probabilities shifting with the newsflow. Beyond this though, the market will have to start thinking about the implications of a potential Labour government,"" said Chi Chan, director of European equities at Hermes Investment Management. 
Parliament votes on the Brexit deal on Dec. 11.
Global fund manager allocations to UK equities have fallen to one standard deviation below the long-term average, according to a survey this month by Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) which also found investors see UK companies' profits outlook as the least favorable.
""Anything which gives a semblance of hope and faith that the Brexit angst and uncertainty may be worked through is going to provide some scope for these moves to be reversed - and much more,"" said Chris Bailey, European strategist at Raymond James.
So far this year the FTSE 100 has lost about 8.5 percent. That followed two years of gains as the exporter-heavy index benefited from a weak currency since vote on June 23, 2016 to leave the EU. 
A strengthening U.S. dollar was partly to blame, as was domestic political uncertainty, while rising volatility globally meant UK stocks experienced many more frequent swings than in 2017.
Sterling could turn into a weight on the index next year, though, should a smooth Brexit be achieved, encouraging the Bank of England to raise interest rates faster than expected. 
However, the UK market remains cheaper than euro zone stocks on a forward price-to-earnings basis and its dividend yield is very high, attracting some investors to it. 
""The sectoral composition of the FTSE 100, tilted towards commodities and defensives, supports late cycle out-performance,"" said Paul O'Connor, head of the multi-asset team at Janus Henderson. 
""We also think the market is cheap and take some contrarian comfort from the fact that investor sentiment about UK assets is already extremely depressed.""

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - BMW (DE:BMWG) is considering a second U.S. manufacturing plant that could produce engines and transmissions, Chief Executive Harald Krueger said on Tuesday, shortly after a report that U.S. President Donald Trump would impose tariffs on imported cars from next week.
Krueger in an interview at the Los Angeles Auto Show also said he backed British Prime Minister Theresa May's current Brexit plan to divorce the United Kingdom from the European Union.
""The compromise on the table is something I can clearly support,"" he said. May is drumming up support for the divorce deal with the European Union ahead of a December 11 vote in British parliament.
BMW is considering changes to U.S. operations as sales in the region grow, Krueger said. BMW has a U.S. vehicle assembly plant, in South Carolina, is planning to open a Mexico factory next year, and is considering changes to its current scheme of importing engines and transmissions.
""We're at the range where you could think about a second location"" in the United States, he said, adding that such a factory would provide a natural currency hedge.

NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Sears Holdings Corp (PK:SHLDQ) won court approval on Tuesday for $350 million in critical bankruptcy financing that will keep the 125-year-old retailer operating through the holidays while it attempts to reorganize.
Sears reached the deal with Cyrus Capital Partners LP for the financing just before a hearing began in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York on the retailer's so-called debtor-in-possession financing arrangements, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Cyrus' loan replaced a similar deal Sears reached earlier this month with Great American Capital Partners, a financial firm affiliated with liquidation specialist Great American Group and financial services firm B. Riley Financial Inc (O:RILY). Cyrus offered better terms to Sears, the person said. 
""The terms of the transaction were much less favorable than what we had agreed to,"" said John Ahn, president at Great American Capital Partners. 
A Cyrus spokeswoman had no immediate comment. 
A Sears spokesman declined to comment on the deal for the $350 million loan, which U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain approved at the hearing.
The loan adds to $300 million that banks provided Sears when it filed for bankruptcy protection in October, giving the beleaguered retailer a total of $650 million in financing.
""These loans are going to benefit everybody,"" Drain said.
Hedge funds, including Cyrus, have been in talks with Sears over the past several weeks regarding financing to help it continue operating during bankruptcy proceedings, according to people familiar with the matter.
Sears' bankruptcy had been expected for years in light of a lengthy slump in sales since the 2008 financial crisis, seven straight years of losses and a debt load of some $5 billion.
In an attempt last year to avoid bankruptcy, Sears sold its Craftsman tool brand to power tool maker Stanley Black & Decker Inc (N:SWK) for $900 million.
The Hoffman Estates, Illinois-based retailer also signed a deal to sell Kenmore appliances on Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), the e-commerce site whose growing popularity with shoppers has been blamed by several brick-and-mortar retail chains for their hard times and bankruptcies.
Earlier this month, Sears won bankruptcy-court approval to advance plans to stay in business and find a buyer even as it evaluates offers from liquidators.
Some creditors have said Sears should consider winding down by letting liquidators sell its assets in the same way Sports Authority did two years ago and Toys ""R"" Us did this year when it shut all of its U.S. brick-and-mortar locations.
Sears has already said it intends to close about 180 stores while its chairman, Eddie Lampert, a billionaire who runs hedge fund ESL Investments Inc, works on a potential bid to keep Sears in business.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Mergers and acquisitions targeting Hong Kong financial firms have slumped this year, with insurance sector deals particularly hard hit, as China's moves to tighten capital controls and crack down on corporate debt have driven mainland buyers away.
Hong Kong's financial institutions have long been considered juicy targets, helped by the city's wealth as well as its tight currency peg to the U.S. dollar. For Chinese financial firms, the city has also typically been the first step in realizing their overseas ambitions due to its proximity to home. 
But the tune seems to be changing this year as Chinese buyers have all but disappeared. Two insurance companies have called off Hong Kong deals worth a combined $1.4 billion, with sources saying Chinese suitors struggled to move funds offshore.
Mergers and acquisitions where Hong Kong financial firms were targets have totaled $1.15 billion so far this year, with 2018 potentially its lowest in 13 years, according to data from Dealogic. The volume is down from $5.1 billion in 2017. 
And Chinese buyers have accounted for less than a quarter of the 2018 volume, the data showed. Over the past six years cumulatively, they made up nearly 60 percent, or $21 billion, of deals worth $35.3 billion.
Beijing's capital controls, put in place since late 2015 to stem weakness in the yuan, have not just pulled overall deal momentum lower but have also left sellers with fewer or no options, people with knowledge of the matter said.
""If you are looking for a buyside mandate, it would probably make a lot of sense to back a non-Chinese name for Hong Kong financial assets,"" said a senior financial investment banker at a global investment bank. 
The sources declined to be named as they were not authorized to speak to the media.
PULLED DEALS
Hong Kong Life Insurance, owned by five Hong Kong firms, called off its $907 million sale to a Chinese consortium last month after waiting for more than a year to get the transaction closed.
While Hong Kong Life shareholders, including OCBC Wing Hang Bank and Asia Insurance Company, did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on the deal, two sources familiar with the matter said there were concerns about the deal's funding. 
Chong Hing Bank, another shareholder of Hong Kong Life, declined to comment. 
U.S. insurer MetLife Inc (N:MET) has decided to shelve the sale of its Hong Kong business worth over $500 million after the short-listed Chinese suitor failed to meet the funding commitment, said people with knowledge of the matter.
MetLife Hong Kong declined to comment.
In recent years, Hong Kong financial deals saw competition among Chinese bidders, driving up valuations.
China's Thaihot Group bought Hong Kong's Dah Sing Financial life insurance unit in 2016 for $1.4 billion in the most expensive insurance M&A, paying nearly three times the embedded value compared to 1.3-2.0 times for similar deals in the region.
While bankers said Chinese bidders with strong overseas business presence and balance sheets would still be able to compete for Hong Kong financial assets, the curbs are expected to open up the field for non-Chinese firms.
Beijing-based JD Group is selling its Hong Kong insurance unit, FTLife Insurance, and potential bidders are likely to include Hong Kong's Chow Tai Fook Enterprises (CTFE), Asian private equity firm PAG and a Japanese insurer.
JD Group, FTLife and CTFE did not respond to requests for comment, while PAG declined to comment.
Taiwan's Fubon Financial (TW:2881) is also looking to sell its Hong Kong banking unit, likely to be valued at over $1 billion, and investment bankers are rushing to tap potential bidders from Singapore, Malaysia and elsewhere, two of the people said.
Fubon Financial declined to comment, while Fubon Bank did not respond.

""Regulations are making people more cautious in thinking about insurance deals,"" said Samson Lo, UBS's head of Asia M&A. ""Those who are able to pay above and beyond are non-traditional buyers such as private equity companies. The buyer's universe has become more diverse.""

The biotech drug arm of South Korea's top conglomerate, Samsung Group, said the company was seeking a court injunction to nullify the regulator's disciplinary action including recommendations to dismiss its chief executive and chief financial officer.
Earlier this month, South Korea's top financial regulator said Samsung BioLogics had intentionally breached accounting rules ahead of its 2016 listing. The company denied any wrongdoing and said it would file an administrative lawsuit.
The regulator's ruling was a blow to South Korea's biggest conglomerate, which is banking on biopharmaceuticals for growth. It announced plans in August to invest $22 billion in the business and in other areas such as artificial intelligence and 5G mobile technology.
""Samsung BioLogics is trying to prove the legitimacy of its accounting management through the administrative lawsuit,"" the company said in a statement.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and United Kingdom are nearing an open skies aviation agreement to govern air travel after Britain exits the European Union, two government officials briefed on the matter said on Tuesday.
The sides have set what they expect will be a final round of talks for Wednesday, the U.S. and British sources said. The UK's secretary of state for transport, Chris Grayling, plans to be in Washington later this week to sign an agreement.
A UK Department of Transport spokesperson said Tuesday that ""our discussions with the US about a new UK-US air service agreement have been positive and we have made significant progress. Both sides want to conclude these discussions soon.""
The department added that ""all parties have a shared interest in ensuring that existing rights will continue under the new bilateral arrangements, allowing airlines on both sides of the Atlantic to continue to operate existing services as well as to seek to develop new ones.""
The U.S. Transportation Department did not comment.
The biggest concern has been over rules that require airlines to have substantial U.S. or UK ownership.
The deal would address potential problems for UK airlines with significant foreign ownership by allowing existing operations under the EU-U.S. agreement to continue.
Going forward, the agreement will require airlines that change hands to meet the ownership requirements or get U.S. approval.
The Financial Times reported on Tuesday the deal would be inferior to the UK's rights under the existing EU agreement, including ""tighter restrictions on ownership, tougher terms for new entrants and no special access"" to a program covering ticket sales to U.S. government employees.
UK-based carriers including British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and Norwegian Air (OL:NWC) could be affected without a deal.
IAG (L:ICAG), the Anglo-Spanish airline group that is the parent company of British Airways and Spain’s Iberia, has also been working to address European Union ownership issues after the European Commission said it could fall below EU ownership requirements after Brexit. 
EU ownership rules require European airlines to be majority-owned by an EU entity. 

IAG did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 0.44%. The S&P 500 rose 0.33%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.01%.
Wall Street rebounded from a selloff early Tuesday as Kudlow said President Donald Trump believes there is ""a good possibility"" that a trade deal can be made with China, but stressed that Beijing would have to meet ""certain conditions"" on trade.
China's response to Trump’s demands so far has been ""disappointing"" and ""unsatisfactory,"" Kudlow added.
Uncertainty over a possible trade deal weighed on trade-sensitive corners of the market as materials fell more than 1%, led by DowDuPont (NYSE:DWDP), crop nutrient miner Mosaic (NYSE:MOS) and fertilizer distributor CF Industries (NYSE:CF).
Trump told The Wall Street Journal on Monday that it was ""highly unlikely"" the U.S. would delay increasing tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods to 25% from 10%, denting hopes that a meeting between Trump and China President Xi Jinping at the upcoming G20 meeting would lead to a trade deal.
A gain in Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) supported tech, pushing the broader market higher, after the streaming giant announced plans to venture further into kids content, clinching a new deal to animate popular Roald Dahl books.

Energy stocks kept a lid on gains in the broader market, however, pressured by stagnant oil prices as traders continued to weigh up reports of record Saudi output against the prospect of major oil producers agreeing to cut output at an OPEC meeting next week.
In a sign of skittish sentiment on stocks, investors turned to defensive sectors of the market, pushing utilities and consumer staples 1% higher.
On the economic front, consumer confidence undershot economists' expectations in November, but still remained close to record highs.

(Reuters) - Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (O:FOXA) on Tuesday rejected claims in a Malaysia casino operator's lawsuit accusing them of abandoning a licensing contract tied to the planned construction of a Fox-branded theme park.
Disney and Fox said Genting Malaysia Bhd's (KL:GENM) respective claims against them were ""without merit.""
Genting shares fell 16.7 percent on Tuesday, a day after the Kuala Lumpur-based company sued the American media and entertainment companies in Los Angeles for more than $1 billion. The decline came before Disney and Fox issued their statements.
According to the complaint, Fox Entertainment Group, under pressure from Disney, breached a 2013 contract to license its intellectual property for a planned theme park at the Resorts World Genting complex, an hour's drive from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia's capital. 
Genting blamed Fox for years of delays, and said Disney, which is buying many Fox assets for $71.3 billion, wanted to back out altogether because partnering with a gaming company did not fit its ""family-friendly"" brand strategy.
The complaint also said Fox issued a default notice in a manner consistent with Disney wanting to ""kill the deal.""
Twentieth Century Fox Film, one of the defendants, rejected that allegation. ""The allegation that Disney, rather than Fox, finally decided to declare a default is simply made up,"" a spokesman said.
Genting said more than 23 million people annually visit Resorts World Genting, which includes a casino, seven hotels, shopping malls, performance venues, gondola lifts and scores of restaurants, bars and clubs.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged higher on Tuesday after White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said a meeting between President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart on Saturday was an opportunity to ""turn the page"" on a trade war.
All three of Wall Street's major indexes reversed losses following Kudlow's comments days ahead of the high-stakes dinner between Trump and Xi Jinping after the G20 summit in Buenos Aires.
But Kudlow also said the White House has been disappointed so far in China's response to trade issues with the United States. On Monday, Trump threatened to move ahead with additional tariffs on Chinese goods, due to take effect on Jan. 1.
""The volatility we're seeing this afternoon is related to Kudlow's comments,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. ""Across all sectors you see the market bouncing up and down and being very unsettled. And it's primarily the tariff issue overhanging the market."" 
General Motors Co (N:GM) shares dropped 2.5 percent after Trump warned subsidies could be cut after the automaker said it would shutter U.S. plants and lay off thousands of workers.
""The GM thing is a war of words,"" Ghriskey said. ""Here's a company trying to react to the market environment ... and they're being criticized for it.""

The Calgary, Alberta-based company has temporarily halted all pre-construction work in the United States on the pipeline project as a result of the ruling, TransCanada spokesman Terry Cunha said on Tuesday. 
He added that the company does not expect to start full construction on the 1,180 mile (1,900 km) pipeline until ""at least the second half of the first quarter of 2019,"" but declined to provide further details on timing.
""It is too soon to say what the injunction will mean to the timeline and cost of the Keystone XL pipeline but we remain confident the project will be built,"" Cunha said.
A U.S. judge in Montana issued an injunction on Nov. 8 blocking construction of the heavy crude pipeline from Canada to the United States, drawing praise from environmental groups and a rebuke from President Donald Trump.
TransCanada has filed an amendment with the Montana District Court to narrow the scope of the injunction to allow it to continue pre-construction work like meetings with stakeholders, the movement of pipe and equipment, and early right-of-way work.
Canada is the No.1 source of oil imported to the United States, but congested pipelines in Alberta, where heavy bitumen is extracted from the oil sands, have forced shippers to use costlier rail and trucks.

Shares of TransCanada closed up 0.72 percent at C$53.50 on Tuesday in Toronto.

But market forces are tough to beat, even if you’re president.
Trump captured the White House thanks in large part to the story he told -- that he could reverse America’s industrial decline. He promised to bring back manufacturing and fossil-fuel jobs written off as casualties of global trade and over-regulation.
But almost halfway through Trump’s first term, divergences from his “Make America Great Again” story line continue to pile up, pushed along by technology, globalization and a changing climate.
Trump is fighting back. On Tuesday, the day after GM’s announcement, he tweeted out threats to cut all the subsidies GM receives, including tax breaks for electric vehicles. Larry Kudlow, director of the White House National Economic Council, also piled on: “There’s great disappointment that it seems like GM would rather build its electric cars in China rather than the United States,” Kudlow told reporters at a briefing just before Trump’s tweets.
It’s unclear whether Trump has authority to revoke subsidies without action by Congress. It’s also difficult, if not impossible, for Trump to overcome the dynamics that are driving companies to choose robots over humans, discontinue brands and close plants. Some are choosing to build nearer to their consumers and supply chains, including China, while others are moving production lines to lower-cost countries, like Mexico.
Trade Deficit
Consumers, too, are increasingly switching to alternative energy for cars and homes. As wages finally rise, people are also buying more imported goods, which pushes up the U.S. trade deficit, one metric by which Trump assesses the economy.
""The market is a tsunami,"" said Seth Kaplowitz, a finance lecturer at San Diego State University. ""If you surf it, you’ll be fine, but if you push back, it’s too strong.""
Trump has gone to great lengths to revive once-storied industries. America’s steel and aluminum companies won levies to hamper foreign competitors. He hit Whirlpool’s biggest rival, South Korea’s Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co., with tariffs on washing machines. For coal miners, Trump is proposing to reduce Obama-era environmental regulations. He also billed his corporate-tax cut as an elixir for capital spending and job creation.
Quid Pro Quo
Sometimes, Trump has offered an explicit quid pro quo. For GM and other automakers, he pledged to lower fuel economy standards in return for jobs. His administration is also considering tariffs on imported autos and parts on national-security grounds.
All of this is on top of the president’s biggest push to revive industry: starting a trade war with China, America’s largest commercial partner.
Market forces, however, have proved too powerful. For Mary Barra, GM’s chief executive, the plan to close a handful of older plants and dismiss more than 14,000 employees came down to basic economics. Consumers are expected to shift to electric and autonomous vehicles. They’re also shunning small cars, like GM’s Chevy Cruze, in favor of pickups and SUVs. With some factories down to one shift a day, GM said it needed to cut its capacity to make traditional passenger cars, while keeping lower-cost production in Mexico.
These moves drew the ire of the president, who said, “We have a lot of pressure on them” to maintain operations in places like Lordstown, Ohio -- a state key to his re-election. “You better get back in there soon -- that’s Ohio.”

GM’s restructuring comes less than two years after Trump praised the company for promising to invest $1 billion in its U.S. operations. It was one of many such pledges by large companies -- even though some were reiterating existing plans -- meant to gain favor with the new administration. The jobs GM promised, however, have largely gone to Silicon Valley, where it’s developing autonomous vehicles.
Like GM, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. said it will exit much of the passenger-car market to focus on SUVs and trucks. It also has said it will lay off workers as part of an $11 billion restructuring.
Public Scolding
Jawboning aside, Trump was unable to stop job losses at a Carrier Corp. air-conditioning plant in Indianapolis. Soon after winning office, he made a highly publicized visit to the factory in a bid to stop Carrier from moving positions to Monterrey, Mexico. The company kept the plant open after receiving millions in state subsidies. But about 600 workers ended up losing their jobs anyway.
The U.S. still is a manufacturing heavyweight, but companies increasingly are choosing automation over human labor. Some forces buffeting manufacturers are the result of other Trump policies. He has worked to lower oil prices by cutting environmental rules and pressuring petrostates. U.S. consumers have responded by purchasing yet more SUVs and trucks, which accounted for about 65 percent of new-vehicle sales in September. Tariffs have also raised prices on aluminum and steel, forcing up production costs.
Harley-Davidson
The decision by Harley-Davidson Inc (NYSE:HOG)., once Trump’s model of a patriotic American manufacturer, to shift motorcycle production to Europe came in direct response to Trump’s tariffs, which prompted the European Union to retaliate with duties of its own, damaging sales there.
Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) at first welcomed Trump’s tariffs by adding 200 jobs in the U.S. It was hurt months later by levies on steel and aluminum, which raised the cost of raw materials. The company said it was forced to pass those costs to customers by raising prices, a move that battered sales and resulted in a profit warning and a steep slide in shares.
Just hours after GM’s announcement Monday, Trump told supporters at a rally in Biloxi, Mississippi, that they shouldn’t worry. ""Under my administration, we’ve created 600,000 brand-new manufacturing jobs that people said could never come back to our country.""
Not quite. Since Trump took office, the U.S. Department of Labor reports, companies have added just over 400,000 manufacturing jobs -- tiny compared with 150 million non-farm positions. Coal-mining jobs have also increased, but by fewer than 2,000 slots.
Tax Cuts
Early on, Trump’s corporate tax cut appeared to boost capital spending, but that may have been short-lived. Companies are reacting more to market conditions than the tax law, such as by paying more because labor is tight. One measure of U.S. business investment shows it at the same level as before the tax cuts. In the end, Kaplowitz said, companies are concerned with profitability and survival over allegiance to a country or politician.
Trade-deficit numbers are telling. The gap between what the U.S. sells abroad and what it buys from other countries has ballooned under Trump. In September, the deficit was $54 billion, up $700 million from August and a seven-month high. In the year to date, the deficit has increased by $40.7 billion, or 10 percent, from the same period in 2017.
Trump isn’t deterred, at least publicly. ""They said manufacturing jobs would never come back, you’d need a magic wand,” he said in Biloxi. “Well, we found the magic wand.”
Mr. Market begs to disagree."

1. GDP Expected to Tick Higher
Economic indicators pick up tomorrow with another reading on third-quarter economic growth and the latest figures on new home sales.
The Bureau of Economic Analysis will release the second measure of third-quarter GDP at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).
On average, economists expect that the economy grew at an annual rate of 3.6%, up from the initial measure of 3.5%.
For inflation watchers, core PCE prices are expected to hold steady at the first estimate of 1.6% annual growth.
Solid but tamer economic growth is expected for the fourth quarter and next year.
“The US economy has performed really well this year with a robust jobs market and massive tax cuts helping to generate the strongest year of GDP growth since 2005. But maintaining this momentum in 2019 will be hard, given the headwinds of the lagged effects of the strong dollar and higher interest rates along with the fading support from the fiscal stimulus and intensifying trade protectionism at a time of softer global growth,” ING chief international economist James Knightley said.
At 10 AM ET, the Commerce Department will issue the new home sales numbers for October.
The market is looking for a rise of 3.7% for the month, rebounding from a drop in September.
2. Tiffany Highlights Morning Retail Earnings
Retail earnings are on tap, with luxury goods seller Tiffany (NYSE:TIF) leading the way.
On average, analysts predict quarterly profit of 77 cents per share on sales of about $1 billion.
Shares have struggled recently and the stock in now back around levels seen just before it spiked higher in May.
Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) will weigh in, with a profit of 26 cents per share forecast on sales of around $1.9 billion.
Chico's FAS (NYSE:CHS) is also scheduled to report.
3. Oil Inventories to Get Prices Moving Again?
Oil prices failed to find clear direction today, but traders may have more luck tomorrow with the official U.S. crude inventory data arriving.
The Energy Information Administration will release its weekly report at 10:30 AM ET (15:30 GMT).
Traders are predicting another build in U.S. stockpiles, but much less than previous ones.
Those in the oil market will also have to weigh the possibility of OPEC and Russia agreeing to an output reduction at the meeting in Vienna Dec. 6-7.

233,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2018 04:11PM ET</span>",Medicine or vice? Socially screened funds struggle to define cannabis industry,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Is marijuana a medicine or a vice? 
The $8 trillion U.S. socially responsible investment industry is grappling with that question as more states approve the recreational use of cannabis, pushing consumption closer to ""sin"" stocks like alcohol and tobacco that ethically focused investors avoid.
Ten U.S. states and the District of Columbia have legalized the recreational use of marijuana for adults over the age of 21, and New Jersey lawmakers on Monday proposed legalizing it. 
No U.S. public companies are directly selling marijuana, but Canadian marijuana producers like Tilray Inc and Canopy Growth Corp are on U.S. exchanges. In mid-October Canada legalized recreational cannabis and that is leading fund managers and their clients to decide if they feel comfortable investing in marijuana if it is not for medicinal use.
Marijuana is used to treat a range of conditions from epilepsy to migraines. 
""There's a lot of mixed feelings about cannabis, whereas with tobacco there's a lot of consensus that tobacco is not safe in any amount,"" said Jennifer Sireklove, director of responsible investing at Parametric Portfolio Associates, which oversees $220 billion in assets under management. 
Faith-based investors, including some Christian college endowments, are more likely to eschew cannabis completely, while other socially focused clients avoid companies that produce marijuana but will tolerate companies that may sell it as part of their larger business, she said.
""If there's a standardized product you can find at a corner store, you may not want to eliminate big parts of the investment universe when cannabis is a small part of a company's revenues,"" she said. 
Funds that do not pass ESG (environmental, social and corporate governance) screens like those by index providers such as MSCI Inc will have a narrower list of potential investors, potentially leaving their stock trading at lower price-to-earnings multiples. Tilray, for instance, has already been a target of investors betting its stock price will fall because of its high valuation. 
INDEX INVESTING
The question of cannabis underscores the wide range of investment philosophies in the rapidly growing ESG sector. While nearly all ESG investors avoid industries that could negatively impact society like weapons, gambling, pornography and tobacco, some will invest in companies that sell alcohol if it is a small portion of their overall businesses.
Neither Parnassus Investments nor Calvert Funds, the two largest ESG-only firms, have current positions in cannabis companies, each firm said. Calvert is a subsidiary of  Eaton  (NYSE:ETN) Vance Corp. 
Yet firms such as MSCI, which maintains screened lists of companies that pass certain ESG criteria, say they currently include cannabis companies in their broad lists of ESG-compliant companies. That could change, however, if a major tobacco firm such as  Altria Group  (NYSE:MO) Inc or Philip Morris International Inc (NYSE:PM) were to acquire a cannabis company such as Tilray or go into the marijuana market itself.
Institutional investors that pay to create their own proprietary lists of excluded companies may still opt to avoid cannabis, said Joseph Williams (NYSE:WMB), vice president of MSCI ESG Research. 
""Some clients take a zero tolerance with cannabis regardless of the use case, while others are more nuanced and only want to restrict companies that are focused on the recreational use market,"" he said in a recent interview.
As ESG investors focus on the question of marijuana's social impact, Jordan Waldrep, fund manager of the $164 million USA Mutual Vice Fund - which specifically invests in the companies that ESG funds avoid - is making a big bet on the sector. 
""Cannabis puts a growth potential on alcohol and tobacco companies that hasn't existed in a long time for them,"" he said. 
Among cannabis companies themselves, he is focusing on companies such as Canopy Growth that have started to establish their own brands, rather than betting on pure growers, he said. Canopy's brand lineup, for instance, ranges from hipster-lifestyle division Tweed to its high-end DNA Genetics, which focuses on award-winning strains. 

""The recreational market will be all about brands,"" Waldrep said. ""The opportunity for growth is just too strong.""

BOSTON (Reuters) - A former  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) adviser was sentenced to five years in prison on Tuesday after he admitted that he misused client funds to invest in a wind farm project and to cover his own personal expenses, including college tuition for his children.
James Polese, 52, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Mark Wolf in Boston, who said he could not understand how the investment adviser could be ""so greedy and stupid"" by carrying out the fraud when he was already financially successful.
""It wasn't just wrong,"" Wolf said. ""It was dumb, and it inflicted harm on the people you cared about.""
The proceedings came after a former employee of the New York-based financial services firm who worked under Polese, Cornelius Peterson, was sentenced in June to 20 months in prison for participating in the scheme.
Polese, who pleaded guilty in April to investment adviser fraud and bank fraud charges, in court apologized to his victims and Morgan Stanley, which employed him as a Boston-based adviser.
""I'm sorry for tarnishing their name through my actions,"" he said.
In addition to prison, Wolf also ordered Polese to pay a $30,000 fine and $462,000 in restitution jointly with Peterson. 
According to court papers, in 2014, Polese and Peterson transferred $100,000 from a Morgan Stanley client's account without his permission to invest in a private equity fund created to support a wind farm project.
Prosecutors said Peterson was on the fund's board of directors, and Polese had himself invested money in the wind farm project, which needed additional funding.
Both men later in 2015 used $400,000 from the account of an elderly Morgan Stanley client, Ralph Bates, to back a letter of credit in support of the project, causing him to incur $12,000 in fees, prosecutors said.
Without Bates' approval, in 2016 they also transferred $350,000 from his account, which was used for a real estate investment and to pay for Polese's personal expenses, according to court papers.
Polese also in 2017 used more than $93,000 from Bates' account to make college tuition payments for two of his children and to pay his own credit card bills, prosecutors said.
Bates, an 87-year-old philanthropist, said in court on Tuesday that Polese had ""ripped me off for big bucks.
""I'm at a loss for words,"" he said.
Morgan Stanley fired Polese and Peterson in June 2017 and has said it terminated them immediately after uncovering their misconduct.
The case is U.S. v. Polese, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, No. 18-cr-10028.

LONDON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - The impoverished state of Central African Republic landed a windfall on Tuesday, at least on paper, when Russian state bank VTB reported it had lent the country $12 billion -- but the bank then said it was a clerical error and there was no such loan.
The loan was mentioned in a quarterly VTB financial report published by the Russian central bank. The report included a table listing the outstanding financial claims that VTB group had on dozens of countries as of Oct. 1 this year. 
In the table next to Central African Republic was the sum of 801,933,814,000 rubles ($12 billion) -- more than six times the country's annual economic output.
When asked about the data by Reuters, the bank said the loan to the former French colony did not, in reality, exist.
""VTB bank has no exposure of this size to any foreign country. Most likely, this is a case of an operational mistake in the system when the countries were being coded,"" the lender said in a statement sent to Reuters.
VTB did not say who was responsible for the mistake or how such a large figure could have been published without being spotted.
CAR government spokesman Ange Maxime Kazagui, when asked about the Russian data, said: “I don’t have that information. But it doesn’t sound credible because $11 billion is beyond the debt capacity of CAR."" 
""We are members of the IMF (International Monetary Fund). When a member of the IMF wants to take on debt ... it has to discuss that with the IMF.”
There was no indication in the data published by the Russian central bank of who was the recipient of the loan, the purpose of the loan, or when it was issued and on what terms. 
CAR is a nation of 5 million people emerging from sectarian conflict, with a gross domestic product of $1.95 billion, according to the World Bank. 
Russia has built up security and business ties with CAR in the past few years. 
Muscling aside former colonial power France, Moscow has provided arms and contractors to the Central African Republic military, and a Russian national is security advisor to President Faustin-Archange Touadera.

258,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2018 02:30PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Kids clothing retailer Gymboree weighs closing half its stores - sources,"By Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - Gymboree Group Inc, a U.S. retailer of infant and children's clothing, is considering closing more than half of its approximately 900 stores, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
The move would be a setback for Gymboree after it emerged from bankruptcy last year. It was one of the few brick-and-mortar retailers that managed to escape liquidation in a wave of bankruptcies that swept the sector, amid the rise of online shopping.
Gymboree has hired consulting firm Berkley Research Group LLC to assist it in evaluating options, which could include filing for bankruptcy again, the sources said. Berkley Research Group will also help cut costs and analyze the mall-based chain's leases, the people said.
This effort could help determine Gymboree's future. Without the cooperation of landlords willing to give rent breaks, struggling retailers are often forced to file for bankruptcy as a way to get out of their store leases.
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Gymboree declined to comment, while Berkley Research Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
San Francisco-based Gymboree filed for bankruptcy in June 2017. Through that process, it cut its debt by $1 billion, and closed one-quarter of its shops. It emerged from bankruptcy in September 2017 with debt that included an $85 million term loan and $200 million revolving credit line.
Gymboree's former lenders, a group including distressed-debt oriented hedge funds Searchlight Capital Partners LP and Brigade Capital Management LP, as well as private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (N:APO), now own the company. 
In addition to Gymboree, the chain has the Janie and Jack and Crazy 8 brands.
More than 20 U.S. retailers have filed for bankruptcy since the beginning of 2017, as e-commerce giants such as Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) surged in popularity. Sears Holdings Corp (PK:SHLDQ) filed for bankruptcy in October, while Toys R Us Inc decided to close down earlier this year. 
Like its peers, Gymboree is now at the most critical time of the year for its business, as shoppers stock up for the holidays. Sales at brick-and-mortar stores declined in the shopping period right after last week's U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, while more consumers made purchases from their smartphone.
To boost sales after it emerged from bankruptcy, Gymboree revamped its brands earlier this year, highlighting new graphic tees and outerwear. The retailer also launched an app focused on its tees.

The new loan limit means more large homes are eligible for backing by Fannie (PK:FNMA) and Freddie (PK:FMCC) - companies conceived to promote home ownership. This year, the companies would not finance home loans larger than $453,100 in most communities.
Fannie and Freddie fell into government hands after the housing crisis hit in 2008 and the companies have been controlled by Washington ever since. They are regulated by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), which sets the 'conforming loan limit' each year.
Fannie and Freddie buy mortgages from lenders, thereby freeing up money for further mortgage loans. The two in turn sell the mortgages to investors with a guarantee that principal and interest payments will passed on to the investors.

While the $484,350 limit will hold across much of the country, more expensive homes in some urban areas will also be eligible for backing from Fannie and Freddie. In high-cost areas, the mortgage loan limit will be $726,525, the FHFA said in a statement.

PG&E (NYSE:PCG) soared 6% on reports a California lawmaker is preparing to introduce legislation designed to give the utility company more financial stability at a time when many are concerned that liabilities from damages from October's California wildfires could bankrupt the company.
The new legislation would allow investor-owned utilities like Pacific Gas & Electric to file with the California Public Utilities Commission and recover some fire costs retroactively.
Shares of PG&E have attempted to mount a recovery following a crash earlier this month, when California's fire protection agency raised the possibility that the California Camp Fire may have been caused by the company's equipment.
Edison International (NYSE:EIX) continued to add to gains amid expectations that the utility company would be able to continue paying a dividend despite potential losses from liabilities linked to the Woolsey Fire in Southern California. Its shares were up more than 2%.
UBS senior credit strategist Frank Sileo said in a report last week that he believes Edison International ""has adequate liquidity and strong financial flexibility to fund wildfire-related losses,"" adding that the prospect of the company suspending dividends was ""low.""

The case will be sent to court unless in the next 20 days the parties agree on a settlement, or new evidence emerges.
The prosecutors suspect Gucci, which is part of French luxury group  Kering  (PA:PRTP), may have paid taxes on profits generated by sales in Italy in another country with a more favorable tax regime.
They allege that Gucci owes the Italian tax authorities around 1 billion euros for revenues booked in the years between 2010 and 2016.
The prosecutors allege Gucci revenues booked through Luxury Goods International (LGI), the Swiss-based company that manages the distribution and logistics platform for most of Kering's luxury brands, should be taxed in Italy and not in Switzerland. 
Gucci Chief Executive Marco Bizzarri and former CEO Patrizio Di Marco are under investigation in the case, the source added. 
The lawyers for the two executives could not immediately be reached for comment. 
Gucci's parent Kering said it was ""confident about the correctness and transparency of its operating mode, and is cooperating actively with the competent authorities"".

Tesla's share price fell 1.8 percent on Tuesday morning following the report which came out during the Asian business day. Hours later, the company responded from its headquarters in California, calling the industry group's report ""wildly inaccurate.""
An official from China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) said data from the industry body showed Tesla sold just 211 cars in the world's largest auto market in October. 
Tesla representatives in China did not respond to repeated calls and written requests for comment during the Asia work day. Later, a California-based spokesman issued a written statement saying Tesla disputed the CPCA's data, but he did not provide internal sales figures.
“This is wildly inaccurate. While we do not disclose regional or monthly sales numbers, these figures are off by a significant margin,"" he said in the statement. 
The electric carmaker, which imports all the cars it sells in China, said in October that tariff hikes on auto imports were hammering its sales there. In July, Beijing raised tariffs on imports of U.S. autos to 40 percent amid a worsening trade standoff with the United States.
While so-called new-energy vehicle sales have continued to climb in China, wider auto sales have slowed sharply since the middle of the year, taking the market to the brink of its first annual sales contraction in almost three decades.
Tesla, led by billionaire CEO Elon Musk, said last week it was cutting the price of its Model X and Model S cars in China in a shift in strategy to make the cars ""more affordable"" and absorb more of the hit from higher tariffs.

Tesla recently secured the site for its first overseas factory in Shanghai that will help it avoid the steep tariffs.

271,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2018 12:50PM ET</span>",U.S. court revives Mattress Firm defamation case against Sleep Number,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Tuesday revived for a second time a 11-year-old defamation lawsuit by bedding retailer Mattress Firm Inc against adjustable bed maker  Sleep Number  Corp (O:SNBR).
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said a lower court judge misinterpreted New York law in dismissing claims first brought in March 2007 by Sleepy's, now part of Mattress Firm, against Select Comfort, renamed Sleep Number last November.
Andrew Hansen, a lawyer for Sleep Number, declined to comment. Lawyers for Mattress Firm did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Mattress Firm, part of South Africa's Steinhoff International Holdings NV (J:SNHJ), emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last week.
The case concerned whether Select Comfort violated a 2005 contract that let Sleepy's sell Select Comfort's wood framed ""Personal Preference"" beds, while Select Comfort sold its plastic-and-polymer framed ""Core"" beds in its own stores.
Sleepy's sued after ""secret"" shoppers it hired to visit Select Comfort stores reported that salespeople disparaged the quality and comfort of Personal Preference beds, whose sales were poor, and said Sleepy's offered inferior warranties.
U.S. District Judge Joanna Seybert in Central Islip, New York dismissed the case in Sept. 2015, saying the alleged disparagements were not ""published to a third party"" under New York law because only Sleepy's secret shoppers heard them.
But in a 3-0 decision by the New York-based appeals court, Circuit Judge Robert Sack said the publication requirement might have been met if the shoppers qualified as Sleepy's ""agents.""
He ordered Seybert to revisit that issue, and whether Sleepy's consented to the alleged slanders.
The appeals court also threw out a $2.63 million legal fee award for Sleepy's, saying Seybert didn't justify it and should reconsider the amount.
Sleep Number is based in Minneapolis. Sleepy's was based in Hicksville, New York, and Mattress Firm is based in Houston.
Sleepy's lawsuit had been dismissed by a different judge in Sept. 2012, and revived by the appeals court in March 2015.

The case is Sleepy's LLC v. Select Comfort Wholesale Corp et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Nos. 15-3560, 16-3595.

283,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2018 12:10PM ET</span>",Russia's Potanin to appeal UK court decision in battle of billionaires,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian businessman Vladimir Potanin plans to appeal a London court decision to block him from buying shares in mining company Norilsk Nickel (MM:GMKN) from fellow investor Roman Abramovich, representatives at Potanin's investment firm said on Tuesday.
The ruling, taken in June, was considered to be advantageous for Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska, who controls aluminum giant Rusal (HK:0486), and has long been at loggerheads with Potanin over control of Norilsk Nickel.
He wanted to stop Abramovich, owner of England's Chelsea soccer club, from selling shares in the company to Potanin, saying that would violate a 2012 shareholder agreement.
Representatives of Interros, which manages Potanin's assets, said they had filed a request together with Abramovich's investment vehicle Crispian, to be allowed to appeal the decision.
""Today the judge satisfied our request,"" Interros said. ""Within 21 days after receipt of the court decision we have to submit our appeal to London's Court of Appeal."" 
Rusal, which holds a 27.8 percent stake in Nornickel, declined to comment. A representative for Abramovich did not respond to requests for comment. 
In September, Potanin returned a 2 percent stake in Nornickel to Abramovich and his partners, that he had previously bought from them for about $800 million - a move which had increased his holding in the miner to 32.9 percent. 
He had previously promised to return the stake to Abramovich if the London court ruled against the deal.
Deripaska and Potanin have battled over control of Nornickel ever since Rusal, the world's largest aluminum producer outside China, bought a stake in the miner just before the 2008 global financial crash.
Abramovich stepped in as a ""white knight"" minority shareholder in 2012 to act as a buffer between Potanin and Deripaska.
The long-running conflict was overshadowed in April this year by U.S. sanctions imposed against Deripaska and some of his companies, including Rusal. 

Nornickel competes with Brazil's Vale (SA:VALE3) for the rank of the world's top nickel producer and is also the world's largest palladium producer.

288,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2018 11:50AM ET</span>",Wary whistleblower casts light on dark Danish drama,"By Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen and Kirstin Ridley
COPENHAGEN/LONDON (Reuters) - When Howard Wilkinson was given a tablet as a gift from a client and his boss did not respond to questions about what he should do with it, the Briton sold it and donated the proceeds to the Tallinn Childrens' Hospital in Estonia.
The former banker-turned whistleblower then handed the receipt to his employer, Copenhagen-based  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE), which has since has become embroiled in one of the world's biggest money laundering scandals.
The 2012 episode, described by Wilkinson's U.S. lawyer and confirmed by the Estonian hospital, sheds light on the nature of the previously obscure 47-year-old, who helped lift the lid on 200 billion euros ($225 billion) of suspicious payments flowing from countries such as Russia through Danske to the West.
Wilkinson, the former Baltics head of trading in Danske's markets division, says he stumbled across the scheme in 2012, reported his concerns to bosses in 2013 and 2014 and assumed they would fix it.
He was wrong.
He told shocked European and Danish lawmakers last week that at least 10 banks, including large U.S. and European lenders, funneled money through Danske in Estonia, Lithuania and Denmark to the U.S. and out into the financial system between 2007 and 2015.
Billed by some as a hero in a global fight against dirty money, Wilkinson said he felt he had ""done something good for society"" - but never wanted a lead role in the Danske drama.
A former colleague says he has a ""black-or-white"" view of the world, which could at times lead to conflict at work. But he was not regarded by workmates as driven by greed.
""He liked his job,"" he told Reuters.
But after filing four whistleblowing reports about large flows of suspicious-looking transfers and seeing little action from Danske, Wilkinson quietly resigned in 2014.
Denmark's largest bank eventually published a report in September that detailed its own compliance and control failings and now faces investigations in Denmark, Estonia, Britain and the United States.
INTO THE SPOTLIGHT
Wilkinson was dragged into the public spotlight after an Estonian newspaper published his name in September and, while outraged at the ""gross abuse of human rights"", has used his podium to demand protection of informants to allow a crackdown on crime.
Wilkinson urged lawmakers last week to ban non disclosure agreements (NDAs) that prevent whistleblowers reporting wrongdoing to authorities, to investigate the Danish FSA regulator for potential misconduct and to police secretive shell companies that hide their owners identities.
Picking his words carefully to avoid the pitfalls of his own NDA and Danish bank secrecy laws - so stringent they surprised some Danish lawmakers - he told European Parliamentarians that employers could retaliate against whistleblowers if they stepped forward.
Flanked by Stephen Kohn, a leading American advocate who secured a $104 million financial reward for a UBS (S:UBSG) whistleblower in 2012 under a U.S. bounty program for informers, Wilkinson said other informants were too afraid to speak up for fear of losing their jobs and livelihoods.
""I strongly believe there were a number of more junior people in the (Estonian) branch who ... knew that there were suspicious things, but because of the set up ... would never come forward as a whistleblower,"" he said.
SEASON OF GOODWILL?
A sometimes nervous-looking Wilkinson, wearing a suit and tie with his top shirt button undone, rose to the occasion when he took to the global stage, even cracking a joke about reporters calling his mother-in-law in a small town in Estonia. 
""How am I going to get a Christmas present this year?"" Wilkinson, who lived with his family outside Tallinn, told about 100 people at the European Parliament hearing in Brussels.
Against the backdrop of criminal investigations, plunging shares and a boardroom rout at Danske, Wilkinson said he remained at a loss to explain how controls failed at Danske and at other banks, that sources have named as  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), JPMorgan (N:JPM) and Bank of America (N:BAC).
Deutsche has confirmed it acted as a correspondent bank for Danske in Estonia but ended the relationship in 2015 after identifying suspicious activity. JPMorgan ended a correspondent relationship with Danske in 2013, according to a person familiar with the matter. Bank of America has declined to comment. 
Whistleblowers who participate in wrongdoing can still claim financial rewards from U.S. authorities, because they are seen as essential to uncovering hidden white-collar crimes. But Kohn says Wilkinson, with his balding salt and pepper hair cropped short and sporting spectacles, is not one of 42 people reported to authorities over the scandal - eight to the police.
In the meantime, Wilkinson has spoken of his frustration at the curiosity about him, rather than about where the cash flows ended up.
""I don't want to be in the public profile, I never volunteered for it ... And what I would really like right now is to go back to my wife and kids,"" he said.
When he left Danske in 2014, he said a senior executive flew over from Copenhagen with an NDA that awarded him six months salary under a non-compete agreement - and an extra 20,000 euros. The executive looked him in the eye, he said, promised he had zero tolerance for money laundering and would ""fix it"".

""I've got a family, I'd got what I wanted which is someone telling to my face, looking me in the eye, that he was going to fix it... I took the view that the right thing to do what to take his word for it and take the money.""

292,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2018 11:30AM ET</span>",Trump may impose tariffs on imported cars from next week: report,"BERLIN (Reuters) - European auto stocks extended losses on Tuesday after a German magazine reported that U.S. President Donald Trump could impose tariffs on imported cars from next week.
Wirtschaftswoche cited ""EU sources"" as saying a U.S. Department of Commerce investigation report was on Trump's desk, adding: ""Trump will possibly decide on tariffs as early as next week after the G20 meeting in Buenos Aires.""
It cited the sources as saying the report recommended a 25 percent customs duty on car imports from all countries except Canada and Mexico.
However, the White House has repeatedly pledged not to move forward with imposing tariffs on the European Union or Japan as long as it is making constructive progress in trade talks.
The European Commission, which oversees trade policy for the 28-member European Union, declined to comment on the report in general, but did say that Wirtschaftwoche's reference to EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom heading to Washington on Wednesday was not correct.
Neither White House nor the U.S. Commerce Department immediately responded to a request for comment.
The Commerce Department has not publicly released any findings from its investigation into whether imported autos and parts pose a national security risk. Reuters reported that the department submitted its recommendations earlier this month to the White House, which did not immediately act.
Trump could take weeks or month to decide. Once he makes a decision, the White House has 15 days to impose the new tariffs.
European auto stocks extended losses after the report, falling 2.5 percent (SXAP). Autos stocks are down 20 percent year-to-date as fears of tariffs and slowing growth in car sales drive investors away from the sector.

Shares in VW (DE:VOWG_p) widened losses and were trading 4.1 percent lower at 1610 GMT. BMW (DE:BMWG) shares were down 1.4 percent.  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) shares were down 2.4 percent.

Colin James, the president of Unifor Local 222, which represents workers at the plant, confirmed on Tuesday morning that his members were back at work.
Union leaders are scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in Ottawa on Tuesday afternoon. Trudeau had expressed ""deep disappointment"" at GM's move on Monday.
The plant closure, which affects 2,973 assembly line workers, would end more than century of vehicle production in the city east of Toronto. It is part of a wider restructuring that will eliminate 15,000 jobs, GM said on Monday.
At a press conference in Oshawa on Monday, Unifor National President Jerry Dias promised ""one hell of a fight."" 
In 2009, GM shut down Oshawa's truck plant, blaming weak demand for pickup trucks and SUVs. The city has a long history of labor unrest. When the truck plant closure was announced, a convoy of some 250 cars surrounded GM's Oshawa operations, temporarily halting production.

During a 1996 strike, amid rumors that the company would try to restart production, a group of workers took over the plant, welding the doors shut behind them.

OKAZAKI, Japan (Reuters) - A senior executive at Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211) said on Tuesday its alliance with Nissan Motor (T:7201) and  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) can survive management upheaval, a day after it fired Carlos Ghosn as chairman over financial misconduct allegations.
The future of the 19-year alliance, one of the biggest automotive groups in the world, has been thrown into doubt after the Nov. 19 arrest and subsequent ousting of Ghosn as chairman of both Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors.
Ghosn, 64, is the architect of the alliance and its chairman. He also remains CEO and chairman of Renault.
Senior executives of the alliance are due to meet for their regularly scheduled gathering later this week in Amsterdam that sources said would start on Wednesday. 
Executives are also expected to discuss Ghosn's chairmanship of the alliance, one source at Nissan told Reuters, seeking anonymity because the contents of the meeting are not public.
Mitsubishi CEO Osamu Masuko said on Monday he would join the meeting via video link, while Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa, who remains in Japan, hasn't decided whether he will travel for the meeting, two company sources said. Nissan declined to comment.
A major longer-term focus is whether and how the ownership structure of the alliance might evolve, as Ghosn, under pressure from the French government, had pushed for a deeper tie-up, including potentially a full merger between Renault and Nissan, despite strong reservations at Nissan.
Renault holds around 43 percent of Nissan, which in turn owns a controlling 34 percent stake in Mitsubishi Motors. Nissan, the biggest partner in the alliance by sales, has a non-voting 15 percent stake in the French partner.
Speaking to reporters at a research and development center in Okazaki, central Japan, Mitsubishi Executive Vice President Mitsuhiko Yamashita said that regardless of the shape the alliance takes, the three companies would continue to source more parts together and leverage their ties to develop new technologies.
""I can't say how the three-way partnership might evolve, but as car-making requires more and more new technologies, the days when a single car maker can handle everything on its own are going to disappear,"" Yamashita, who once served as Nissan's top engineer, said.
RENAULT AUDIT
Renault will appoint a new chief compliance officer to head the carmaker's own independent audit triggered by Nissan's allegations against Ghosn, three sources said on Tuesday, two days after Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire announced the probe.
The investigation will conduct checks on Ghosn's pay and benefits as well as those of his immediate staff and executives, they said. The promotion of security chief Eric Le Grand to the new compliance role was first reported by Les Echos.
Ghosn is in detention in Tokyo over suspicion of financial misconduct, including alleged understating of his income and personal use of corporate money. He has denied those allegations, public broadcaster NHK has reported.
He has not made public comments on the allegations and Reuters could not contact him or his lawyers for comments.
Yamashita said the alliance would need to work out who would make decisions, and how, without the binding figure of Ghosn, but was confident the partnership was strong enough to withstand the challenge.
""Renault and Nissan have a history of nearly 20 years, and we're coming up on two years since Mitsubishi Motors joined,"" he said. ""The foundation on which the cooperation has been built is becoming strong so I have faith that we can work with that.""
Sealed in 1999 when Nissan was rescued from near-bankruptcy, the Franco-Japanese alliance was enlarged in 2016 to include Mitsubishi and enabled the members to jointly develop products and control costs.
Yamashita's remark echoes comments by Saikawa who told staff in a town hall meeting on Monday that the alliance remained important to generate synergies.
Saikawa also said there was an ""excessive concentration of power"" on Ghosn, and that in future alliance members should communicate better to help preserve their independence.
FRESH ALLEGATIONS
In fresh allegations on Tuesday, Japanese media reported that Ghosn had shifted personal investment losses incurred during the 2008 financial crisis to Nissan to avoid millions of dollars in losses for himself.
Citing several unidentified sources, the Asahi Shimbun newspaper said that when Ghosn's bank had called for more collateral from the executive, he instead handed the rights over the derivatives trade to Nissan, which effectively shouldered 1.7 billion yen ($15 million) in losses.
Japan's Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission (SESC) discovered this incident during that year's routine inspection, the newspaper said.
Nissan said it could not comment on the report. An SESC spokesman said the watchdog could not comment on individual cases.

308,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2018 09:35AM ET</span>",Banks extend UK plc's overdraft ahead of Brexit,"By Iain Withers
LONDON (Reuters) - Banks in Britain are trying to prepare businesses for a potential cash crunch after Brexit, whether or not a deal agreed by the UK and Brussels this weekend is approved by parliament next month.
Banks fear Britain's departure from the European Union could cause a spike in bad loans with corporate clients, if it leads to delays in cross-border shipments and payments or big swings in sterling.
To protect against these risks some banks are extending credit early to companies and selling insurance against volatility in sterling.
State-controlled Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS) trebled its ""growth fund"" for small businesses last month from 1 billion to 3 billion pounds ($3.86 billion), saying it had set aside extra cash to help customers to get through Brexit.
It said it may need to top up the pot again. ""To a large extent it depends on the type of Brexit we get,"" Mike Slevin, head of capital management at the bank, told Reuters. 
It has identified nearly 2,000 at-risk companies across several sectors it believes are exposed to a Brexit fallout. 
These include those reliant on complex overseas supply chains – such as car part manufacturers and medicine makers – and those susceptible to an economic downturn - such as leisure and construction.
Credit being offered by RBS includes increased import and export funding, supply chain finance and bigger working capital lines for everyday operations, Slevin said. It is logging where credit is taken up due to Brexit to track the impact.
But take-up has been slow so far and small firms are not as prepared as they ought to be, Slevin said.
""Many want to hold back from increasing lines until a little closer to the time because of the cost. So it's a slow burn."" 
CYBG (L:CYBGC) - which owns the Clydesdale, Yorkshire and Virgin Money (LON:VM) brands – has also been contacting businesses to offer credit, including farmers across Yorkshire and Scotland that account for a significant chunk of its business loan book.
British farmers are reliant on support payments from the EU, and while these are guaranteed by the British government for up to three years after it leaves the EU in March next year, the FTSE 250 lender wants to smooth any bumps in the road.
""We have worked with a good number of our customers in agriculture. We are making sure they are financially ready,” CYBG chief financial officer Ian Smith told Reuters.
Silicon Valley Bank, a U.S.-based lender focused on the technology sector, has in recent months sold a large number of currency hedges to start-up companies in Britain exposed to fluctuations in the sterling/dollar exchange rate .
""A number of our clients have raised funding in dollars with U.S. investors but have costs largely in sterling, so they've been entering into forward contracts to lock in rates,"" said Phil Cox, head of EMEA for the bank.
The majority view among tech firms is that a Brexit deal will be finalised, he said, triggering a rally in the pound that would leave clients with unhedged dollar positions vulnerable.
Some British companies have also been taking action to protect against potential Brexit disruption.
These include Mr Kipling cakes baker  Premier Foods  (L:PFD), industrial products group  Electrocomponents  (L:ECM) and online white goods seller AO World (L:AO).
Tile retailer  Topps Tiles  (L:TPT) said on Tuesday it was also increasing inventories of some products in preparation for any supply problems. The company declined to comment on whether it had asked its banks to extend credit lines.
British banks have had low bad debts over the past few years through a period of rock bottom Bank of England interest rates and economic growth.
But finance industry analysts say these historically low levels of impairments on British banks' loan books cannot last.
""We expect impairments to get back to more normalized levels. A hard Brexit would no doubt accelerate that,"" John Cronin, banking analyst at Goodbody, said. 
The threat of a rise in bad loans is one of the reasons why Brexit has depressed British bank stock prices and delayed capital returns for long-suffering investors. 
The Bank of England will release the results of its latest health check of the country's banks, including the potential impact of a chaotic Brexit, on Wednesday.
CYBG for one is holding on to the bulk of its excess capital in case of a Brexit shock. ""Some investors are talking to us about return of excess capital, but it is not the right time to have that conversation,"" CYBG's Smith said.

309,By Business Insider,"<span>Nov 27, 2018 09:32AM ET</span>",GM warned Trump that his China tariffs would hurt jobs. He now complains that it's happening,"US President Donald Trump is railing against General Motors (NYSE:GM)' decision to close plants and ax up to 14,000 jobs, something his trade war helped trigger in the first place.
When listing reasons behind the job cuts on Monday, GM tiptoed around trade policy and blamed a  host of other factors. But the company has been much more direct in its criticism of Trump's trade war in the past.
Earlier this year, GM lowered its profit forecasts for 2018, citing higher steel and aluminum prices caused by new US tariffs. And in June, GM warned that trade tariffs could lead to job losses and lower wages, telling the Commerce Department that higher steel tariffs would affect competitiveness.
The automaker, which employs about 110,000 workers, on Monday said it planned to halt production at a plant in Ohio, a state that voted for Trump in 2016.
GM did not specifically mention tariffs, instead citing ""changing market conditions and customer preferences"" among the reasons.
Trump  lashed out at CEO Mary Barra. ""I was very tough,"" he said,  per CNN. ""I spoke with her when I heard they were closing, and I said, you know, this country has done a lot for General Motors. The United States saved General Motors, and for her to take that company out of Ohio is not good.""
Trump said he told the CEO that she had ""better"" reopen plants in the US soon.
Trump's trade war shows no signs of abating. He told The Wall Street Journal on Monday that he was likely to go ahead with a hike on tariffs on Chinese goods, increasing them  to 25% from 10%. The tariffs have so far hammered  global shipping,  US farmers, and, perhaps, even  iPhone users.
GM on Monday said its Lordstown Assembly plant in Warren, Ohio, would be ""unallocated"" by the end of 2019, as would its Oshawa Assembly plant in Oshawa, Ontario, its Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly plant in Detroit, and its propulsion-component plants in Maryland and Michigan. It also said it would cease operations at two unnamed assembly plants outside the US.
The stock soared 4.8% on Monday's announcement. On Tuesday, however, GM shares were down 1.5% in premarket trading as of 11 a.m. in London (6 a.m. EST)."

The S&P 500 fell 10 points or 0.40% to 2,662.63 as of 9:30 AM ET (14:31 GMT), while the Dow slipped 83 points, or 0.34%, to 24,557.02 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was down 39 points, or 0.56% to 7,042.18.
Comments from Clarida dampened investor sentiment, as he noted that interest rates are closer to neutral. The central bank should take a gradual approach to rising rates based on data, he added.
“As the economy has moved to a neighborhood consistent with the Fed’s dual-mandate objectives, risks have become more symmetric and less skewed to the downside than when the current rate cycle began three years ago,’’ he said.
Meanwhile, U.S.-China trade also worried investors after President Donald Trump told The Wall Street Journal that it is “highly unlikely” that he will hold off on raising tariff rates on China from 10% to 25%. The increase on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports is expected to take effect on Jan. 1.
Semiconductor maker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) was among the top gainers, rising 0.90%, while medical marijuana company  Canopy Growth  (NYSE:CGC) gained 0.82% and Micron (NASDAQ:MU) increased 0.52%.
Elsewhere, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) slumped 1.80% after Trump suggested a 10% tariff increase on iPhones and laptops imported from China. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell 2%, while Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) inched down 1% and General Motors (NYSE:GM) decreased 1.31%.
In commodities, gold futures fell 0.07% to $1,227.90 a troy ounce and crude oil jumped 0.19% to $51.73 a barrel. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, gained 0.19% to 97.162."

The electric-car maker sold just 211 vehicles in the world's largest auto market in October, down 70% from a year ago, according to Reuters, citing an official from China Passenger Car Association. The source attributed Tesla's underperforming sales to the ongoing US-China trade war.
On Thursday, Tesla said it was slashing prices on its Model X and Model S vehicles in China by 12% to 26% to help offset some of the impacts from President Donald Trump's trade war. 
""We are absorbing a significant part of the tariff to help make our cars more affordable for customers in China,"" Tesla said in a statement sent to Reuters. 
Earlier this year, the Trump administration imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, prompting Beijing to retaliate. In July, Beijing raised  tariffs on imports of US autos to 40% amid a worsening trade standoff with the US.
Tesla in October secured a site in Shanghai, China, for its  first overseas Gigafactory in order to help avoid the steep tariffs.
Tesla was up 8% this year through Monday.

LONDON (Reuters) - A couple of weeks ago it was 10-year Treasuries, last week 5-year bonds: hedge funds are shifting their view of the Fed and U.S. interest rates by magnitudes rarely seen before.
Speculators on U.S. futures markets slashed their bearish bets on 5-year Treasuries last week by the fifth largest amount since the Commodity Futures Trading Commission began compiling data in 1995.
This follows the third largest ever reversal in short 10-year Treasury futures the week before, and underscores the view that the Fed won't raise rates next year nearly as much as it has indicated.
Slowing growth and wobbly stock markets won't allow it.
Fed officials, led by vice chairman Richard Clarida, have struck a more cautious and dovish tone in recent weeks. A rate hike next month is fully priced, but fed funds futures now only fully discount one more increase next year.
The Fed will update its guidance at its Dec 18-19 meeting, but as of September the broad outlook pointed to three or maybe even four rate increases next year. Speculators are clearly taking the ""under"" on that trade.
CFTC data for the week ending Tuesday Nov. 20 show that funds and speculative accounts slashed their net short 5-year Treasury futures position by 124,356 contracts to 446,186 contracts. There have only been four bigger weekly positioning swings in favor of bonds since 1995.

Funds' short position in 5-year bonds has virtually halved from the record net short of 867,556 contracts in August, and bullish momentum is accelerating rapidly. It has only been greater twice before: mid-2017 and March-June 2008.

The 5-year yield hit a decade-high of 3.10 percent on Nov. 8 but has fallen right back through 3.00 pct since. If the prospects for steady and continued Fed tightening fade, the 5-year yield may not be spending much more time above 3.00 pct.
5-year U.S. Treasury yield: https://tmsnrt.rs/2RhU70q
The outlook for U.S. growth next year has darkened in recent weeks, thanks to the Trump administration's tax cuts and fiscal stimulus wearing off mid-2019, a diminishing ""wealth effect"" from fragile stock markets, brewing global trade tensions, and the cumulative effect of three years of rising interest rates.
Plus, the U.S. expansion is already close to the longest in history. The end is drawing closer and funds are beginning to position themselves for it. Can the Fed continue to tighten policy at the same pace or at all?
Economists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JP Morgan think so, and are sticking to their forecasts of four rate hikes next year. But the San Francisco Fed suggests policy may be too tight already, arguing that much of the pick-up in inflation is down to ""acyclical factors"", and not the strengthening economy.
""While risks to the outlook for inflation appear broadly balanced, they include the considerable possibility that inflation has not yet sustainably reached target,"" the San Francisco Fed said in a paper published this week.
A flattening yield curve is often interpreted as a sign that the bond market believes the longer-term growth and inflation outlook is dimming, which will limit the scope for higher interest rates.
And that's exactly how hedge funds and speculators appear to be playing it. The latest CFTC data show that while funds cut back on their short positions in 5-year and 10-year bonds, they stuck with their huge short position in the two-year space.
Speculator positioning in 2y Treasuries - CFTC: https://tmsnrt.rs/2RjQqHK
They trimmed that position to 361,057 contracts from a record 362,374 contracts the week before. Effectively, funds are positioning for a flatter curve through short-term yields remaining elevated and longer-term yields drifting lower.
The curve has flattened over the last couple of months as stocks have wilted and growth fears have mushroomed. It's not inverted yet - the classic precursor of every U.S. recession in the past half century - but it's back at August's multi-year low and now only 22 basis points away from inversion.
Of course, stretched positions, pricing, valuations and momentum are usually flashing lights for hedge funds to go against the tide and bet the other way. We're not seeing it right across the U.S. bond market yet though.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - H&M (ST:HMB), the world's second-biggest fashion retailer, said on Tuesday it would close down its struggling independent brand Cheap Monday.
H&M in 2008 bought Fabric Scandinavien AB, the owner of the Cheap Monday brand, whose trademark product is low-priced skinny jeans, and the store chains Weekday and Monki. 
Cheap Monday products are sold mainly through around 3,000 resellers world-wide. They are also sold through its own online store, a flagship store in London and on online marketplaces Asos (L:ASOS) and Zalando (DE:ZALG). 
""Cheap Monday has a traditional wholesale business model, which is a model that has faced major challenges due to the shift in the industry,"" H&M said in a statement. 
""There has been a negative trend in the Cheap Monday's sales and profits for a long time. The H&M group therefore intends to close down  Cheap Monday."" 
Fabric Scandinavien was H&M's first-ever acquisition. H&M has since then launched several independent chains such as COS and & Other Stories to broaden its customer base. 
""We see very good opportunities and great potential for all of the other brands within New Business, which all are developing positively both digitally as well as through physical stores,"" H&M said on Tuesday. 
Its core H&M brand, which has struggled to adapt to the online shift in the industry, still accounts for the bulk of business. 
H&M said it aimed to complete the closure of Cheap Monday, which affects around 80 employees, by the end of June 2019.

""There are way too many players in Europe,"" Carsten Spohr told a meeting of the Centre for Aviation in Berlin on Tuesday, noting that six airlines had gone bankrupt in the last few months. 
""It is obvious that consolidation will act further and we as Lufthansa want to be part of that,"" he said. 
Lufthansa has been a key player in hectic M&A activity in the industry, snapping up Brussels Airlines and parts of insolvent Air Berlin last year to expand in the budget market.
Spohr said there were three major global airlines in the Chinese, American and Middle East markets and he expected a similar shake-out in Europe.
""There will most likely be three major European network carriers or groups of carriers, plus one or two low cost guys,"" he said.
""Our job in Lufthansa ... is to make sure the company is fit enough to play in this league of global champions league players in our industry.""
He said consolidation seemed to be happening mostly via bankruptcy rather than airlines buying rivals as going concerns.
Lufthansa is among several airlines that have been in talks with Italy since Alitalia first went into administration.
Spohr expects some European airline brands to survive as part of broader groups, noting that passengers still loved the ""Swissness"" of its SWISS subsidiary a decade after Lufthansa took over the former flag carrier Swissair.
""Here in Europe brands still matter a lot,"" he said.

332,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2018 07:00AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Traders in talks to form first LME ring member in decade,"By Eric Onstad
LONDON (Reuters) - A group of traders are in talks with Sigma Broking Ltd to create the first new open-outcry member of the London Metal Exchange (LME) in more than a decade, three industry sources said. 
Discussions have been going on for several months, including with the LME, but a deal has not yet been finalised and no formal application to the world's top metals exchange has been submitted, said the sources, who declined to be identified. 
Privately-owned Sigma, the LME and Chris Adams, the head of the dealers' group, all declined to comment. 
A new member would be fresh blood for the LME ring, the last open-outcry trading venue in Europe, which has steadily lost members over the years.
The LME - owned by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (HK:0388) - has nine firms that trade in the ring, down from about 30 during a peak in the late 1980s.
In 2014, the LME's new management reviewed operations and decided to keep its open-outcry trading, bucking a trend by most other markets to shift to all-electronic operations. 
If the partnership between the ring dealers and Sigma is finalised and accepted by the LME, it would mark the first new ring member on the LME since EDF (PA:EDF) & Man joined in 2007, not including companies that have taken over existing members.
Chinese broker GF Financial Markets and China Construction Bank International bought existing LME ring dealers Natixis in 2013 and Metdist in 2016 respectively.
In the ring, a circle of padded red-leather seats, traders use arcane hand signals during five-minute bursts of intense trading in copper, aluminum, zinc, lead, nickel and zinc.
The ring has its roots in the early 19th century when the Royal Exchange, the world’s first commodities market, became so crowded, metal merchants gathered at the Jerusalem coffee house on Cornhill in the City to conduct business.
METALS EXPERIENCE
Sigma mainly trades listed derivatives for institutional clients, including some commodities, according to its website, but it is not a member of the LME, the world's oldest and largest market for industrial metals.
Sigma's Chief Executive David Mudie was head of the UK arm of broker R.J. O'Brien Ltd until he joined Sigma in February 2017, according to his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile. He declined to comment. 
Chicago-based R.J. O'Brien, which bills itself as the oldest and largest independent U.S. broker, became a Category 2 member of the LME in July 2015 while Mudie was chief executive of the UK business. 
Second tier LME members are allowed to trade on the LME's electronic platforms and the telephone market but not in the ring.
Sigma has had a good year, posting a profit of 2.29 million pounds ($2.92 million) in the financial year to the end of May, up from 223,175 pounds in the previous period, according to accounts filed at UK Companies House.
Sigma, majority owned by trader Matthew Kent, had available cash of 1.7 million pounds at the end of May, up from 124,917 pounds at the same time last year, the filing showed. 
LME REQUIRES CAPITAL 
In August, Sigma sold its spread betting arm Sigma Trading to InterTrader, owned by FTSE-100 gambling firm GVC Holdings plc (L:GVC), the accounts showed.
The proceeds from that deal would help provide the capital to invest in an expanded metals operation, industry sources said. 
The dealers group's Adams is head of LME ring dealing strategy for Sucden Financial, one of nine Category 1, open-outcry members of the 141-year-old LME. 
Sucden declined to comment.
While Adams has extensive experience with LME ring trading, especially on lucrative spread trades, he would need the backing of an established firm such as Sigma to establish a new ring trader, the sources said.
Adams served as a director of Sigma London LLP, a firm linked to Sigma Broking, from 2005-2011, filings show.
To be approved as a top-tier LME member, a firm must have capital of at least $5 million, be approved by UK regulators the Financial Conduct Authority and get the green light from the LME executive and board.

DUBAI (Reuters) - DBS (SI:DBSM), Southeast Asia's largest bank, said it would almost double its Dubai private banking staff in its bid to triple revenue for those operations in the Middle East by 2023, capitalizing on a shift of investments towards Asia.
The Singapore bank is joining Citibank (N:C) and other global lenders expanding wealth management operations in the region. The prospective client base includes wealthy Middle East business people, family offices and non-resident Indians.
DBS said it planned to double headcount for its private bank in Dubai by 2023 from about 11 now to about 20.
""This region is not yet a big part of our wealth management revenues today as we are an Asian bank but its the fastest growing part,"" said Tan Su Shan, group head of wealth management and consumer banking. ""It's been growing at double digits.""
Wealth management contributes about 2.6 billion Singapore dollars ($1.89 billion) to DBS revenues, she said.
In the past, clients in the region would focus investments towards Switzerland, United States and Britain, Rudiger von Wedel, managing director and head of international at DBS Private Bank, told a news conference.
""The whole focus of the region is shifting towards the East,"" he said. ""What I have seen since 2012-2013 is more and more shift towards Asia.""
Other banks are also expanding in the region.
Citibank (N:C) aims to lift its wealth management customer base by 18 percent in the United Arab Emirates in 2018 and 24 percent in 2019.

336,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2018 06:16AM ET</span>",Political divisions cloud Poland climate talks,"By Nina Chestney
LONDON (Reuters) - Divisions within Europe and tension between the United States and China pose major challenges to the next round of United Nations talks on climate change.
The most important U.N. climate conference since the Paris Agreement of 2015 opens on Sunday in Katowice, Poland, in one of the most polluted coal-mining regions in Europe. Success, according to the conference's Polish host, will need a miracle.
Delegates from about 195 nations are on a deadline to produce a ""rule book"" to flesh out details of the pact, which the United States, at the behest of President Donald Trump, has announced it will quit.
The 2015 deal aims to shift the world economy away from fossil fuels and limit the rise in global temperatures to between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius to avert more extreme weather, rising sea levels and the loss of plant and animal species.
The pact was 20 years in the making and commits almost every country to fight global warming. But rules are needed to bring about real cuts in emissions and ensure they are closely monitored.
U.N. scientists in October added to pressure for a strong outcome from the talks, saying the world will hit the 1.5C threshold around 2040 and unprecedented changes are needed in the way people use energy.
Despite this call for unified action, there are divisions within the European Union and trade tensions between the United States and China, all of which have implications for climate policy.
The president of the talks, Poland's former deputy energy minister Michał Kurtyka, has expressed hopes of a compromise while at same time acknowledging the scope of the task ahead. 
""Only by a miracle can we realize success,"" he said last month, although miracles were ""a Polish speciality"".
Then earlier this month he added: ""Undoubtedly, the geopolitical situation in 2015 was much easier for discussing global agreements than the one we have in 2018. However, my talks with representatives from the whole world show that there is a willingness to reach a compromise in Katowice.""
POLITICAL, ECONOMIC RIFTS
Developing nations and those vulnerable to climate change, such as islands and low-lying states, are looking to big industrialized countries to deepen cuts in emissions.
Senior Chinese climate change official Li Gao told reporters last month that some industrialized countries more responsible for climate change were backsliding on the ""polluter pays"" principle, which ""will make it hard to reach a consensus"". 
In the European Union, European Commission climate chief Miguel Arias Canete's call for more ambitious goals was rebuffed by Chancellor Angela Merkel, who said it would be counter-productive because some European countries, including Germany, were struggling to meet their targets.
The United States has a seat at the negotiating table until it can formally quit in November 2020 at the earliest.
It may use its remaining time to try to develop ammunition for its trade dispute with China. Former climate and energy adviser to President Trump, George David Banks, told Reuters the administration wants to make sure it ""corrects as many of the flaws of the agreement that it can"".
The United States has always been interested in getting a robust framework for reporting and measuring emissions cuts, particularly for developing countries such as China.
""It helps inform your trade policymaking and negotiations vis-a-vis the Chinese and others,"" Banks said.

The United States also plans to promote fossil and nuclear fuels at the talks, repeating a strategy that infuriated global-warming activists last year.

337,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2018 06:10AM ET</span>",European shares would suffer more in a global trade war: ECB,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Euro zone shares would suffer more than their U.S. counterparts in the event of a full-blown global trade war but emerging markets would likely take an even bigger hit, research published by the European Central Bank suggested on Tuesday. 
Trade tensions have risen this year as the United States imposed a plethora of protectionist measures, mostly tariffs on China, raising the risk of an escalation that could exacerbate an already notable slowdown in worldwide trade.
""U.S. equity prices would fall by about 10 percent and U.S. corporate bond spreads would increase by up to 100 basis points in the first year,"" in an all-out trade war, the ECB said, describing that scenario as 25 percent import tariffs imposed by all countries on each other.
""In the euro area, equity prices would fall by 15 percent and corporate bond spreads would increase by 150 basis point in the first year,"" the ECB added in a chapter of its Financial Stability Review.
But emerging markets would suffer a more than 20 percent fall in share prices and a more than 400 basis point rise in risk premia, the ECB said.
Up to now, European shares have fallen about as much as their U.S. counterparts after the announcement of protectionist measures, the study said. If the tensions escalated but remained quite limited, those symmetrical price drops would likely continue, it added.
Shares dropped by a cumulative 7 percent on both sides of the Atlantic around key announcements of protectionist measures earlier this year and the drop was 12 percent for companies specifically impacted by the announcements.
""The symmetric reaction between the United States and the euro area suggests that markets view increases in tariffs as a lose-lose situation for all parties involved,"" the research, said.

""The reason for this likely lies in anticipated retaliation and second-round effects, which are mostly interpreted as a lose-lose situation for the global economy,"" the study added.

China is expected to triple its nuclear power capacity to reach 120-150 GW in total by 2030 as part of Beijing's push to boost clean energy consumption.
Pre-allocated 2019 import quotas for tax exemption on nuclear reactors with capacities of more than 1 gigawatt (GW) to Chinese manufacturing companies will also be canceled, the Finance Ministry said in a statement on Tuesday. 
China has already committed itself to using advanced, safer and larger third-generation reactors, including Westinghouse's AP1000 and Areva's  EPR, as well as its own home-grown Hualong One. 
Last month, the United States said it was tightening controls on China's imports of civil nuclear technology to prevent its use for military or other unauthorized purposes amid growing trade tension between the two countries.
All of the 37 nuclear reactors in operation and half of the 20 reactors under construction are second or advanced-second generation, according to data from the China Nuclear Energy Association.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese chat app operator Line Corp (T:3938) will set up a bank with Mizuho Financial Group Inc (T:8411) and also partner China's Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700) to offer mobile payment services - plans which saw its stock rise 13 percent on Tuesday.
Pending regulatory approval, the bank will provide financial services to Line's almost 80 million users from 2020, Line and Mizuho said, without detailing the services to be offered. Line will hold 51 percent of the bank with Mizuho owning the rest.
Separately, Line said Japanese retailers offering Line Pay services will be able to process payments from Chinese tourists using Tencent's WeChat Pay beginning early next year.
The moves come as Line seeks alternative revenue streams to offset stagnating user numbers for its eponymous flagship app, expanding into areas such as payments, stock broking, insurance and cryptocurrencies.
""We expect financial services to start contributing to profit in the medium term,"" Line Chief Executive Takeshi Idezawa said at a strategy briefing. ""We are making big investments in fintech and AI,"" he said, referring to financial technology and artificial intelligence. 
Japan's tech firms are increasingly looking for growth by offering financial services to their existing user base. The trend has also been seen at retailers in recent years, with convenience store operator  Lawson Inc  (T:2651) entering the banking sector just last month.
For traditional lenders such as Mizuho, hamstrung by years of low interest rates, tie-ups with tech firms offer an opportunity to attract younger, tech-savvy customers.
""It will give us a point of contact with a young generation, which we megabanks are not good at reaching,"" said Mizuho's head of retail banking, Toshitsugu Okabe.
Mizuho joins another of Japan's financial giants, Nomura Holdings Inc (T:8604), in teaming up with Line. In May, the country's biggest brokerage and investment banking group said it would set up an internet-focused securities brokerage with Line.
News of the tie-ups on Tuesday lifted Line shares to close up 13 percent, adding about $1 billion to the firm's market value. The stock is still down more than 16 percent this year. Mizuho and Tencent's shares were flat.

Both Alibaba and Didi Chuxing are portfolio companies of Japan's SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984).

Japan has been slow to move to cashless payments, with a rush of entrants such as Line Pay and SoftBank-backed PayPay encouraging consumers to use QR code-based payments, which have become widespread in China, India and elsewhere.

343,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2018 04:11AM ET</span>",European shares dip as focus turns to Sino-U.S. trade dispute,"By Danilo Masoni
MILAN (Reuters) - European shares fell on Tuesday after a new threat by Washington to impose tariffs on more Chinese imports, while Thomas Cook tanked on a profit warning.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) benchmark index fell 0.2 percent by 0851 GMT percent, pulling back from the one-week high reached the day before on optimism over Brexit and a possible Italian budget compromise with Brussels. 
""The positivity that started the week was nowhere to be seen on Tuesday, with Donald Trump pouring more fuel on the trade war fire while unleashing some unhelpful Brexit comments,"" said Connor Campbell, analyst Spreadex.com. 
The U.S. president said on Monday he expected to raise tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports to 25 percent from the current 10 percent and repeated his threat to impose tariffs on all remaining imports from China.
Among the leading sectoral fallers on Tuesday were mining companies (SXPP), down 1 percent as copper prices slid for the third day, pressured by Trump comments. The export-oriented auto sector (SXAP) fell 0.6 percent. 
Travel stocks were under pressure after Thomas Cook cut its profit forecast for the second time in two months and suspended its dividend after the hot British summer deterred holidaymakers from going abroad.
Thomas Cook (L:TCG) shares fell 30 percent to a six-year low, putting the stock on track for its biggest one-day drop since end 2011. 
Its slump dragged down shares in other travel companies. TUI (DE:TUIGn) fell 5.1 percent to the bottom of the STOXX 600. 
""It’s been a challenging year for travel operators and airlines, buffeted by the `Beast from the East' at the beginning of the year, and then by industrial action in Europe, as well as rising oil prices through the summer,"" said Michael Hewson, an analyst at CMC Markets.
However,  Accor , (PA:ACCP) rose more than 1 percent. Europe's largest hotels company stuck to its target of doubling core earnings to 1.2 billion euros by 2022.
 Tele2  (ST:TEL2b) rallied for a second day, up 7.5 percent, following a Reuters report that the European Commission was set to approve without conditions the sale of its Dutch business to Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn).
Following the report, which has rekindled expectations of more dealmaking in the sector, Tele2 said it was optimistic the EU would approve the planned merger.

Among other top movers on the STOXX were UDG Healthcare (L:UDG), down 6.7 percent after results. Traders pointed out weak cash flow figures.

344,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2018 03:55AM ET</span>",China sets new rules to reduce 'too big to fail' risk,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's financial regulators on Tuesday released broad guidelines on new rules aimed at tightening supervision of financial institutions that are deemed ""too big to fail"", the latest step by Beijing to fend off systemic financial risks.
Regulators led by China's central bank will shortlist financial institutions accounting for at least 75 percent of total assets in their respective sectors - or at least 30 banks, 10 securities firms and 10 insurance companies - as potential systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) for a review each year, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said in an online statement.
Financial regulators will evaluate the impact of a potential failure of the short-listed institutions and submit an initial list of SIFIs to the State Council's Financial Stability and Development Committee, which will make the final decision on the list.
The new rules come at a time when China's policymakers are seeking to tighten regulations and rein in risky practices in the broader financial industry.
SIFIs will be asked to comply with additional regulatory requirements on capitalization, leverage ratios, liquidity and large exposure risks to avoid ""blind expansion"", the statement said.
The additional requirements will mean higher compliance costs for the institutions, though regulators will grant them a grace period to adapt to the tighter rules, the statement said.
The central bank and other regulators will also create a crisis management team to ensure immediate action is taken to prevent systemic risks in the event a SIFI fails.
In adverse situations that could threaten systemic financial stability SIFIs may seek help from industry security funds and even ""emergency liquidity support or bailouts"" from the central bank, the statement said.
Regulators will periodically conduct stress tests on SIFIs.

More detailed sector-specific rules for banks, securities firms and insurers will be released in the future, the statement said.

349,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2018 01:34AM ET</span>","Australia's AMP to spend over $852 million in remediation, CEO tells inquiry","By Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's largest-listed wealth manager, AMP Ltd (AX:AMP), told an inquiry on Tuesday it expected to spend A$1.18 billion ($852.6 million) to compensate customers who had received bad advice or been charged for no service. 
AMP interim Chief Executive Michael Wilkins told the powerful Royal Commission inquiry into financial-sector misconduct the discrepancy with the A$290 million it had previously put aside for refunds was due to accounting rules.
The firm has been rocked by revelations of widespread misconduct including charging customers without providing a service and conspiring at board level to deceive a regulator about the practice.
Former director Wilkins replaced the previous CEO and chairman after the inquiry revealed their alleged involvement in misleading regulators. 
He said there was a risk that an extensive review of over 217,000 customer files could find further problems. 
In July AMP told investors it had put A$290 million aside to compensate customers for poor advice and expected to spend A$50 million in each of the next three years on a review of fees and advice across its network of financial advisors, the country's largest.
Asked by a lawyer assisting the inquiry whether AMP faced the risk of finding further cases of fees-for-no-service, Wilkins replied ""yes"". 
The Sydney-based firm has already lost over half of its market value since the inquiry began in February, hit by an exodus of customers abandoning and fears that reforms ensuing from the inquiry could threaten its business model, such as forcing the separation of its advice and product manufacturing units.
The inquiry's final report due in February 2019 is expected to recommend tougher regulation and potential prosecutions.
National Australia Bank Ltd (AX:NAB) Chairman Ken Henry earlier on Tuesday told the inquiry he regretted his board's failure to step in after the lender took three years to agree a refund for thousands of pension fund investors charged fees for advice they never received.
The inquiry continues its final week of public hearings with AMP's Wilkins returning to the stand on Wednesday morning. He is expected to be followed with testimony from Shayne Elliott, the chief executive of Australia's third-largest lender, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ).

The move aims to help small businesses in Japan to serve Chinese tourists. The service is expected to begin next year. Small businesses will then be able to use Line terminals compatible with Tencent’s WeChat Pay to receive payments.
The partnership will help Tencent to tap into Japan’s mobile payment landscape and Line to capitalise on the Chinese tourism boom.
Last year, around 7.35 million Chinese tourists visited Japan, three times the number from three years ago.
Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) and SoftBank inked a similar partnership in the space, launching the PayPay mobile service this fall. The two later partnered with  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) so that Alipay users can pay at some PayPay member stores.

353,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 27, 2018 12:00AM ET</span>",Not Even Tencent Can Make Up for Line's Lost Friends,"(Bloomberg Opinion) --  Line Corp  (NYSE:LN). investors are so desperate for any shred of good news that reports of a tie-up with Tencent Holdings Ltd. drove the stock’s biggest gain in two years.
Users of Tencent’s WeChat Pay will be able to buy goods through Line’s platform at Japanese retail outlets, the Nikkei reported Tuesday. Merchants will be able to capitalize on the flow of Chinese travelers to Japan using Line payments terminals that will be compatible with WeChat Pay, it said. A press conference was scheduled for later in the day, Bloomberg subsequently reported.
The share spike of as much as 17 percent merely retraced a third of the ground lost since a peak in September. 
Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst Vey-Sern Ling quickly poured cold water on the notion that teaming up with Tencent would be any boon to the company’s bottom line:
The service merely allows Japanese retailers to accept Tencent's WeChat Pay. This helps attract Chinese tourist spending, yet has been available to  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA)'s Alipay users for some time.
Ouch. Scathing, but true.
Even if the Tencent deal were to add something more than mere payments, that would be unlikely to change the near-term trajectory of the Japanese company.
Line’s “other business” – which includes Fintech, AI, Commerce and Mobile – accounted for less than 4 percent of revenue in the most recent quarter at 2.03 billion yen ($17.9 million). The “payments processing and licensing expenses” line item was three times that at 7.5 billion yen. 
It’s always good to have more friends, so the Tencent cooperation isn’t a bad deal. But it’s not enough to change the fact that that Line’s core business, based on instant messaging, is looking weak and management appears to have no strategy in place to expand its user base. By the end of September the company had 3 million fewer users in its four key countries than a year earlier.
Tencent, by comparison, managed to add 102.5 million users to WeChat over the same period despite already being a Goliath. Of course, the company has the China sandpit all to itself and Line has zero chance of gaining entry thanks to government censorship and protectionism. 
But Line has ready access to Asia’s third-largest country, Indonesia, and still managed to mess up: It shed 37 percent of monthly active messaging users in just one year and now counts just 22 million there. The company tried to paper over that decline by explaining that consumers were more engaged with Line Today, its news-feed service, with 40 million users, than the chat app itself. It seems almost proud to have shifted consumers from active to passive engagement. 
The best thing that Line could get out of Tencent is some lessons on product strategy. The Shenzhen-based company knows it’s the user base that underpins all the services you build on top. Witness Tencent’s reticence to open up its timeline feed to too many ads lest consumers get annoyed and disengage. By comparison, Line is getting a growing reputation for becoming spammy, which is ironically pushing many toward WeChat or WhatsApp.
Bruised Line investors are eager for a turnaround story. This Tencent Pay deal isn’t it.

355,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 26, 2018 11:20PM ET</span>","Top Fund Buys Tencent and China Stocks, Sells U.S. Tech Giants","(Bloomberg) -- A top-performing global equity fund is picking up battered Tencent Holdings Ltd. shares and doubling down on China as it pares its exposure to some of Wall Street’s biggest tech stocks.
Tencent’s messaging service WeChat is too powerful to ignore, and its shares have fallen far enough, said Peter Chang, vice president at Nomura Asset Management Taiwan Ltd. The $260-million Nomura Global Equity Fund, which has outperformed 98 percent of its peers with an annualized year-to-date return of 4.3 percent, has more than doubled its exposure to China since September on bets government stimulus will boost shares. The fund has reduced some U.S. tech stocks on concern valuations were getting too high.
""With the two-pronged approach in monetary and fiscal policies, corporate earnings in China should rebound in the second half next year,"" Chang said in an interview last week in Taipei. ""Tencent shares aren’t far from the bottom. No one can do without Tencent in life in China.""
Chinese shares now account for about 20 percent of the fund’s holdings, while the proportion of U.S. equities has been reduced to below 50 percent from around 60 percent, according to Chang. Money could flow toward emerging markets from the U.S. amid expectations the Federal Reserve will halt raising interest rates next year, he said. American tech giants like  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). were still among the fund’s top holdings as of October, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
While the fund has a strong track record over a longer period, its performance hasn’t been as flattering over the past month, losing an annualized 3 percent and underperforming its peers. Chang didn’t name other Chinese companies the fund has recently added.
After slumping as much as much as 47 percent in October from its all-time high in January, Tencent has regained some stability in recent weeks. While investors are still waiting for clarity on new game approvals, its third-quarter report provided some relief. Tencent commands a powerful asset in WeChat, used by more than a billion people to shop, pay for services and hail rides.
Chang expects Chinese companies to post a return of 10 to 20 percent next year. Valuations are relatively cheap and technology, consumption and health-care stocks look particularly attractive, he said, referring to both onshore- and offshore-traded shares.
The Shanghai Composite Index has tumbled 22 percent this year, among the world’s worst performers, while the MSCI China Index has dropped about 17 percent. That contrasts with a decline of just 1.5 percent for the S&P 500 Index through last week, which is coming off new highs made two months ago. The U.S. gauge is trading at a 52 percent premium over Shanghai shares, when measured by price-earnings multiples, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Trump said he expects to move ahead with raising tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports to 25% from 10% currently.
Trump said it was ""highly unlikely"" he would accept China's request to hold off on the increase, planned for Jan. 1. The comments ran counter to recent speculation about a possible deal when Trump meets Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires later this week.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock declined 2% in after-hours trading after Trump said the new tariffs could hit iPhones and laptops imported from China. The rate could be either 10% or 25%, Trump added.
""Maybe. Maybe. Depends on what the rate is,"" the president told the WSJ about the possible iPhone and laptop tariffs. ""I mean, I can make it 10%, and people could stand that very easily.""
Apple’s products are currently exempt from the tariffs. Shares of the company’s Asia-listed suppliers were mixed on Tuesday. Hon Hai Precision was down 0.7%, while Pegatron inched up 0.4%.
China’s Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component were up 0.4% and 0.5% respectively by 10:50PM ET (03:50 GMT).
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was little changed at 26,361.00.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 traded 0.7% higher. Chat app operator Line Corp (T:3938) was up almost 9% on reports that it is teaming up with Hong Kong-listed Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700) to offer mobile payment services for small Japanese retailers.

Stephenson's departure was followed by the exit of another Amazon veteran, Jason Warnick, who is leaving the e-commerce giant to become CFO at online brokerage startup Robinhood.
Stephenson will start in early January, Airbnb said in a statement https://press.airbnb.com/dave-stephenson-joins-airbnb-as-chief-financial-officer, and will replace Laurence Tosi, who left the company in February. 
Stephenson, a who has worked at Amazon for 17 years, was most recently vice president and CFO of the online retailer's worldwide consumer organization, which is responsible for all of Amazon's global website sales including its Prime service.
Airbnb, valued by private investors at $31 billion, has in recent months turned to new services and offerings to fuel growth, adding luxury vacation homes and hotels to its platform.
Robinhood said https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2018/11/26/jason-warnick-joins-robinhood-as-chief-financial-officer Warnick will join the company next week, after spending nearly 20 years at Amazon - most recently vice president of finance and chief of staff to the CFO.
Robinhood, valued at $5.6 billion after its latest round of funding, competes with established brokerages such as TD Ameritrade and E* Trade Financial Corp (O:ETFC) that charge clients for commissions.
Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours.

360,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2018 08:20PM ET</span>",United Technologies to separate into three companies,"(Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (N:UTX) said on Monday it would separate into three companies consisting of its aerospace, elevators and building divisions, making it the latest industrial conglomerate to pursue such a break-up.
The decision follows the completion this month of United Technologies' $30 billion acquisition of avionics maker Rockwell Collins (NYSE:COL), which gave enough scale to its aerospace business to be a standalone company.
The move is in line with plans of other major industrial companies, such as DowDuPont Inc (N:DWDP), Honeywell International Inc (N:HON) and  General Electric  Co (N:GE), to shed major divisions, as investors assign more value to the parts of these companies separately than to their sum.
Two activist hedge funds, Daniel Loeb's firm Third Point LLC and William Ackman's Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management LP, had called on United Technologies to pursue a split, and United Technology's chief executive, Gregory Hayes, had signaled for most of the past year that he was considering the move.
""Our decision to separate United Technologies is a pivotal moment in our history and will best position each independent company to drive sustained growth,"" Hayes said in a statement. 
United Technologies shares were up 2.2 percent at $130.81 in extended trading in New York on Monday. With a market capitalization of $102.5 billion, United Technologies is one of the biggest companies ever to pursue a three-way split.
United Technologies said it planned to keep the newly acquired Rockwell Collins business, along with its Pratt and Whitney engines unit and aerospace systems. This combine business generated total sales of $39 billion in 2017 on a pro forma basis.
United Technologies said it will spin off its Otis elevators and Carrier air-conditioning businesses tax-free to shareholders.
Otis reported sales of $12.3 billion last year, while the Carrier unit had revenues of $17.8 billion.
Hayes will continue in his current role as United Technologies chairman and CEO after the separation, the company said, with the separation expected to be completed by 2020.
United Technologies raised its 2018 sales forecast on Monday to a range of $64.5 billion to $65.0 billion, up from $64.0 billion to $64.5 billion previously, to include the Rockwell Collins acquisition.

The company expects 2018 adjusted earnings per share of between $7.10 and $7.20, down from $7.20 and $7.30 earlier.

361,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2018 06:16PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Deutsche Telekom to win EU nod for Dutch Tele2 deal, shares jump","By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) will win unconditional EU antitrust approval to buy Tele2's Dutch business, sources familiar with the matter said on Monday, sending telecoms shares higher on hopes of more flexible regulation on consolidation.
The European telecoms index spiked higher, with Tele2 shares jumping 9 percent for their best day in more than four months. Deutsche Telekom shares recovered from negative territory to a 1 percent gain.
The telecoms industry has long called on the European Commission to take a broader view of mergers aimed at boosting revenue and investment, as well as allowing it to compete better against internet rivals.
Pessimism reigned, however, after Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager scuppered a plan by Telia Company and Telenor to merge their businesses in Denmark in 2015.
A year later she blocked CK Hutchison Holdings' plan to merge its Three UK subsidiary with Telefonica’s O2 UK and also demanded hefty concessions for waving through other mobile telecoms deals.
The Commission opened a full-scale investigation into the Deutsche Telekom bid five months ago, concerned that a deal reducing the Dutch market to three players from four would hurt competition and lead to price increases for consumers.
Deutsche Telekom has argued that the combined company would have only a 25 percent market share, way behind market leader KPN and No. 2 player VodafoneZiggo.
It said the merged third player would be able to challenge the two competitors in fixed-broadband prices in the Netherlands and also roll out a 5G network more quickly.
Under the deal, Tele2 will receive 190 million euros ($224 million) in cash and a 25 percent stake in the enlarged T-Mobile NL, the two companies said when the deal was announced last December.
Tele2 said in a statement on Monday it remains optimistic the Commission will approve the merger, ""without conditions"", but has not yet received any decision. 
The Commission, which is scheduled to rule on the deal by Nov. 30, and Deutsche Telekom declined to comment.
Telecoms consultant John Strand welcomed the prospective EU approval, saying its previous stance was flawed.
""Our research has revealed the folly of regulators rejecting 'four-to-three' mergers for reasons of competition and price only to find that their logic was wrong and that prices increased,"" he said. 

The EU green light could be a watershed for European telecoms and speed consolidation in Spain and the UK while boosting valuations for some companies, Bernstein analyst Dhananjay Mirchandani wrote in a client note.

362,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 26, 2018 06:01PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Did Cyber Monday Live up to Its Billing?
Retail stocks will still be in focus as investors look to see if the high expectations for Cyber Monday sales came to fruition.
Cyber Monday is widely expected to haul in record online sales, continuing the trend from Black Friday, which pulled in $6.22 billion in online sales, up nearly 23.6% from a year ago, setting a new high, according to Adobe Analytics.
Cyber Monday online sales are expected to set a new record of $7.8 billion, up nearly 18% from last year, according to Adobe.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the obvious beneficiary, but analysts will likely be looking at companies that have touted a revamp in their online sales capability such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), as legacy retailers look to increase their share of online spending.
2. Oil Finding Its Feet?
Oil prices face a crucial week as traders wait for the next OPEC meeting on Dec. 6 and the possibility of sideline deals at the upcoming G20.
Crude was up more than 2% on Monday, following Friday’s 8% rout, after Goldman Sachs said current prices were an “extremely attractive entry point for longs in oil” and other commodities.
The consensus appears to be that the oil market is well supplied and that only some kind of cut in production will be able to lift prices.
Bloomberg reported that the G20 meeting in Argentina may be where the actual amount of a production cut will be decided. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih and his Russian counterpart Alexander Novak will be in Buenos Aires together, reinforcing the impression they will try to reach a deal ahead of the OPEC meeting.
It wouldn’t be the first time the two energy superpowers used a G20 to decide on oil policy.
At the same time, there is pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to keep prices lower, as he touts the recent plunge as a self-made de facto tax cut.
3. Fed Heads Gather
With recent dovish calls by Federal Reserve members, Fed speeches will be parsed tomorrow.
Three Fed members speak at 2:30 PM ET (19:30 GMT), in a Q&A at The Clearing House Conference.
Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, Kansas City Fed President Esther George and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic will be in attendance."

364,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2018 05:21PM ET</span>",Trump says Brexit agreement may hamper U.S.-British trade; UK differs,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday the agreement allowing the United Kingdom to leave the European Union may make trade between Washington and London more difficult, but the UK prime minister's office disputed his interpretation.
Trump told reporters outside the White House that the deal sounded like it would be good for the European Union, but ""I think we have to take a look seriously whether or not the UK is allowed to trade.
""Because right now if you look at the deal, they may not be able to trade with us,"" he said. ""And that wouldn't be a good thing. I don't think they meant that.""
He said he hoped British Prime Minister Theresa May would be able to address the problem, but he did not specify which provision of the deal he was concerned about.
A spokeswoman for May's office said the agreement struck with the EU allowed the UK to sign trade deals with countries throughout the world, including with the United States.
""We have already been laying the groundwork for an ambitious agreement with the U.S. through our joint working groups, which have met five times so far,"" the spokeswoman said.

Under the deal secured with EU leaders on Sunday, the UK will leave the bloc in March with continued close trade ties. But the odds look stacked against May getting it approved by a divided British parliament.

365,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2018 05:00PM ET</span>","Disney, Fox sued in U.S. for $1 billion over Malaysia theme park","By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (O:FOXA) were sued for more than $1 billion on Monday by casino operator  Genting Malaysia Bhd  (KL:GENM), which accused them of abandoning a contract related to its planned construction of the first Fox-branded theme park.
Genting said ""seller's remorse"" induced Fox, with Disney's help, to breach its 2013 contract with Fox Entertainment Group to license intellectual property for Fox World, a proposed addition to its Resorts World Genting complex, an hour's drive from Kuala Lumpur.
Disney did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Dan Berger, a spokesman for Twentieth Century Fox Film, one of the defendants, declined to comment.
The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles as Disney prepares to complete its $71.3 billion purchase of many Fox assets, expected in the first quarter of 2019. 
Genting said the problems began as Fox engineered years of delays to force a renegotiation of the contract, which did not give it a share of gate sales.
But according to the complaint, Disney is now ""calling the shots,"" and wants to end the contract because associating with a gaming company didn't fit its ""family-friendly"" brand strategy.
Genting said Fox issued a default notice with the hope of terminating the contract, in a manner ""entirely consistent with Disney wanting to kill the deal"" to benefit itself.
""Given that FEG had no right to terminate the Agreement, Fox and Disney are liable for what will exceed a billion dollars in damages attributable to the bad-faith behavior of both Fox and Disney,"" the complaint said.
Genting said it had already made a ""$750 million-plus investment"" in Fox World. It is also seeking punitive damages.
According to the complaint, Resorts World Genting contains Malaysia's only legal land-based casino, seven hotels, shopping malls, performance venues, gondola lifts and scores of restaurants, bars and clubs. More than 23 million people visit each year, the complaint said.

The case is Genting Malaysia Bhd v Fox Entertainment Group LLC et al, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 18-09866.

366,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2018 04:39PM ET</span>",Thousands moved out for a new GM factory; now it's closing,"By David Shepardson and Nick Carey
WASHINGTON/DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) on Monday pulled the plug on the Chevrolet Volt hybrid and the Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly plant that builds it, both examples of a costly gamble that is not paying off. 
GM's widely touted factory of the future, forced on a town desperate for jobs and hailed decades later by former President Barack Obama, is set to wind down over the next few years, leaving beleaguered Hamtramck wondering what happened.
Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan said at a news conference Monday that he told GM chief executive Mary Barra Monday that ""we moved thousands of people out of that neighborhood ... to create that assembly plant and I felt that the city of Detroit deserved more consideration.""
The Detroit-Hamtramck plant stands on 465 acres of land that was once a neighborhood known as ""Poletown."" 
In 1981, the Michigan Supreme Court approved a decision to allow Detroit to tear down up to 1,500 homes, more than 140 businesses, a hospital and six churches to build the $500 million plant. The Detroit News reported 4,200 people lost their homes as a result.
GM convinced officials in the cities of Detroit and Hamtramck, the state of Michigan - and ultimately the state's highest court - to use eminent domain, a controversial process in which government seizes private land. 
Karen Majewski, the mayor of Hamtramck, told Reuters that the GM plant is one of the largest contributors to local property taxes. Empty, she worried the factory will discourage other investments.
""They destroyed homes and churches and local businesses, all to build that plant,"" Majewski said. ""Now that the plant is going to close, people will wonder why that neighborhood had to be sacrificed in the first place.""
COSTLY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT GAMBLE
For years after it opened, the Detroit-Hamtramck plant struggled, building one generation of slow-selling models after another. 
The precedent the project set also took a blow. In 2004, the Michigan Supreme Court reversed its earlier decision allowing the taking of homes, calling it ""a radical departure from fundamental constitutional principles and over a century of this court's eminent domain jurisprudence."" The court said it was acting to ""protect the people's property rights, and preserve the legitimacy of the judicial branch as the expositor-not creator-of fundamental law.""
GM tried to revive the Hamtramck plant in 2008, as it neared financial collapse, by giving it the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid car to build. GM touted the Volt as a symbol of its technological promise, and a reason for the government to step in and rescue the company. 
In 2010, then U.S. President Barack Obama visited the plant and even drove a Volt for about 10 feet. Some Republicans and conservative critics pilloried the Volt as the ""Obama car.""
In the years after the federal bailout of GM, gas prices fell and the Volt did not hit GM's ambitious sales targets. U.S. Volt sales are down 14 percent for the year through October to just 14,897 cars - about one-third the number of Chevrolet Silverado pickups GM sells in a month. Since 2010, GM has sold about 150,000 Volts - about half the capacity of a typical car plant running at full speed.
GM on Monday did not definitively say the Hamtramck plant will be closed but instead called the factory ""unallocated,"" meaning it has no products to build after 2019. 
It is possible GM could reach an agreement with the local union to put a vehicle in the plant in talks next year.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 1.46%. The S&P 500 rose 1.56%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 2.06%.
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) soared 5% as retailers reigned supreme, lifting the broader consumer discretionary sector on expectations that Cyber Monday would haul in a record in online sales.
Cyber Monday online sales are expected to set a new record of $7.8 billion, up nearly 18% from last year, Adobe Analytics said.
A surge in shares of General Motors (NYSE:GM) also underpinned consumer discretionary after the automaker revealed plans to reduce output at several plants and cut its salaried workforce by 15%, a larger cost-cutting plan than many had expected.
Wall Street's bold start to the week was further underpinned by financials, which have remained resilient in the wake of a wider slump in the overall market during the current quarter, losing about 4% compared with a more than 8% decline for the S&P 500.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) ended the day higher.
Tech rebounded back from weakness last week, as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) pared some recent losses, rising 1% as the iPhone maker argued a case about antitrust laws and its App Store in front of the Supreme Court.
Apple fell in aftermarket trade, however, as President Trump reportedly suggested the U.S. could slap 10% tariffs on iPhones and laptops imported from China, CNBC reported.
The dour update on trade comes as investors remain hopeful that Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will find a way to renew dialogue on trade and de-escalate trade tensions at the upcoming G20 meeting.

372,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 26, 2018 04:00PM ET</span>",Trump Says He Is Pushing GM to Get ‘Back’ in Ohio After Job Cuts,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump said he is pressuring General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). to get “back” into Ohio after the automaker announced it would close a factory in the state as part of a plan to cut jobs and shutter facilities around the world.
“You better get back in there soon -- that’s Ohio,” Trump told reporters Monday, recounting what he said to GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra following the job cuts announcement earlier Monday. The automaker said it planned to lay off 14,000 workers and close seven factories.
Among the factories GM plans to close is one in Lordstown, Ohio, that makes the Chevrolet Cruze. Ohio is a critical political battleground in presidential elections.
“I was very tough. I spoke with her,” Trump said as he departed the White House for campaign rallies in Mississippi. “We have a lot of pressure on them.”
Trump said he wasn’t impressed with GM officials’ explanation that the company is closing the Ohio plant because of poor sales of the model it manufactures.
“They said the Chevy Cruze is not selling well,” Trump said. “I said ‘Well, then get a car that is selling well and put it back in.’ So I think you’re going to see something else happen there. ”
Four factories in the U.S. and one in Canada could be closed by the end of 2019 if the automaker and its unions don’t come up with an agreement to allocate more work to those facilities, GM said in a statement earlier Monday. Another two will close outside North America. The Detroit-based company’s shares surged on the plan, which includes abandoning some of its slower-selling sedan models.
Barra was scheduled to meet with White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow on Monday following the automaker’s announcement, a White House official said.
The meeting was planned prior to GM’s announcement on Monday, the official said. The person asked not be identified because the meeting wasn’t publicly announced."

TOULOUSE, France (Reuters) - Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR) delivered its first A330neo jet to TAP Portugal on Monday as it seeks to trump U.S. rival Boeing (N:BA) in the fiercely competitive battle at the lower end of the market for long-haul jets.
The face-off between the A330neo and Boeing 787 pits two generations of jetliner against each other in one of the most crowded but potentially lucrative parts of the aircraft market, predicted to represent $1 trillion in sales over 20 years.
The A330neo offers fuel savings through new engines from Rolls-Royce (L:RR), though these have been delayed by industrial problems at the British supplier. 
Airbus planemaking chief Guillaume Faury said he expected Airbus to catch up on delayed A330neo deliveries by end-2019.
Sales of the A330neo have also fallen short of expectations as Boeing places its 787, but Faury predicted these would pick up following the first delivery.
""The A330neo will in my view get more traction when it is in service,"" he told reporters.
One of the earliest and largest customers for the A330neo, leasing firm Avolon which financed the first TAP aircraft, said Airbus still needed to win more orders.
""It is a soft (order) backlog. We would prefer if there were more airplanes sold to more customers - wouldn’t anybody?,"" Avolon Chief Executive Domhnal Slattery told Reuters.
""But the thing that is giving us comfort is that the replacement wave for the (earlier) A330-200 hasn’t really kicked in and it should kick in this year, next year and the year after.""
Airbus recently won A330neo orders from Kuwait Airways and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), but Delta said it had deferred some deliveries of the newer A350 and industry sources say Kuwait had been given flexibility to delay or cancel A350s in return for its support.
MID-MARKET STRATEGY
The A330neo - sporting a newer cabin and larger engines than existing A330 long-haul jets - is the latest gambit in a battle between Airbus and Boeing over the fiercely contested 'middle of the market,' sitting between long-haul and medium-haul planes.
Boeing is weighing proposals to develop a dedicated jet carrying 220-270 people in a development analysts say could damage the A330, the most profitable Airbus wide-body model.
Airbus is attempting to close its jaws around the same part of the market through a combination of the 250-300-seat A330neo at the top end and the smaller A321neo underneath.
The dogfight between plane giants has been one of the most intense for years, prompting European claims that Boeing is trying to drive the A330neo out of the market to make way for its potential new jet. ""Boeing failed in its mission to kill the A330,"" Airbus twin-aisle marketing head Crawford Hamilton said.
Boeing rejected this. ""We are focused on delivering the most capable, most efficient and versatile airplanes to airlines around the world,"" a spokesman said.
Boeing says it has won 65 percent of wide-body orders in the last 5 years. Airbus says the A330 won some 50 percent of orders contested against the 787 since the A330neo version was launched in 2014. Both firms select data to support marketing campaigns.
The aircraft delivered to TAP Portugal on Monday is the 298-seat A330-900neo, the larger of two versions developed by Airbus and one that dominates the tally of 242 aircraft on order.
Of these, 28 are officially earmarked for IranAir but Airbus says these won't be delivered any time soon due to renewed U.S sanctions, which apply to all jets using significant U.S. parts.

The smaller A330-800neo took its first flight this month.

Mexico’s Antitrust Issues Recommendations on Bank Fees Proposal
Banco del Bajio’s 11 percent skid led losses after Mexico’s antitrust agency, Cofece, recommended the Senate ask the central bank to conduct a case-by-case analysis of proposed modifications. Grupo Financiero Banorte and  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) Mexico slumped at least 7.7 percent. The benchmark Mexbol dropped to the lowest since August 2015.
It’s been a rocky month for Mexican financial stocks. President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s political party, Morena, rattled investors on Nov. 8, when it introduced the bank plan just two weeks after the new leader canceled a $13 billion airport. While Lopez Obrador tried to walk back the bank fee plan a day later, Morena has kept it alive. The losses today came with the release of Cofece’s Nov. 21 letter to the Senate asking for further study on the issue.
""Banks have certainly been a concern for investors because of concerns about the potential for increased government regulation that could crimp profits,"" said Morgan Harting, a senior portfolio manager at AllianceBernstein in New York.

GE's $115 billion debt pile has left investors fearing that the company could see its credit status reduced to junk, which would likely rack up the amount it pays to service its debt at time when the company is struggling to alleviate investor concerns about future profitability.
General Electric CEO Larry Culp told CNBC in an interview early November, that he would sell assets to cut the company's debt and touted the possible IPO of the company's health care business.
But not everyone is convinced the company is heading for junk status. Peter Tchir of Academy Securities said Wall Street's fears about General Electric's bonds are overblown.
Despite spread widening in the secondary markets because of its debt profile, General Electric ""should not see a material increase in their total cost of borrowing in 2019,"" Tchir said in a note, citing $26 billion of the company's $105 billion of debt is maturing in the next two years, mostly in 2020.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Campbell Soup and Third Point LLC settled their proxy contest on Monday by adding two of the hedge fund's nominees to the U.S. food company's board and giving the activist investor a say in selecting Campbell's next CEO, the company said.
Campbell Soup will expand its board with the addition of Third Point nominees Sarah Hofstetter, who is president of Comscore, and Kurt Schmidt, a former chief executive of Blue Buffalo Company. By May 2019 another director will be added and Third Point will be consulted on the choice.
The hedge fund, which owns 7 percent of the company, will also be able to offer its views at two board meetings and two meetings with the chief executive officer in the next 12 months. 
In return, Third Point promised not to run a proxy contest in the next year.
Campbell's stock was off 2.9 percent at $39.36 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
The deal between the 149-year old food company and Loeb's hedge fund, one of the world's most closely watched activist hedge funds, ends an acrimonious U.S. boardroom battle days before an investor vote at Campbell's annual meeting on Thursday. A number of heirs to the Campbell fortune, including three current board members, control roughly 41 percent of the company and made it increasingly difficult for Third Point to win the vote count, people familiar with the matter said. 
""We are pleased to have reached an agreement with Third Point that is in the best interests of Campbell shareholders,"" Campbell interim CEO Keith McLoughlin said in a statement.
Daniel Loeb, the billionaire investor who runs Third Point, said his firm ""looks forward to working collaboratively with Campbell to improve value for all shareholders at this important time for the Company.""
Loeb initially asked other investors to help him oust the entire board, saying it was largely responsible for the company's lagging share price and a fast-paced takeover spree that saddled it with a lot of debt. He pushed for a full sale of the company. 
Campbell's McLoughlin has said the company had lost focus but now has a strategic plan and is busy executing it, for example, by shopping its fresh foods business.
The company is still looking for a new chief executive and expects to name one before the end of the year. Third Point, which has been talking to a potential candidate, will be allowed to have input in the decision, the company said.

A steep decline in the iPhone maker’s share price has left its market capitalization roughly the same as fellow technology bellwether  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). for the first time in more than eight years.
Currently, Apple has a market cap of $817.7 billion, meaning it has shed nearly $300 billion in value after cresting a record $1.1 trillion valuation in early October. Microsoft’s market value is about $816.3 billion. The last time Microsoft was bigger than Apple by this metric was in mid-2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Apple has slid amid growing concerns the company is seeing weak demand for iPhones, by far its biggest product line. Shares have fallen more than 25 percent from record levels. While Microsoft hasn’t been immune from weakness in the technology sector, it has held up much better, falling just 9 percent from its own all-time high.
Shares of Apple were slightly lower in midday trading on Monday, while Microsoft jumped 2.4 percent.
According to Rich Ross, a technical analyst at Evercore ISI, Apple’s stock “has another 18 percent downside,” which could take the stock to $140. “It is not bullish when the biggest stock in the world is in ‘falling knife’ mode,” he wrote to clients on Monday."

388,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2018 12:36PM ET</span>",GM to slash jobs and production as U.S. sedan sales sink,"By Joseph White and Nick Carey
DETROIT/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) said on Monday it will cut production of slow-selling models and slash its North American workforce in the face of a declining market for traditional gas-powered sedans, shifting more investment to electric and autonomous vehicles.
The announcement is the biggest North America restructuring for the U.S. No. 1 carmaker since its bankruptcy a decade ago. Its shares rose 7.6 percent to $38.66.
GM plans to halt production next year at three assembly plants: Lordstown, Ohio; Hamtramck, Michigan; and Oshawa, Ontario. It will also stop building several models now assembled at those plants, including the Chevrolet Cruze, the Cadillac CT6 and the Buick LaCrosse. The Cruze compact car will be discontinued in the U.S. market in 2019. 
Plants in Baltimore, Maryland, and Warren, Michigan, assembling powertrain components will have no products assigned to them after 2019 and are at risk of closure, GM said. It will also close two unidentified factories outside North America. 
""We are right-sizing capacity for the realities of the marketplace,"" Chief Executive Mary Barra said, adding that GM will double resources dedicated to electric and self-driving vehicles over the next two years.
Cost pressures on GM and other automakers and suppliers have increased as demand has waned for traditional sedans. The company has said tariffs on imported steel, imposed earlier this year by the Trump administration, have cost it $1 billion.
Barra did not link Monday's cuts to tariff pressures, but said trade costs are among the ""headwinds"" GM faces as it deals with broader technology change and market shifts. 
The biggest U.S. autoworker union vowed to fight GM's plans. ""General Motors' decision today... will not go unchallenged by the UAW,"" said Terry Dittes, the union's vice president in charge of negotiations with GM.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he spoke with Barra and expressed ""deep disappointment.""
GM said it will take pre-tax charges of $3 billion to $3.8 billion to pay for the cutbacks, but expects the actions to improve annual free cash flow by $6 billion by the end of 2020. 
""In contrast to times past... (GM) is trying to get ahead of a potential crisis by making cuts now,"" said Michelle Krebs, executive analyst at Autotrader. 
SMALLER WORKFORCE
GM's North American salaried workforce, including engineers and executives, will shrink by 15 percent, or about 8,000 jobs. The company said it will cut executive ranks by 25 per cent to ""streamline decision making.""
Even as GM is moving to lay off salaried staff, the company is hiring. At GM's Detroit headquarters on Monday, there were signs directing people to a ""new hire orientation"" meeting.
Barra said GM can reduce annual capital spending by $1.5 billion and increase investment in electric and autonomous vehicles and connected vehicle technology because it has largely completed investing in new generations of trucks and sport utility vehicles. Some 75 percent of its global sales will come from just five vehicle architectures by the early 2020s.
GM plans to reduce annual capital spending to $7 billion by 2020 from an average of $8.5 billion a year during the 2017-2019 period. 
Unlike Japanese automakers Nissan Motor Co Ltd, Honda Motor Co Ltd and Toyota Motor Corp, which rely on a more flexible system where they make multiple vehicles at a single plant, GM has too many factories that make just a single model.
With U.S. car sales lagging, that means several GM car plants have fallen to just one shift, including its Hamtramck and Lordstown assembly plants. 
A rule of thumb for the automotive industry is that if a plant is running below 80 percent of production capacity, it is losing money. GM has several plants running well below that. Consultancy LMC estimates that Lordstown operates at just 31 percent of production capacity in 2018.
Through the UAW, workers at Lordstown have worked to improve quality, cut the number of union locals to make it easier for GM to negotiate and agreed to the outsourcing of some jobs, in a bid to persuade the automaker to add more models to its factory line.
U.S. President Donald Trump won Ohio in 2016 campaigning on bringing manufacturing jobs back to America.
""So far, President Trump has been asleep at the switch and owes this community an explanation,"" Representative Tim Ryan, a Democrat whose district includes Lordstown, wrote on Twitter.
Barra said the automaker is running at about 70 percent capacity utilization in North America, and GM will provide an update on how the latest moves will improve utilization in January.
""We need to make sure that we are well positioned to compete, not just over the next few years, but well beyond,"" she said.
Unlike its plants making passenger cars, many of GM's plants producing its higher-margin trucks and SUVs are running on three shifts, with some running six and sometimes seven days a week to keep up with demand.
Rivals Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV have both curtailed U.S. car production. Ford said in April it planned to stop building nearly all cars in North America.
SEDANS OUT OF FAVOR
The industry-wide slowdown in passenger car sales worsened in 2017. 
U.S. consumers have swiftly shifted away from passenger cars to larger, more comfortable SUVs and pickup trucks, leaving automakers scrambling to readjust. 
As recently as 2012, passenger cars made up more than 50 percent of all U.S. new vehicle sales. Through the first nine months of 2018, that had fallen to a little over 31 percent. 
While industry-wide passenger car sales were down 13.2 percent through the first nine months of the year, pickup truck and SUV sales rose 8.3 percent. As well as being roomier, the fuel economy on SUVs and crossovers has improved significantly.

Sales of Cruze, built at Lordstown, fell 27 percent through September 2018. Impala, which is built at Oshawa and Hamtramck, was down 13 percent. Buick LaCrosse and Cadillac CT6, which are built at Hamtramck, were down 14 percent and 11 percent, respectively.

401,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2018 11:56AM ET</span>",Qatar expects to receive six F-15 fighter jets from U.S. by March 2021,"By Eric Knecht
DOHA (Reuters) - Qatar expects six F-15 warplanes to be delivered to its air force by March 2021, a military official said on Monday, the first batch of 36 it agreed to buy from the United States last year for $12 billion.
Brigadier General Issa al-Mahannadi told reporters at the Al Udeid air base in Qatar that a further six F-15s would be dispatched three months after the initial batch, with four more expected every three months thereafter.
Qatar signed agreements to buy warplanes from the United States as well as Europe last year after a political dispute broke out between it and neighbors Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Bahrain. 
""This is not a purchase, it is a strategic partnership with the U.S.,"" Mahannadi said.
The tiny but wealthy Gulf state will begin sending eight pilots per year to the United States for training this year, Mahannadi added, while transitioning some of its experienced Qatari pilots to fly the F-15s in order to establish a 53-person aircrew for them by 2023.
The programs are part of Qatar's drive to beef up its air power and meet the needs of an air force that has also inked deals for 12 more French Rafale fighters and 24 Eurofighter Typhoon aircrafts since the rift with its neighbors kicked off.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) was awarded the contract for the F-15s.
Qatar in August announced it would expand Al Udeid, which hosts the largest U.S. military facility in the Middle East, to accommodate the F-15s and other fighter jets.

Mahannadi said construction on the area for the F-15s would start in 2020 and be completed by 2021, in time to receive the first delivery.

407,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2018 11:05AM ET</span>","Fiat Chrysler aims to boost margins, keep jobs with European production plan","By Agnieszka Flak and Stefano Rebaudo
MILAN (Reuters) -  Fiat  Chrysler (FCA) (MI:FCHA) is expected to commit to producing a raft of new models in Italy, including Jeeps and an Alfa Romeo SUV, union sources said, as the carmaker strives to fill underutilized plants and lift profit margins in Europe.
The plans, which the sources said would also include building a new Maserati sportscar in Italy, would deliver on the strategy outlined by the group's late boss Sergio Marchionne.
New European chief Pietro Gorlier will meet with unions on Thursday to discuss the proposals and present them to journalists later that day. 
FCA declined to comment. 
FCA appointed Gorlier last month to tackle a region where profitability is below that of peers, thousands of workers are on temporary layoff schemes, and some plants run below capacity.
In his last strategy unveiled in June, Marchionne vowed to keep converting Italian plants to churn out Alfa Romeos, Jeeps and Maseratis instead of less profitable mass-market vehicles in an attempt to preserve jobs and boost margins.
FCA's Melfi plant in southern Italy, which already produces the Jeep Renegade, is expected to also produce the Jeep Compass, the sources said. The Compass will replace the Fiat Punto, which was discontinued in August. 
The Pomigliano factory near Naples is set to keep the Fiat Panda, the most sold vehicle in Italy, the people added, dismissing earlier reports the model could return to FCA's plant in Poland, where it was made until 2011. 
Pomigliano will also get the new Baby Jeep, smaller than the Renegade, which will be another model targeting European clients.
Unions have been awaiting news of product plans to see whether workers, some of whom have been on temporary layoff schemes for years, would be brought back,
Marchionne initially promised to fill all European plants by the end of 2018, but in June said that goal would likely slip to the end of the current strategy plan in 2022. 
The Fiat brand will be reduced to a few models such as the iconic 500 and the popular Panda hatchback. The 500 family in particular will become a big part of the company's electric vehicle drive in Europe.
The Mirafiori plant in Fiat's hometown of Turin may be chosen to assemble the new electric Fiat 500, the sources said, but added the plans were not yet final, especially as the combustion engine version is currently made in Poland.
Mirafiori may also be used to revive the Fiat 500 Giardiniera wagon, they added.
Mirafiori already produces the Maserati Levante, but sales of the luxury SUV fell sharply in recent months due to weak Chinese demand. The Levante platform may also be used to produce a new SUV for the Alfa Romeo brand, bigger than the Stelvio SUV that was launched in 2016, the people said. 
Maserati's sporty Alfieri model will likely be made in the brand's hometown of Modena, the sources added. 
The world's seventh-largest carmaker in June outlined a global plan to ramp up production of SUVs and invest 9 billion euros ($10.2 billion) - out of a total spending plan of around 45 billion euros - in electric and hybrid cars in an effort to double operating profit by 2022.

FCA's operating margin in Europe recovered to 3.2 percent last year, which compares with Europe-focused PSA Group's (PA:PEUP) global automotive margin of 7.3 percent. FCA expects that margin to grow to between 5 and 7 percent by 2022.

412,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2018 10:25AM ET</span>","Zimbabwe sees no radical change for platinum, diamond ownership","LONDON (Reuters) - Zimbabwe does not plan to change its ownership rules for diamonds and platinum, its mining minister said on Monday, denting hopes among some miners the country will open up ownership as it announces mineral frameworks in coming weeks. 
Zimbabwe in March changed its empowerment law limiting the rules that mandate majority state ownership to diamond and platinum mines, rather than to the mining sector as a whole.
Speaking on the sidelines of an investment conference in London, Minister of Mines and Mining Development Winston Chitando told Reuters there would be ""no change"" for diamonds and platinum when asked about industry speculation the indigenization rules could be relaxed further.
An official from a junior miner developing a project in Zimbabwe said on condition of anonymity, he still believed there could be flexibility if miners were, for instance, investing heavily in the local community.
Zimbabwe has held a series of conferences in Africa, as well as in London since the overturning of long-term leader Robert Mugabe in late 2017, raising expectations the mineral-rich southern African country would become more investor friendly.
Progress has been slow but Chitando said the country was determined to bring about change and over the coming weeks would roll out policies for various minerals, including diamonds and gold.
While the indigenization rules - insisting the state holds 51 percent of platinum or diamond mines - remain in place, Chitando said the diamond policy would focus on developing greater value from the industry.
For instance, the government is trying to ensure the cutting and polishing of stones takes place in Zimbabwe rather than in other countries.
Most of the diamond fields are in Marange in eastern Zimbabwe, where production is dominated by the state-owned Zimbabwe Consolidated Diamond Company. It is expected to produce 3.5 million carats this year, up from 2.5 million in 2017.
In early 2016, Mugabe's government evicted all diamond mining firms, including two Chinese joint venture companies from Marange, saying their licenses had expired after they declined to merge under a newly created state-owned mining firm.

The Chinese have been lobbying the new government of Emmerson Mnangagwa to be let back in, but so far without success.

Asked on the sidelines of a delivery ceremony in Toulouse whether Airbus planned to launch the proposed new variant, planemaking chief and CEO-designate Guillaume Faury said: ""I will be more precise in 2019.""
He declined further comment on the reported project.
Reuters first reported in June that Airbus is considering adding extra endurance to the longest-range version of its A321 as part of efforts to pre-empt a potential new mid-market jet being studied by U.S. rival Boeing (N:BA).
Next year is also when Boeing intends to make a decision on the future of that project.
Airbus's proposed new A321XLR would carry extra fuel and expand the range of the A321LR aircraft, which recently claimed a long-distance record for single-aisle jets in testing.

The two companies got the go-ahead from the Department of Justice for their $69 billion deal  in October, but still needed key state insurance agencies to sign off. The companies  said on Monday morning that they'd received approval from all regulators, and expect to complete the transaction by Wednesday.
The deal will redraw the healthcare industry.

In CVS and Aetna's case, the deal creates a new type of company that includes a health insurer, a retail pharmacy, and a company that negotiates prescription drug prices with drugmakers called a pharmacy benefits manager (PBM). As part of the agreement with the DOJ, CVS and Aetna have to  divest Aetna's Medicare Part D prescription-drug-plan business.
The boundaries of the healthcare business are changing. Instead of growing by acquiring other companies in the same business, companies have started to move into new lines of business, with no two combinations looking exactly the same.
It's part of a push by healthcare companies to both cut costs and gain more control over the patients in need of their services. It's coming as large tech companies seek ways to disrupt the healthcare industry as it faces new medications that challenge the way we pay for treatments.

He replaces Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, who steps down in December as chair of the FSB, a body that has been coordinating new banking rules for the Group of 20 (G20) since the global financial crisis a decade ago.
The FSB said that Klaas Knot, president of the Dutch central bank, was appointed vice chair and will succeed Quarles within three years for a period of three years.
Quarles was appointed by U.S. President Donald Trump as the Fed's first head of banking supervision last year.
Regulatory sources have said that the appointment of the transatlantic duo, first reported by Reuters, is seen by Europeans as helping to keep Washington fully engaged in the FSB, while also giving Europe an influential role.
Quarles said the FSB's work remains relevant a decade after the financial crisis.
European regulators were alarmed when Trump last year directed U.S. regulators to review post-crisis regulations with an eye to stimulating lending and boosting the economy.
But the Fed under Quarles and Chairman Jerome Powell has largely steered a moderate course, moving to refine and tailor post-crisis regulations in line with firms' risk profiles.
Sensing that many governments want a pause in the heavy bout of rulemaking that followed the financial crisis, the FSB has already signaled a change in course and speed.

""Randy and Klaas will provide strong leadership and continuity as the FSB pivots towards the implementation and evaluation of post-crisis reforms, and to addressing emerging vulnerabilities in the global financial system,"" Carney said in an FSB statement.

420,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 26, 2018 09:30AM ET</span>",GM Plans to Close Canadian Plant in Global Overhaul,"(Bloomberg) -- A car plant that General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). has operated for 65 years in Canada could be on the verge of shutting down as part of what a union says will be a global overhaul of the automaker’s operations.
The company will announce Monday that it’s ending production at its plant in Oshawa, Ontario, two people familiar with the plans said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Unifor, Canada’s autoworkers’ union, said it’s been told there is no car production assigned to the factory beyond next year, though it raised the prospect of talks to preserve jobs.
“We have been informed that, as of now, there is no product allocated to the Oshawa assembly plant past December 2019,” Unifor said in a statement late Sunday. “Unifor does not accept this announcement and is immediately calling on GM to live up to the spirit” of a contract agreement reached in 2016, the union said.
Unifor said it received notice Sunday from GM that the company “will make a major announcement tomorrow that will impact its global operations.” The union said it doesn’t yet have complete details and would speak with company representatives on Monday.
Barra’s Retrenching
GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra has spent the last several years shrinking the company down to focus on regions and products where it’s most profitable to improve earnings and free up resources to develop self-driving technology. She sold off the company’s European divisions Opel and Vauxhall to France’s PSA Group last year and has retrenched from key markets including India and Russia.
A product overhaul may be next. Sales of bigger sedans such as the Chevrolet Impala and Cadillac XTS built in Oshawa have been plunging as demand has shifted to SUVs, and GM’s rivals Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV have already announced plans to kill off several passenger cars from their lineups.
Reuters reported Monday that GM will significantly cut car production in North America and stop building some low-selling car models, citing an anonymous source.
Late last month, Barra, 56, offered buyouts to about 18,000 salaried workers in North America who have been with the company at least a dozen years. GM may consider involuntary cuts if the portion of people who accept the offer isn’t big enough.
The Oshawa plant employs about 2,200 people, according to the union, and was once one of the largest carmaking facilities in Canada. David Paterson, a spokesman for GM in Canada, declined to comment. The potential plant closure was reported earlier by CTV News, which didn’t say where it got the information.
Any closure would mark the end of more than a century of carmaking in Oshawa, a city about 60 kilometers (36 miles) east of Toronto. Detroit-based GM started operating the massive plant in 1953.
2016 Contract
The survival of the factory was a key issue in the automaker’s 2016 labor talks with Unifor, which represents tens of thousands of autoworkers in Canada. As part of that settlement, GM had agreed to spend some C$400 million ($302 million) in the Oshawa operations. The union hailed the agreement at the time as part of an effort to stem the loss of jobs to Mexico.
According to GM’s website, it has two lines in Oshawa. One makes the Chevrolet Impala and Cadillac XTS cars, while the other builds the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks. GM also operates Canadian plants in Ingersoll and St. Catharines, Ontario.
The plant had employed 23,000 workers as recently as 1983. Production in Oshawa and other car centers near Toronto has dwindled in the last few decades as more North American production shifted to lower-cost centers in Mexico and the U.S.

421,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2018 09:11AM ET</span>",France drops plan for urban tolls amid fuel price protests,"PARIS (Reuters) - The French government has dropped plans that would have eased the introduction of urban tolls amid nationwide protests against rising fuel costs, the transport minister said on Monday. 
Last month, Transport Minister Elisabeth Borne said a new law on mobility would allow cities to introduce congestion pricing in a bid to cut traffic jams and pollution.
But in the past two weeks, France has seen nationwide protests against rising fuel costs, with demonstrators clad in fluorescent jackets - dubbed ""yellow vests"" - blocking highways and setting up barricades, hoping to force the government to row back on new taxes on petrol and diesel. 
The unrest came to a head in Paris on Saturday, when police clashed violently with thousands of demonstrators on the Champs-Elysees, with more than 100 protesters detained. 
At a presentation of the draft mobility law following a cabinet meeting on Monday, Borne told reporters that it would not include urban tolls as had previously been proposed. 
""The perception is that this measure would create new territorial divides, and hence it will not be part of the draft law,"" she said. 
She added that the goverment's transport policy would focus on providing more alternatives for individual car ownership.

This will include improving railway connections to smaller cities, which have been left behind as France focuses on building high-speed TGV lines between its major cities, and on encouraging car sharing and cycling.

423,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 26, 2018 09:00AM ET</span>",Blockbuster Cyber Monday Is Overshadowed by Economic Outlook,"(Bloomberg) -- Shoppers will spend an estimated $7.8 billion on Cyber Monday -- a record -- boosting a strong holiday shopping season. And Wall Street seems to be mostly shrugging it off.
Even a blockbuster holiday won’t divert the market’s attention from the rising interest rates next year and the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China that’s expected to slow global economic growth. U.S. President Donald Trump in September imposed 10 percent tariffs on approximately $200 billion worth of Chinese imports and plans to raise the levy to 25 percent in January, which will drive prices higher.
Fears about a consumer spending slowdown in 2019 outweigh any positive signs of a strong holiday, said Tom Forte, analyst at DA Davidson & Co.
“Many of the tariffs will likely be borne by consumers in the second half of 2019 in the form of higher prices on products,” he said. “Higher interest rates may dampen spending on big-ticket items.”
Companies like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. and  Target  Corp. (NYSE:TGT) that are fighting to win holiday spending online may not see a substantial payoff in terms of their market value. And some technical fumbles on Black Friday showed that traditional stores are still struggling to accommodate the hoards of internet shoppers. Even with substantial investments in technology, some retail giants including Walmart, Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) Cos. and Kohl’s Corp. confronted glitches and malfunctioning websites on Friday, a sign they aren’t keeping pace with the load of consumers switching to e-commerce.
Purchases on Black Friday, traditionally the best day for sales on electronics, totaled $6.22 billion, up 23.6 percent from a year ago, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) data show. Spending on Cyber Monday, usually the best day for toy sales, is expected to increase 17.6 percent.
Total holiday retail spending -- in stores and online -- in November and December will grow by more than 5 percent for the second consecutive year, a first since before the Great Recession about a decade ago, said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners. Investors may be worried about whether that pace can be sustained, even though it’s grounded in low unemployment and wage growth rather than the heavy use of credit that led to the financial crisis, he said.
“The strong consumer and retail spending we are seeing now is coming off of this healthy foundation, which is much more sustainable than the credit bubble we saw 12 years ago,” Johnson said.
The weekend sales bump doesn’t appear to be enough to help retailers recover from the selloff in their shares last week. Target led the rout, with shares tumbling 15 percent, followed by a 12 percent loss at Kohl’s and 11 percent at TJX (NYSE:TJX) Cos., the owner of Marshalls and TJ Maxx. Investors ignored robust quarterly sales growth, focusing instead on squeezed profit margins as companies spend to raise wages and increase online sales, outdo each other on free shipping and face new tariffs in the Trump administration’s trade war with China.
In early trading Monday, Walmart, Target and Kohl’s were all up about 1 percent while Amazon gained 2 percent.
Cyber Monday has its roots in people returning to work from a long Thanksgiving weekend and using the fast internet connections of their office computers to search for the best deals. Such connections are prevalent now in homes and on smartphones, which should make the day less important. But shoppers are still conditioned to hunt for online deals, and retailers try to meet that expectation.
“Even though you see all these pre-Black Friday sales, people concentrate their spending on Cyber Monday,"" said Taylor Schreiner, director of Adobe Digital Insights.

Visitors to an Airbus delivery center in Toulouse on Monday saw at least two Airbus A330 aircraft and one smaller A320-family jet in position for handover to HNA-affiliated airlines. An electronic sign welcomed crew for an imminent A320 delivery.
""Some (HNA) planes will be delivered,"" an industry source said. 
However, another six A330 aircraft painted in flame-red HNA tail liveries remained parked in long-term storage elsewhere in Airbus's Toulouse base, according to Reuters journalists, who were attending an event at the facility for the first delivery of the upgraded A330neo version to TAP Portugal.
“Deliveries are ongoing. Contractual terms are confidential,” an Airbus spokesman said, when asked about HNA deliveries.
Companies belonging to the Chinese aviation-to-finance conglomerate delayed payments earlier this year, leading Airbus to suspend deliveries rather than step in to provide delivery financing itself, Reuters reported in July.
Airbus said last month it hoped to resolve by year-end an unidentified commercial issue surrounding current-generation A330 airplanes, which industry sources afterwards linked to the HNA payments stand-off.
Under pressure from Beijing, HNA Group is in the process of selling some $20 billion of assets, according to Reuters calculations and media reports, following a $50 billion acquisition spree.

Airbus aims to deliver a total of 782 aircraft this year including the stored HNA aircraft.

UK Prime Minister Theresa May will hold an emergency cabinet meeting on Monday to brief ministers on her strategy to convince the deal's critics that include the Northern Irish DUP party currently propping up May's government.

BLACK FRIDAY 
Wall Street stock futures firmed up after another negative session on Friday had seen the S&P 500 record its lowest close in six months, more than 10 percent down from September’s peaks, and pushed it back in 'correction' territory. (N)
Heavy oil price losses that sent Brent crude plunging below $58 per barrel had dragged energy stocks lower. Brent, hit by growing signs of crude oversupply on world markets as demand ebbs, clawed back lost ground first thing on Monday but has been struggling to keep a foothold above $60. 
Both U.S. WTI and Brent futures are down more than 20 percent this month, and unless they recover further this week the losses would mark their biggest fall since October, 2008.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) last stood at $60.15 per barrel, up 2.3 percent in London. U.S. crude futures (CLc1) last fetched $51.23 per barrel, up 1.6 percent on the day and off Friday's low of $50.15.
Overnight in Asia, MSCI's broadest index of the region's shares excluding Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) edged up 0.6 percent, led by gains in Hong Kong and Taiwan, while Japan's Nikkei (N225) advanced 0.8 percent. 
In China, the Shanghai composite index (SSEC) eased 0.1 percent, though, and Bitcoin (BTC=BTSP) extended its recent run of falls, dropping more than five percent from the day's highs as selling in cryptocurrencies gathered broad momentum again.
Bitcoin was last trading at $3,880 -- holding above the 2018 lows it hit last week but it has lost around three quarters of its value this year.

Gold, meanwhile, rose as fears of a slowdown in global economic growth and uncertainty surrounding the U.S. interest rate trajectory and U.S. China trade tensions bolstered the metal's appeal ahead of a G20 meeting at the end of the week.

434,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2018 05:10AM ET</span>","Mitsubishi Motors ousts Ghosn as chairman, follows Nissan's footsteps","By Sam Nussey and Chang-Ran Kim
TOKYO (Reuters) - Mitsubishi Motors Corp said on Monday its board removed Carlos Ghosn from his role as chairman, following his arrest and ouster from alliance partner Nissan Motor Co last week for alleged financial misconduct.
Ghosn's ouster marks the end of his chairmanship of Japanese automakers, just two years after he was praised for bringing a steadying hand to Mitsubishi Motors following a cheating scandal in 2016. CEO Osamu Masuko will become temporary chairman, the automaker said. 
The move comes amid discontent over French partner  Renault  (PA:RENA) SA's role in the 19-year alliance of which Ghosn was the driving force. Sealed in 1999 when Nissan was rescued from near-bankruptcy, it was enlarged in 2016 to include Mitsubishi and enabled the members to jointly develop products and control costs.
The alliance vies with Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and Toyota Motor Corp for the ranking of the world's biggest automaker. 
Even as Nissan has recovered and grown rapidly, it remains a junior partner in the shareholding structure. Renault owns 43 percent of Nissan and the Japanese automaker holds a 15 percent non-voting stake in the French firm. And Nissan is almost 60 percent bigger than Renault by sales. 
Top alliance executives are meeting this week in Amsterdam, aiming to shield their joint operations from the fallout of Ghosn's arrest as a power struggle between Nissan and Renault looms. Renault has refrained from firing him as chairman and CEO.
Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa told staff on Monday that power was too concentrated with Ghosn and that in future better communication between alliance board members and executives would help preserve independence and generate synergies among the automakers, a Nissan spokesman said. 
Ghosn was pushing for a deeper tie-up, including potentially a full merger between Renault and Nissan at the French government's urging, despite strong reservations at the Japanese firm.
Nissan removed Ghosn at a high stakes board meeting on Thursday after allegations of understating his income and using company money for personal use.
Ghosn has denied the allegations, public broadcaster NHK reported on Sunday. 
Nissan holds a controlling 34 percent stake in Mitsubishi Motors and has two executives on the board.
While the automakers have stressed that operations and business are proceeding as normal, Nissan has postponed the launch of its high-performance Leaf electric car ""to ensure that this important product unveiling could receive the coverage it merits"", a Nissan spokesman said.

Shares in Mitsubishi Motors closed up 3.3 percent ahead of the announcement while Nissan climbed 1.8 percent, outperforming the broader market's 0.8 percent gain.

435,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2018 05:05AM ET</span>","VW, Ford alliance borne out of need to adapt to fragmented markets","By Edward Taylor
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The proposed alliance between Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Ford (N:F) shows that the days of carmakers going it alone are over, as tariffs, new technology and tougher emissions rules fragment markets that were once global.
It and similar tie-ups may be the fulfillment of late Fiat chief executive Sergio Marchionne's 2015 prediction of a new era of auto industry consolidation. 
Firms that once sought a vehicle with universal global appeal to create economies of scale are now seeking advantages in specific market segments like hybrid SUVs, North American pickup trucks or European city cars. 
The shift toward electric and autonomous vehicles and a trade war that is forcing carmakers to build separate factories for Europe, the United States and China are helping accelerate the trend. So is the global clampdown on emissions following VW's 2015 diesel cheating scandal.
Carmakers long aspired to follow Henry Ford's ideal of using one set of production tools to supply markets all over the world at the lowest possible cost. 
They now see standardization of some technologies -- particularly engines and vehicle underpinnings, known as platforms -- as a potential source of cost savings, with other features used to lure consumers. 
""Economies of scale matter in architecture and powertrain,"" industry veteran Carl-Peter Forster, now a director of Volvo Cars, told Reuters.
""In theory you can keep costs down through lower tooling costs, but you need to make the product in different places in the world, which means double-tooling."" 
Ford and VW are not attempting a merger but want to share costs by joining forces in markets and technologies they have found problematic but do not want to retreat from. 
After struggling to make money from passenger cars in South America, China and Europe, Ford has dropped its focus on the Mondeo as a model for the world and abandoned new sedans. 
Volkswagen meanwhile remains a niche player in the profitable U.S. pickup truck segment. In September, it said it will cease producing its iconic Beetle as it readies for a future of mass-market electric cars.
Similar tie-ups point to a trend. Honda and General Motors (NYSE:GM) have agreed to split development costs on autonomous driving while Toyota and Mazda plan to follow Mercedes-Benz and Nissan in sharing a factory to serve the NAFTA markets. Jaguar Land Rover is looking at alliances in the area of powertrains.
Forster, who declined to comment on Ford and VW's proposed deal, said focused partnerships can work better than formal mergers, based on his experiences overseeing transformational takeovers and alliances at Tata, BMW and GM Europe. 
Speaking about the merits of consolidation to Reuters in 2015, Forster said there were limits to economies of scale. 
""With scale you reach a point when you no longer reap the benefits of lower cost per unit because of the added challenges of management complexity and bureaucracy,"" he said, citing an engine factory as an example.
Forster confirmed through a spokesman this week that his remarks are still current.

SERGIO'S GHOST
Marchionne, who died in July, is part of the reason Ford's shareholders are demanding it undertake a radical rethink of its global footprint and put greater emphasis on profitability. 
In an April 2015 presentation entitled 'Confessions of a Capital Junkie', the Italian accused the auto industry of wasting billions on duplicate products. 
He argued that about half of all investment spending went on developing technologies like four-cylinder engines, which customers mostly can't distinguish from each other and which are now secondary to styling and connectivity in driving purchases. ""Broadly speaking, I think it is reasonable that people are trying to establish alliances to get access to both markets and technologies to lower the cost of execution,"" Marchionne told journalists at the Geneva car show last March.  The advent of electric and autonomous cars, which shift the marketing focus to vehicles as cleaner and more intelligent, reinforces the case for alliances and consolidation, he said. ""If ... we are moving to a world where powertrains will significantly change ... the question then is, could that development be shared efficiently ...? The answer is yes,"" Marchionne said.  Ford Chief Executive Jim Hackett is bearing those comments in mind as he considers investments in expensive hybrid and electric technologies.  ""The capital it takes, and God bless Sergio, there is something wrong with that that we think we can fix,"" Hackett told Reuters.  ECONOMIES OF SCALE Volkswagen also needs to bring down the cost of developing new cars, while at the same boosting sales of zero-emission vehicles to some 30 percent of new car sales by 2030 to meet new European clean air rules. To tempt customers away from diesel, VW Chief Executive Herbert Diess wants to sell an electric car for less than 20,000 euros ($22,836), a source familiar with the plans told Reuters. That gives scope for Ford to broaden its alliance with VW from commercial vehicles into passenger cars, helping VW create more economies of scale in production and R&D. VW may free up capacity for electric cars at its Hannover plant by shifting production of transporter vans to a Ford plant in Turkey, a person familiar with VW's plans told Reuters.  It could offer Ford access to its electric cars platform in exchange for help developing the next VW Amarok midsized pickup. AUTONOMOUS DREAM New competitors from China and the U.S. tech sector and the need to accelerate investments have prompted VW to abandon its approach of developing everything in-house.  ""We need a massive increase in our competencies, partnerships and acquisitions,"" Diess said recently, identifying software and autonomous driving as key areas to catch up in. Last March, months before his death, Marchionne warned about overspending on autonomous driving, which he compared to the 19th century development of British railways.  ""How much (capital) needs to be wasted to provide progress is a very good question ... There is not a single railway company that built the network in the UK which is alive today. Although the technology endured, ""it was overbuilt, overspent, overburdened, most of them economically failed,"" Marchionne said.  
""Maybe we are living through a similar process.""

Outside politics, dealmaking drove the biggest moves.

 Melrose  Industries (L:MRON) meanwhile tumbled 4.8 percent after a Sky News report that the industrial company had got lower-than-expected bids for its Powder Metallurgy unit. 
Eurofins Scientific (PA:EUFI) rose 5.6 percent after the laboratory testing firm extended its organic growth objectives beyond 2020, and Berenberg raised the stock to ""buy"" from ""hold"".
Dutch marine engineer Boskalis (AS:BOSN) jostled for pole position with Eurofins, with its shares climbing 6 percent after it said it had signed a multi-year deal with Saudi Aramco to work on its offshore facilities.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The chairman of National Australia Bank Ltd (AX:NAB) said at an inquiry into sector misconduct that it would take a decade to fix the profiteering culture that has shredded the reputation of the lender and the broader financial industry. 
Damaging revelations of bribery, fraud, the charging of fees for no service and from the accounts of deceased people, as well as board-level deception of regulators have roiled Australia's financial sector since the explosive inquiry began in February.
Customers' trust in lenders has been ""pretty well eroded to zero"" after several months of damaging allegations, NAB Chairman Ken Henry said at the inquiry on Monday.
NAB, which like some of its peers has admitted to charging dead client accounts, has reviewed its culture and found ""insufficient intensity of focus on getting it right all the time"", Henry told the inquiry in Melbourne. 
The bank, the nation's fourth-biggest, has determined that it did not respond fast enough to regulators, Henry added.
Asked how long it would take the bank to change its culture, Henry said: ""it could be ten years"".
""I hope not, but it would not be unusual for organizations that seek to embed challenging cultures."" 
He did not specify why it would take 10 years to overhaul the culture. He, however, added that neither the bank nor its peers had a specific way to measure if leaders were embedding the desired culture. 
The investigation, called the Royal Commission, is taking evidence from financial services executives as it nears the end of hearings this Friday. 
Retired judge Kenneth Hayne, who is running the inquiry, will deliver a final report to the government by February.
NAB CEO, Andrew Thorburn, testified earlier in the day. 
He told the inquiry the bank was ""wrong"" but not dishonest when it charged fees to customers who had died.
""It's wrong (but) dishonesty goes to intent,"" Thorburn said.
""I don't think ... there was an intention to not do the right thing. I think it was wrong that we didn't pick it up, and I think we got onto it reasonably quickly but it was a process error. It broke trust with our clients.""

Henry continues his evidence on Tuesday.

443,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2018 01:16AM ET</span>","In China's hinterland, car market growth engine sputters","By Yilei Sun and Adam Jourdan
PINGDINGSHAN, China (Reuters) - When Cao Jun, 40, an engineer from the central Chinese city of Pingdingshan, takes his old, grey MG 3 car to be serviced he always steals a few moments to pop into the Nissan (T:7201) and Honda (T:7267) dealerships next door.
But the Civic and Sylphy sedans in the showrooms are just eye candy. Cao wants to upgrade his car, but he's facing a steep loan repayment on his flat, medical bills for his wife and a tough local economy in his once-prosperous coal town.
Cao is far from alone. China's car market, the world's largest, is on the brink of its first sales contraction in almost three decades, according to industry data, a signal of wider economic strains that are rattling the country's leaders in Beijing.
The slowdown - aggravated by a protracted trade war with the United States - is being most sharply felt in smaller, provincial cities like Pingdingshan, the engines of growth for Chinese consumption of cars and an array of consumer goods.
China has long hoped to spur consumption in these provincial cities as a way of diversifying an economy long reliant on manufacturing. But a slump in consumption spending is already being seen in things like cinema ticket sales, online shopping and smartphones purchases.
Part of the reason is that provincial city consumers like Cao are being squeezed tight.
Speaking to Reuters as he drove his MG through the outskirts of the city, Cao said capacity cuts at his main employer - the state-owned coal and chemicals conglomerate Pingmei Shenma Group - meant his income this year had dropped sharply.
He has taken up driving part-time for the ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing to make ends meet.
On a salary of around 6,000 yuan ($864.40) a month, Cao said he puts at least 1,000 yuan towards paying off his house loan, 400 yuan on medical bills for his wife and another large chunk on his two daughters' education.
""All these things put together, they slowly start to turn the screw on your life,"" he said. ""I want to drive a better car, but my situation won't allow it.
He added that the family had also cut back on luxuries like long-distance travel and fancy restaurants.
Cutbacks on car purchases by Cao and others like him in China's smaller cities, are hitting local car dealers and global automotive makers from General Motors Co (N:GM) to Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p).
""The main slowing markets now are those 4-6 tier cities in China,"" said Xu Haidong, assistant secretary general at the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, referring to smaller provincial urban centers.
""These were the cities leading China's auto sales growth in the past few years."" 
GRAPHIC: China's auto market stalls - https://tmsnrt.rs/2QDhPUR
JUST NOT WORKING
Consumers and car dealers in Pingdingshan all painted a similar picture. The city, 150 kilometers south of the provincial capital Zhengzhou, went through boom years from the 1990s, buoyed by a flourishing coal industry.
But amid a nationwide shift to cut reliance on polluting industries and a sharp shift away from coal, the city has suffered. Pingmei Shenma Group, one of the area's biggest employers, has cut back coal capacity and seen profits fall - creating a ripple effect through the local economy.
The group, like many state-owned firms around the country, reaches far into the community: it operates hospitals and schools, and provides pensions, subsidized housing for workers, water, heating and power.
During the growth years, a family car became a symbol of status and success in the city, driving growth faster than the national average. That has now changed.
""The situation here is really bad. We sold 40 percent fewer cars in October than September,"" said Zheng Shuke, a manager at an SAIC-VW dealership near a busy freeway outside Pingdingshan. ""This is very unusual in the 6 years I've been an auto dealer."" 
""I think the biggest reason is that fewer and fewer people have enough money to buy cars,"" he added. ""Our economy used to rely on natural resources. However now due to capacity cuts, fewer people can get the iron rice bowl,"" a reference to state firms cutting cradle-to-grave welfare support that he said had underpinned spending confidence.
Reuters spoke with 20 consumers, car dealers like Zheng, auto finance executives and government officials, mostly in and around Pingdingshan, who said the car market in the Henan province city had seen a sharp slump this year as consumers tightened their belts.
Henan province is one of China's biggest by auto sales with over a million passenger car units sold this year. But growth has stalled sharply, according to data from local consultancy Daas-Auto.
Henan auto sales dropped 18 percent in October after a 25 percent drop the month before, outstripping a fall in sales nationwide of almost 12 percent last month, the fourth straight month of declines.
In response, car dealers in Pingdingshan have cut prices to lure buyers, according to dealers and adverts circulated on local social media.
""We're offering discounts, but these just don't seem to be working,"" said Zheng, the car dealer.
INVENTORY BUILD-UP
Across town at a ten-year-old dealership for GM-linked Wuling-Baojun cars, manager Jiang Long said customers had dwindled this year, especially since June.
In front of the store 100 new cars waited to be sold, but customers were in short supply when Reuters visited. Jiang said sales were down 40-60 percent versus last year.
""This is just part of our inventory, we have more in other places,"" said Jiang. ""We make many calls to old customers to attract them to buy new cars, but they just don't seem enthusiastic this year.""
The top-selling cars in the area are mostly no-frills, practical cars, industry data show, a trend mirrored in other provincial cities and rural areas.
In Pingdingshan, the top-sellers are the compact multipurpose vehicle Wuling Hongguang, 7-seater people carrier Baojun 730, Great Wall Motor Co's (SS:601633) Haval H6, Volkswagen's Lavida and GM's Buick Excelle.
Outside the city in nearby Lushan county another Wuling-Baojun dealer, Si Pengyuan, said local families used to take pride in having the best car, but had pulled back - cutting his sales in half versus 2017.
""Rural people like to compete; when a family buys a car their neighbors will come and buy one too,"" he said. ""But this year people just aren't coming. Families who have had cars for years aren't replacing them.""
CREDIT CRUNCH
Pingdingshan's downturn has spooked business people and the local government, which says that young people have less buying power or are moving away entirely.
The slowing economy has sapped consumer confidence even as access to credit has dwindled amid a crackdown on risky lending and high levels of debt. This credit had previously spurred car purchases, some dealers said.
Zhang Yinlong, a local manager at an auto finance firm, told Reuters at a large second-hand car market near the city that it was a ""bad time"" to be in the industry. ""I don't see many customers are buying car these months,"" he said.
Ruan Pengfei, 33, who owns a children's clothes shop, is one feeling the pinch. A self-confessed car nut with two kids, he bought a new Buick Excelle GT for 110,000 yuan less than a year ago and loves to drive it to work.
But with sales at his shop slumping, he's now reluctantly trying to sell the car for 85,000 yuan via an online platform and reverting back to his older Honda Fit.
He said he's struggling to sell the Buick - with few people willing to buy even at a discount.
""My bottom price for this car is 80,000 yuan, but people who came all complained about the price,"" he said.

Nissan made the comment after the Nikkei business daily quoted Saikawa as telling employees that Nissan's ""tie-up relationship with Renault was not on an equal basis"", noting that Renault owns 43 percent of Nissan, while the Japanese firm holds a non-voting 15 percent in Renault.
A Nissan spokesman said Saikawa had mentioned an excessive concentration of power in one person - Carlos Ghosn - who is CEO and chairman of Renault and was, until his ousting last Thursday, also chairman of Nissan. 

That had discouraged the other board members of Renault and Nissan from communicating directly with each other, instead escalating decisions to Ghosn, the spokesman quoted Saikawa as telling staff.

MONTREAL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) is set to make a major announcement on Monday that will affect its global operations and threatens to shutdown a big vehicle assembly plant in the province of Ontario, a Canadian union said on Sunday.
Unifor, which represents most unionized autoworkers in Canada, said it had been informed by GM that there would be no product allocated to the plant in Oshawa after December 2019, a development that would affect production at the plant.
The union statement came after a Canadian TV news channel said GM was planning to close all operations at the plant in Oshawa, near Toronto.
A GM spokesman declined to comment on Sunday evening.
GM has been cutting jobs to deal with plunging car sales in North America. The company has internally debated for months how to address shrinking car demand, a person briefed on the matter said, and the issue is certain to re-emerge when GM holds contract talks next year with the United Auto Workers union.
GM is expected to announce as soon as this week some involuntary salaried layoffs after it did not get as many volunteers to accept buyouts as hoped, the person said.
GM said on Oct. 31 that about 18,000 of its 50,000 salaried employees in North America are eligible for the buyouts.
The stepped up cost-cutting and restructuring at GM comes as many industry executives and analysts predict that overall vehicle sales in the United States will decline further in 2019 and 2020.
At the same time, China, the world's largest auto market and GM's biggest market by vehicle sales, has decelerated sharply in the past few months.
Analysts have said GM has too many North American plants building slow-selling sedans.
GM shares are down 12 percent for the year, and GM Chief Executive Mary Barra, in a message to employees last month, cited the stagnant share price as a reason for tougher restructuring measures.
She said the automaker had negative cash flow for the first nine months of the year and it needed to cut costs.
BUYOUTS
GM has been offering buyouts to North American salaried workers and has said it could lay off white-collar staff if it does not hit a cost-cutting target.
The person briefed on the matter confirmed that GM planned a major announcement on the future of the Oshawa plant, but said the automaker wanted to notify employees of its plans before making any announcements about the plant.
Total vehicle production at the Oshawa complex fell 60 percent through the first ten months of 2018 from the same period a year ago, according to Automotive News production data.
GM employs about 2,500 union staff in Oshawa which produces both the Chevrolet Impala and Cadillac XTS sedans. It also completes final assembly of the stronger-selling Silverado and Sierra pickup trucks which are shipped from Indiana.
Political pressure in Canada is already mounting on GM, which had accepted billions of dollars in aid from the U.S., Canadian and Ontario governments after filing for bankruptcy protection during the 2009 global economic downturn.
""We are aware of the reports and we will be working in the coming days to determine how we can continue supporting our auto sector and workers,"" a Canadian government official said.
""The jobs of many families are on the line,"" said Colin Carrie, a Member of Parliament for Oshawa. ""Communities all over Ontario would be devastated if this plant were to close.
The U.S.-based automaker has other operations in Canada, including a plant in Ingersoll, Ontario, where it assembles the Chevrolet Equinox.
The reported plant closure is a further blow to the Canadian auto industry, which has lost jobs to the United States, where governments offer manufacturers rich incentives, and Mexico, where labor costs are lower.

However, a new trade deal that the United States, Mexico and Canada struck in September leaves significant room for Canadian plants to grow exports duty-free.

(Reuters) - Campbell Soup and Third Point LLC are close to settling a bitter proxy contest by adding two of the hedge fund's nominees to the U.S. food company's board and giving the activist investor a say in selecting Campbell's next CEO, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday.
A deal between Campbell Soup and billionaire investor Daniel Loeb's Third Point would end one of the most acrimonious U.S. proxy battles only days before investors were scheduled to vote on Thursday at Campbell's annual meeting.
Under the deal being negotiated, Campbell Soup would expand its board, naming two Third Point nominees, the sources said. These people will provide input on appointment of another director, expanding the board to 15 members. The hedge fund would promise to refrain from running a proxy contest in the next year, the sources said.
Through the directors it nominates, Third Point will have a say in naming the company's next CEO. Denise Morrison stepped down from the post last May. Campbell Soup director Keith McLoughlin has filled the vacancy on an interim basis and has said he does not want the position permanently.
The company aims to name a permanent CEO before year end. Chief Operating Officer Luca Mignini is one contender, sources have said, but Third Point has said an insider would be unacceptable. The hedge fund has been courting its own candidate, according to a source familiar with the matter.
The proxy fight between Loeb and Campbell Soup has been one of the year's most bitter. Third Point, which owns about 7 percent of Campbell Soup, was lining up support from other investors, but it was becoming increasingly clear the fund could not beat a bloc of heirs to the Campbell fortune who control 41 percent of the company and have three board seats.
The potential settlement looks similar to an offer Campbell proposed to Third Point earlier this month. Third Point had rejected the company's offer to name as directors marketing expert Sarah Hofstetter, president of Comscore Inc (O:SCOR), and former Blue Buffalo CEO Kurt Schmidt, who brings operational experience. The two are now expected to join the board.
Campbell Soup and Third Point did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Wall Street Journal first reported on the potential settlement earlier on Sunday.
Third Point surfaced as an investor in Campbell Soup over the summer, criticizing the lagging share price and spree of costly acquisitions and asking management to explore a sale. Campbell's stock has lost about a third in value over the past two years.
One of Third Point's main criticisms has been the board's lack of succession planning to replace Morrison, who pushed for acquisitions, including the purchase of Snyder's-Lance, which added to Campbell's debt load. 
When Third Point launched the proxy contest, its first since taking on Sotheby's four years ago, it sought to oust Campbell Soup's entire board, including three descendants of John Dorrance, inventor of condensed soup who ran Campbell's a century ago. 
It allied itself with Campbell heir George Strawbridge. Third Point later scaled back its demands and got backing for its five nominees from proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc.
This year activist investors have launched 42 proxy contests at U.S.-based companies and 13 have been settled, data from Activist Insight show.
STRATEGIC REVIEW
Third Point pushed to put one of its partners on the board, saying Campbell needed financial expertise. As part of the settlement, it will now make periodic presentations to the board on financial matters, a person familiar with the negotiations said.
After Morrison departed, Campbell Soup went through a strategic review and announced in August plans to sell its international and refrigerated foods business and explore the possibility of a full sale. McLoughlin said the company had lost focus within its brands and did not do enough to keep its soups business relevant to modern consumers.
Campbell had maintained that Third Point lacked a smart plan to improve the company's fortunes. On Tuesday, the company's hand looked stronger when it reported a smaller-than-expected decline in quarterly earnings.

Also last week, McLoughlin met with Loeb in an effort to reach a deal, one of the sources said.

Biotechnology firm Ascletis Pharma Inc., whose retail book was covered 10 times, is down 44 percent from its IPO price, and Meituan Dianping, a food-delivery giant that attracted billionaire investors including Hong Kong’s richest man Li Ka-shing, has dropped 23 percent.

Investing five to six months before the elections in 2009 and 2014 earned an average three to six percent more than the Indian benchmark return in the five-year period to the next vote, said Vidya Bala, head of mutual fund research at the online retail investment platform with assets equivalent to $775 million under management.
“Elections are a season of volatility and it is good to capture this period,” she said, adding that by the time the results are out, most of the uncertainty is priced in and the equity market moves on from the verdict.
Political uncertainty is emerging as a key risk for investors as Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party faces elections in five states before a national vote to be held by May. Some opinion polls are predicting a win for the main opposition Congress in Rajasthan, and a close contest in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh -- both of which are currently ruled by the BJP.
A verdict in favor of continuity would be beneficial for companies that are direct beneficiaries of an improving economic outlook, such as financial services, manufacturing, transportation and logistics firms, according to Funds India. Defensive stocks such as those in the consumer sector and multinational firms would likely fare better on opposition gains, it said.
Still, while FundsIndia has launched two portfolios of mutual funds geared toward both possible outcomes from next year’s general election -- the current government retaining power or a change at the centre -- Bala doesn’t see a huge deviation ahead for longer-term investors.
“Investors have a strong view on elections and the portfolios address both the aggressive and defensive investor,” she said. “However, over a five-year period, we don’t expect a wide difference between the returns they will offer.”

(Reuters) -  Logitech  International SA (S:LOGN), a Swiss manufacturer of keyboards and webcams, has ended discussions to acquire  Plantronics Inc  (N:PLT), a U.S. maker of Bluetooth earpieces and gaming headsets, the companies said on Sunday.
The announcement came after Reuters reported on the negotiations between Logitech and Plantronics last Friday. The companies confirmed the talks on Sunday, but said they had now been terminated.
Plantronics added in its statement that Logitech approached it regarding a potential acquisition, and that it engaged in discussions in line with its fiduciary duties. It said it would deliver on its strategy as a stand-alone company.
""I have been and remain tremendously optimistic about the opportunity in front of us, and with our focused strategy and leadership team, I am confident that Plantronics will create significant long term value for shareholders,"" Plantronics Chief Executive Joe Burton said in the statement.
Logitech and Plantronics were hoping to successfully conclude negotiations this week, but Logitech's board decided on Sunday to walk away from the potential deal, according to people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity to discuss the confidential discussions.
Logitech's board ended negotiations over price disagreements, according to a source close to the company. That was despite Plantronics having opened its books to Logitech on the basis of an offer by Logitech that was well in excess of $3 billion, three of the sources added.
Plantronics had a market capitalization of about $2 billion as of the end of trading on Friday.
The deal would have been by far Logitech's largest acquisition, amid a push to diversify its business beyond computer peripherals. It would have come as Logitech and Plantronics seek to keep down manufacturing costs following the introduction of tariffs on imports from China into the United States. 
Logitech's and Plantronics' businesses have been under pressure as a result of new offerings being developed, not just from network gear makers such as Cisco Systems Inc (O:CSCO), but
from major technology companies such as Microsoft Inc (O:MSFT) and Google owner Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL).
Founded in 1981, Logitech has been countering declining sales of personal computers by focusing on consumer accessories that are benefiting from the growth of cloud computing, such as gaming, music, smart home connectivity and video conferencing. The Lausanne-based company has a market capitalization of $5.6 billion.
Last year, Logitech acquired ASTRO Gaming for $85 million in cash to expand in the video game sector.
Santa Cruz, California-based Plantronics makes unified communications systems, wireless headsets, conferencing systems, and some software, which it sells to businesses and consumers. 
Founded in 1961, Plantronics' first products were lightweight headsets for airline pilots. It later became known for selling headsets to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, including the ones worn by Neil Armstrong during his first moonwalk in 1969.

A sale of Plantronics would have come on the heels of the company's $2 billion acquisition in July of U.S. video-conferencing equipment maker Polycom Inc.

“If we get some sort of signal at the end of the month that there will be cooperation or negotiation between the U.S. and China instead of further escalation, that could be the catalyst for additional dollar weakness,” said Daniel Morris, a senior investment strategist at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Asset Management in London. “It should also support the local markets.”
Investors will also be following speeches by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, especially since traders are pricing in a slower pace of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. They will also be parsing minutes of the Fed’s November meeting on Thursday to gauge if their carry returns this month, which are set for the highest since January, are in danger.

456,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2018 10:42AM ET</span>",Renault-Nissan leaders to meet amid tensions over Ghosn ouster,"By Laurence Frost and Norihiko Shirouzu
PARIS/BEIJING (Reuters) - Renault-Nissan executives will attempt this coming week to shield their joint operations from a looming power struggle between the carmakers, following alliance boss Carlos Ghosn's shock arrest over misconduct allegations.
Top executives from both manufacturers and third partner Mitsubishi will attend mid-week operations committee meetings in Amsterdam that had been planned before Ghosn's Nov. 19 detention in Japan, the companies confirmed.
""There is no change in our alliance relationship,"" a Mitsubishi spokesman said.
While Nissan and 43.4 percent-owner  Renault  (PA:RENA) have vowed to safeguard the partnership, the Japanese carmaker's Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa also made clear he wants to end its French parent's control of the alliance, as he moved swiftly to oust Ghosn as chairman.
Ghosn, 64, and alleged co-conspirator Greg Kelly, a fellow Nissan director, both deny accusations that they under-reported Ghosn's compensation, misrepresented Nissan investments and made personal use of company funds, Japanese broadcaster NHK reported.
Renault has refrained from dismissing Ghosn as chairman and CEO, while demanding that Nissan share findings from the months-long internal investigation that led to his arrest. Ghosn's duties have been delegated to second-in-command Thierry Bollore and board director Philippe Lagayette.
RIGHTS DISPUTE
Behind the scenes, fundamental differences have opened up over Renault's rights under the alliance's Restated Alliance Master Agreement (RAMA), sources familiar with the matter said.
Nissan, the larger partner by sales, has also revived a long-held ambition to force Renault to sell down its controlling stake.
On the eve of Ghosn's Nov. 22 ouster from Nissan, Renault informed Saikawa and his board colleagues that it planned to appoint a fourth director under the terms of the 2002 founding pact, Reuters earlier reported.
In his formal response, the Nissan CEO insisted Renault had no right to make further appointments. The French company currently has three Nissan board members - including Ghosn, whose directorship can be revoked only by a shareholder meeting.
The number of Renault managers on Nissan's executive committee might even be reduced, one company official told Reuters. ""Discussions might include whether to let Renault keep its two positions,"" he said.
The French government, Renault's biggest shareholder, weighed in on Sunday. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said he was still waiting for evidence of wrongdoing by Ghosn - adding that a new audit would be carried out at Renault.
Efforts underway to secure and deepen the Renault-Nissan alliance must ""respect the crossed shareholdings such as they are today,"" the minister also told BFM TV. Nissan currently holds a reciprocal non-voting 15 percent stake in Renault.
INVESTOR PRESSURE
Saikawa's independence struggle is already drawing support from investors keen to unlock the discounted value of Renault's large holding in its Japanese affiliate.
""The relationship between Nissan and Renault needs to be rebalanced,"" Evercore analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said on Sunday. ""We urge Renault to sell down its stake in Nissan ... toward 25 percent (and) use the proceeds to buy back its own stock."" 
At Nissan's Thursday board meeting, Renault appointees also voted to eject Ghosn. They did so after reviewing 400 pages of internal findings, sources said - but are barred from sharing the information even with the French carmaker.
The Amsterdam gathering is likely to see Bollore and Saikawa meet face-to-face for the first time since Ghosn's arrest, sources close to the companies said.
""These are purely operational sessions,"" a Renault official said.
All three carmakers have stressed that operations and alliance business are proceeding as normal. Nissan, however, called off the launch of a high-performance Leaf electric car, cancelling Nov. 28 events in Yokohama and Amsterdam.

A Nissan spokesman gave no reason for the postponement and said the company had yet to set a new date for the announcement.

ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Luxury carmaker  Aston Martin  (L:AML), has not yet seen a slowdown in its key markets and aims to more than double the number of cars it makes by 2025, its chief executive said on Sunday.
The British automaker, whose sports cars feature in James Bond films, is on target to produce 6,400 vehicles this year despite the pressures of slowing Chinese demand and worries over the impact of Brexit.
The company is looking to manufacture 14,000 cars by 2025 with the size of the company growing four-fold from what it was in 2014, said CEO Andy Palmer.
It will also become a very profitable company, he said.
In 2017, Aston Martin made a pre-tax profit of 87 million pounds ($111 million), its first annual pre-tax profit since 2010.
""The rich are getting richer, they want more personalization,"" Palmer told Reuters in Abu Dhabi on the sidelines of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix where Aston Martin is the title sponsor of the Red Bull Formula One team. 
""On the other hand, the car industry is getting more and more commoditized because of technology,"" he added.
Palmer dismissed the notion that there was a slowdown in key markets. In the year-to-date the company saw turnover grow 185 percent in the U.S; 133 percent growth in Asia-Pacific and 118 percent growth in China, he said.
""The retail part is not in dispute. China was slow, but not for us,"" he said.
The company is confident it will achieve higher profits in 2018 over last year minus the one-off costs such as those related to its initial public offering in October. 
""If you focus on EBITDA, then yes we obviously will see growth. Excluding one-off costs, last 12 months, it all looks very healthy,"" he said, without citing figures. 
Adjusted EBITDA more than doubled to 207 million pounds in 2017. 
The company is on track to launch its new sport utility vehicle (SUV) in late 2019. It is betting on existing Aston Martin customers who also have an SUV in their garage, Palmer said, adding that demand for SUV's in the Middle East North Africa (MENA) region was similar in size to China.

ZURICH (Reuters) - The chief executives of ABB (S:ABBN) and  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) are traveling to Saudi Arabia to attend a supplier conference, just weeks after they pulled out of an investment event in the country following the death of a journalist.
ABB CEO Ulrich Spiesshofer and Joe Kaeser from Siemens will travel to Dammam for an event organized by Saudi Aramco called In-Kingdom Total Value Add (IKTVA) which is due to take place on Monday and Tuesday.
The pair had been among the executives who boycotted an earlier investment conference following the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist who was critical of the Saudi government.
During his trip Spiesshofer will visit an ABB factory in Dammam, and will also meet representatives from Saudi Aramco, one of ABB's most important customers in the region.
Among other attendees at the IKTVA event are Paal Kibsgaard from Schlumberger (N:SLB) and Jeff Miller, CEO of oilfield services company Halliburton (N:HAL).
""Alongside being a responsible partner to our customers, we act as a responsible employer to our workforce. Therefore, our CEO will meet some 200 employees at our plant in Dammam during his trip to Saudi Arabia,"" ABB said in a statement on Sunday.
""In addition, the CEO will also be meeting one of our most important customers in the region in order to foster further dialogue with them.""
A person familiar with the situation said Spiesshofer was only taking part in the opening ceremony, and would not be a speaker or a panelist.
Siemens confirmed the attendance of Kaeser at IKTVA, where he is among the speakers, but said the executive would not meet with officials from the Saudi government.
""This is a business trip to the Middle East where Mr. Kaeser will visit customers and business partners in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia among others,"" a Siemens spokesman said.
""In Saudi Arabia he will visit only our customer, Saudi Aramco, in Dammam.""
More than two dozen top officials and executives from the United States and Europe boycotted an investment conference last month over the killing of Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.
Khashoggi, a critic of the Saudi government and a columnist for the Washington Post, was killed on Oct. 2 when he went there to pick up documents for his planned marriage to a Turkish woman.

The CIA believes Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the killing of Khashoggi, sources have told Reuters, a claim rejected by the Saudi embassy in Washington.

Germany's Allianz Group (DE:ALVG) will be permitted to establish China's first foreign insurance holding company, and Hong Kong's Chiyu Bank has been approved to set up a branch in Shenzhen, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) said.
The regulator said it would ""steadily expand"" the opening up of China's financial sector, while at the same time improve its risk prevention and supervision capabilities. 
Allianz chief executive Oliver Bate said in a statement that the move was a ""significant milestone"" and the group expected the holding company to be established in 2019.
Chinese President Xi Jinping said in Shanghai earlier this month that China would work to broaden market access for foreign players while boosting imports and strengthening intellectual property rights. 
The banking regulator said it has recently given the go-ahead for Taiwan's Fubon Bank, ICBC-AXA Assurance Co., Ltd. and the Korean Reinsurance Co (KS:003690) to set up local units.

The regulator issued draft guidelines late last year to help promote foreign investment in the financial sector, cutting red tape and creating a level playing field for foreign institutions to set up branches, raise debt and hire senior executives.

WASHINGTON/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The head of Russian oil company Rosneft (MM:ROSN), Igor Sechin, flew to Caracas this week to meet Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and complain over delayed oil shipments designed to repay loans, two sources briefed on the conversation said on Saturday.
The visit, which was not publicly disclosed, is one of the clearest signs of strain between crisis-stricken Venezuela and its key financier Russia.
Over the last few years, Moscow has become Venezuela’s lender of last resort, with the Russian government and Rosneft handing Venezuela at least $17 billion in loans and credit lines since 2006, according to Reuters calculations.
State oil company PDVSA is repaying almost all of those debts with oil, but a meltdown in its oil industry has left it struggling to fulfill obligations.
Sechin and a large delegation of executives met with officials at PDVSA in a Caracas hotel this week. Sechin also met with Venezuela's leftist leader Maduro, and chided him overoil-for-loans shipments that are behind schedule.
""He brought information showing that they were meeting obligations with China but not with them,"" said one source with knowledge of the talks.
""They're running around in PDVSA because of this,"" added the source, asking to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak to media.
The country's oil production has fallen to just 1.17 million barrels-per-day, a 37 percent drop in the last year, according to reports from secondary sources to OPEC, leaving itstruggling to ship Russian entities the roughly 380,000 bpd it has agreed to send, according to PDVSA documents seen by Reuters. 
The closing of a dock at Venezuela's main oil export port, through which the vast majority of shipments to Rosneft transit, has delayed millions of barrels in crude since August.
Sechin handed Maduro graphics about oil shipments to Russian entities compared with China, the two sources said.
Top financier China, which has ploughed more than $50 billion into Venezuela, also gets reimbursed in oil.
According to Reuters calculations based on PDVSA data, the Caracas-based company delivered around 463,500 bpd to Chinese firms between January and August, a roughly 60 percent compliance rate. That compares with around 176,680 bpd to Russian entities, or a 40 percent compliance rate.
Rosneft and PDVSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
One of the sources with knowledge of Sechin's visit, as well as two separate sources, said a Chinese delegation was also in Caracas this week.
CHINA, RUSSIA VIE FOR VENEZUELA OIL
As of early 2017, PDVSA began to fall months behind on shipments of crude and fuel under the loan deals with China and Russia due to problems in its oil industry, home to the world's biggest crude reserves, according to documents reviewed by Reuters.
The problems include operational mishaps, such as refining outages and delayed cleaning of tanker hulls, and financial disputes with service providers owed money by PDVSA.
This April, Rosneft and PDVSA signed a refinancing agreement designed to allow the Venezuelan company to catch up on delayed loan payments by delivering more crude to Rosneft. Under the refinancing, PDVSA has to provide Rosneft with some 380,000 bpd, up from around 310,000 bpd, according to Reuters calculations.
The Russian company was planning on using Jose’s South dock to pick up the cargoes, before an August tanker collision delayed exports to Rosneft. PDVSA reopened the dock earlier this month, sources said.
China agreed to use ship-to-ship (STS) operations to avoid Venezuela's clogged ports. However, the clients to whom Rosneft sends Venezuelan crude, Russian-backed Indian refiner Nayara Energy and Indian conglomerate Reliance, did not agree to STS transfers, likely heightening delays.

466,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 24, 2018 09:35AM ET</span>",Egypt says U.S. oil firms showing appetite for offshore projects,"By Davide Barbuscia
ROME (Reuters) - Egypt sees increasing interest from U.S. energy companies in developing its offshore oil and natural gas resources and expects them to participate in two bidding rounds due before year-end, Petroleum Minister Tarek El Molla said.
Egypt has emerged as an attractive destination for foreign energy firms following a string of major discoveries in recent years including the giant Zohr offshore field, which holds an estimated 30 trillion cubic feet of gas.
Molla said Egypt wanted to become a regional trading gas hub now it had achieved its goal of self-sufficiency, but would focus on meeting its existing commitments -- including a contract to supply Jordan -- once exports are resumed.
While declining to name potential bidders, Molla said there was ""an increase in appetite from different American companies and we will see this in practical ways when the closing of the bidding rounds and submission of offers.""
""This will be the proof that they're interested,"" he said.
Molla, who met U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Energy Resources Francis Fannon in Cairo last week, said bidding for exploration and exploitation of gas and oil in offshore concession blocks in the Mediterranean under state-run importer EGAS was due to close on Nov. 29.
A second bidding round for concession areas in the Red Sea is scheduled to open before the end of the year, he added.
Officials and industry sources said last year that  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM.N) was considering a foray into Egyptian offshore oil and gas, seeking to replicate rivals' success in the country and boost its reserves.
GAS TRADING HUB
Molla highlighted the existing operations of U.S. companies including Apache (N:APA), which is currently engaged in onshore exploration and production. 
""We'd like to have and attract more companies in the oil and gas sector for the offshore, and I think that with the opening of ... the new frontier area like the Red Sea and what we are talking about now in the bid rounds of EGAS and (state-controlled Egyptian General Petroleum Corp) EGPC, this is all really attracting a lot of attention to American companies,"" he said.
Molla has said previously that Egypt aimed to attract about $10 billion in foreign investment in the oil and gas sector in the fiscal year that began in July 2018. 
The minister said that while Egypt was focusing on using its infrastructure to become a regional gas trading hub, importing gas from countries including Cyprus and Israel, Cairo would honor a contract with Jordan that had been delayed by domestic needs.
""But now, as we have reached the self-sufficiency two months ago, when we resume exports priority will be for those existing contracts,"" he said.
Egypt has signed a deal with Cyprus for the construction of a pipeline that will channel gas from the island's Aphrodite field to facilities in Egypt. 
Molla said there was no specific date for work to start on the pipeline but cited the Cypriot side as saying the pipeline could be up and running within four years.
An Egyptian company has signed a $15 billion deal to import gas from Israel for processing in Egypt.

""So we will import and export at the same time, so we're talking about a trading hub,"" Molla said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. fund investors renewed their concerns about credit quality in corporate debt markets during the latest week, hitting leveraged loan and high-yield debt funds with multibillion-dollar withdrawals, Lipper data showed on Friday.
So-called ""loan participation funds,"" made up of funds that buy loans to highly indebted companies that typically must pay investors more as interest rates rise, posted $1.7 billion in withdrawals during the week ended Nov. 21. That was the most cash pulled from those funds since December 2015, the research service's data showed.
High-yield ""junk"" bond funds based in the United States recorded $2.2 billion in withdrawals, the most in four weeks. Those funds include bonds from issuers with lower credit ratings.
Sentiment around corporate credit has turned more negative in recent weeks on concerns that economic and profit growth is starting to peak as rising interest rates from the Federal Reserve put more pressure on debtors.
The market includes a high number of issuers in the energy industry, which adds to the pressure on high-yield debt. Benchmark international Brent crude oil prices (LCOc1) are about $59 a barrel, down more than 30 percent from highs above $86 just last month.
The $14 billion iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (P:HYG), one widely traded junk bond fund, has nearly 15 percent of its holdings in the energy sector.
In further signs of the risk-aversion, investors pulled $1.4 billion from technology sector stock funds in the week, the most since February 2015. Tech funds have been the stars in the U.S. equity market's near-10-year run but have been bludgeoned by the change in sentiment and dour headlines, including Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) earlier this month putting out a lower-than-expected sales forecast for the Christmas quarter that jolted parts suppliers across the world.
Short-term U.S. Treasury funds gathered $2.6 billion, the most since January 2016. The funds have low credit risk because the issuer is the government and less sensitivity to rates because they repay over a shorter time frame, allowing investors to reinvest the proceeds at higher rates.
One area in funds does reflect an appetite for greater risk-taking among investors. U.S.-based funds invested in emerging market equities, such as those in China, pulled in $1.4 billion during the week, the most cash since March. Helping those stocks is a slowdown in gains for the U.S. dollar, whose rise this year put pressure on countries with greenback-denominated debts.

474,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2018 02:28PM ET</span>","Black Friday deals lure U.S. shoppers, biggest sales gains online","By Nandita Bose and Melissa Fares
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shoppers across the United States snapped up deep discounts on toys, clothing and electronics both online and at stores on Black Friday, giving retailers a strong start to their make-or-break holiday season.
A healthy economy and rising wages gave people the confidence to splash out on retailers' annual raft of bargains. 
“The prices today are very good,” said Jose Manuel Cruz Hernandez, 59, who hit the Del Amo Fashion Center in Torrance, California, with his sister Paulina Cruz, 66, who comes every year from Mexico City to shop. 
The pair spent $120 on princess dolls and other toys at the Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co store, where items were 20 percent off. They spent a similar amount at Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS), where items were discounted by about 55 percent. 
Cruz Hernandez, a foreman at an aerospace firm, said he was comfortable with the U.S. economy and his own finances and plans to spend another $1,000 on holiday gifts - about the same as last year.
A similar story played out online, where shoppers spent $643 million by 10 a.m. ET, up 28 percent from a year ago, according to Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Analytics, which tracks transactions at most of the top U.S. online retailers. Smartphone sales in particular contributed to gains.
Foot traffic looked healthy at stores offering discounts, although detailed numbers on brick-and-mortar holiday sales will not be available for several days.
""Overall, Black Friday doesn't have the sense of urgency as in the past and feels more like a busy regular weekend day in many of the stores,"" said Dana Telsey at Telsey Advisory Group. 
""Many of the promotions were available for the past couple of weeks,"" Telsey said. ""We haven't noticed desperation from any retailer."" 
Shares of Macy's Inc, Kohl's Corp, and  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) all closed down on Friday and weighed on the broader S&P 500 retailing index, which closed down 0.56 percent. 
Investors are concerned retail sales growth may have peaked in the second quarter and business will slow down as comparisons get tougher, said Brian Yarbrough, retail analyst with Edward Jones. 
Victoria's Secret owner L Brands (NYSE:LB), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and  American Eagle Outfitters  (NYSE:AEO) rose. J.C. Penney Co Inc ended flat and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) closed slightly lower. 
The overall stock market finished a shortened session with losses. 
STRONG ONLINE SALES
Early numbers showed overall retail sales, both in stores and online, were in line with expectations, according to Mastercard (NYSE:MA) Inc's SpendingPulse retail report. The firm expects overall Black Friday sales to top $23 billion this year, up from $21 billion last year.
Mastercard combines sales activity in its payments network with estimates of cash and other payment forms. It said cold weather in the eastern United States and wet weather in the west may be pushing more consumers online. 
Online spending is on track to hit $6.4 billion on Friday, Adobe said. Online sales on Thanksgiving Day were up 28 percent at $3.7 billion.
The National Retail Federation forecast U.S. holiday retail sales in November and December will increase between 4.3 and 4.8 percent over 2017 for a total of $717.45 billion to $720.89 billion. That compares with an average annual increase of 3.9 percent over the past five years.
About 38 percent of American consumers plan to shop on Black Friday, a Reuters/Ipsos poll showed last week.
Very cold weather in the U.S. Northeast may have kept some shoppers at home, although industry analysts also reported added demand for coats and other warm clothing. An Athleta clothing store in Tysons, Virginia, provided hot chocolate with marshmallows to women in line for the dressing room. 
DEAL FRENZY
Shoppers picked up big-ticket items such as TVs, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPads and Watches at Target, while phones, toys, gaming consoles and cookware were top sellers at Walmart Inc.
Many shoppers sought out air fryers, which do not use oil to deep fry food and Instant Pots. Kohl's Chief Executive Michelle Gass told CNBC the company was selling 60 Instant Pots per minute online on Thanksgiving Day.
While most retailers have not changed their deals and discounts year-over-year, many have moved their start dates earlier and offered more teasers, according to deal site RetailMeNot. 
The deepest discounts in apparel and accessories were offered by Michael Kors, which ran a 60 percent discount sale; Gap, which offered 50 percent off site-wide; and Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN), which gave away up to 60 percent on merchandise.
Other deals included: 
* An H&M store in Manhattan offered 30 percent off everything in-store and online.
* Macy's in Herald Square (NYSE:SQ), Manhattan, sold a Coach designer wallet, originally $225, for $53. Coach bags there, originally $259, were half off.
* Midtown Comics was taking 25 percent off everything at its three Manhattan locations until noon. 
* An Eddie Bauer in Chicago offered 50 percent off all items. 
* At a Chicago-area Pandora, which sells popular charm bracelets that can cost up to $1,000, jewelry was 35 percent off before 10 a.m. and 25 percent off for the remainder of the day. 
* J Crew clothing was 50 percent off. Its site experienced some technical difficulties. 
* Walmart was selling a Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Home mini for $99. 
REPLACING A TOY STORE
Many retailers, reacting to the bankruptcy of the Toys 'R' Us chain, are catering to parents. 
Target said in October it planned to dedicate nearly a quarter of a million square feet of new space to its toy business across 500 of its stores. 
“Toys 'R' Us had better quality for toys,” said Ashley Drew, 29, shopping for her 5-year-old daughter at a Los Angeles-area Walmart, next door to the empty shell of a Toys 'R' Us store. 
Department store JC Penney, known for its mid-priced apparel, has also made a push into toys.
Carolyn Pertette from Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, shopped in the early morning at the Waterfront Mall in Pittsburgh. 

""I'm concerned about where I'm going to get toys,"" she said.

475,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2018 02:08PM ET</span>","Wall Street drops, S&P 500 confirms correction","By Lewis Krauskopf
(Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed lower in a shortened post-holiday trading session on Friday as the energy sector tumbled on continued weakness in oil prices, and the benchmark S&P 500 confirmed its second correction of 2018.
The three major U.S. indexes all fell well over 3 percent for the week, with the Dow industrials and the Nasdaq posting their biggest weekly percentage declines since March. 
The S&P 500 ended about 10.2 percent down from its Sept. 20 closing record high, confirming it had entered a correction.
The S&P last entered a correction earlier this year after posting a then record high in late January, and falling more than 10 percent by early February. That correction lasted roughly seven months, until the index posted a fresh record high in late August.
On Friday, the S&P 500 energy sector (SPNY) fell 3.3 percent, dragged down by another plunge in oil prices, amid fears of a supply glut even as major producers consider cutting output. Oil prices have plunged some 30 percent since the start of October.
Shares of oil majors  Chevron  (N:CVX) and  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM) dropped 3.4 percent and 2.7 percent, respectively.
Aside from energy, declines in Apple (O:AAPL) and Amazon (O:AMZN) weighed on the S&P 500, underscoring the drop in technology and internet stocks that has marked this latest swoon in equities.
“I see this as a continuation of the market trying to come to terms with slower growth next year,"" said Alicia Levine, chief market strategist at BNY Mellon Investment Management in New York. ""Today’s price action is part of that story.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 178.74 points, or 0.73 percent, to 24,285.95, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 17.37 points, or 0.66 percent, to 2,632.56 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 33.27 points, or 0.48 percent, to 6,938.98. 
Trading volume was relatively light with the session ending at 1 pm ET following the Thanksgiving Day holiday, so the day's action might carry less significance.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was about 3.4 billion shares, well below the 8.2 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.
""When everyone comes back, we’ll get a clearer indication of what it might look like for the rest of the year,"" said John Carey, managing director and portfolio manager at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management in Boston. ""Today just confirms the recent weakness due to persisting worries about the economy and the effect of higher interest rates on price-to-earnings multiples, borrowing costs and so forth.""
U.S. shoppers formed long lines at store checkout counters on Black Friday to snap up deep discounts on clothing and electronics, offering evidence of stronger consumer spending at the start of retailers' make-or-break holiday season.
The S&P 500 retailing index <.SPXRT> fell 0.6 percent.
United Technologies Corp (N:UTX) rose 2.6 percent after the company won Chinese regulatory approval to buy aircraft parts maker Rockwell Collins Inc (N:COL). Rockwell shares jumped 9.2 percent.
Investors will be focusing on next week's G20 summit in Buenos Aires, where U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are expected to hold talks amid a trade dispute that has weighed on financial markets.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.36-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.17-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 1 new 52-week highs and 19 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 15 new highs and 74 new lows.

493,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2018 12:25PM ET</span>",Buffett-backed Chinese automaker BYD suspends plan for Canada plant,"By Allison Martell
TORONTO (Reuters) - China's BYD Co Ltd (HK:1211) has put plans to open its first Canadian electric truck plant on hold but could revive the project when the electric vehicle maker sees a business case, a company executive said.
BYD, backed by Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa), had planned to open the site this year in Ontario with about 40 workers, a boost to green manufacturing in the country's most populous province.
""It's just not happening right now, and we're not necessarily waiting on anything to make it happen,"" Ted Dowling, Vice President of BYD Canada said on Thursday. ""When the business case makes sense, we'll do it.""
Dowling did not give a specific reason for the decision to suspend the plan, but noted that the company had made more progress winning Canadian orders for buses than trucks. 
He said BYD's decision was not related to Ontario's move on July 3 to scrap the province's incentives for green vehicles and its cap and trade program, which required companies to buy allowances for some greenhouse gas emissions.
Dowling expects Ontario's newly elected government will roll out a new program that could be better than the old scheme.
When the plan was first reported, BYD's trucks had not been approved to operate on Canadian roads. BYD announced that approval on June 26, shortly before right-wing populist Doug Ford took office as Ontario's premier.
The provincial government said in an email it had canceled cap and trade to bring down gas prices and lower costs for families and businesses, and as a result the incentive program ended. Transport ministry spokesman Bob Nichols said Ontario would release a new environment plan later this month.
A new truck plant would have been a small boost to Canada's auto industry, which has lost jobs to the United States, where governments offer manufacturers rich incentives, and Mexico, where labor costs are lower.
BYD's assembly plant in Lancaster, California started with about 100 workers in 2013, and now employs close to 1,000, Dowling said.
The Canadian auto sector was shaken this year when U.S. President Donald Trump threatened tariffs on Canadian vehicles. About 85 percent of cars made in Canada in 2016 were exported. The draft U.S.-Canada-Mexico Agreement leaves significant room for Canadian plants to grow exports duty-free. 
In July, BYD landed an order from the Toronto Transit Commission, the country's largest transit operator, for ten buses with an option for 30 more.
Canadian grocery store operator Loblaw Co Ltd (TO:L) tested BYD's vehicles last year. Loblaw is hoping to place an order next year, it said in a statement.

Buffett bought 10 percent of BYD in 2008 for $230 million, and the company's market capitalization has since topped $20 billion, thanks to China's booming electric car market.

497,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2018 12:12PM ET</span>","U.S. officials, German car firms prep for White House meeting: sources","By Tom Sims
BERLIN (Reuters) - U.S. officials and German carmakers are preparing for a meeting of the chief executives of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), BMW and Daimler with the Trump administration in the coming weeks, sources close to the matter said.
One of the sources said the meeting could take place as soon as next week. A second source suggested it might slip to early to mid December to give the carmakers more time to prepare.
President Donald Trump has been threatening for months to impose tariffs on all European Union-assembled vehicles, a move that could upend the industry's business model for selling cars in the United States.
But he has refrained from such a measure while Washington and Brussels undertake talks to cut other trade barriers.
The White House has extended an invitation to German carmakers through the U.S. Embassy in Berlin for a meeting with Economic Adviser Larry Kudlow and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, said one of the sources. 
It was not immediately clear if the U.S. ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, or President Donald Trump would take part.
U.S. officials have grown impatient with the lack of progress on trade issues after a meeting between Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in July.
No other representatives from European companies or the EU are believed to have been invited to the meeting, one of the sources said. 
The White House was not immediately available to comment. Volkswagen and Daimler declined to comment, while BMW said it had so far not received any official invitation to a meeting.
The CEOs would make clear they could not negotiate on behalf of the EU, people close to the matter said earlier this week.

The United States currently imposes import tariffs on cars assembled in the EU of 2.5 percent, compared with 10 percent tariffs for U.S.-built cars entering the European trading bloc.

The conditional approval for the deal between the two American industrial heavyweights comes during a period of escalating trade tensions between China and the United States.
The dispute between the world's two largest economies had fanned concerns among UTC shareholders that the merger could fall victim to the growing tensions.
UTC said on Friday the transaction should close within three business days. Last month the company had already expressed confidence of securing Chinese approval for the deal.
China requires both UTC and Rockwell to dispose certain assets, and regulators also specified requirements related to the supply of aircraft components in the country, a statement by China's State Administration for Market Regulation showed. The market regulator oversees anti-monopoly issues.
Connecticut-based UTC, which makes Pratt & Whitney jet engines, Otis elevators and various aircraft components, is hoping Rockwell will give it more leverage against aircraft makers, which are negotiating for price cuts. UTC's customers include Boeing (NYSE:BA), Airbus and Bombardier.
Meanwhile, other major American mergers have run into trouble with Chinese regulators in the backdrop of the trade dispute, the latest being Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc's failed attempt to buy  NXP Semiconductors  NV (NASDAQ:NXPI).
Still, China this week gave an unconditional approval for Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's $$71.3 billion deal to buy Twenty-First Century Fox's entertainment assets.
UTC, under pressure from activist investors to split itself up, said last month it was considering options including entertaining interest from third parties to buy any of its businesses.

Shares of Rockwell Collins jumped about 9 percent in morning trading in New York, while UTC's stock climbed about 2 percent.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) will pay $182.5 million to settle U.S. investor litigation claiming they violated antitrust law by conspiring with other banks to rig a key European interest rate benchmark.
A preliminary settlement addressing the banks' alleged manipulation of the European Interbank Offered Rate, or Euribor, was filed on Wednesday night with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, and requires a judge's approval.
Five banks have reached $491.5 million of settlements in the case, including earlier settlements of $170 million by  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn), $94 million by  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc and $45 million by  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA).
Euribor is the euro-denominated equivalent of Libor, a benchmark for setting rates on hundreds of trillions of dollars of credit cards, student loans, mortgages and other debt.
Investors including the California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS) pension fund accused banks of rigging Euribor and fixing prices of Euribor-based derivatives from June 2005 to March 2011 to profit at their expense.
According to the settlement agreement, Citigroup and JPMorgan denied wrongdoing, and settled to avoid the cost and distraction of litigation. Several banks remain defendants.
Citigroup spokeswoman Danielle Romero-Apsilos and JPMorgan spokeswoman Tasha Pelio declined to comment on Friday. Vincent Briganti, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, also declined to comment.
Many lawsuits in the Manhattan court seek to hold banks liable for alleged rigging in interest rate, commodity, currency and other financial markets.
JPMorgan this week reached a separate $7 million settlement of investor claims that it conspired with rivals to rig the Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate, becoming the first bank to settle that litigation. The same law firms represented investors in that case and the Euribor case.

The case is Sullivan et al v. Barclays Plc et al, U.S. District Court, Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, No. 13-02811.

511,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2018 11:20AM ET</span>",Black Friday misery for French shops as Macron and protesters lock horns,"By Richard Lough and Dominique Vidalon
PARIS (Reuters) - French retailers warned after days of unrest over fuel taxes on Friday that prolonged protests could spoil the Christmas shopping season and threaten jobs, while President Emmanuel Macron showed no sign of backing down.
For a week, protesters clad in fluorescent yellow jackets have blocked highways across France with burning barricades and convoys of slow-moving trucks, obstructing access to fuel depots, shopping centers and some factories.
The unrest is a dilemma for Macron who casts himself as a champion in the fight against climate change and wants the French to switch to greener energies. He has been derided as out of touch with common folk and is fighting a slump in popularity. 
Now he faces upsetting businesses with a warning from retailers that the protests are damaging trade and could harm the economy.
Retailers' daily revenue fell 35 percent last Saturday, the first day of the so-called ""yellow vest"" protests, when nearly 300,000 people took part. 
""We have a real problem as some stores have been closed for a week now because of the blockades,"" said Jacques Creyssel, head of the French Retail Federation (FCD). ""One week without revenue is dramatic for a company.""
The FCD represents retailers including  Carrefour  (PA:CARR), Casino and Fnac Darty, for whom Black Friday, a now annual event imported from the United States on the day when retailers traditionally begin turning a profit, marks the start of the Christmas shopping season.
""It's a crucial time for retailers. If retailers cannot work and customers cannot shop, it's bound to have a major impact on employment,"" said Creyssel.
The protests will enter a second week on Saturday with police braced for confrontations with violent fringe elements though the overall number of protesters has fallen sharply.
Tourism is also being affected. The Eiffel Tower in Paris will be closed on Saturday because of the planned protests, its operator said.
And the disruption has spread to carmaker PSA Group, which was forced to temporarily halt two production lines on Wednesday at its Sochaux plant, where it assembles Peugeot and Citroen vehicles, because of problems getting supplies delivered.
""GENTLE TOUCH"" NEEDED
The government has sought to calm the uprising by earmarking 500 million euros to double a 2,000 euro bonus granted to motorists on low incomes who change old-model cars for cleaner ones.
But it was enough. The ""yellow vests"" demand the government reverse fuel tax hikes which, combined with higher global oil prices, have led to a roughly 20 percent rise in the pump price of diesel in the last year. Diesel now retails at about 1.50 euros ($1.70) per liter in the Greater Paris region.
Macron's decision to dig in his heels is showing signs of upsetting the young, centrist En Marche party. There is simmering dissatisfaction, in particular among left-leaning lawmakers, over policies perceived as favoring the rich.
""It we want France to change its course, it requires a gentle touch and flexibility,"" said En Marche legislator Patrick Vignal. ""And my government is showing neither.""
Matthieu Orphelin, an En Marche MP who wants Macron to move faster on clean energy, said: ""To be heard, you first have to listen. We need to get out there, get shouted out and reply to their anger in concrete terms.""
Diesel tax opponents argue that the government lacks a clear vision on switching to more environmentally-friendly energy sources, citing foot-dragging by Macron on reducing France's reliance on nuclear power.
The president and his ecology minister will on Tuesday lay out their blueprint for an ""energy transition"", including a timeline for reducing France's reliance on nuclear, which currently delivers about 75 percent of French power.

""We're working more to a target of 50 percent nuclear by 2035,"" Ecology Minister Francois de Rugy said on Thursday.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Discontent among  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE) customers remains high, although sentiment improved slightly in the last month as the Danish bank moved to address a 200 billion euro ($227 billion) money laundering scandal, figures from Voxmeter show.
Four in ten customers say they are considering leaving the bank within the next year, although the number mulling a move has fallen slightly since the exits of chief executive Thomas Borgen and chairman Ole Andersen, the polling firm's data shows.
These management changes and the effort Danske Bank has placed on talking to its customers and apologizing for the scandal are beginning to have an impact, Voxmeter chief executive Christian Stjer said on Friday.
""A softening of opinions almost always begins from the inside,"" Stjer said, adding that many dissatisfied customers do not in the end shift bank, even though they are considering it, because they find it too troublesome.
The figures from Voxmeter, which interviews almost 40,000 persons a year about banks, show there is still a very strong negative view of Danske Bank from customers at other banks.
Danske Bank said it was not surprised by the poll.
""What happened in the Estonia case is deeply regrettable. Just as much as we are apologizing for the whole course of the case, just as focused are we on learning from what has happened to ensure that nothing like that can happen again,"" a spokesman for the bank said.
""We are fully aware that we have a huge task ahead of us in order to regain the public's trust,"" he added. 
The scandal over suspicious payments between 2007 and 2015 through Danske Bank's tiny Estonian branch has damaged Danes' trust in banks, which have also been hit by a wider European dividend stripping scandal and other money laundering cases.
Negative media coverage of Danske Bank has spiked to a level not seen since recordings began seven years ago, other figures from Voxmeter showed.

Amazon Germany said around 620 workers were participating in the strikes at its Bad Hersfeld and Rheinberg facilities but the majority of employees were continuing to work and there was no impact on customer orders.
Germany's Verdi services union had called for Amazon workers to strike for 24 hours until midnight on Friday, demanding better pay and labor contracts that guarantee healthy working conditions.
""We are entering the end of year spurt, the most stressful time for employees,"" said Verdi representative Mechthild Middeke. ""Especially on a day like Black Friday, employees should be the central focus.""
Amazon Germany said its jobs offered competitive pay and comprehensive benefits from the first day of employment.
Staff in Germany earn a starting salary of 10.78 euros ($12.23) per hour and earn on average a monthly wage of 2,397 euros after two years.
Workers at Amazon's biggest warehouse in Spain, San Fernando de Henares, walked off the job on Friday and will also strike on Saturday. Unions said between 85 and 90 percent of staff were taking part in the industrial action.
Amazon Spain said the figures did not reflect reality and a majority of employees were processing orders.
Black Friday, the day after the Thanksgiving holiday, was so named because spending in the United States would surge and retailers would traditionally begin to turn a profit for the year - moving from the red ink into the black.

525,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2018 10:35AM ET</span>",French banks scale back plans for post-Brexit staff moves,"By Inti Landauro
PARIS (Reuters) - French banks may end up relocating significantly fewer staff than originally expected from London to mainland Europe after Brexit, banking officials said on Friday.
Sector analysts had forecast that France's three biggest banks -  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP),  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) and  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) - might relocate more than 500 staff combined from London to continental Europe, mostly to Paris, because of regulatory changes brought about by Brexit.
But even though the terms of Britain's departure from the European Union remain unclear, the final numbers to be moved are likely to be significantly lower. French banks say they have enough staff on the continent to handle operations and won't need to shift so many of them from London. 
At the same time, the banks say they will keep a strong presence in London since it will remain a major finance center. 
Credit Agricole's investment banking unit has fine-tuned its projection, saying around 20 personnel will move after originally estimating 10 to 100, a bank official said.
The official said the impact on the bank's corporate and investment banking (CIB) activities in London would be ""very limited"" as the bank has a significant CIB presence in the EU through its head office in Montrouge, near Paris. 
The teams in London would continue to care for the bank's clients in the City and elsewhere outside the European Union. 
The bank's investment banking operation in London has 735 employees. 
BNP Paribas, France's largest listed bank, has estimated that fewer than 90 of its UK-based bank staff will be affected. A number of them, mostly dealing with sales, will have to relocate to mainland Europe, a BNP Paribas official said.
Sources close to the bank, which employs more than 7,000 people in London, said last year that it might have to transfer as many as 300 jobs.
The third largest bank, Societe Generale, has said Brexit might lead to the relocation or hiring of up to 300 people outside London, most of them in Paris.
A union representative said that while the bank had not detailed its plans, it does not seem inclined to move whole teams or departments. ""If they were to relocate entire teams they would have started talking to the unions,"" he said.
Earlier this year Paris Europlace, a financial lobbying group, estimated 3,000 financial services jobs would relocate to Paris from London due to Brexit. 
In recent months several non-European banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and Bank of America (N:BAC), have said they will set up or expand offices in Paris or elsewhere in Europe to go on servicing EU clients. 
Private equity funds and asset management firms are also relocating staff outside Britain.
Not all jobs will be shifted to Paris - several financial companies have chosen Dublin, Frankfurt or Luxembourg as their future operating base in Europe.
""There won't be a single city for the whole continent but rather an integrated, polycentric network of financial hubs each focused on specific expertise,"" François Villeroy de Galhau, the governor of the French central bank, said on Friday.

All three major French banks have said they may send some of their relocated staff to French cities other than Paris.

The firm said in October last year it would cut roughly 400 out of the then 1,900 people at the location, and then announced a further 250 jobs losses in January as Peugeot restructured the loss-making sites it bought from General Motors (NYSE:GM) in 2017.
Vauxhall builds the Astra Sports Tourer family estate model at Ellesmere Port and the brand has seen its sales fall 11 percent so far this year, faster than the overall decline of 7 percent in Europe's second-biggest autos market. 
""The restructuring is necessary to make it a competitive plant when compared to the benchmark,"" Vauxhall said in a statement.
The firm said the announcement was not related to Britain's imminent departure from the European Union. 
PSA boss Carlos Tavares said earlier this year that the French carmaker will decide in 2020 on whether to make fresh investment to keep the plant in northwest England open.
Britain's biggest trade union Unite said it was seeking urgent assurances over the future of the site. 

""Unite will not tolerate the death by a thousand cuts of Ellesmere Port and will leave no stone unturned in securing the future of the plant and its skilled workforce,"" said Unite regional coordinating officer Mick Chalmers.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Volvo Cars has decided to delay building Lynk & Co branded cars at its plant at Ghent in Belgium because of increased macro-economic uncertainty, a spokesman for the Geely-owned [GEELY.UL] Swedish carmaker said on Friday.
Lynk & Co, co-owned by Volvo's owner and its two brands Volvo and Geely Auto, began selling its first model in China last year. The vehicle is currently produced at a Volvo-operated plant in Taizho in China.
The original plan, set out in March, was to begin production in Belgium at the end of 2019. But the Swedish company has had to replan what cars to produce in which part of the world due to a trade dispute between China and the United States that has led to additional tariffs.
""The decision to revise the manufacturing plans for Lynk & Co was taken due to an increased macro-economic uncertainty, and Volvo has reviewed how we best can utilize the group's global production infrastructure,"" the spokesman said.
The changes would not impact employment in Ghent and Lynk & Co's cars would instead be exported to Europe from China next year, he said in response to emailed questions.
Volvo also has plans to begin selling Lynk & Co vehicles in the U.S. in 2020.
As global uncertainty has mounted, the company has also been forced to shelve plans to float its shares and like other carmakers, Volvo is now facing added pressure from a demand slowdown in its main market, China.
The company has found itself in need of more free capacity at Ghent, after being forced to move production of its V60 station wagon out to Belgium and China to free up space at its Swedish plant.
This is because by the end of this year it plans to move most of the production of its best-selling SUV, the XC60, for export to the U.S. market to its plant to Torslanda, Sweden from Chengdu, China.

The spokesman said on Friday that Volvo had also decided to produce its S60 luxury sport sedan in China from next year, altering an original plan to manufacture the vehicle only at its U.S. factory and export it to China.

532,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 23, 2018 08:20AM ET</span>",Oil Options Traders Turn More Bearish Than During 2014 Crash,"(Bloomberg) -- Oil options traders have turned more bearish than when prices plunged back in 2014.
The premiums they’re paying for bearish put options over bullish calls over the next 12 months has reached the largest in data compiled by Bloomberg since 2013. The skew, as it’s known, indicates demand for protection against a slump. The negative bias is far greater than during four years ago, when Saudi Arabia adopted a pump-at-will production policy, helping prices crash to $47 from $115 in a matter of months.
The crude market has been roiled by surging U.S. output and Donald Trump’s unexpected decision to allow buyers of Iranian oil to continue purchases, thereby adding unexpected supply. At the same time the Saudis, under pressure from the American president to help keep prices down, has signaled that it may be producing at a record pace.
Thrown into the mix has been frenetic selling from banks who’ve been forced to sell futures contracts after options contracts that they sold to producers came close to being valuable. The resulting moves have seen crude swing rapidly from talk of $100 a barrel just a few weeks ago, deep into a bear market. Brent traded at about $61 on Friday.
“It shows you the extreme change in perceptions that we’ve just had, the disappointment in expectations,” Thibaut Remoundos, founder of hedging strategies adviser Commodities Trading Corp. in London said of the shift in options markets. “The options volatility market in Brent is broken right now.”
While the premium paid for puts over calls is the biggest in at least five years, it’s not the only corner of the oil options market that has been buffeted by tumbling prices. The CBOE/Nymex Oil Volatility Index, a measure of near-the-money crude options, hit nearly 56 points earlier this week, the highest level in 2 years and almost double where it reached in early November.
The move brings into focus the decisions of some producers to lock in their output when prices were at multi-year highs in recent months.
Remoundos said some producers could have locked in their output for 2019 at $72.50 without any outlay on options contracts, a strategy known as a costless collar. A 128 million barrel hedge by Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as well as Mexico’s national oil hedge -- the biggest oil deal of the year -- are among those said to have roiled Wall Street banks in recent weeks.

LONDON (Reuters) - European stock markets rose on Friday after a volatile week in which company earnings and growth worries hit stocks, although the euro sank after weaker-than-expected business surveys from Germany and the euro zone.
Italian stocks (FTMIB) led the bounce in equities, rallying hard after the country's bond yields fell after a press report that EU Affairs Minister Paolo Savona is considering resigning over the government's decision to challenge European Union budget rules. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index was up 0.1 percent. Europe's performance on Friday stood in contrast to Asia, where steep losses in Chinese markets hit stocks amid lingering trade war tensions and worries about global growth. (EU)
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) fell 0.2 percent as Chinese blue-chips (CSI300) tumbled 2 percent and the Shanghai Composite index (SSEC) lost 2.2 percent.
Not all was cheerful in Europe though - surveys of German and euro zone purchasing managers came in weaker than expected, pushing the euro to its lowest in three days and setting up the single currency for its worst week in a month.
The disappointing readings will likely be of concern to policymakers at the European Central Bank, who are expected to draw a line under their 2.6 trillion euro asset purchase programme at the end of the year.
""The key message from the PMI data is that it has raised doubts about whether the economy will rebound after Q3 weakness, so there's no wonder the news has been taken badly by the market,"" said Jack Allen, senior European economist at Capital Economics in London. 
""The big picture is that the data is not bad enough for the ECB to not end asset purchases at the end of the year. But if growth fails to rebound, they (ECB policymakers) will have to think twice about raising rates next year.""
Purchasing manager indexes from the United States, due at 1425 GMT, will be watched for a reading on where global growth is headed.
The MSCI All-Country World Index (MIWD00000PUS) of stocks was down 0.1 percent on the day, and set for a second week in the red.
U.S. equity futures were pointing to weakness on Wall Street when trading resumes Friday. S&P E-mini futures (ESc1) were down half a percent.
DARKENING OUTLOOK
On Thursday, stock markets in Europe were hit by disappointing earnings, underscoring the lingering anxiety among equity investors as trade tensions, slowing global investment and growth.
A draft deal between Britain and the European Union on future relations reached on Thursday did little to lighten the mood.
Daiwa analyst Chris Scicluna said: ""Asian equity indices have largely picked up the baton of negativity from European markets yesterday."" 
He noted investor apprehension was high before next week's Buenos Aires bilateral meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, and added: ""Following VP Pence's tough rhetoric at the APEC summit, making it clear that the Trump administration is in no hurry to end the trade war and calling on China to change its ways, that's perhaps no surprise."" 
In the currency market, the pound  was down 0.3 percent, buying $1.2830 after rising more than 1 percent on the news of the draft agreement between Britain and the EU, which describes a close post-Brexit relationship. The agreement follows a draft treaty last week that set the terms for Britain's departure from the EU in March.
The dollar weakened 0.1 percent against the yen to 112.84 . Against a basket of currencies, the greenback was higher 0.13 percent. (DXY)
China's yuan  fell to 6.9498 per dollar, with trade concerns weighing. The currency has also come under pressure in recent weeks in sympathy with falling Chinese rates, with yields on shorter-term Chinese government bonds below their U.S. counterparts.
In commodities markets, oil prices fell to their lowest in a year, on course for their biggest one-month decline since late 2014, even as oil producers consider cutting production to try to stem a rising global surplus. [O/R]
U.S. crude (CLc1) was trading down 4.4 percent at $52.23 while Brent crude (LCOc1) futures were last down 2.5 percent at $61.05 a barrel. 
Spot gold  was down 0.4 percent at $1,222.33 per ounce.

534,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2018 07:40AM ET</span>",Nationwide strike called at Metro's German hypermarket chain Real,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German services union Verdi has called a nationwide strike at Metro AG's (DE:B4B) Real hypermarket chain for next Monday to press a demand for its 34,000 staff to be covered by a collective pay deal.
Verdi said in a statement that Metro had in June bailed out of the pay agreement so that it could hire new staff more cheaply, and had also let go 4,500 staff on fixed-term contracts to cut costs.
Metro CEO Olaf Koch said the strike would not deter him in his determination to sell Real, which was put on the block in September as he focuses on Metro's wholesale operations.
""We are striving to sell Real as a whole,"" Koch said in a statement. Private equity firms are seen as the most likely bidders for the hypermarkets business that has struggled to compete in the cut-throat German market. 
Real CEO Henning Gieseke criticized the strike and a planned protest at Metro's headquarters in Duesseldorf, saying in a statement that it would harm the business and its staff just as the year-end shopping season was getting underway.

Management described as ""unrealistic"" the call to return to a collective pay deal with Verdi and said its stores would remain open despite the strike.

Flybe said earlier this month it was in talks with potential buyers, but added it was also looking at other options, such as further reductions in capacity and costs.
Airlines have been looking to consolidate in many markets because of rising running costs, largely higher fuel prices, and increased competition from budget carriers. Icelandair (IC:ICEAIR) agreed to buy rival WOW this month. 
Shares of Flybe rose as much as 53.2 percent to 14.8 pence on Friday after Sky News reported late on Thursday that Virgin Atlantic, founded by billionaire Richard Branson, was in talks about a takeover bid for Flybe.
Virgin Atlantic said it was reviewing options for Flybe, including a possible offer for the London-listed company. 
The options also include an enhanced commercial arrangement, Virgin said, adding that it already has a trading and codeshare relationship with Flybe. 
Virgin Atlantic closed its British domestic airline network Little Red in 2015 after it was ""not able to make a positive contribution"" to the group and following a review of its network that had put emphasis on its transatlantic routes.
A deal would give the airline, part owned by U.S. carrier Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL), access to Flybe's 192 routes serving 14 countries from 75 departure points in the UK and Europe. 
A spokesman for Flybe declined to comment on other potential buyers. Sky News had previously reported that Stobart Group (L:STOB) was likely one of the potential suitors for Flybe. 
The British infrastructure and support services company had scrapped plans to buy Flybe in March after being rebuffed.
Flybe, which flies 76 aircraft, has a market capitalization of about 20.8 million pounds ($26.68 million), according to IBES data from Refinitiv, after its shares fell over 50 percent this year.
The company's stock plunged after a profit warning last month, underscoring challenges that are also affecting bigger European rivals including Ryanair (I:RYA) Wizz Air (L:WIZZ) and easyJet Plc (L:EZJ).
Virgin Atlantic is being advised by Rothschild & Co, while Evercore is acting as financial adviser to Flybe and Numis and Liberum as broker to Flybe.

536,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2018 07:35AM ET</span>",British banks await stress-test trigger for shareholder payouts,"By Huw Jones and Lawrence White
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's bank bosses are hoping for the green light to return more capital to long-suffering investors when the Bank of England publishes results next week from its annual stress test of leading lenders.
A decade after the financial crisis that triggered taxpayer-funded bank bailouts, the central bank has said repeatedly that they now hold enough capital to withstand extreme theoretical shocks such as Britain crashing out of the European Union next March without a deal.
The Bank of England has acknowledged that there was no need, therefore, to make the tests any tougher than last year, raising hopes of positive outcomes when the numbers are delivered at 0700 GMT on Nov. 28.
 Barclays  (L:BARC), Lloyds (L:LLOY) and Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) (L:RBS) have all signaled that they plan to ramp up dividend payments and share buybacks as a means of returning excess capital to investors hit by plunging share prices, caused by fears over Britain's exit from the European Union and weaker than hoped for revenue growth.
Lloyds could return as much as 12 billion pounds ($15.4 billion) through dividends and buybacks over the next three years, analysts said, while RBS could pay out as much as 7 billion pounds over the same period.
RBS Chief Executive Ross McEwan has indicated that the bank is considering special dividends and buybacks to return more capital to shareholders but says a clean bill of health from the central bank is a prerequisite. 
""We are considering all options; we've got to get through a stress test beginning of December,"" McEwan said last month.
Shares in  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) rose briefly on Thursday morning after media reports said that it, too, is contemplating buybacks.
SPOTLIGHT ON BARCLAYS, LLOYDS
HSBC (L:HSBA), Nationwide Building Society and Santander UK (MC:SAN) are the other lenders being scrutinized on their ability to withstand deep simultaneous recessions in Britain and global economies, as well as a slump in asset prices. 
The lenders also face a separate assessment of the impact from potential misconduct fines.
Of those under the microscope, Barclays and Lloyds are under particular scrutiny after faring worst in this year's EU health check of 48 lenders from across the bloc. Barclays struggled to make it through the Bank of England's test last year.
Rob Smith, a partner at consultants KPMG, said that all seven will clear the hurdles set by the Bank of England, though some will feel the impact of a new accounting rule that forces lenders to make earlier provisions for souring loans. 
Even if, as expected, Britain's biggest banks perform favorably in the tests, lingering anxiety over the economic impact of Brexit could dampen expectations of generous capital returns in the near term.
""I don't see the stress tests as necessarily giving the green or even amber light for dividends,"" said Julian van Kan, head of financial institutions coverage at MUFG (T:8306) in London. 
""While we still have the outcome of Brexit looming no bank will be too ambitious in returning capital to shareholders.""
Analysts will also look at whether the central bank signals any intention to mirror moves in the United States to ease back on stress tests.

Volkswagen (VW) said it believed the court in Augsburg had misapplied the law and that it would appeal the ruling at the higher regional court.
The Augsburg civil court ruled on Nov. 14th that VW had acted immorally by deliberately installing emissions-cheating software to increase sales and profits, a spokesman for the court said on Friday.
The court ordered VW to repay the owner the original price of almost 30,000 euros ($34,200), according to a copy of the ruling.
""In our opinion, there is no legal basis for customer complaints. Customers have suffered neither losses nor damages. The vehicles are safe and roadworthy,"" VW said in a statement.
It added that around 9,000 judgements had been issued in connection with its diesel emissions scandal, which came to light in 2015, and the majority of customer complaints had been unsuccessful at district and higher courts.
""The decision of the district court in Augsburg thereby stands in contradiction to multiple decisions of other courts in comparable cases,"" VW said.
Its shares were little changed at 151.88 euros at 0844 GMT.
VW has said about 11 million diesel cars worldwide were fitted with software that could cheat emissions tests designed to limit noxious car fumes.
The German carmaker has agreed to pay billions of dollars in the United States to settle claims from owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers. It offered to buy back 500,000 polluting U.S. vehicles.

The company has not reached a similar deal in Europe, where it faces billions of euros in claims from investors and customers in the worst business crisis in its history.

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's private jet market faces a protracted lull as the economy continues to slow down, salesmen and aviation lawyers said at forum in Beijing this week, predicting the country's uber-rich will sell off jets in droves next year.
""Whether it is as a manufacturer, a leasing company or an operator, we all feel a chill,"" Xu Lidong, chairman of HNA Group Co Ltd's private jet division Deer Jet, said at the Beijing event, citing the broader economic malaise.
China's economy expanded in the last quarter at the weakest pace since the global financial crisis, with economists forecasting more headwind to come amid a years-long campaign to tackle debt risk and spiraling trade war with the United States.
Dealers and brokers at the 2018 China Business Aviation Development Forum echoed the sentiment.
""For the past 10 years, it's been all about Chinese business owners buying; but this year, we have so far handled 3-5 cases where jet owners wanted to sell to overseas markets,"" Wang Shu, a partner at Han Kun Law Offices.
Deer Jet's Xu said there are currently over 30 aircraft up for sale from Greater China, with used private plans from China being snapped up by U.S. buyers.
""The U.S. market is having its best run in a few years,"" said Wang Fuhou, president of the aircraft leasing division at Minsheng Financial Leasing. He said that contrasted sharply with the situation in China.
""I wouldn't say (this year) is the worst, though. The next year or the year after will be the worst.""
Some speakers at the event forecast a pickup - but not until around 2020.
For Lily Jet, a charter company operating in China for the past decade, the golden days when the charter market recorded annual growth of 30 percent are well gone.
""Profit is drastically down this year,"" said Ding Lili, general manager for business, adding the firm had cut prices by about a quarter for one of its most luxurious jets.

""Against such a backdrop, I understand why jet operators are reducing their fleets significantly.""

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares rose modestly at the end of a volatile week, led by rebounding banks and technology stocks, while Italian equities rallied as bond yields fell. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) was up 0.4 percent by 0940 GMT, while Italy's FTSE MIB (FTMIB) outperformed with a 0.8 percent rise.
The European index was still set for its second straight week of losses as investors' concerns about slowing global growth, weak earnings, and a U.S.-China trade war drove them away from the region's equities. 
""The market seems to still be concerned about the growth outlook and this comes along with a lot of discussions that we have on politics,"" said Britta Weidenbach, Europe portfolio manager at German asset manager DWS. 
""The U.S.-China trade conflict, Brexit negotiations, Italy to some extent, all of this is causing worries that companies will further delay their investment decisions.""
Growth-sensitive oil and mining sectors were the worst-performing on Friday.
Italian banks climbed after a media report that Italy's EU Affairs Minister Paolo Savona is considering resigning over the government's decision to challenge European Union budget rules. Savona denied the report.
Italy's banks' index (FTIT8300) climbed 1.9 percent as bond yields slid, boosting lenders who have large sovereign bond portfolios.
Banco BPM's (MI:BAMI) shares rose 3.4 percent, while  Mediobanca  (MI:MDBI), Unicredit (MI:CRDI), UBI Banca (MI:UBI), and  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) gained 1.6 to 2.6 percent. 
 Renault  (PA:RENA) shares rose 2.8 percent after Deputy CEO Thierry Bollore said he would safeguard the carmaker's interests in its alliance with Nissan (T:7201), following the ouster of Carlos Ghosn as Nissan chairman over financial misconduct allegations.
Jefferies analysts upgraded Renault shares to ""buy"", writing: ""The most likely outcome from the current crisis, in our opinion, is a re-balancing of the Alliance with cooperation continuing and Renault reducing its stake to a ""fairer"" level.""
The carmaker's shares dropped 8.4 percent on Monday when CEO Carlos Ghosn was arrested over allegations of financial misconduct.
Telecoms equipment makers Ericsson (ST:ERICb) and Nokia (HE:NOKIA) climbed 2.5 and 1.5 percent respectively as traders saw a positive read-across from a Wall Street Journal report that the U.S. government is asking allies to shun telecoms equipment from China's Huawei .
Earnings disappointments drove the biggest losses on the STOXX. 
Shares in stone wool insulation maker Rockwool (CO:ROCKb) dropped 9.9 percent after its third-quarter results.
German industrial machinery group GEA (DE:G1AG) fell 13.4 percent after it cut its outlook for 2018 cashflow margin.
Industrials firms have delivered weaker results as the slowdown in European growth, and trade war fears, hit those most vulnerable to the cycle first.
Data on Friday showed Germany's economy saw its first quarterly contraction since 2015 in Q3, driven by weaker exports. 
Overall expectations for 2018 earnings growth in European stocks have fallen recently as investors price in a weaker economy.
""Markets do look really attractively priced by now, but the question is about the earnings,"" said Weidenbach. 

""For next year consensus (earnings growth) is still at around high single digits, but certainly there are some clouds in the sky that might make the consensus a little bit too optimistic because of the economic environment,"" she added.

The Nissan board's vote to remove Ghosn as chairman on Thursday drew a firm line under his stewardship of the nearly two-decade-old alliance. 
""I will make sure we guarantee our stability and stay focused on our missions to preserve the interests of  Renault  and the sustainability of the alliance,"" Thierry Bollore, named as Ghosn's stand-in at Renault after the industrial star's arrest in Japan, said in a video to shareholders. 
The shareholding structure among Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi, which was brought into the alliance in 2016, has become a source of tension alongside the removal of Ghosn, with Nissan unhappy with what it sees as a junior partner status.
Renault owns 43.4 percent of Nissan, while Nissan has only a 15-percent non-voting share in Renault. Yet Nissan is 60 percent bigger than the French automaker by sales. 
The relationship is further complicated by the role of the French state, which holds 15 percent of Renault and enjoys double-voting rights. 
Ghosn and former Nissan Representative Director Greg Kelly are being investigated over alleged conspiracy to understate Ghosn's compensation over five years from fiscal 2010 by about half of the actual 9.998 billion yen ($88.9 million).
On Friday, the Asahi newspaper reported that Japanese prosecutors are likely to build a new criminal case against Ghosn for understating his remuneration by 3 billion yen ($27.0 million) over three years from fiscal 2015.
In the wake of Ghosn's spectacular downfall, French and Japanese government ministers have reaffirmed support for the Renault-Nissan alliance, which was enlarged to include Mitsubishi in 2016. 

""Our group is perfectly organized to ensure the continuity of the company's business,"" Bollore said.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Dolce & Gabbana's co-founders asked for China's ""forgiveness"" on Friday, trying to salvage a crucial market for the luxury brand after a backlash against its latest advertising campaign.
The Italian fashion house canceled a marquee show in Shanghai on Wednesday after celebrities and social media users threatened a boycott over the campaign, which led e-commerce firms to pull Dolce & Gabbana items on Thursday.
The furor is a setback for one of Italy's best-known fashion brands in China, where rivals from Louis Vuitton of LVMH (PA:LVMH) to Kering's (PA:PRTP) Gucci are vying to expand. 
Chinese buyers account for more than a third of spending on luxury goods worldwide, and are increasingly shopping at home rather than on overseas trips. 
Users slammed the video campaign in which a Chinese woman struggles to eat pizza and pasta with chopsticks while the narrator offers eating lessons in a patronizing tone.
The blunder was compounded when screenshots were circulated online of a private Instagram conversation, in which designer Stefano Gabbana makes a reference to ""China Ignorant Dirty Smelling Mafia"" and uses the smiling poo emoji to describe the country. The company said Gabbana's account had been hacked.
In a video apology on Friday, Gabbana and co-founder Domenico Dolce said they had ""reflected seriously"" and were saddened by the impact of their words.
""In the face of our cultural misunderstanding, we hope that we can earn your forgiveness,"" Dolce, speaking in Italian, said in the video of the two designers seated side-by-side. 
The 85-second video with Chinese subtitles was posted on China's Twitter-like platform, Weibo. 
Gabbana also asked for forgiveness and offered a formal apology to Chinese people around the world. The designers ended the video by saying sorry in Mandarin.
""We will never forget this experience and lesson, and this sort of thing will never happen again,"" Gabbana said.
It's not the first gaffe by Dolce & Gabbana in China, where the brand came under fire on social media last year for a series of advertisements showing the grungy side of Chinese life. 
Other upsets have come and gone in China without appearing to cause lasting damage, including at brands like Kering's Balenciaga, which apologized in April amid a backlash over how some Chinese customers had been treated in Paris.
However, the crisis for Dolce & Gabbana showed no sign of easing on Friday. Retailer Lane Crawford said it would pull the brand from its stores and online sites in mainland China and Hong Kong after customers had returned Dolce & Gabbana items.
Most of the comments posted under the apology video on Weibo were also critical.

""We don't have to accept your apology. Go and make money in other countries, there's none for you here in China,"" one user wrote.

On Saturday November 17, more than 280,000 demonstrators took part in the protests all over the country. Some of them kept on protesting and blocking roads since then. The protesters, known as the ""yellow vests"", are planning to hold a large demonstration in Paris this coming Saturday.
Jacques Creyssel, the head of the French Retail Federation (FCD), told RTL radio station that French retailers' daily revenue fell 35 percent because of the Saturday protests. Store footfall fell 47 percent that day as protesters blocked motorways, sparking major logjams.
""We have a true problem as some stores have been closed for a week now because of the blockades. One week without revenue is dramatic for a company. We are asking for free access for our staff and customers to the stores and the warehouses,"" he said.
""We are at the beginning of the Christmas season, today it's Black Friday, a crucial time for retailers. If retailers cannot work and customers cannot shop, it's bound to have a major impact on employment,"" he warned.
Back Friday, the day after the Thanksgiving holiday, was so named because spending in the United States would surge and retailers would traditionally begin to turn a profit for the year - moving from the red ink into the black. 

The Black Friday discount sales day starts on November 23 and will be followed three days later by Cyber Monday.

The nomination will be done by the Japanese automaker's newly created advisory committee that includes the company's three independent directors.
The new chairman would hold the post ""at least"" until Nissan's next shareholder meeting. No decision on whether to hold an extraordinary shareholder meeting has been made, the source added. The next regular meeting is expected in June 2019.
Another special committee led by the independent directors to discuss improving governance based on third-party advice will then likely propose setting up a nomination committee to select a permanent chairman, said the source, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.
""It's a two stage process,"" the source said. ""First we have to decide on a temporary chairman as soon as possible.""
Nissan was not immediately available for comment on Friday, a public holiday in Japan.

Nissan's board voted unanimously to oust Ghosn, who was arrested on Monday over allegations of financial misconduct including under-reporting of his remuneration and personal use of company assets.

550,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2018 01:11AM ET</span>",U.S. benefits manager baulks after Novartis values gene therapy at $4-5 million,"By John Miller
ZURICH (Reuters) - Just weeks after Novartis floated the idea that $4-5 million was fair value for its new gene therapy against a deadly neuromuscular disease, a major benefits manager is pushing back.
The Swiss drugmaker's assessment of AVXS-101's value for treating spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) has put the company front-and-center in the debate over what ""super drugs"", for rare diseases afflicting relatively few patients, are really worth.
Among the first to react was pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX), which helps U.S. employers manage workers' prescription costs.
Its chief medical officer, Steve Miller, told Reuters he ""loves the science"" behind Novartis's therapy, a potential cure for newborns who are diagnosed early.
But $4 million or more per patient?
""You just can't keep pushing these price points up,"" Miller said. ""I just don't think we can allow it. It is not sustainable over time.""
Novartis, which bought U.S.-based AveXis for $8.7 billion in April to add the SMA therapy to its portfolio, is still mulling its asking price as it awaits U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, likely in early 2019.
But the company has begun its campaign to convince insurance groups and governments to cover AVXS-101, contending the one-and-done infusion will save society money over the long haul, even with a cost near the highest ever for a one-time therapy.
There's now only one approved drug for SMA, Biogen's two-year-old Spinraza, and it is listed at $750,000 for the first year and $350,000 thereafter. Spinraza is not a cure and must be taken indefinitely.
""When we look at 10-year costs, you see somewhere between $2.5 million to $5 million being spent by societies to care for these types of patients,"" Dave Lennon, AveXis's president, said.
""Four million dollars is a significant amount of money, but we believe this is a cost-effective point.""
Though newborns may stand to benefit the most from AVXS-101, depending on the durability of its effect, the therapy is also being tested in older SMA patients with more advanced disease in hopes it will improve their symptoms, too.
A CHILD'S LIFE
A diagnosis of SMA, which affects one in 10,000 live births, is devastating. Forty percent of victims have the severest form and historically die within months.
Children with less severe SMA can live to adulthood, although with profound physical disabilities. Though cognitively normal, many cannot feed themselves and require 24-hour care, wheelchairs and machines to help them breathe and cough.
Janice Kress, a Pennsylvania woman, lost her grandson to the disease at 5 months.
Today she volunteers for SMA charity events and knows families who have fought their U.S. insurers for access to Biogen's Spinraza, as payers seek to rein in costs using eligibility criteria like age or when symptoms began.
""A child's life -- how can you say no?"" Kress said.
PRICE WATCHDOG
As Novartis prepares to launch AVXS-101, it also hopes for tacit endorsement of its pricing strategy from the non-profit Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), which is currently reviewing the cost-effectiveness of SMA therapies. 
The Boston-based non-profit, established in 2006, carries out cost-benefit analyses on drugs that it calls independent of ""Big Pharma"", insurers and government.
Unlike European price regulators, ICER cannot dictate costs.
But it has steadily gained influence in the U.S. pricing debate, as companies like Express Scripts and CVS Caremark and governments rely on its analyses.
ICER has reviewed 11 treatments in 2018. 
Seven times, it concluded drugs' prices aligned with their benefits, like when it said Roche's $482,000 hemophilia medicine Hemlibra could save the U.S. system up to $1.9 million for the hardest-to-treat patients.
Four times, however, ICER concluded drugmakers were asking too much, giving payers ammunition to bargain them down. 
For instance, the New York Department of Health told Reuters that ICER's finding that a $270,000-per-year cystic fibrosis drug from Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) represented ""low long-term value"" helped underpin the state's demand for a steep discount.
JUST ONE FINGER
Novartis and Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB), as well as Switzerland's Roche, which also has an SMA drug in development, are all lobbying ICER to broaden what it considers a meaningful benefit, potentially helping their therapies fare well in the group's review.
The ability to move one finger might not seem like much, but Biogen told ICER such a measure should be considered, since it might allow somebody with SMA to steer an electric wheelchair and maintain a level of independence.
""We recently spoke with a young man who is...now losing ability and power in his fingers,"" said Sangeeta Jethwa, Roche's head of patient partnerships, told Reuters.
""He wants to be able to go out with his friends and open his own bottle of drink. That for him is fantastically meaningful.""
For its SMA review, ICER aims to quantify factors like quality of life, direct medical costs and how patient and caregiver productivity losses may burden society.
A head-to-head comparison of Spinraza's and AVXS-101's financial impacts over time is also planned before ICER issues its final report in March.
ICER spokesman David Whitrap said ICER's review takes eight months so it can ""rigorously evaluate all of the available evidence."" 
The stakes are high for Biogen, after Britain's healthcare cost agency, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, has concluded Spinraza was too expensive to be cost-effective.
Though Spinraza, whose nine-month 2018 sales hit $1.25 billion, is available in the United States and elsewhere in Europe, Biogen wants to avoid a negative ICER assessment that gives payers more leverage to demand rebates.
""We are confident in the evidence supporting the value it provides,"" a Biogen spokeswoman said.
SIGNS OF PROGRESS
Treatments for rare diseases like SMA are increasingly popular among drugmakers, because they command high prices while insurers are hard pressed to reject claims, especially for sick children.
Sales of rare disease therapies will rise 11 percent annually, nearly twice the overall market rate, through 2024, when they'll hit $262 billion, consultancy Evaluate Pharma has forecast.
Novartis Chief Executive Vas Narasimhan, with ambitions of treating hundreds of SMA patients annually, highlights 90 kids in AVXS-101 trials over four years, including some who would otherwise have been incapacitated and fed through tubes.
""With AVXS-101... patients are alive and thriving,"" Narasimhan said.
There were no SMA therapies, however, when Victoria Gusset, an eight-year-old Swiss girl with a shy smile and love for horses, was diagnosed as a toddler after failing to stand independently.
Today, Victoria is in a trial testing how Spinraza may improve muscle control or halt its decline in older children.
Every four months, Victoria and her mother, Nicole Gusset, load her electric wheelchair into their van and drive two hours from their home near Bern to a German hospital for a spinal infusion.
Victoria looks forward to each trip, though she sometimes suffers from nausea and headaches following treatment.
""I get to go shopping with mum,"" she said.
After her daughter's diagnosis, Nicole Gusset founded an SMA patient organization and has been lobbying the Swiss government to expand access to Spinraza. Children under 20 have coverage, but most insurers refuse to pay for adults.
Gusset said Novartis's $4 million announcement sent shockwaves through Switzerland's SMA community, heightening fears that escalating costs will keep new treatments out of reach for some who might benefit.
""The best therapies are useless if patients cannot get them,"" she said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) on Friday vowed to compensate by 2028 its local chip and display factory workers who have suffered from work-related illnesses.
The move settles a year-long dispute between the world's top memory chipmaker and an advocacy group representing sickened workers and their families after the 2007 death of a Samsung chip factory worker with leukemia sparked concerns over working conditions at the South Korean company.
""Our effort was insufficient to better understand the pain affected workers and their families went through,"" Samsung Electronics Chief Executive Kim Ki-nam said in a public apology during an event to sign the agreement with the advocacy group.
Following the mediation panel's decision earlier this month on the case, Samsung will pay up to 150 million won ($132,649.45) for each former and current employee suffering from work-related diseases if they are found to be caused by exposure to harmful chemicals. 
All former and current Samsung employees as well as the company's contractors who worked at Samsung's semiconductor and display production plants for more than one year since 1984 are eligible to be compensated for their illnesses.
Kim said the company would post its compensation guidelines along with an apology letter by at the end of this month on the company's website and an independent Seoul-based law firm will conduct the review process for affected workers for their compensation eligibility. 
South Korean activist group Sharps claims around 200 workers have fallen ill after working at Samsung plants and 70 of them have died subsequently. 
Hwang Sang-ki, founder of Sharps and father of a dead chip factory worker with leukemia, told Reuters that besides those 200 he expected more workers to apply for compensation, but it would take a long medical process to prove their diseases are directly related to the work environment.

Both Samsung and Sharps did not elaborate on the potential size of the total compensation.

Ghosn and former Nissan Representative Director Greg Kelly are currently being investigated in a case of alleged conspiracy to understate Ghosn's remuneration by about half the 10 billion yen he earned at Nissan over five years from fiscal 2010.
Combined, Ghosn has understated his remuneration at Nissan by around 8 billion yen in the eight years through the fiscal year that ended in March, the paper said, without citing sources.
It did not mention whether a new case would also target Kelly.
Ghosn and Kelly were arrested and dismissed from their positions this week over allegations of financial misconduct.
A new case would make Ghosn liable for rearrest, Asahi said.
With the duo still in custody, neither man has been able to defend himself publicly against the allegations. 
Reuters was not able to contact them. Motonari Otsuru, a former public prosecutor who local media said has been hired as Ghosn's lawyer, was not immediately available to comment.

555,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 22, 2018 10:50PM ET</span>",Jaguar Land Rover's New Evoque SUV Rides to Rescue of U.K. Plant Amid Brexit Pinch,"(Bloomberg) -- Jaguar Land Rover is planning a new version of its Evoque SUV to be built in northern England, safeguarding production at a site where output has been squeezed by sliding sales in the run up to Brexit.
The new Evoque, which will be priced from 31,600 pounds ($41,000) in the U.K. and commence deliveries in the first months of 2019, will also be the Land Rover division’s first “mild-hybrid” model, using so-called regenerative braking to provide a power boost to the standard internal combustion engine.
The launch provides a lift for Jaguar Land Rover following disappointing sales in China and a slump in U.K. demand that it has blamed on Brexit jitters and government moves to outlaw diesel engines. JLR announced 1,000 job cuts earlier this year, mainly at Solihull, central England, and said it would scale back output at Halewood, near Liverpool, where the new Evoque will be built.
The Evoque refresh is also crucial to JLR, a unit of India’s Tata Motors Ltd., because the original model, introduced in 2010, helped define a new category of luxury SUV aimed at the younger urban driver. That car is also credited with enhancing the appeal of Land Rover and its Range Rover brand among women.
Plant Upgrade
“Our commitment to U.K. production remains firm,” JLR Chief Executive Officer Ralf Speth said in a statement, adding that the company has invested 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) to support the Evoque’s development, including 110 million pounds spent on updating Halewood’s manufacturing capabilities.
The new Evoque will debut JLR’s Ground View technology, which uses cameras in the front grill combined with a head-up display system to create the illusion of a transparent hood that allows drivers to see the road ahead even on the steepest incline. The back window also has a camera feed to the rear-view mirror meant to aid visibility if the direct line of sight is blocked by luggage.
The mild-hybrid powertrain harvests energy lost during deceleration and redeploys it to assist the engine when the driver accelerates, reducing fuel burn. A plug-in hybrid option will also be available in 12 months. JLR, Britain’s biggest carmaker, has said all new models will come with hybrid or fully electric variants by 2020."

The Fed’s job is sure to get a whole lot more complicated even after this next decision, and the global economic picture isn’t helping: If you freaked out about Japan and Germany and the broader euro area slowing in the third quarter, you might want to mind a few more GDP losses this week in Israel, Chile, and Thailand.
Here’s our weekly wrap of what’s going on in the world economy.
Fed, We Hardly Knew Ye
There are a slew of fresh question marks around the Fed’s December plans, with pricing of interest-rate probabilities sliding amid signals that the U.S. economy is shifting into lower gear. Add to that: the New York Fed chief’s remark that they’ll probably raise rates “somewhat,” and more skepticism of a happy ending for U.S.-China talks (more on that later). It’ll only get tougher from there.
There was also a loud peanut gallery this week to rattle central bankers. U.S. President Donald Trump took his Fed criticisms further, promoting a cut in interest rates. The Reserve Bank of India engaged government officials who have their own plans for the central bank, which underlined the populist pressure that’s also cropped up from Italy and Turkey of late.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Lawyers launched a class action lawsuit in Israel on Thursday against Airbnb, accusing the company of ""outrageous discrimination"" and demanding monetary damages after it withdrew listings of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.
The San Francisco-based company said this week it was removing listings of around 200 homes in settlements after hearing criticism from people who ""believe companies should not profit on lands where people have been displaced”.
Through her attorneys, Ma'anit Rabinovich from the West Bank settlement of Kida, who offers guest room rentals, said the move ""represents especially grave, offensive and outrageous discrimination"".
Rabinovich claimed 15,000 shekels ($2,573) in personal damages. The class action lawsuit would seek an as yet unspecified sum on behalf of others in the same situation, according to court papers presented at Jerusalem District Court.
""The company's decision is in effect directed solely against Israeli citizens living in the settlements, the petitioner claims, and this is severe, especially outrageous discrimination,"" Rabinovich's lawyers said in a statement.
""(It is) part of the long war being conducted by organizations (of which a clear majority are anti-Semitic) against the State of Israel in its entirety, and against Israelis living in settlements in particular.""
Palestinians who want to establish an independent state taking in the West Bank have welcomed Airbnb's move. Most world powers view Israel's construction of settlements on occupied Palestinian land as a violation of international law, and Palestinians say it is wrong for companies to profit from them.
""Airbnb took a decision in the right direction to stop dealings with Israeli settlements, consistent with international legitimacy,"" Wasel Abu Youssef, a senior official with the umbrella Palestine Liberation Organization, told Reuters.
An Airbnb spokesman declined to comment on the filing of the lawsuit.
In a statement emailed to Reuters on Tuesday, Chris Lehane, Airbnb's global head of policy and communications, said: ""Israel is a special place and our over 22,000 hosts are special people who have welcomed hundreds of thousands of guests to Israel.
""We understand that this is a hard and complicated issue and we appreciate everyone's perspective.""
Airbnb's delisting applies only to Israeli settlements in the West Bank, where Palestinians have limited self rule under Israeli military occupation. 
It does not apply to Israel itself, or East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, territories Israel has annexed without international recognition. Israel withdrew settlers from another Palestinian territory, the Gaza Strip, more than a decade ago.
Israel strongly objects to international boycotts, including boycotts of the settlements, which it views as discriminatory.

A 2017 Israeli law empowers courts to award cash compensation to claimants who prove they have been denied goods or services because of where they live.

562,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 22, 2018 03:30PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets Friday.
1. Markets Closing Early
The stock market will likely see higher-than-normal volatility Friday with an early market close and many investors and traders still away for the Thanksgiving holiday.
U.S. stock and bond markets were closed Thursday.
On Friday, stock markets will close at 1:00 PM ET (18:00 GMT). The bond markets close at 2:00 PM ET.
Stocks moved into Turkey Day on a higher note, with the broader market managing to stay in the green after a late selloff.
2. Retail in Focus on Black Friday
There are no earnings scheduled, but retail stocks will be closely watched for any reaction to Black Friday holiday sales as retailers slash prices and hold promotional events.
Known for its long lines and, at times, pandemonium to get marked down items, Black Friday was traditionally when retailers moved into the black for the year as holiday shopping began.
Now it’s an event unto itself that starts Thanksgiving evening – and for some retailers earlier – and goes through until Cyber Monday.
Big-name retail stocks were hit hard in the recent market selloff as they reported earnings, with investors piling out of companies that reported strong numbers, like Walmart (NYSE:WMT), and those that disappointed, like  Target  (NYSE:TGT).
What may make it difficult for investors is that retailers tend not to break out numbers for the Black Friday period, so much of the evidence on strength or weakness will be anecdotal. Twitter feeds for retail analysts will be closely watched for estimates on foot traffic and popular promotions.
3. Manufacturing and Services PMI on the Calendar
There will be one batch of data for the market to react to Friday.
Markit will releases its preliminary measurements of manufacturing and services activity at 9:45 AM ET.
On average, economists expect the Markit manufacturing purchase managers’ index (PMI) to stay steady compared with October. The November services PMI is forecast to tick up slightly."

564,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2018 01:50PM ET</span>",German car bosses willing to attend White House meeting - sources,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The heads of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), BMW (DE:BMWG) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) are ready to attend a meeting at the White House with the Trump administration, but have not yet received a formal invitation, industry sources said on Thursday.
The Handelsblatt newspaper on Wednesday cited industry and diplomatic sources as saying the meeting could possibly take place as soon as next week. The paper said it was not known whether U.S. President Donald Trump would attend the meeting.
""It's clear that the meeting is planned, and that the CEOs will attend,"" said one industry source.
A second industry source confirmed plans for a meeting in Washington, but said details were still being worked out and the CEOs would make clear they could not negotiate on behalf of the European Union.
Trump has threatened for months to impose tariffs on all European Union-assembled vehicles, a move that could up-end the industry's business model for selling cars in the United States.
But he has refrained from imposing car tariffs while the United States and European Union launch negotiations to cut other trade barriers.
Sources at the carmakers said no formal invitation had been received and no travel arrangements had been made. They said the meeting could take place at short notice, possibly next week.
The companies declined to comment publicly.
A German government spokesman said the chancellery was familiar with the idea of such a meeting, but said European Union officials were responsible for all trade negotiations.
One industry source said the invitation put the companies in an awkward position, given the EU's responsibility for trade matters. At the same time, they did not want to turn down the opportunity to engage in dialogue.
""What matters is that we find a solution,"" said one source, adding that it was critical for the German car industry to maintain access to the U.S. market, the second largest behind China.
Bernd Westpahl, business policy spokesman for the Social Democrats, junior partners in the German coalition government, said the invitation offered an opportunity to make progress.
""It is a good - and perhaps the last - opportunity to convince the U.S. president to back away from punitive tariffs,"" he said.
Handelsblatt said Richard Grenell, the U.S. ambassador to Germany, had relayed the invitation to the car companies. Grenell also met with the German car bosses in July.
An embassy spokesman referred all questions to the White House. No immediate response was available, given the U.S. Thanksgiving Day holiday.
The United States currently imposes tariffs on cars of 2.5 percent, compared to 10 percent tariffs in the EU.

On Tuesday, trade ministers will meet representatives of major companies including Spanish banks Santander (MC:SAN) and BBVA (MC:BBVA), Commercial Bank of China, Spain's  Telefonica  (MC:TEF), oil company Repsol (MC:REP), China National Building Material Group, China Energy Engineering (HK:3996) and Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL].
Philippe Le Corre, a China specialist and senior fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School, said Spain lagged its neighbor Portugal in attracting Chinese investment and is keen to get more.
He noted that China Ocean Shipping Company's 51 percent stake in Spain’s Noatum Port Holdings, which gives it control over the major harbours of Valencia, Bilbao and Barcelona, meant Spain ""is definitely part of the 'maritime silk road'"".
China has courted southern and eastern European states as countries such as Germany tend to be more critical on human rights and trade issues, Beijing-based diplomats say. 
Neither Spain nor Portugal have signed a letter backed by at least 15 western ambassadors seeking an audience with the top official in China’s restive Xinjiang region to discuss rights concerns, something diplomats see as an apparent sign of their reluctance to confront China on contentious issues.

Spain has a chronic trade deficit with China, according to Spain’s Institute of Foreign Trade, but in 2017 exports jumped 28 percent to around 6.25 billion euros.

571,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2018 12:35PM ET</span>",Greek central bank sets out plan to reduce banks' bad loan burden,"ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece's central bank unveiled a proposal on Thursday it said could remove a mountain of bad loans from banks' balance sheets to a single-digit ratio within two to three years, hoping to beat a deadline set by regulators.
Greek banks have the highest level of non-performing exposures (NPEs) in Europe, with more than 45 percent classed as bad loans, the equivalent of 88.9 billion euros.
Under the central bank's proposal, banks would transfer a ""significant part"" of their NPEs and deferred tax claims to a special purpose vehicle. That SPV would then convert the deferred tax claims - tax breaks to companies when reporting losses - to a claim on the state. The transfer would be financed with a bond issue, the central bank said.
It did not mention the value of loans to be transferred, saying that would have to be carried out by independent third parties. Banks were expected to make a commitment of achieving a single-digit ratio of NPEs within a three-year period from engagement of the transaction. 
Banks have agreed with European Central Bank regulators to take steps to shrink bad loans to 64.6 billion euros by the end of 2019, or by 37 percent. 
""The plan has been sent to the SSM and will be presented next Monday,"" a Greek central bank official told Reuters, referring to the ECB's supervision mechanism. 
""The Central Bank of Greece is attempting, in tandem with the efforts of banks, and bearing in mind any legal limitations, to drastically reduce NPLs so they fall to the European average by 2021,"" the official added.
Greece's central bank said its proposal would bring about a ""direct and drastic"" reduction in NPEs and would allow, under certain conditions, to target single-digit ratios within two to three years.
Non performing exposures are a particular legacy of crisis-hit countries, with Greece and Cyprus topping the list.
According to data from the European Banking Authority, all EU member states bar those two plus Portugal have ratios of non-performing loans - exposures which do not include those loans restructured - of less than 10 percent.

574,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2018 12:23PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Visa, Mastercard offer tourist card fee cut in EU antitrust probe - sources","By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Visa and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) have offered to trim the fees merchants pay on card payments by tourists in the European Union in an attempt to stave off possible fines after a long-running antitrust investigation, people familiar with the matter said.
Even after the cut, the fees paid by merchants when they accept card payments, a lucrative source of revenue for banks, will still likely be higher than those for EU cards, they said. 
The European Commission has battled for more than a decade to reduce so-called interchange costs and encourage cross-border trade and online commerce. U.S. regulators have also frowned on such practices.
Retailers say interchange fees count as a hidden cost and the card companies have paid billions of dollars to settle class action lawsuits.
Visa, the world's largest payments network operator found itself in the Commission's crosshairs in August 2017, charged with subjecting the cards of foreign tourists to excessive fees when they were used in the EU.
The case originally concerned Visa Europe which was acquired by  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V) in June 2016. The EU said that fees charged to retailers when they accept Visa cards issued outside the EU could raise prices of goods and services for all consumers.
The EU competition enforcer's charge against Mastercard dated from July 2015. The company is also accused of having rules which blocked banks in one EU country from offering lower interchange fees to a retailer in a second EU country.
The Commission and Visa declined to comment. Mastercard said: ""At this time, we have no information to share on our ongoing engagement with the European Commission.""
Mastercard has warned it might be fined more than $1 billion if found guilty of breaching EU antitrust rules, but this might be less if there was a negotiated resolution.
The Commission can hand down fines as much as 10 percent of a company's global turnover for infringing EU antitrust rules.
But under EU settlement rules for antitrust cases, companies do not get fines nor are required to admit wrongdoing.  
The Commission is expected to seek feedback from retailers and consumer groups before deciding whether to accept the offer from Visa and Mastercard. Negative comments could lead it to demand a bigger fee cut. 
Business lobbying group EuroCommerce, whose 1997 complaint triggered the EU investigations, and Visa declined to comment.

Visa and MasterCard capped cross-border fees within Europe - that is, fees on transactions in one EU country charged for transactions in another EU country - in 2014 and 2009 respectively, to end another EU investigation.

577,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2018 12:15PM ET</span>",Russia hopes for IPO renaissance after worst year in a decade,"By Olga Popova, Katya Golubkova and Dasha Afanasieva
MOSCOW/LONDON (Reuters) - Russian companies remain committed to planned stock market listings in 2019, sources and bankers say, despite the country's worst year for equity sales in a decade. 
At least 10 Russian companies, ranging from petrochemicals giants to real estate and health businesses, had been lining up at least $4 billion worth of initial public offerings (IPOs) this year in Moscow and, in some cases, London.
But none have come to pass and 2018 will be the first year in a decade without a single Russian IPO.
""This year was marked by an increase in U.S. interest rates ... It triggered big outflows from emerging markets starting from May,"" said Dmitry Brodsky, head of equity capital markets for Russia and CIS at Russia-focused investment bank Renaissance Capital. 
""Quite a lot of companies continue to study the market or prepare to tap it ... If the markets reverse, they could be ready in four to eight months."" 
But for all the plans and hopes, the outlook remains clouded as U.S. sanctions against Russia and wider economic concerns that have hammered emerging markets continue to weigh heavily on corporate Russia.
Among those that had been considering an IPO this year were Sibur, one of the world's largest petrochemicals companies, as well as insurer RESO and private healthcare provider European Medical Center. 
""There will be no IPOs for the rest of the year – the window is shut,"" said Alina Sychova, head of capital markets origination at Sova Capital.
""I know there are a few names looking at the first-quarter: they are going to be monitoring the situation in terms of sanctions, Brexit and overall market volatility.""
WHAT WENT WRONG 
Last year Russian companies raised about $8 billion from public equity sales, about $3 billion of which was from IPOs, including Oleg Deripaska's En+  listing in London and Moscow, according to Reuters data. En+ manages Deripaska's energy and aluminum assets.
In April, however, Deripaska and his business were among those placed under U.S. sanctions in response to Moscow's alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. Moscow has denied any wrongdoing. 
The United States has also promised a fresh sanctions package, known as the ""bill from hell"", designed to punish Moscow for what Washington described as malign activity and other international actions that Russia has denied. 
The Russian stock market was hit hard by the April sanctions. Haulage company Globaltruck (MM:GTRK), which raised 3.85 billion roubles ($59 million) via its Moscow IPO last November, was trading at 102.5 roubles per share on Thursday, down 22 percent from the 132 rouble offer price. 
Sanctions, emerging markets turmoil and rising U.S. Treasury yields, topped off by the continuing U.S.-Sino trade war, have all hit the Russian IPO plans, bankers say.
Some companies that had been private business success stories - such as food retailer Magnit - became co-owned by state bank VTB. Others, including mobile phone operator Megafon (MM:MFON), decided to delist their shares while only a handful of businesses held secondary share offerings. 
""I don’t think market conditions are favorable,"" said an executive at a company that had considered listing some of its operations.
""There’s concern about the political situation, consumer confidence, budget, oil prices. It’s just volatile and that’s worrying for everybody,"" he told Reuters. 
Another to fall by the wayside was, IT services company IBS, which postponed a $100 million Moscow IPO immediately after the sanctions announcement in April, citing volatility in financial markets. 
""The market, both investors and companies, needs a certain time to adjust and find a balance,"" said Boris Kvasov, an executive director for equity capital markets at VTB Capital, Russia's leading investment bank. 
""A lot of (IPO) transactions are in the stage of preparation and can materialize next year ... Any positive trend in resolving this (geopolitical issues) could trigger an increase in market activity, thanks also to unfulfilled demand.""

583,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2018 12:02PM ET</span>",Nissan ends Ghosn's two-decade reign with last-minute Renault backing,"By Sam Nussey, Maki Shiraki and Laurence Frost
YOKOHAMA, Japan/PARIS (Reuters) - Nissan's (T:7201) board voted unanimously to oust Chairman Carlos Ghosn over allegations of financial misconduct, after French partner  Renault  (PA:RENA) backed away from a last-minute demand to postpone the decision on their alliance leader's fate.
The vote - supported by Renault appointees on the Nissan board after a four-hour meeting - may begin to defuse a crisis that threatened to upend the alliance and spark a diplomatic rift between Japan and France, Renault's main shareholder.
It also drew a firm line under Ghosn's stewardship of the car empire that was his life's work. Ghosn was arrested in Japan on Monday after a Nissan investigation uncovered evidence of serious wrongdoing including under-reporting of his remuneration and personal use of company assets.
""The board acknowledged the significance of the matter and confirmed that the longstanding alliance partnership with Renault remains unchanged,"" the Japanese carmaker said.
Nissan said its board dismissed Ghosn and fellow representative director Greg Kelly, an alleged co-conspirator, ""after reviewing a detailed report of the internal investigation"" - the first time Renault had seen key findings.
With Ghosn and Kelly still in custody, neither man has been able to defend himself publicly against the allegations.
ULTIMATUM
Before the meeting, two Renault board directors had demanded a postponement of the vote to fire Ghosn until the internal probe and legal proceedings were complete, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Failing that, they had warned that the French carmaker would exercise its right under the alliance master agreement to appoint Ghosn's successor and a fourth Renault nominee to the Nissan board, the sources said.
The ultimatum was issued in a strongly worded response to Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa - who had informed Renault in an earlier confidential missive that the Nissan investigation was expanding to include Renault-Nissan finances.
Nissan is 43.4 percent-owned by Renault. While almost 60 percent bigger by sales, it remains the junior partner in their shareholding hierarchy with a smaller reciprocal 15 percent non-voting stake in its French parent.
Ghosn had been exploring a deeper Renault-Nissan tie-up that was resisted by the Japanese firm - a fact which has fueled speculation about ulterior motives for his arrest.
NO CONSPIRACY?
After the board presentation and its summary of findings, however, the tune in Paris had changed.
""The accusations are extreme, certainly, but they are also precise,"" said an official at French President Emmanuel Macron's Elysee Palace office.
""We know there's a flourishing conspiracy theory about all this, but that's really not our thinking.""
After heavy losses earlier in the week, Renault shares were up 0.5 percent at 1615 GMT. Nissan shares closed up 0.8 percent. 
The Japanese company did not announce a replacement for Ghosn - confounding reports that Saikawa was to be appointed interim chairman. 
Japanese prosecutors say Ghosn and Kelly conspired to understate Ghosn's remuneration by about half the 10 billion yen ($88 million) he earned at Nissan over five years from 2010.
Following an internal probe resulting from a whistleblower alert, Ghosn is also accused of misappropriating Nissan assets and ""misrepresenting the purpose"" of company investments.
A Nissan executive with direct knowledge of the board meeting said Renault's representatives had initially voiced incomprehension over the accusations.
""There was some talk and frustration about an unjust arrest,"" he said. ""But they suddenly changed when they heard the contents - and understood that this wasn't some strange conspiracy.""
GHOSNLEAKS
Japanese newspapers have been awash with leaked details of the Tokyo prosecutor's investigation into Ghosn. Asahi Shimbun reported on Thursday he had emailed Kelly orders to make false statements about his remuneration.
The Yomiuri, Japan's biggest-circulation daily, said Nissan had been paying Ghosn's elder sister $100,000 a year since 2002 for a non-existent advisory role. She lived in a luxury Rio de Janeiro apartment funded by a Nissan subsidiary, according the report, which cited unidentified sources.
Mitsubishi Motors, which joined the alliance in 2016, also plans to oust Ghosn as chairman next week. Renault's board named interim replacements on Tuesday but kept Ghosn on as chairman and CEO, with government backing.
That stance may now change.
Even were he cleared, French officials now concede, Ghosn would be an unlikely figure to rebuild the cross-cultural trust of which he once appeared to be the sole guarantor.
""It really seemed there was a common vision between Ghosn and Nissan,"" the Elysee official said. ""But now we realize there was in fact a yawning gap.""

585,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2018 11:25AM ET</span>","Nissan's Saikawa, a hard-nosed leader, takes center stage after Ghosn's ouster","By Norihiko Shirouzu and Maki Shiraki
TOKYO (Reuters) - In sacking his long-time mentor Carlos Ghosn as chairman of Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201), CEO Hiroto Saikawa has only bolstered his reputation for being a tough leader unafraid to antagonize people in the interests of business.
Thursday's board decision to oust Ghosn, one of the most celebrated leaders in the auto industry, comes after he was arrested in Japan this week, accused by Nissan of serious financial misconduct over many years.
Saikawa is described by company insiders as smart, exacting and results-oriented. He will have to marshal those qualities as he tackles reputational loss, legal and regulatory issues, as well as suspicions that the arrest was a coup engineered by board members unhappy with Ghosn and the alliance with  Renault  SA (PA:RENA).
""He's very strong and aggressive,"" said a Nissan executive, adding Saikawa was not afraid to embarrass people in meetings if their performance fell below his standards.
""There are people who love him and people who hate him - people who don't like him because he is very strict,"" said the executive who, like other company insiders Reuters spoke to, declined to be identified due to the personal nature of their comments.
Nissan has accused Ghosn of using money for personal purposes and under-reporting income. According to Tokyo prosecutors, Ghosn is suspected of reporting only half of some $88 million in earnings over a five-year period.
Reuters was unable to reach Ghosn, who has been detained by Tokyo prosecutors, or a lawyer for him.
Saikawa only became CEO last year, having been groomed by Ghosn for the job over many years.
Another Nissan executive described Saikawa as unflinchingly scrupulous, adding this would have certainly played into how he dealt with the allegations concerning Ghosn once they surfaced within the company.
""He's very much 'by the book'. He has one phone for personal use and one for company use and when he rings his family, he never uses the company phone,"" he said.
The executive noted that last year's scandal at the Japanese automaker over improper inspection procedures in the domestic market would have made Saikawa even more cautious.
""Saikawa's been dealing with the inspection problem since last year and where matters of compliance are concerned, he'd be of the belief that you just can't turn a blind eye.""
Nissan declined to comment on the executives' assessment of Saikawa. Saikawa could not be reached for comment.
NOW A GHOSN CRITIC
At a news conference on Monday to explain the arrest, Saikawa, usually a very fast talker, earned praised on social media for the unhurried and dispassionate way in which he answered questions for close to 90 minutes, unflanked by lawyers or other company officials.
""It was also quite telling how he did not stand and bow in apology,"" said a former Nissan executive, adding it was as if Saikawa was signifying that he personally was not at fault.
Saikawa on Monday was also frank in his assessment of Ghosn's shortcomings, saying too much power had been concentrated at the top of the company. In addition to the alleged financial misconduct, there were times where Ghosn made decisions without seeking the input he should have, he added.
Saikawa was, however, not his usual composed self at a meeting with department chiefs on Tuesday, according to two people who attended. One said he looked like he ""had tears in his eyes"" and another said his voice quivered at one point.
Like everybody else at Nissan and Renault, Saikawa's career has long been overshadowed by Ghosn, the charismatic ""Cost Killer"" credited with turning around a debt-ridden automaker by closing 5 plants and cutting 21,000 jobs - drastic steps that broke new ground in Japan and were widely seen at the time as something only an outsider could do.
But now it is Saikawa's turn in uncharted waters.
Ghosn had been seen by many analysts as the only person who could make the three-way alliance between Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211) work.
""It's going to be extremely difficult for Saikawa,"" said Takeshi Miyao, managing director of consultancy Carnorama, noting it was not clear if Renault, Nissan's biggest shareholder with a 43.4 percent stake, would be supportive.
While Saikawa has served on Renault's board for 10 years, he does not have Ghosn's experience in dealing with the French government or the length of experience Ghosn gained in leading Renault and before that as a senior executive at  Michelin  (PA:MICP).
""But he's a tough negotiator. Ghosn wouldn't have picked him as CEO if he wasn't,"" Miyao said.
Saikawa, who at 65 is a few months older than Ghosn, joined Nissan from the prestigious Tokyo University more than 40 years ago. Described by some as reluctant to stand out, little is known about his private life, beyond that he is married.
He has spent much of his career managing purchasing and supply chains, and helped Ghosn break up Nissan's supplier network to reduce costs. 
Acting as chief competitive officer from 2013 to 2016, he was tasked with reducing manufacturing costs by saving money in raw material procurement, regulatory expenses and planning and development. Saikawa was also instrumental in hammering out the details of Nissan's deal to bring Mitsubishi Motors into the alliance.

""He's very much a numbers man - he's hard on those that don't deliver results, although he's also hard on himself,"" said the former Nissan executive. ""Some might say that he lacks warmth.""

589,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2018 10:58AM ET</span>",BioMarin sets stage early for hemophilia cure off-Broadway,"(This version of the November 21st story has been refiled to show in paragraph 23 that Sangamo Therapeutics has six people in clinical trials)
By Caroline Humer
NEW YORK (Reuters) - BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc (O:BMRN) is turning to the theater to establish its name with hemophilia patients, long before its experimental cure for the bleeding disorder could reach the market.
Earlier this month, BioMarin hosted 25 teenagers and their chaperones for an all-expenses paid trip to New York City, where they performed a Broadway-style musical based on their own experiences with bleeding disorders. Some came from as far away as Hawaii to work with a professional theater crew, have their headshots taken and meet members of the show Hamilton. 
During breaks, some stopped to infuse the blood-clotting medications, with a nurse on hand to attend to any health needs.
Well beyond a feel-good philanthropic effort, BioMarin’s business strategy here is to build a long-term relationship with hemophilia patients who it wants to one day use its gene therapy. If approved, it is expected to be one of the most expensive on the market at well over $1 million per person. 
BioMarin’s sponsorship of “Hemophilia: The Musical” – conceived more than a year ago while its own experimental hemophilia gene therapy will not reach the market until at least mid-2020 - stands out in a drug industry known for pulling out all the stops to convince doctors and patients to use their medicines. U.S. regulations allow companies to discuss diseases and care with patients, but they cannot advertise products before they are accepted by health regulators.
BioMarin’s long-term strategy is geared to take market share from  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGn),  Shire  Plc (L:SHP) and  Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb), who dominate the $10 billion market for blood clotting treatments. These players have also provided hemophilia patients with summer camps and other events such as a kayak trip in Washington State’s Puget Sound from Switzerland’s Octapharma AG. 
Another likely rival is Roche Holding AG (S:ROG), whose Hemlibra treatment helps hard-to-treat hemophilia patients keep their condition under control and requires fewer infusions.
""What the hemophilia community has said to us is, 'Who is BioMarin. Gene therapy, that looks interesting, but who is BioMarin? We've got to get to know BioMarin. We need to know you and trust you before your product shows up,"" BioMarin Chief Commercial Officer Jeff Ajer said in an interview.
With that in mind, BioMarin turned to Patrick James Lynch, who runs the Los Angeles-based marketing and production agency Believe Ltd that specializes in bleeding disorders. Lynch, who has hemophilia, recruited the applicants, managed the details and led the group - in matching black jackets with Hemophilia the Musical and BioMarin logos - to Times Square (NYSE:SQ). 
For Porus Pavri, 14, the three-day weekend represented a rare opportunity to kick back with teenagers who understand his daily challenges. Acting, he said in the play, was like his life at home: “It is one of the only activities I can do where I can go all out without worrying about my health.”
Concerns he will be hurt has put activities such as sports, or even the school marching band, off limits to Porus, who has coped with an especially severe form of hemophilia for most of his life.  
""At one point I had lost full faith in the American medical system. That faith, with a lot of difficulty, has been restored,"" Yasmin Pavri, Porus’ mother, said.  
Earlier this year, Porus switched to Roche’s Hemlibra, which has reduced the bleeding and pain. Without it, he could not have participated in the musical, Pavri said. An earlier experience in switching medications made her reluctant to consider the Roche therapy. She would like to see several years of data on a gene therapy, whose effects are likely irreversible, before contemplating it for her son. 
But after the weekend workshop, she said she felt more comfortable with BioMarin above the other companies working on gene therapies.
Unlike most countries, the United States allows drug companies to market their FDA-approved products directly to consumers. In recent years, new laws have curbed drugmaker gifts to doctors, based on studies showing that even small items, such as a pen, can influence behavior. 
The relationships that pharma companies have with patients are “potentially problematic” because their influence may not align with the effectiveness of a treatment, said Alyssa Burgart, a clinical ethicist at the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford University.
“This is planting a very early seed for adolescents” given that the drug is still in trials, she said.
BioMarin disagreed with her assessment, and said that the project aimed to create an environment for teens with bleeding disorders to connect art and wellness, and is consistent with the company’s history in expanding care for people with rare genetic diseases.
“When we first started working with Believe Limited, we shared a strong principle that this should not be a marketing effort,” spokeswoman Debra Charlesworth said.
“NORTH OF $1 MILLION”
There are about 20,000 U.S. patients with hemophilia, 16,000 of which suffer from hemophilia A which BioMarin and others are targeting. The current standard therapy requires patients to infuse factor proteins into their bloodstream several times a week for life, costing hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. Some develop an immune response, like Porus, and their costs rise to more than $1 million per year, making hemophilia patients among some of the most expensive for the U.S. healthcare system. 
BioMarin sees that price tag as an opening for its own experimental gene therapy – which if successful will cure the disorder in patients and justify the price.
""We haven't decided what we are going to price it at, but it's going to be for sure north of $1 million,"" BioMarin CEO Jean-Jacques Bienaime he said in an interview. ""We are not trying to introduce a new therapy that is going to cost substantially more per year,"" he said, adding that it would allow a deferred payment plan over two to five years if needed. 
Other drugmakers see the market potential for hemophilia gene therapies, but have a longer road ahead.  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) has licensing agreements with  Spark Therapeutics Inc  (O:ONCE), which began enrolling patients in clinical trial in July, and Sangamo Therapeutics Inc (O:SGMO), which currently has 6 patients in hemophilia A clinical trials. 
BioMarin is aiming to submit the therapy to regulators in the fourth quarter of 2019, and has the capacity to produce 4,000 gene therapy doses a year at its Navato, California factory.
DIFFERENT APPROACH 
BioMarin’s approach differs from Roche, which launched Hemlibra for difficult-to-treat hemophilia patients in late 2017 and more broadly in October. The drug’s price is about $492,000 per year for a 140 pound person. Roche has made donations to sponsor patient advocacy organizations, and provided information to physicians and others about Hemlibra, Roche spokeswoman Ulrike Engels-Lange said. It has not directly sponsored an event. 
By contrast BioMarin executives, including the head of research and development and a hemophilia business head, attended a parents breakfast during the New York weekend, BioMarin’s Charlesworth said.
Its general counsel gave introductory remarks at the musical and at the end of the production, Charlesworth enlisted caregivers give each teenager a small Tony Award-like trophy in areas such as “Biggest Heart” and “Unbreakable Spirit.”
She encouraged participants to fill out a survey to help the company decide on the program’s future and for longer-term research around the connection between art and health that BioMarin plans to fund. 
“I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship,” she said.

590,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2018 10:50AM ET</span>",Head of Danish pension giant haunted by past tax schemes,"By Teis Jensen
COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Pressure is mounting on the chief executive of Denmark's largest pension fund ATP to step down as a unit of bank Nordea (HE:NDAFI) that he ran has been criticized for its tax policies.
Five political parties, representing 43 percent of the seats in the parliament and including two of the coalition government's three parties, have said they do not think Christian Hyldahl is the right person to head the pension fund.
ATP is Europe's fourth largest pension fund with assets worth around $120 billion under management and handles mandatory pensions for more than five million Danes.
The focus on tax treatment has intensified in Denmark in the wake of a money laundering scandal involving its largest lender  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE) and a wider European dividend stripping scandal.
""At the time, the mindset was that it was a legitimate business opportunity,"" Hyldahl said of trading schemes that for example involved buying shares in Swiss francs from Swiss investors shortly before the annual dividend was paid out, and selling them back shortly after.
Under a tax agreement between Denmark and Switzerland the unit Hyldahl headed was able to get the divided tax it had paid refunded, unlike those Swiss nationals who held the shares the remainder of the time.
""Today, I think it was wrong that we entered that kind of trades,"" he told online media Finans on Thursday, referring to treatment of taxes in 2005-2008.
Hyldahl had in earlier comments defended the trades as ""decent."" His comments to Finans were confirmed by ATP.
Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen's Liberal Party said it will await further clarification about the ""serious accusations"" before it draws conclusions about ATP's leadership.
Hyldahl and the unit he headed has not been accused of any unlawful activity. But criticism from lawmakers comes as Hyldahl has pushed companies for better corporate governance and introduced random checks of business partners to avoid being entangled in tax avoidance since he took over the reins in ATP last year. 
As a self-owned entity ATP is not under direct political control, but not immune to political pressure either as its board members, which are nominated by employers associations and labour unions, are appointed by the employment minister.
The chairman of ATP's board, Torben M. Andersen, told newspaper Borsen on Thursday that the board retained confidence in Hyldahl. Andersen declined to comment to Reuters.

591,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2018 10:05AM ET</span>",Brexit race to stockpile pushes some of UK's aerospace suppliers to the brink,"By Sarah Young
BIRMINGHAM, England (Reuters) - A race by aerospace giants Rolls-Royce (L:RR) and Airbus (PA:AIR) to stockpile parts before Brexit is pushing some small suppliers to breaking point.
With just over four months until it leaves, and political bickering continuing, Britain is yet to sign off on its divorce terms with the European Union, forcing companies to prepare for a disorderly exit from the world's largest trading bloc. Supporting over 120,000 jobs, the UK's aerospace sector is the second largest in the world and depends on smooth cross-border trade. This makes it vulnerable to any checks and delays that would snarl up supply chains and throw an industry-wide ramp-up to meet surging global demand off course.
A string of suppliers have told Reuters they are either stockpiling parts, producing extra goods to be stored by their customers, or holding out to see whether a deal can be struck. 
Bitrez, a speciality chemicals manufacturer based in north west England, said some customers now ask suppliers to provide material to their premises, with the customer only invoiced as the stock gets used.
""Most of our larger customers have imposed or pushed for consignment stock deals so this has allowed them to increase stocks and provide a buffer,"" Paul Jones, MD of the 24 million pound-turnover company said. 
""Brexit is the driver for it.""
CASH FLOW 
Such demands put pressure on the cash-flow of small companies and Paul Adams, head of aerospace at consultancy Vendigital, said that was one of the biggest short-term risks for smaller aerospace suppliers. 
""When you're talking about adding time to a process what you're really talking about is consuming cash, mainly in the form of inventory, but also possibly resources to help with that,"" he said.
Even this sort of stockpiling would only realistically provide a limited extension due to restrictions on space and cost implications. And not all companies have the capability or space to step up at all.
""The aerospace guys have started stockpiling stuff, we're seeing that,"" said Tony Worsley, the managing director of Elder, a manufacturer of metal and polymer components.
But the family-owned, 4 million pound turnover company with 30 employees, can't stockpile all the materials it will need if a no-deal Brexit leads to days or weeks of supplies at UK ports.
""I haven't got the space, the resources,"" he said. Britain's aerospace sector includes small engineers across the country producing parts for the wings of the Airbus A320 plane, the Rolls-Royce engines which power passenger aircrafts, and the F-35, one of the world's most advanced fighter jets.
The industry had already been on a steep production curve as the likes of Airbus, Boeing (NYSE:BA), Rolls-Royce, Pratt and Witney and others race to meet demand for jets, particularly from China.
Weaker cash positions in smaller firms can add to the risks embedded in the supply chains of larger quoted companies, which are already rising due to the output hikes.
Global commercial aircraft production will reach 1,800 planes by 2022, up over 20 percent from 2017, Deloitte has said.
Andrew Mair, head of the Midlands Aerospace Alliance, a regional industry body which represents about a quarter of the UK's sector, said the recent ramp up meant it was impossible for some small companies to produce extra inventory.
""They can't keep up with current volume requirements, they cannot stockpile,"" he said.
The complex nature of building air frames and aero-engines means even the smallest suppliers can cause delays. The A380 is made up of 4 million components made by 1,500 companies in 30 countries, while 18,000 components go into Rolls-Royce engines.
Adams said some suppliers hold power in the short term because they're in a unique position to do what they do. ""They can and will push back,"" he said.
CLOCK TICKING
As the Brexit clock ticks down, the bigger companies are worried that their own contingency plans are only as robust as those of the thousands of smaller suppliers on which they rely.
Airbus, which has 4,000 companies in its UK supply chain, said in July it was activating its Brexit contingency plans to build up ""buffers"" because it thought the British government's strategy was unravelling.
""Our teams across Europe are in daily contact with suppliers about a range of subjects; we have both written to, and surveyed, our suppliers regarding Brexit and are working with those companies,"" said a spokesman for Airbus.
A spokesman for Rolls-Royce said: ""We are working hard to ensure that our supply chain has all the relevant information they need to plan for Brexit and we believe our suppliers will be able to take the steps necessary to ensure continuity of supply of both goods and services."" 
Rolls-Royce's CEO said last week the engine-maker was still intending to stockpile parts, to give it ""the logistical capacity that we need to carry on running our business.""
That fits with what small suppliers are starting to see. Mark Venables, the managing director of Alloy Wire International, a central England-based provider or specialist wire, said customers were asking for its Brexit plans.
Alloy Wire has, in fact, been taking on extra warehousing and building up its own buffers. ""We have been preparing for the last few years because we have been in effect carrying extra stock,"" he said. ""We took another unit on in August last year and have invested more than $5 million in material over the past twelve months - the biggest investment we've ever made in stock.""
If Britain can emerge through the Brexit deadline relatively unscathed then there could be a silver lining and company bosses, like Mark Crouchen, of Rockwood Composites, a 20 person, 1.5 million pound turnover, are hopeful. 
Corporate spending could spike if Britain agrees a good divorce deal, British finance minister Philip Hammond has said, following a period when companies have been ""sitting on their hands"" as they wait to see the outcome of the negotiations. South west England-based Rockwood, a maker of composite material parts used, for example in cabin doors and the decoy system in the Eurofighter, said its orders were all bespoke. 
It was hard to blame Brexit directly, but Crouchen said he had seen delays over the last two years.

""But we've certainly seen a big surge in work for next year and beyond. It's very, very unusual.""

592,By Business Insider,"<span>Nov 22, 2018 08:35AM ET</span>","Some Tesla Gigafactory workers will have to work through Thanksgiving as the company pushes to make 7,000 Model 3s per week and keep the company profitable","Tesla's Gigafactory will stay open over Thanksgiving as the company pushes to reach CEO Elon Musk's production goal of 7,000 Model 3s a week.
According to an internal email viewed by Business Insider, most Gigafactory workers will be able to observe Thanksgiving Day, but a few ""mission critical areas"" will remain open, meaning some employees must work.
""For Thanksgiving, we will be working in Model 3 Module and Pack Production,"" said the email, sent November 12. ""We're asking for volunteers to help us support these areas. Managers will follow up with each critical area to develop the volunteer list.""
It added: ""All of our hourly and non-exempt team members who work a Tesla holiday will receive 8.0 hours of holiday pay in addition to pay for hours worked on those days. We greatly appreciate everyone who's able to help and in turn will try to make it festive and rewarding for those that volunteer.""
A Tesla spokesperson said that the Gigafactory shifts on Thanksgiving were not added to meet production, rather, they were existing shifts. The spokesperson said that if someone assigned to a mandatory shift wanted off, they could potentially swap with a volunteer. 
Tesla posted a profit during its third quarter, something it had done only twice since becoming a public company in 2010.
However, the company failed to reach its goal of producing 5,000 Model 3s a week. (It averaged 4,300 a week.)
Now Musk is upping the ante, in part because the company has said it will sell less expensive — and thus lower-margin — versions of the Model 3 going forward, so it needs to increase volume.

Musk has also said customers who order their vehicles before the end of November will get them before an electric-vehicle tax credit for Teslas expires at the end of the year.
In a separate email on November 15, Musk stressed how important it was for the company to continue growing production so it can maintain profitability:
In another email to employees earlier this month, Musk said he'd be walking the entire Model 3 production line ""from cells to finished vehicles"" on November 27 and 28 to ensure each part is doing 50 units an hour, which would bring Tesla to 1,000 finished vehicles a day.
One Tesla worker, who spoke to Business Insider on the condition of anonymity, called the goal ""hopeless"" and said turnover remained high at the company.

594,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2018 07:20AM ET</span>",Tech outflows biggest since 2015; investors pile into safer sectors: BAML,"By Sujata Rao and Helen Reid
(Reuters) - Redemptions from technology stocks totalled $1.5 billion in the past week, the biggest since February 2015, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) said on Thursday, citing data from EPFR Global.
The outflows from funds dedicated to tech shares came as a rout on Wall Street earlier this week wiped $1 trillion off the value of leading tech firms.
Total equity redemptions were just $900 million, as the biggest moves happened under the surface. Investors pulled out of sectors highly sensitive to the cycle and favored safer high-dividend and stable-earning ""defensive"" sectors.
""Broader flow story is rotation... not massive redemptions,"" the strategists wrote. ""Defensive yes, but panicked no.""
Investors have plowed $8 billion into defensive sectors (excluding real estate investment trusts) and pulled $14 billion out of cyclicals over the past eight weeks, they noted.
The strategists said they remain sellers of equities because institutional positioning is not bearish enough yet to signal a market bottom.
The bank's ""Bull & Bear"" indicator of market sentiment remained at last week's level of 2.8. It would have to fall to 2 to constitute a ""buy"" signal, BAML said.
""We see no positioning or policy capitulation yet; institutional positioning not bearish enough to signal Big Low,"" the strategists wrote.
""BIG POLICY PANIC""
The triggers for a panic over monetary tightening are forming, BAML wrote, predicting the U.S. Federal Reserve could be stopped in its tracks in the next three months by further falls in the S&P 500 and high-yield bonds.
Fed tightening cycles usually end with a ""financial event"", they warned, pointing to previous crises such as the 2000 tech bubble and the subprime crisis of 2007.

599,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2018 05:25AM ET</span>",No more fake Fidelity or bogus Buffett: China bars new copycat fund names,"By Samuel Shen and Tony Munroe
SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese asset managers will no longer be allowed to make a name for themselves by exploiting brands such as HSBC, Goldman, Morgan or Fidelity in their newly-launched funds, according to industry guidelines published this week.
They're also barred from linking their products with market wizards such as Warren Buffett or Peter Lynch under new Asset Management Association of China (AMAC) rules that bar unauthorized use in private fund products of renowned trademarks, names of famous people or institutions.
However, the rules that take effect on Jan. 1 don't apply to existing fund products, including the roughly 60 that use the HSBC name in Chinese characters and have nothing to do with the British banking giant, according to AMAC's website.
HSBC (L:HSBA), which is among the biggest foreign players in China's financial sector, declined to comment.
Privately, some industry executives complain that the government should do more to close regulatory loopholes that allow copycat practices to persist.
The rules, which AMAC said are aimed at promoting orderly development of the private fund industry and protecting investors, come as Beijing accelerates opening of its fund industry to foreign asset managers.
""Foreign brands have long been misused in China,"" said Ivan Shi, head of research at fund consultancy Z-Ben Advisors.
""New rules would help foreign asset managers in China build their brand awareness and protect their reputation.""
The appropriation of Chinese versions of big foreign names in finance is widespread in China's funds industry.
The Chinese name for Goldman Sachs (N:GS) is used in seven private funds, and eight asset managers registered with AMAC, none of them related to the investment bank. The Chinese name for Fidelity is used in about 40 products and 12 firms unrelated to the funds giant, according to AMAC.
Both U.S.-based firms declined to comment.
The surname of billionaire investor Warren Buffett is used on 20 Chinese fund products unrelated to the ""Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) of Omaha"".
One product called ""Huifeng (the Chinese name for HSBC) Abundance Hedge Fund No. 1 with the Most Buffett Potential"" has lost 52.13 percent since its inception in February 2015, ranking 5,159th among peers by Shenzhen Qianhai Simuwang Fund Distribution Co based on investment returns.
Trademark disputes have been a long-running problem for foreign brands across industries in China.
Since China opened its domestic private fund sector to foreign players two years ago, overseas giants including Fidelity, BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), Man Group and UBS Asset Management have launched yuan-denominated products targeting Chinese investors.
Meanwhile, China has pledged to open its mutual fund industry further by allowing foreign asset managers to hold majority stakes in local ventures.
An advisor to foreign asset managers, who declined to be named due to sensitivity of the issue, said the new AMAC rules on fund product naming don't address the problem of local firms registering copycat company names before a foreign firm enters China.

LONDON (Reuters) - Europe's share markets dropped back into the red on Thursday as investor worries mounted about slowing global growth in the face of rising U.S. interest rates and trade tensions.
Chinese markets extended their slump in Asia amid the trade war with the United States, and with Wall Street closed later for Thanksgiving, Europe followed suit.
The region had plenty of concerns of its own. Italy was under pressure in both stock (EU) and bond markets [GVD/EUR] as sparring resumed over its budget plans. Some disappointing big-name earnings added to the gloom.
The dollar also edged lower for a second day as traders sold the greenback going into Thanksgiving and after Wall Street had seen Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) buckle again after a failed attempt at a rebound. [.N][/FRX]
""I think that the recent moves in equities have largely been about big tech catching up with the rest of the market,"" said Eoin Murray, the head of investment at Hermes Investment Management.
""Post the (global market) wobbles at the end of January, it has really only been big tech that has run off into the stratosphere ... So this is simply big tech coming back down to earth.""
Europe's tech sector lost another 1.2 percent, but it wasn't the worst performer. Banks were 1.6 percent weaker and mining companies and other resources firms were down nearly 2 percent and approaching a one-month low. (EU) 
That reflected the bitter Sino-U.S. trade war, encouraging investors to take money off the table before U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, meet in Argentina next week. 
The focus will be on whether they can make any progress on their trade feud. Singapore became the latest to warn about the potential impact on Thursday. The city state is considered as a bellwether for international trade.
""Risks in the global economy are tilted to the downside,"" said Loh Khum Yean, Singapore's permanent secretary for trade and industry.
RUSH FOR THE BREXIT
Sterling traded flat at $1.2784 but down 0.1 percent against the euro to 89.19 pence after Prime Minister Theresa May added little to Brexit plans at a meeting with the head of the European Union's executive on Wednesday.
May will return to Brussels on Saturday to try and agree an outline for Britain's withdrawal from the EU. All EU leaders are due to meet on Sunday to approve the deal. 
Just over four months before Britain's departure from the EU, Brexit negotiations and political uncertainty in Britain remain the key drivers for the pound, and many analysts are cautious about its prospects.
""With the UK and EU rushing to dot i's and cross t's on a Brexit deal, there's some support for sterling at the moment and some upward pressure on the front end of the rates market,"" said  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) strategist Kit Juckes.
""Though it won't take long before we refocus on the challenge facing the Prime Minister in getting House of Commons support for her Brexit deal,"" he added.
Back in the share markets, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had ended little changed after recovering from an initial wobble. 
The index has managed to hold up so far in November after three straight monthly declines, but is on track for its worst annual performance since 2011. 
Japan's Nikkei had finished almost 0.7 percent higher but Chinese shares closed 0.4 percent in the red. 
""Investors are still wary about whether they'll see further lows, given none of the issues that drove the recent correction have dissipated,"" said Shane Oliver, Sydney-based head of investment strategy at AMP.
In commodities, China-sensitive metals like copper fell [MET/L] and oil prices reversed early gains, although they were still above one-year lows touched earlier this week. [O/R]

MILAN (Reuters) - European shares resumed their downward trend on Thursday, hit by disappointing earning updates from UK utility  Centrica  among others and a fall in Italian banks on continued uncertainty about the country's finances.
At 0954 GMT, the STOXX 600 (STOXX) was down 0.9 percent, with most sectors trading in the red following broad-based gains in the previous session that helped the pan-European index bounce from near two-year lows.
""Hopes have been dashed that yesterday's rally would be the start of a new recovery,"" said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould.
Uncertainty over Italian politics, Brexit and worries over slowing economic and earnings growth have discouraged investors from taking risks as central banks take steps to end years of easy monetary policy.
On Thursday, Centrica (L:CNA) slid 8.2 percent to lead losers on the STOXX 600 after its trading update. Analysts at Jefferies said even though the company affirmed some of its debt and dividend targets for the year, its earnings per share guidance was 10 percent below consensus.
British industrial group  Rotork  (L:ROR) was another big faller in Europe, down 7.1 percent, following a 4 percent drop in its order intake.
Telecoms firm Altice (AS:ATCA) slumped 10.5 percent after its third quarter core earnings fell nearly 7 percent due to heavy promotions to win customers.
""The key challenge for Altice remains to turn around revenue and EBITDA trends,"" said  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Jakob Bluestone as he lowered his price target on the stock.
Not all earning updates disappointed.
 Remy Cointreau  (PA:RCOP) rose 2.5 percent after the French spirits group delivered higher first-half profits that were above forecasts, helped by demand for its premium cognac in China and by a tight rein on costs.
Concerns over the global economic outlook have led analysts to cut their 2018 estimate for average European corporate earnings growth to 4.8 percent, from 10 percent seen at the start of the year. Growth in 2019 however is seen rising back to 10 percent.
Italian banks (FTIT8300) fell 1.9 percent after Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini said the government would not backtrack on its expansionary 2019 budget law following a rejection by the EU Commission. 
UBI Banca (MI:UBI) was the biggest faller, down 2.5 percent, while top lenders UniCredit (MI:CRDI) and  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) fell 1.9 and 1.3 percent respectively. 
Bearish bets on a number of Italian banks have increased over the past weeks, reflecting their dim profit outlook and worries over the euro zone's third-largest economy. 

Miners (SXPP) were the biggest sectoral fallers, down 1.9 percent, as copper prices edged lower on worries over slowing global economic growth, hurt by an escalating trade war between Washington and Beijing. [MET/L]

“This is the return to normality,” James Ashley, head of international market strategy, said at a briefing in Singapore. “We think emerging markets are being oversold. We would see this as an attractive entry opportunity.”
The money manager isn’t alone in saying it may be time to buy. Aberdeen Standard Investments purchased U.S. stocks earlier this month, while Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors is snapping up emerging-market debt and selective U.K., Chinese and European equities. Northcape Capital Ltd. also sees buying opportunities.
A challenging year for financial markets took a turn for the worse in November as volatility erupted from New York to Athens. While global equities have recouped some of their losses in recent days, markets such as China, Hong Kong and South Korea have all dropped into bear territory due to concern over slowing economic growth, sliding oil prices and a U.S.-China trade war.
Goldman Asset is “modestly overweight” China and favors Indian and Indonesian equities, London-based Ashley said.
“The key message for 2019 is we prefer equities to credit, we prefer credit to developed-market fixed income, and we prefer emerging markets to developed markets,” he said.
Others are less optimistic. JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).’s multi-asset team has boosted cash levels and Treasury holdings at the expense of shares to reduce risk.
This isn’t the time to go defensive, Goldman Asset’s Ashley said. “The environment over the next couple of years will be more challenging than it has been in the recent past -- lower returns, higher risk -- but that doesn’t mean it’s the time to go into cash.’’

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's corporate regulator told an inquiry on Thursday that funding cuts and an increasing mandate had hampered its ability to prevent wrongdoing in the financial sector, and slammed bank bosses for failing to properly respond to its inquiries.
Australian Securities and Investment Commission Chairman James Shipton told the inquiry into financial sector wrongdoing that bank CEOs seemed to have little interest in speaking candidly to him and their demeanor in meetings was ""muted"".
""ASIC is under-resourced compared to some of our peers globally,"" Shipton, who started in the job in February, told the powerful Royal Commission inquiry that has exposed rampant misconduct throughout the country's financial industry.
""It means that we are restricted in our ability to take on matters or pursue matters in a way that we would like to. We are constrained in probably every aspect of our regulatory work, certainly in investigation, in matters to do with enforcement.""
The former judge running the Royal Commission, Kenneth Hayne, has accused ASIC and other regulators of failing to effectively do their jobs and of being too soft on big banks and other financial firms.
Shipton said the regulator conducted over 50 annual meetings with the boards and CEOs of Australia's biggest banks but did not keep records because ""I've been doing most of the talking"". 
""I was surprised when I first attended these meetings ... that such senior people spoke so little,"" he said. 
The head of banking regulator the Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority will take the stand in the coming days, as the year-long inquiry winds down.
Hayne's final report due in February is expected to recommend tougher regulation of the financial industry, stiffer penalties for wrongdoing as well as possible criminal or civil charges.
MACQUARIE CRUISES THROUGH
Earlier on Thursday, the CEO of the country's biggest investment bank,  Macquarie Group  Ltd (AX:MQG), glided through his appearance at the inquiry.
Macquarie CEO Nicholas Moore, who retires next week after a decade, said that although his company's executives had mis-read changes in the stockbroking industry during a switch in focus to wealth management, the company had taken action several years ago to fix those shortcomings.
""There was failure of recognition, of management, of the situation that we faced,"" Moore said.
Macquarie Equities agreed to a legally binding undertaking for the corporate regulator in 2013, after a review found poor compliance by its advisers dating back to 2008.
The inquiry was told that an independent review by KPMG in 2016 found the subsidiary was fully compliant.

The inquiry continues on Friday.

(HK:0178) saw its shares slide 9.4% to HK$3.17 on Thursday in Asia after Citibank downgraded the company’s international credit rating to “sell” from “buy.”
Citibank lowered the targeted share price of Sa Sa from HK$3.8 to HK$2.7 on softer sales growth in November compared to last month, Aastocks reported citing the research notes. Citibank said increased customer traffic from improved transport facilities might not be sufficient to compensate for weaker consumer power from the global economic slowdown.
The company announced Wednesday that same-store sales in third-quarter were worse than expected, although its interim results for the period ending on Sept. 30, matched expectations.
Sa Sa said that the market sentiment stayed gloomy on fluctuations in the stock market and RMB exchange rate amidst the U.S.-China trade war. The sales growth in the second quarter also slowed due to the 2018 FIFA World Cup and typhoons."

The electric carmaker, led by billionaire CEO Elon Musk, said it will cut prices of the two models by 12-26 percent to make the cars more ""affordable"" in the world's top auto market, where sales of so-called new-energy vehicles are rising fast.
The move comes amid severe trade tensions between China and the United States, which has seen extra tariffs slapped on U.S. imports into the country, including automobiles, hurting Tesla which imports all the cars it currently sells in the market.
""We are absorbing a significant part of the tariff to help make our cars more affordable for customers in China,"" Tesla said in a statement sent to Reuters.
The move marks a shift from July when Tesla was one of the first U.S. carmakers to raise prices in the market in response to tariffs. The firm hiked prices then on its Model X and S cars by about 20 percent.
Tesla warned last month it was facing major problems with selling cars in China due to new tariffs that would force it to accelerate investment in its first overseas Gigafactory in Shanghai.
The carmaker last month secured the site for the facility, which will help it avoid steep import tariffs. 
The firm, which recently launched pre-sales of its new Model 3 car in China, added in its statement that the car's pricetag would start from 540,000 yuan ($77,928.83) for a dual motor all-wheel drive version, and 595,000 yuan for a performance version.
Before the price hike in July, Tesla had lowered prices on its models in China in May, after Beijing had said it would cut import tariffs for all auto imports.

619,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2018 12:13AM ET</span>",Exclusive: HNA in talks with bad debt firm Cinda as it extends $43 billion asset sales - sources,"By Kane Wu and Julie Zhu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese conglomerate HNA Group has turned to state-owned  China Cinda  Asset Management Co (HK:1359), among the country's largest bad debt managers, for advice on asset disposals, people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
HNA Group's vice president, Dennis Chen, the nephew of its chairman Chen Feng, met with Cinda President Chen Xiaozhou on Tuesday to discuss cooperation, according to the people, who declined to be named as the information is confidential. 
It was not immediately clear what role Beijing-based Cinda is playing in HNA's asset disposals, but at the meeting, Cinda told HNA it stood ready to help, according to an internal memo sent to HNA staff and reviewed by Reuters. 
""Cinda will continue to support HNA's strategic transformation and its asset disposals in core and auxiliary businesses,"" Cinda's president said, according to the memo.
""Especially when HNA is in a relatively difficult time, there is all the more reason for us to increase our support,"" the president added.
HNA has attracted much scrutiny for its $50 billion worth of deals in recent years that included hotels in the United States and left it the largest shareholder in  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).
Faced with soaring debts and China's crackdown on aggressive dealmaking firms, the airlines-to-finance conglomerate has been pushing ahead with a series of asset sales that have so far included real estate and stakes in hotel groups. 
It has also offered up its much-hyped luxury $300-milliom-plus corporate ""Dream Jet"".
This week, HNA-controlled Hainan Airlines (SS:600221) announced the sale of a 40 percent stake in Urumqi Air to a local government entity for an undisclosed amount. 
The conglomerate has also offloaded a 25 percent holding in asset manager BrightSphere (N:BSIG), worth about $343 million, to U.S. hedge fund manager John Paulson.
Last week, chairman Chen told domestic business magazine Caijing that HNA had sold almost 300 billion yuan ($43 billion) in assets this year and would continue the disposals.
INGRAM PLANS
Cinda has already been involved in talks with potential buyers for Ingram Micro, the U.S. IT parts distributor that HNA bought for $6 billion in 2016, three people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The bad debt manager could also provide capital for a potential deal, according to one of the people.
An HNA spokesman declined to comment on this week's meeting with Cinda, but added that neither HNA nor any of its affiliates or subsidiaries was working with Cinda to sell Ingram Micro and that ""any suggestion to the contrary is patently false"".
Cinda did not respond to requests for comment. Ingram did not respond to a request for comment outside of office hours.
Any sale of Ingram Micro could be complicated by stepped-up powers recently awarded to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which scrutinizes foreign purchases of the country's assets.
In 2016, CFIUS approved the HNA-Ingram deal so long as the U.S. company operated as a stand-alone entity. 
But earlier this month, new rules aimed at curbing Chinese investment in 27 sensitive sectors gave the committee additional oversight of those sectors, which include telecommunications and semiconductors.
Several Chinese groups, including Cinda's counterpart  China Huarong Asset Management  (HK:2799), have held discussions with HNA regarding Ingram, Reuters reported in May. 
Huarong ended discussions on concerns over whether it could pass U.S. regulatory approvals.

HNA Technology Co (SS:600751), which owns Ingram, said in September it had $3.55 billion of debt outstanding from the purchase of the firm, of which $350 million was due this year.

""Markets experienced a better night last night, but it is fair to say that sentiment remains fragile,"" Daniel Gradwell from ANZ Research wrote in a morning note.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended higher on Wednesday after a brutal two-day selloff, led by a rebound in energy and technology shares, but the market faltered toward the session's end as Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) surrendered gains ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday.
The Dow also gave up its gains to end flat, while the S&P 500 ended near its session lows, a sign of lingering bearishness.
Worries about slowing global growth and peaking corporate earnings have sapped risk appetite in recent months, throwing into doubt the longevity of the nearly 10-year-old bull market.
Michael Antonelli, managing director of institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee, said the late-day weakness, which was likely tied to program selling in thin trading volume, is a disappointment for the bulls.
""It's ugly end-price action. There's no way to say it otherwise,"" he said. ""Everybody's watching Apple because it's been one of the drivers of pain. It opened really strong and to give all of that back just means the pain is not over.""
Though the S&P technology index rose 0.6 percent, helped by a 9.7 percent gain in shares of  Autodesk Inc  (NASDAQ:ADSK), Apple shares ended down 0.1 percent at $176.78 after trading as high as $180.27 during the session.
Software company Autodesk reported third-quarter results above analysts' estimates and announced an $875 million deal to buy cloud-based software company PlanGrid.
The S&P energy index rose 1.6 percent as oil prices steadied after a 6 percent plunge on Tuesday.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended flat at 24,464.69, the S&P 500 gained 8.04 points, or 0.30 percent, to 2,649.93 and the Nasdaq Composite added 63.43 points, or 0.92 percent, to 6,972.25.
The U.S. stock market will be closed on Thursday for Thanksgiving and will close at 1 p.m. EST (1800 GMT) on Friday.
The Dow and S&P 500 remain in negative territory for the year.
The Cboe Volatility Index, the most widely followed barometer of expected near-term volatility for the S&P 500, was down 1.68 points at 20.8. Traders in the options market expect stocks to remain volatile in the coming weeks. 
Volume was light at about 6.5 billion shares. That compares with the 8.5 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days.
""It's a cautious, measured recovery to recapture some of the lost share price from the past few days,"" said John Carey, managing director and portfolio manager at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management in Boston.
""Oil is a big part of it ... It's brought about an improvement in cyclical stocks,"" Carey said, referring to gains in shares of energy and materials companies.
Retailers also recovered, with the S&P retail index ending up 1.1 percent, breaking an eight-session string of losses.
 Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL) Inc surged 14.9 percent after the footwear retailer's quarterly same-store sales trumped expectations and boosted other sports retailers.
Shares of Dick's Sporting Goods Inc, Hibbett Sports Inc and  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE), a Foot Locker supplier, all gained.
Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS) rose 4.7 percent after several Wall Street brokerages took positively to Chief Executive Arthur Peck's more aggressive plan to close underperforming stores, which is expected to eliminate significant losses.
Gains in Foot Locker and Gap helped push the S&P consumer discretionary index 1 percent higher.
A report by capital markets-focused MNI saying the Federal Reserve may pause its interest rate-hiking cycle as early as spring may have helped to support the market, some strategists said.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.77-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.91-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted six new 52-week highs and three new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 14 new highs and 84 new lows.

The bank was subpoenaed by federal prosecutors in Manhattan late last year as it was locked in a court fight with the New York Department of Financial Services, according to the NYT report, citing two people who were briefed on the investigation.
The litigation is a part of the department's attempts to punish MUFG for breaking anti-money-laundering rules, the newspaper reported.
The subpoena was issued after the State of New York said in a court filing that the bank had intentionally ignored an internal filter designed to keep it from doing business with companies and people on international sanctions lists, the NYT reported.
The bank was fined hundreds of millions of dollars in 2014 for misleading U.S. regulators about its transactions with sanctioned countries including Iran.

The Italian publisher said late on Tuesday that it had launched arbitration proceedings under Italian law last week to annul the sale of the properties in central Milan that it had sold to Blackstone. It gave no further details in its statement.

The publisher contested the sale through a letter in March and then again in July before starting arbitration proceedings last week, the source said. 
A source close to Blackstone said the private equity group believed that RCS's attempt to void the sale was ""wholly fabricated"".
RCS Mediagroup could not immediately be reached for comment.

Blackstone launched a separate legal case against RCS Mediagroup in New York on Tuesday, alleging a planned sale of the same properties to Allianz (DE:ALVG) was held up by claims from RCS that the transaction was ""null and void"", according to a copy of the court documents seen by Reuters.

646,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 21, 2018 02:10PM ET</span>",Not Everyone's Abandoning Those Calls for Yield-Curve Inversion,"(Bloomberg) -- The contortions of the Treasury market have shaken off some of Wall Street’s most prominent calls for the yield curve to invert. BMO Capital Markets and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). are among the few hanging on.
Yields at the short end of the curve will push above those at the long end if the Federal Reserve proceeds with its planned policy tightening, according to BMO interest-rate strategist Ian Lyngen. The U.S. central bank’s latest quarterly projections show three 2019 rate increases, and in Lyngen’s view the Federal Open Market Committee is unlikely to back off from that stance while the unemployment rate is pushing through half-century lows.
“It’s too early to call the FOMC blinking on the hiking cycle and as a result our expectation for the curve to flatten to inversion remains in place,” Lyngen wrote in a note Wednesday.
This position is longstanding, as BMO was among the first to call the curve-flattening trend that has gripped the $15.4 trillion Treasuries market for the past two years. The Canadian bank’s tenacity stands out as many others have backed off flattening trades in recent months as long-end yields rose. Upward pressure came from stronger growth data, a pickup in wage inflation and an expansion in Treasury supply. The gap between the 2- and 10-year yields has pulled back to around 25 basis points from a decade low of about 18 in August.
JPMorgan takes an even stronger stance than the Fed on tightening, predicting four hikes in 2019 and an inversion of the curve in the second half of the year, according to a report released Tuesday.
All Eyes on the Fed
Morgan Stanley’s Matthew Hornbach -- another early subscriber to the flattener trade -- last month dropped his prediction for the 2- to 30-year U.S. curve to flatten completely. Still, the global head of interest-rate strategy wasn’t ready to back bets on a steeper curve. John Herrmann, a strategist at MUFG Securities Americas Inc., has abandoned his call for inversion.
The path of the curve from here hinges on whether the Fed signals a slower path of hikes ahead, in response to weakening global growth, recent equity-market volatility and subdued inflation data. Markets last week seemed to embrace this prospect, a references to global economic headwinds from top Fed officials sent the benchmark 10-year yield tumbling back toward 3 percent.
Traders in short-end rates markets have scaled back their positioning for central-bank increases. And while a hike in December is still seen as likely, the market is now pricing in less than half of the tightening that the Fed itself projects for 2019.
Hot Labor Market
While Lyngen isn’t dismissing the possibility of a March pause, he argued that “the simple reality is that one of the hottest labor markets we’re going to experience in our lifetimes doesn’t justify an accommodative stance of monetary policy, even if inflation is a bit weaker than desired.”
This view is shared by  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA economist Omair Sharif, who has warned that markets are overreacting to the Fed’s dovish undertones. In a research note Wednesday he flagged a busy schedule of Fed-related events over the next two weeks, including another Powell speech, “and we suspect that the occasions could be used to pull markets back towards the Fed’s stated 2019 path.”
Meanwhile, in the absence of any more compelling catalysts for Treasuries to rally, Lyngen is looking for short-dated yields to correct higher.
“While eventually there will be an inflection point, we’re not there yet, and once this reality is appreciated by the market, expect another bearish move in the front-end.”

649,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2018 01:25PM ET</span>",Investors caught in crossfire of fight for holiday shoppers,"By Trevor Hunnicutt
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors would normally be thankful for a strong U.S. economy, yet this holiday season they worry retailers may have to spend heavily to win, leaving shareholders with a lump of coal.
Steep discounts are as familiar a sight during the holidays as rich desserts, but this year so is a fierce grab for a slice of the e-commerce market as Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and  Target  Corp (N:TGT) offer free shipping for small purchases.
Underwhelming earnings reports this week from Target to department store Kohl's Corp (N:KSS) and home-improvement specialist Lowe's Cos Inc (N:LOW) reminded investors that U.S. tariffs on imported goods, fickle consumer tastes and competition could eat away at profits this year. Shares of Target fell 10 percent on Tuesday as the company said profit margins declined due to growing investments in boosting its online business, wage increases, price cuts and the higher cost of preparing and shipping orders.
""The retailers and e-commerce players are duking it out,"" Shawn Kravetz, Esplanade Capital LLC's chief investment officer, said at the Reuters Global Investment 2019 Outlook Summit in New York last week.
""Amazon is buying that (consumer retail) business. Other players are buying that business. So it's a war.""
Kravetz, whose first job after earning an MBA in 1995 was at CML Group Inc, a company that sold NordicTrack exercise machines and other products through catalogs and television advertisements, said ""the old joke was that we gave away stuff for free to sell people shipping.""
The game has changed for retail players now, he said.
""They have almost no gross margin and they're giving away shipping. It's a tough gig. But if you're Amazon - and you're playing the long game - if you can only get another trillion dollars' worth of revenue and then raise prices one percent the numbers can work.""
More retailers face pressure to cut into their margins or sacrifice growth, creating a catch-22 for investors even as consumers seem poised to open up their wallets for the sales that follow Thursday's U.S. Thanksgiving Day holiday. About 38 percent of American consumers planned to shop on ""Black Friday,"" a Reuters/Ipsos poll showed last week.
Even so, money managers are getting more selective.
(Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2PK8wGb)
 Eaton  (NYSE:ETN) Vance Corp portfolio manager Kathleen Gaffney, whose Multisector Income Fund (O:EVBAX) holds bonds issued by J.C. Penney Co Inc (N:JCP) and  Nordstrom Inc  (N:JWN), said she has scaled back the J.C. Penney holding.
""They've pretty much secured every asset that they have so it is going to be challenging. Nordstrom, on the other hand, is well suited for the current market,"" Gaffney said at the Reuters summit, adding that the company's managers have been effective and target a solid, upscale niche.
Nordstrom shares have added 10 percent this year, including dividends, sharply paring gains closer to 50 percent earlier this year after reporting disappointing third-quarter same-store sales. J.C. Penney shares crashed nearly 60 percent over the same period as the company continued to struggle to appeal to changing tastes of younger shoppers less likely to frequent traditional department stores.
Katie Shaw, sector leader for the global consumer team at Fidelity Investments, said she is positive about retail stocks because U.S. consumers are getting a raise, seeing inflation-adjusted wages gain at all income levels for the first time since the 2007-2009 global financial crisis. But Shaw has a lower holding in mall-based department stores and big-box retailers than the benchmark against which she is measured.

""The role of retail to a customer's life has changed,"" she said. ""There are a number of companies who have yet to invest in driving emotional connection with consumers.""

1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) [TERRN.UL] is the subject of corruption and money-laundering investigations in at least six countries.
Government-owned IPIC said in a statement it filed a civil legal action in New York against Goldman, and others, alleging they ""played a central role in a long-running effort to corrupt former executives of IPIC and its subsidiary Aabar Investments, and mislead IPIC and Aabar.""
The suit alleges Goldman conspired with unidentified people from Malaysia to bribe Khadem Abdulla al-Qubaisi, former IPIC managing director and Aabar chairman, and Mohamed Ahmed Badawy al-Husseiny, former Aabar chief executive, to further the business of Goldman and 1MDB at the expense of IPIC and Aabar.
""We are in the process of assessing the details of the allegations and fully expect to contest the claim vigorously,"" a Goldman spokesman said.
Malaysian government officials could not immediately be reached for comment.
IPIC also said in its statement that it had filed a criminal complaint in the United Arab Emirates against Qubaisi and Husseiny, for allegedly accepting bribes and abusing their authority. The current whereabouts of the two men are not publicly known and they could not be contacted.
Last year, 1MDB and the Malaysian government agreed to pay $1.2 billion to IPIC under a London arbitration award and assume responsibility for future principal and interest payments on 1MDB bonds which IPIC had guaranteed.
On Tuesday, Malaysia sought to set aside that award, IPIC said. It said it would fight that action and take steps to reaffirm the validity of the settlement.
An estimated $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB by high-level officials of the fund and their associates between 2009 and 2014, the U.S. Justice Department has alleged.
Three weeks ago, U.S. prosecutors unveiled criminal charges against two former Goldman bankers and Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho related to the 1MDB case.

Meanwhile, the Malaysian government has said it wants to reclaim from Goldman fees which the U.S. bank received for helping 1MDB raise money as well as losses suffered due to the deals.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A new normal is taking root in U.S. stock markets, and the word that best sums it up starts with a ""V"".
For the second time this year, volatility has returned with a vengeance, and traders in the equity options market are betting ongoing market gyrations are not about to let up any time soon.
This year's regular bouts of volatility mark a sharp departure from 2017 when daily stock gyrations plunged to a multi-decade low. Indeed, the S&P 500 Index is on pace for its most volatile year since 2015, Refinitiv data showed.
Persistent trade-related tensions between the United States and China, weakness in the tech sector, worries about slowing global growth and jitters about the Federal Reserve marching toward higher interest rates has taken a toll on U.S. stocks in recent weeks and the S&P 500 Index has shed all its gains for the year.
Concerns about the outcome of a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at next week's G20 summit and how it might affect the outlook for Sino-U.S. trade relations is the latest worry to be playing on options traders' minds.
Unlike in 2017, when U.S. stocks went up in almost in a straight line, options traders expect stocks to dance to a more volatile tune for the foreseeable future, analysts said.
""We have had abnormally positive conditions for the last three, five, seven years,"" said Richard Selvala, chief executive at Harvest Volatility Management LLC, in New York.
""We are transitioning to more normal conditions,"" he said.
20 IS THE NEW 10
For the last six weeks, the Cboe Volatility Index, Wall Street's so-called ""fear gauge,"" has largely stayed above 20, a level associated with heightened expectation for near-term volatility.
Expect the VIX to stay closer to the 20 level than to 10, said Selvala. Speculative positions in volatility futures backs that view.
Asset managers or institutional players, leveraged funds and other traders, who together are described as the 'buy-side,' are now net long 11,441 contracts, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission positioning data through Nov. 13. That's a sharp change from early October when they were net short nearly 90,000 contracts.
Graphic: Buy side positions in VIX futures - https://tmsnrt.rs/2QUQb5L 
Since the start of October, traders in the options market have shown a healthy appetite for defensive contracts on broad market indexes.
""It's been absolutely huge,"" said Ilya Feygin, senior strategist at WallachBeth Capital, referring to the demand for defensive contracts on the S&P 500.
""Clearly there was a lot of hedging with puts,"" said Feygin. An index put option gives the holder the right to sell the value of an underlying index at a fixed level in the future, thereby offering protection against declines in the index. Calls convey the opposite right.
Nor is the rush of activity restricted to defensive contracts. Calls are in demand as well.
""There is risk for a large up move and a down move right now, more so than normally, because of tariffs, especially around the G20 summit,"" said Vinay Viswanathan, a derivatives strategist for Macro Risk Advisors in New York.
With investors jockeying to position themselves for coming stock swings, the number of open options contracts on S&P 500 Index and its tracking fund, known as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (AX:SPY), has surged to the high-end of their respective two-year ranges, according to data from options analytics firm Trade Alert.
For S&P 500 options, implied volatility - an options-based measure of how much stocks are expected to gyrate - shows a noticeable spike contracts expiring on Dec. 7, the first weekly expiration after the conclusion of the summit, according to Trade Alert data.
It is not clear whether a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit will help sooth frayed nerves or inflame tensions further between the two countries. For now, traders see volatility as the safest bet.

""People are betting action could come in either direction,"" said Viswanathan.

668,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2018 12:17PM ET</span>",New York regulator to end supervision of Standard Chartered for compliance failings,"LONDON (Reuters) - New York's Department of Financial Services (DFS) will end a period of monitoring of  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) on Dec. 31, the DFS said on Wednesday, bringing to a close one strand of the bank's punishment for past failings in compliance controls.
Standard Chartered agreed to the supervision with the regulator in 2012 as part of a wider settlement with U.S. authorities in relation to the bank's dealings with Iran-related entities. The bank agreed an extension to that deal, which saw an independent monitor installed in the bank to check on progress in improving controls, in 2014 and again in April 2016.
That last extension was set to expire on Dec. 31 this year, but the news that there are to be no further extensions to the monitorship will be welcomed by StanChart bosses as they seek to convince U.S. authorities they have learned from past mistakes.
The bank's problems over failing in the past to prevent customers from breaching Iran-related sanctions are not over.
StanChart faces a separate investigation by U.S. authorities into the extent to which it allowed clients with Iranian interests to conduct transactions after 2007, as well as the extent to which it shared such dealings with authorities at the time of the 2012 settlement.
The end of the monitorship announced on Wednesday has no bearing on that investigation, StanChart said in a regulatory filing. 
Media reports in October said the bank could face a further $1.5 billion fine for those violations, in addition to the $667 million it paid in 2012 to settle alleged breaches between 2001 and 2007.
The reports said the fine amount was a preliminary assessment based on some of the communications between the bank and regulators.

StanChart CEO Bill Winters in an internal email to staff in October criticized media coverage of the bank's efforts to improve its controls.

PARIS (Reuters) -  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) needs 12-18 months before it can determine whether the legalization of cannabis will dent the consumption of premium spirits, the company's chief executive said on Wednesday. 
""To date there is no evidence that the legalization of cannabis will have an impact on the consumption of premium spirits. We continue to monitor it,"" Alexandre Ricard told the annual shareholders meeting. ""We must give ourselves 12-18 months to be in a position to assess it."" 
Eight U.S. states, including California and Nevada, have legalized marijuana for recreational use, and Canada became the first industrialized nation to legalize recreational cannabis last month.
Some studies show consumers would buy the drug instead of alcohol if it was freely available.
Rival Constellation Brands (N:STZ) has bought a near 10 percent stake in Canadian cannabis maker Canopy Growth Corp to take advantage of any future boom, as more jurisdictions consider legalizing the drug. 
 Coca-Cola Co  (N:KO) is also closely watching the fast-growing marijuana drinks market for a possible entry that would expand the world’s largest soft drink maker’s ambitions further away from sugary sodas.
Alexandre Ricard also told shareholders that the world's second-largest spirits market after  Diageo  (L:DGE) was working on a new three-year strategy plan. 
This comes after Pernod Ricard, which makes Absolut vodka and Martell cognac, exceeded in fiscal year 2017/18 the medium-term sales growth goals it had set in June 2015, the year Ricard took over as chairman and CEO.
Pernod Ricard delivered underlying group sales growth of 6 percent in the year ended June 30, driven by a 17 percent jump in sales in China. This compared with a medium-term target of 4-5 percent sales growth.
""Our goal is to consolidate that acceleration, to deliver a durable and profitable growth,"" Ricard told shareholders, without providing new targets.

674,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2018 11:35AM ET</span>",Italian bond yields tumble as investors hold nerve after EU budget rejection,"By Virginia Furness
LONDON (Reuters) - Italian bonds rallied on Wednesday, pushing two-year yields down as much as 23 basis points as markets shrugged off the European Commission's rejection of Rome's draft budget and focused on the possibility of compromise between the two sides.
Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini refuted a La Stampa newspaper report that he was open to reviewing the 2019 deficit of 2.4 percent of GDP, but said other aspects of the budget could be discussed.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said he was worried about Italy's bond spread over Germany and that the government would respond with reforms.
The Italy/Germany 10-year bond yield spread tightened to 313 basis points, having widened to 335 bps on Tuesday (DE10IT10=RR). It has more than doubled this year. 
""There is obviously a hint in the reports from Italy that there might be some tweaks to the budget in due course,"" said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets in London. 
""I don't think there will be substantive changes but we did have a significant selloff yesterday, so there's a better mood around bond markets today.""
The European Commission said the Italian budget does not comply with the EU debt reduction criteria and that an excessive deficit procedure is warranted.
While the euro (EUR=) briefly turned negative and Italy's benchmark stock index (FTMIB) hit a session low on the news, markets soon recovered. Italian bank shares were up 2.5 percent on the day (FTIT8300) and bond yields extended their slide. 
""We know how negotiations work in Europe and the most likely outcome in this case is that both sides agree on a compromise,"" said Jonas David, a strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management. ""We may see further negative headlines but at this stage we need to read between the headlines a bit.""
Italy's two-year bond yield fell 23 bps to touch 1.15 percent, the lowest in almost two weeks, while 10-year yields were down 13 bps, falling to about 3.49 percent (IT10YT=RR). 
Yields were set for their biggest daily drop in over three weeks, with an improvement in global risk sentiment helping equity markets to stabilize.
Italy's bond price gains also followed hefty losses on Tuesday, caused partly by a ""BTP Italia"" retail debt sale in which small investors took up just 723 million euros ($824 million) of the bonds on Monday and Tuesday. The previous such sale had received orders worth 3.7 billion euros in the first two days.
SKEPTICAL
Many remain skeptical about a sustained Italian recovery, noting Rome had made no significant changes in the revised budget it submitted to Brussels.
""We don't think they're going to budge much. There might be some word play with the Commission, but Italy is still going to run a deficit of 2.4 percent,"" said Lyn Graham Taylor, rates strategist at Rabobank.
Meanwhile, PIMCO's chief investment officer for global fixed income, Andrew Balls, said the possibility of Italy defaulting on its debt is unlikely but cannot be ruled out altogether.
As Italian yields fell, Greece's bond market also recovered slightly from a heavy selloff in the previous session, with five-year yields down 3 bps (GR5YT=RR). 
They had earlier touched the highest in more than two months, coming under pressure from renewed concern about the Greek banking sector and contagion from Italy's volatility.
The Commission said on Wednesday Athens needed to speed up implementation of reforms.
The rally in riskier euro zone bonds dented demand for safer debt, with 10-year German yields rising 2 basis points to 0.37 percent (DE10YT=RR).

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa's Competition Tribunal on Wednesday approved Sibanye-Stillwater's (J:SGLJ) takeover of troubled platinum producer  Lonmin  (L:LMI) (J:LONJ) but imposed a six-month moratorium on job cuts.
South Africa's  Sibanye  has proposed to buy Lonmin for about 285 million pounds ($365 million) to create the world's No. 2 platinum producer in a bid to ride out depressed prices for the metal.
""The public interest will be best served if a moratorium were placed on all retrenchments for a period of 6 months,"" the Tribunal, which has the final say on deals, said in a statement. 
Layoffs in South Africa are a politically sensitive issue and regulators have in the past placed caps on lay-offs as a condition of deals being approved. Unemployment in Africa's most developed economy runs at around 28 percent.
""They took into account all stakeholders but ultimately this is the right decision for the region, for Lonmin's assets and for the industry generally,"" Sibanye's spokesman James Wellsted said.
A Lonmin spokeswoman said that they were still studying the Tribunal's ruling and would comment later.
Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) president Joseph Mathunjwa, who previously said the union would consider mass action to oppose the takeover, could not immediately be reached for comment. 
Lonmin, the world's third biggest platinum producer, has burned through $1.6 billion in cash, which was raised from investors since platinum prices plunged 60 percent from their peak in 2008. But it has still struggled to fund its mines.
The Competition Commission, which has a mandate to protect employment as well as promote competition, in September recommended that the takeover be approved but imposed conditions to limit job losses.
Britain's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in June unconditionally cleared the takeover.
The markets had closed when the Tribunal released its statement.

677,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2018 11:26AM ET</span>",China and U.S. accuse each other of hypocrisy as WTO litigation begins,"By Tom Miles
GENEVA (Reuters) - The United States and China clashed on Wednesday at a World Trade Organization meeting with a U.S. envoy accusing Beijing of using the WTO to pursue ""non-market"" policies and a Chinese official saying it was Washington that was flouting the rulebook.
U.S. President Donald Trump has outraged U.S. trading partners by erecting a tariff wall against imports of steel and aluminum - justified by U.S. national security concerns - and has hit Chinese goods with huge tariffs over accusations of stealing U.S. intellectual property.
At the meeting on Wednesday, where a slew of legal disputes over Trump's trade policies entered a formal adjudication phase, U.S. Ambassador Dennis Shea said China was using the WTO to promote ""non-market"" policies, which had distorted world markets and led to massive excess capacity, especially in steel and aluminum.
The Chinese official retorted that Beijing did not want to get into a blame game and said the United States had failed to back up its ""unfounded"" claims about China's economy, which it was using to disguise its own violations of the WTO rulebook.
Both sides accused each other of hypocrisy. 
Shea said the WTO should throw out a lawsuit brought by China, along with those brought by the European Union, Canada, Mexico, Norway, Russia and Turkey, because WTO rules allowed exceptions for actions taken for national security concerns. 
""Some (WTO) members have expressed concerns that invoking the national security exception in these circumstances would undermine the international trading system. This is erroneous, and completely backwards,"" Shea said, according to a copy of his remarks provided to Reuters.
""Rather, what threatens the international trading system is that China is attempting to use the WTO dispute settlement system to prevent any action by any Member to address its unfair, trade-distorting policies.""
The United States also triggered its own litigation to contest retaliatory measures by Canada, Mexico, China and the EU, which say Trump's metal tariffs are thinly disguised U.S. protectionism. 
""The United States cannot abide this level of hypocrisy,"" a second U.S. official told the meeting.
In response to the U.S. intellectual property complaint, China's representative highlighted the fact that the WTO still had several unresolved disputes on its books, including a 2004 ruling against a U.S. violation of the WTO's agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property (TRIPS).
At the same time, the United States was suggesting its intellectual property protection was supreme. 
""That claim itself lacks the credibility given the simple fact that the U.S. has deliberately delayed the implementation in this case for more than 14 years,"" the Chinese official said. 
""China has fully complied with the TRIPS agreement while the U.S. has not. And we believe that until the U.S. faithfully and entirely honors its TRIPS obligations, the comparison suggested by the U.S. is clearly without the legal benchmark.""
The Chinese official said the United States had failed to back up its ""unfounded"" claims about China's economy, which it was using to disguise its own violations of the WTO rulebook. 

""The statement made by the U.S. reeks of hypocrisy,"" the official said.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Tenants are up in arms over the sale of apartments on the most prominent boulevard in old Communist East Germany to Berlin's largest property company, the latest in a wave of protests over skyrocketing rents in the German capital.
Deutsche Wohnen (DE:DWNG) has bought 700 flats on Karl Marx Allee, a sweeping boulevard of monumental Stalinist architecture that was one of the flagship building projects of the former German Democratic Republic after World War Two.
Deutsche Wohnen owns around 110,000 flats in the Berlin area and has been the focus of much ire over rising rents. Tenant groups want to gather 170,000 signatures needed within four months to hold a referendum with the aim of expropriating Deutsche Wohnen's property.
The seven- to nine-story apartment blocks flanking Karl Marx Allee, named after the German political philosopher who wrote ""The Communist Manifesto"" and ""Das Kapital"", were built between 1952 and 1960 in the socialist wedding-cake style.
Protesters against the sale have hung banners from one apartment silo reading ""Kommerz Allee fuer 28 Million Verhoekert An Deutsche Wohnen"" (""Capitalist Avenue - flogged to Deutsche Wohnen for 28 Million"").
A spokeswoman for Deutsche Wohnen said the company planned to keep the apartments in its portfolio and that existing rental contracts would be valid. 
For decades, residents enjoyed comparably cheap housing. But over the past decade, ultra-low interest rates, foreign investment and an influx of some 40,000 people to the capital each year have thrust up living costs.
Rents have more than doubled since 2008, according to a recent study by online housing portal immowelt.de. In April, some 10,000 people took to the streets of Berlin to protest about rising housing costs.
Last month Google (O:GOOG) shelved plans to convert a former electrical substation in the trendy Kreuzberg district into a campus following months of anti-gentrification protests.
Concern about a shortage of affordable housing prompted Berlin's mayor in August to say the state was considering barring foreign investors from buying real estate in the capital in a bid to cool the property market.
The Berlin government has introduced measures to try and curb rising rents including expanding areas that are covered by anti-speculation laws that allow the state to block private sales in favor of state-owned companies. 

The district of Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg is considering whether to execute its first right of refusal to buy one of the four apartment blocks, a spokeswoman said.

683,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2018 10:25AM ET</span>","Ryanair says not seeing any Brexit impact, well-prepared for no-deal","By Sarah Young
LONDON (Reuters) - Europe's biggest low cost airline Ryanair (I:RYA) is not seeing any impact from Brexit on demand for flights, and is prepared for a no-deal, chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs said.
Ryanair was not interested in buying British regional airline Flybe (L:FLYB), which put itself up for sale last week, he added in a press conference on Wednesday.
He reiterated comments that Ryanair, which has been hit by a series of strikes this year, would come to agreements with unions in its main markets before the end of March. 
The comments on Brexit from the Irish airline echo what smaller British rival easyJet (L:EZJ) said on Tuesday, about it being prepared for a no-deal scenario, and the uncertainty over Britain's future relationship with the European Union having no impact on ticket sales.
""The demand that's out there...is really, really strong. The European consumer, the British consumer just continues to book,"" Jacobs said. 
Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary has in the past warned that a disorderly Brexit could ground flights for a number of weeks after the UK leaves on March 29, but after reassurances on flying rights provided by the EU last week, that is no longer a risk, said Jacobs.
""If we're in a no-deal Brexit situation, flying will be fine,"" he said. 
The action Ryanair will have to take if there's no deal will be to comply with EU ownership rules. Once the UK is no longer part of the EU, the 20 percent of Ryanair shares owned by British investors will be treated differently, Jacobs said. 
He repeated the airline's plan of restricting voting rights for UK shareholders, adding that Ryanair's board and the EU had both already approved the plan. 
Like easyJet, Ryanair ruled out an interest in buying Flybe, a smaller operator which is looking for a new owner after warning that profits would be lower than expected due to recent rises in the fuel price. 
""We're not interested in Flybe,"" Jacobs said. ""It'll probably be split up and you'll probably get a few different airlines buying the various assets."" 
Ryanair's plan was predominantly for organic growth, he said. 
Referring to a wave of strikes this year which has meant thousands of canceled Ryanair flights and which it has said will dent profits, Jacobs said the airline was on track to reach agreements with its biggest unions. 

""We'll definitely have a few more big agreements in place pre-Christmas but not all. I think probably when we get to March of next year I think this will be normalized,"" he said, explaining that that meant signing agreements with all the relevant unions in its biggest markets.

684,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2018 10:05AM ET</span>",UK plans to tighten takeover rules face resistance from business,"By Ben Martin
LONDON (Reuters) - One of Britain's biggest pension funds has joined other investors, law firms and trade bodies in raising concerns about plans to give the government more power to scrutinize takeovers and other deals on security grounds, documents seen by Reuters showed.
The Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS), which owns stakes in Heathrow airport and the company behind utility Thames Water, has said it is worried that politics could influence the way future governments use the proposed powers.
Britain announced a sweeping plan in July to give the government more scope to examine deals and investments on the basis of national security, in the biggest overhaul of the rules since the Enterprise Act in 2002.
The plan would allow the UK to investigate a wide range of transactions from company takeovers and loans to sales of assets such as land and intellectual property, putting key decisions in the hands of a senior minister.
The government has said it is mainly seeking to safeguard infrastructure and technology assets with the new rules.
Reuters has reviewed 13 responses submitting during a 12-week consultation by the government. Respondents included the USS, which has 63.6 billion pounds ($81.4 billion) in assets.
""We are concerned that the interpretation and implementation of this call-in regime could evolve with the political mood of the nation and corresponding change of government and therefore lead to uncertainty,"" the USS said, although it recognized the government's need to scrutinize infrastructure deals.
The British Venture Capital Association said in its submission that it was ""concerned that the call-in power might be used for political reasons.""
Other respondents to the consultation, which closed last month, said they were worried the plan could deter foreign investment in Britain.
The government, which has yet to respond to the consultation, has not said how many submissions it received.
""These reforms are aimed solely at ensuring the government's ability to protect national security,"" a government spokesman said. ""We remain open for business and welcome foreign investment.""
Britain's move mirrors initiatives in other nations to prevent sensitive assets falling under the control of foreign powers, such as China. Such steps have been taken by Germany, Italy and the United States.
But respondents to the consultation said Britain's proposals were too broad. They also said the government had underestimated how many firms would flag up deals for security screening.
Britain has only formally intervened in deals on the grounds of national security in nine instances since 2002, according to Fingleton Associates, a firm set up by John Fingleton who ran Britain's now-defunct Office of Fair Trading.
Under the new rules, the government estimates it would screen about 200 cases a year, of which it expects 100 to face deeper examination and 50 to be blocked or face restrictions.

Law firm Herbert Smith Freehills said in its consultation submission it expected the number of reviews and interventions to be ""dramatically higher, given the numerous 'foreign-to-foreign' acquisitions with assets or business in the UK and also given the regime's reach on, for example, real property and intellectual property.""

690,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2018 09:30AM ET</span>",Foot Locker shares soar after Air Max boost,"(Reuters) -  Foot Locker  (N:FL) shares jumped 20 percent on Wednesday after third-quarter results showed shoe sales turning back to growth thanks to a boost from Nike's latest lines, heading off fears it was losing out to Amazon (O:AMZN) and other online stores.
The retailer's same-store sales from footwear climbed in the three months ended Nov. 3 after falling for six consecutive quarters, Foot Locker said, as U.S. shoppers bought Nike's new Air Max shoes.
Analysts have feared that Nike's (N:NKE) move about two years ago to begin selling via Amazon and its own stores would hurt Foot Locker and other third-party sellers which rely on relationships with manufacturers to pull shoppers.
But Tuesday's results suggested that Foot Locker's tie-up with  Nike  was intact, and even growing, leading at least seven Wall Street analysts to raise their 12-month targets on the New York-based retailer's stock price.
""Foot Locker's position continues to improve and it remains a top destination for Sneakerheads and a strong partner for multiple brands, including Nike,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Christopher Svezia said in a report.
Its ability to continue collaborating with Nike to launch products exclusively for its core shoppers is keeping sales humming, said Cristina Fernández at Telsey Advisory Group.
The two companies have tied up to improve the customer experience in stores by hiring trained associates to inform shoppers about exclusive sneaker launches by Nike.
In Los Angeles Foot Locker launched a Jumpman store with an investment from Nike's Jordan brand to house curated Jordan collections.
""I get excited about launches, but I get more excited about the collaborations that we've got with our great vendor partners,"" Richard Johnson, Foot Locker's chief executive officer, said on Tuesday's conference call with analysts.
Nike's own resurgent shoe sales, especially of Air Max shoes, is benefiting Foot Locker, Jefferies analyst Janine Stichter said.
""While we don't see the bear case around (Nike's) push toward a Consumer Direct strategy going away just yet, we do think that (Foot Locker's) commentary around the strength of their relationship with Nike should help to quell some fears,"" she said.
Stichter raised her price target on Foot Locker shares by $2 to $62. The stock was last up 15 percent at $53 in premarket trading.

If the gains hold, Foot Locker shares are on track for a five-month high, setting them on course to finish higher in 2018.

691,By Business Insider,"<span>Nov 21, 2018 09:27AM ET</span>",Take a look inside Walgreens' futuristic store where it's plotting new ways to take on Amazon and CVS,"On the edge of a suburban lot in the Chicago area, next to a Whole Foods and across the way from a Barnes & Noble (NYSE:BKS), sits a Walgreens. 
At first glance, it seems like any other drugstore. But upon closer look there are some differences.
For one, there's a large beauty section right at the front of the store. For another, candy and other tempting snacks have been relegated to the back, along with seasonal decorations. There's more over-the-counter medications, supplements, and toiletries in the first few aisles, too. 
Another big change: the store offers lots of health services, such as hearing screenings, eye exams, and  lab tests.
 Walgreens is using this store — not more than half a mile from its corporate headquarters — as its pilot for what future pharmacies might look like around the US. In a world where more and more shopping happens online, Walgreens is  trying to figure out what it'll take to get you to visit one of its 9,560 US stores.
""We're in transformation mode,"" Richard Ashworth, Walgreens' president of operations told Business Insider. 
Ashworth is doing all this to keep up with customer behavior, which has been changing much faster than it has in past decades. From 2010-2018, he said, ""Everything has changed."" 
Ashworth says customers want to be able to shop more quickly and conveniently. And they're making lots of their purchases online, and having them delivered.
Walgreens is up against stiff competition for customers, facing off against the  likes of Amazon, which is getting into the pharmacy business through its  acquisition of online pharmacy PillPack,  CVS Health (NYSE:CVS), which is making a big bet on the healthcare aspect of its business through the pending acquisition of insurer Aetna (NYSE:AET), and of course retail giant  Walmart (NYSE:WMT).
For its part, Walgreens might be looking to strike up a closer relationship with a health insurer as well. On Tuesday,  The Wall Street Journal reported that Walgreens and Humana (NYSE:HUM) were considering taking equity stakes in one another. Walgreens is already partnering with Humana to run primary care clinics out of some of its stores in the  Kansas City area. 
""The pharmacy business model is under more direct attack from disruptive players than are health plans,"" Jefferies analyst Brian Tanquilut noted Wednesday. A stronger partnership with Humana, he said, could help Walgreens with its market share, while Humana could benefit from better branding and marketing that comes from being seen inside the retail pharmacy. 
Read more:  Amazon beat out Walmart in a deal for a small pharmacy startup — and it shows just how intense the rivalry’s gotten
The pharmacy giant is hanging on — the stock of its parent company is up  5.6% over 2018. But same-store sales of things like snacks, toothbrushes and laundry detergent were down 1.9% in the company's fiscal fourth quarter. Prescription-drug sales did better, up 1.3%.
As competition heats up, Ashworth has faith that going to an actual store will still be a part of that picture. 
""I think customers very much will enjoy brick and mortar retailing if we make it modern and experiential,"" Ashworth said. 
On the left side of the store as I walked in, I was greeted by a make-up display presenting kits filled with bath bombs, brushes, and lip balm. There's a designated beauty consultant who staffs the section. Across they US, Walgreens has hired 3,500 beauty consultants, Ashworth said. 
On the right side, next to a FedEx (NYSE:FDX) counter, was an optical store. There, I could browse for eyeglasses or pop into an eye exam room. The optometrist had previously worked at the  Sears Optical in Niles, Illinois. That Sears is among the locations  the company announced in October it would close. 
There was a place to get lab results as well. In October, Walgreens made an agreement with lab-testing giant  LabCorp to open at least 600 locations. 
All of the health services — including lab services, the pharmacy, and optical — are nestled under what Walgreens calls its health corner alongside a hearing station. Within the hearing station is a room built to test how well people can hear, which could dictate whether they might need a hearing aid. 
The pharmacy counter is in the back right corner, which looked standard apart from the express lane. Through the Walgreens app, you're able to check out remotely and then scan the QR code for a quicker check-out process. Here's a closer look at the counter:
As for whether it'll all look like the storefront in Deerfield, Illinois: ""Jury’s not out on that,"" Ashworth said. What works for one community might not work for another."
692,By Business Insider,"<span>Nov 21, 2018 09:25AM ET</span>",Elon Musk's SpaceX is the latest big tech company to tap the risky leveraged loan market,"Elon Musk is loving high yield debt.
SpaceX took a leveraged loan worth $250 million on Monday, having initially sought to borrow as much as $750 million,  according to numerous reports. The smaller loan was taken as a result of deteriorating credit conditions during the fundraising period.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) led the financing which will help fund SpaceX's push into sending astronauts into space and eventually humans to Mars. The loan had previously been led by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), who helped take Tesla public, before rejected the proposed terms regarding future debt funding.
Previous private equity funding valued SpaceX at more than $20 billion, but loan investors were wary of the company's record of burning cash as it seeks to expand its  operations. 
The leveraged loan market has expanded dramatically in recent years into a $1.6 trillion industry. Doubts have been raised about the quality of these deals by former Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen and the IMF this year as companies pile on more and more debt.
Another of Musk's companies, Tesla, also tapped the high yield market earlier this year. Other major tech companies Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Uber, and WeWork have also expanded into leveraged financing in the past 18 months. 
Space X's seven-year loan was issued at 99 cents on the dollar with a coupon of 4.25% — a higher interest rate than previously expected. Investors committed $750 million forward for the loan, suggesting interest was still strong in providing funding despite renewed concerns about leveraged loans, although SpaceX eventually took the smaller amount.
The S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index saw the average price of loans fall 0.3% in the past week indicating investors see the product as more risky. 
Musk has become a controversial figure for investors due to his often  volatile behaviour, according to the Wall Street Journal. The SpaceX chief executive, who is also CEO of Tesla, mocked the SEC earlier this year after it  settled a lawsuit against him following a tweet claiming he had secured funding to take Tesla private.
SpaceX's current business model involves sending commercial and government satellites into space. However it's opportunities could be diminished following news that NASA, which has contracted the company to fly astronauts to the International Space Station, will launch a safety review of the company, according to the  Washington Post. 
Earlier this year, SpaceX was shut out of a U.S. Air Force contracts worth more than $2 billion to develop boosters for US military and spy satellites in the mid-2020s.
Musk's company is planning to launch thousands of satellites to cover the Earth with internet access while SpaceX has also introduced a  larger rocket, called BFR, in 2016 with test flights set to begin next year. "

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Deere & Co gave an underwhelming earnings forecast on Wednesday for fiscal 2019 after missing quarterly profit estimates amid a U.S. trade battle with China that has depressed U.S. farm commodity prices and hurt farm equipment demand.
The Moline, Illinois-based tractor maker expects net income of about $3.6 billion in 2019. That would translate into earnings of $11.10 per share, compared with the average analyst estimate of $11.47, according to Refinitiv data.
Equipment sales for the world's largest tractor manufacturer are estimated to grow 7 percent on the year in 2019 compared with a 29 percent jump in fiscal 2018, which ended Oct. 28.
Stephen Volkmann, an equity analyst with Jefferies, said the earnings forecast reflected the potential impact of the tit-for-tat tariff war between the world's two largest economies.
""It could well be that we are now starting to see some impact of those (trade) concerns,"" Volkmann said.
Deere reported an adjusted profit in the fourth quarter through Oct. 28 of $2.30 per share, lower than Refinitiv's estimates for $2.45, as equipment sales growth halved from the previous quarter.
Agriculture and turf equipment sales rose 3 percent in the quarter, compared with 18 percent in the third quarter.
Shares slipped 2.8 percent in light premarket trading. The stock has fallen over 19 percent since late January.
The U.S. trade showdown with China, one of the biggest export markets for U.S. agricultural products, is further squeezing American farmers whose incomes have been under a siege for the past four years amid a global grain glut.
Last year, China imported 32 million tons of soybeans from the United States. But this year, the country has not purchased any of the U.S. crop after Beijing slapped a 25 percent tariff on U.S. imports in July. The move was in retaliation for U.S. duties on Chinese goods, imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump.
There has been growing concern that depressed bean prices could induce a significant switch of acreage into other crops next year, causing a supply glut that could, in turn, hurt the prices of other farm commodities.
On Wednesday, Deere moderated its previous expectations, projecting farm cash receipts to remain flat. It had earlier been hopeful that stronger demand for crops like corn, wheat and cotton would mitigate the impact of the trade battle and boost U.S. farm cash receipts in 2019.
Deere said industry sales of agricultural equipment in North America - its biggest market - were expected to be flat to up 5 percent next year, compared with a 10 percent estimated increase for 2018.
Its global sales for agriculture and turf equipment are projected to rise 3 percent in 2019, significantly slower than a 15 percent year-on-year jump this year.

Competition has eaten into LATAM's margins, prompting the airline to announce it had renegotiated commitments for future aircraft purchases, achieving a reduction of $2.3 billion in fleet expenses through 2021, according to a securities filing.
""It's been a few years since the last time the company made such a big effort into adjusting our plans,"" said Ramiro Alfonsin, LATAM's vice president for corporate finance.

Trafigura granted extra cash to keep Nyrstar running smoothly as the company, the world’s second-largest zinc producer, faced a crisis over its massive debt burden. Analysts said the deal alleviates some of the short-term pressure on Nyrstar and makes a debt restructuring more likely in the future.
“The liquidity situation seems very critical and this is indeed a lifeline,” said Philip Ngotho, an analyst at ABN Amro NV. “For the zinc market, this is good. But for bondholders and shareholders, it doesn’t really change the story.""
Nyrstar bonds plunged after Trafigura said the money can’t be used to repay debt. Trafigura also secured the new lending against fixed assets of the zinc producer, potentially hurting the chance of bondholders recovering money in the event of a default.
The company’s bond due in September 2019 fell 6 cents on the euro to 48 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The shares had the opposite reaction, jumping 20 cents to 98 euro cents in Brussels trading.
Here are some key points on the deal:
1) Trafigura is tightening its grip on Nyrstar.
Trafigura is closely entwined with Nyrstar -- it’s the biggest shareholder and has a key zinc supply deal with the company. Today’s rescue package further strengthens the relationship.
With its 11th hour rescue, Trafigura is helping to ensure that Nyrstar can keep the metal flowing under its supply deal. In the event of a default, it may also have a claim to key assets, giving it a leg up on other creditors.
""What is material in my view is that Trafigura gets additional collateral over Nyrstar assets,” said Stijn Demeester, an analyst at ING Bank. “That puts them alongside junior bondholders, and the reaction of the bond market this morning is more representative of how we should interpret this news.""
2) The shares will still likely get wiped out.
Even though the shares rebounded today, analysts were unanimous in saying that they’ll eventually be worthless and Nyrstar is still on the path to a debt restructuring.
3) Nyrstar was in a cash squeeze.
In the statement today, the company hinted it was in desperate need of Trafigura’s money. The zinc producer said its liquidity position has worsened since the end of the third quarter, restricting the cash needed to fund its day-to-day operations.
4) Here’s how the deal works:
Trafigura extended additional working capital to Nyrstar from Nov. 30 and will make $220 million of financing available to cover the company in the next nine days. The $650 million facility is secured against fixed assets, inventories and shares in subsidiaries.
5) It’s expensive money.
The main part of the new larger facility will cost Libor plus 5 percent. That compares with Libor plus 4 percent for a previous $250 million capital facility that Trafigura had granted Nyrstar.

705,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2018 06:10AM ET</span>",Wells Fargo fights to leave customers out of auto payout plan,"By Patrick Rucker and Imani Moise
WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) is fighting to shut some customers out of a sweeping plan to compensate around 600,000 drivers it pushed into car insurance they did not need, according to court documents and a source familiar with the effort.    
U.S. regulators fined Wells Fargo $1 billion in April over the insurance program and told the bank to compensate drivers who were harmed. Those drivers are also suing Wells Fargo in a federal court in California for more compensation that the bank is willing to pay.
The faulty insurance program ran from 2002 to 2016 but the bank only intends to compensate drivers forced into policies from 2005 onwards, Wells Fargo has told the federal judge overseeing the case.
Wells Fargo's reluctance to compensate all drivers contradicts its pledge to help every customer who was hurt and that could intensify scrutiny of the scandal-plagued bank.
Lawyers for the drivers have argued that the compensation plan should cover the entire life of the insurance program but the bank is not persuaded, according to court documents obtained by Reuters.
""There's no credible reason why you don't go back to the inception of the program,"" Roland Tellis, an attorney for the drivers, said at an August hearing.
Tellis did not respond to requests for further comment.
Tim Sloan, Wells Fargo's chief executive, told lawmakers last year that the bank was ""working diligently to make things right for every customer who was harmed.""
But a lawyer for the bank argued at the same court hearing that it has already ""compromised"" by allowing payouts from 2005 to 2016, according to the official court transcript.
Wells Fargo has records from the first three years of the insurance program but those are held in a separate database to the 2005-2016 files, the lawyer said. He did not explain why the bank did not wish to access the earlier database and the bank declined to elaborate when contacted by Reuters.
Any driver who believes that he or she was hurt in the insurance program can contact the bank directly and make a claim, a spokeswoman for the bank said. 
""We invite them to reach out to us with their insurance information,"" Wells Fargo said in a statement to Reuters.
Tellis and other lawyers want a payout exceeding three times what drivers were charged, which could add costs and uncertainty to a scandal that continues to worry investors.
The final terms of the private litigation could affect the ongoing remediation plan the bank agreed with federal regulators.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) allowed the bank to limit its payout plan to the 2005-2016 time frame in its April settlement with the bank. A spokesman for the bureau declined to comment on the scope of the payout plan.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which had a part in the April fine, declined to comment. The OCC's settlement did not set a specific time frame for payouts. 

Over the summer, the OCC rejected the bank's plan to repay customers with Joseph Otting, head of the OCC, telling lawmakers in October that he was ""not comfortable"" with the bank's effort.

706,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2018 05:53AM ET</span>",Nissan wants less clout from Renault as Japan seeks to stabilize alliance,"By Daniel Leussink and Sam Nussey
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan said it is ready to work for the stability of the Nissan-Renault global alliance following the stunning arrest of common Chairman Carlos Ghosn, but a Nissan executive said the Japanese automaker is seeking ways to weaken the influence of its French partner.
The 19-year alliance, enlarged in 2016 to include Japan's Mitsubishi Motors, has been jolted by Monday's arrest of Ghosn for alleged financial misconduct. Ghosn has personally shaped the alliance and had pledged to consolidate it with a deeper tie-up. 
""We need to return to the original idea of a win-win relationship,"" a long-time Nissan executive told reporters, speaking on condition of anonymity. It should be ""a more equal relationship than before."" 
A reduction of Renault's stake in Nissan - which recovered from near-bankruptcy after Ghosn took its helm and has become more profitable than its French partner - should be one option under consideration, the Nissan executive said.
The French automaker currently owns 43.4 percent of Nissan, which in turn holds a non-voting 15 percent stake in  Renault  (PA:RENA) and 34 percent of Mitsubishi Motors. 
One of the world's best-known auto industry executives, Ghosn bestrode the alliance, serving also as chief executive of Renault and chairman of Mitsubishi Motors, although his efforts to drive integration were hampered by the French government's 15 percent stake in Renault.
On Monday Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa portrayed Nissan as a victim of Ghosn's alleged misdeeds. But Nissan itself faces scrutiny over the financial misconduct case, with the Asahi newspaper reporting on Wednesday prosecutors are weighing bringing a case against the Japanese automaker.
With Ghosn potentially gone from the picture, the future shape of the alliance is the subject of intense investor speculation. Mitsubishi Motors CEO Osamu Masuko said on Tuesday it may be hard to manage without the unifying figure of Ghosn.
The success of the alliance, which helps the automakers develop products and control costs, is critical for the members at a time when the industry is buffeted by major changes in consumer tastes and rivals are investing billions in new growth areas like automated and internet-connected vehicles.
Given those considerations, the Japanese and French governments have backed the alliance and called for its stability in the aftermath of Ghosn's arrest.
Japan said on Wednesday it was ready to support the alliance. It ""is a symbol of Franco-Japanese industrial success,"" the top government spokesman said, calling for a ""stable relationship"" between the three automakers.
WHISTLEBLOWER
Nissan said on Monday an internal investigation triggered by a tip-off from a whistleblower had revealed that Ghosn engaged in wrongdoing including personal use of company money and under-reporting for years how much he was earning. It plans to remove him from the post on Thursday.
Ghosn, 64, was arrested by Japanese prosecutors who said he and Representative Director Greg Kelly conspired to understate Ghosn's compensation at Nissan over five years starting in fiscal 2010 as being about half of the actual 10 billion yen ($88.65 million).
Ghosn and Kelly, who has also been arrested, have not commented on the accusations so far and Reuters has not been able to reach them.
Kyodo News reported on Wednesday that the Tokyo District Court has decided that Ghosn and Kelly will be detained for 10 days.
Japan's Nikkei business daily reported on Tuesday that Ghosn had received share price-linked compensation of about 4 billion yen over a five-year period to March 2015 but that it went unreported in Nissan's financial statements. 
Prosecutors also plan to interview Saikawa on a voluntary basis, NHK reported on Wednesday citing unnamed sources. 
Prosecutors were not immediately able to comment. A Nissan spokesman declined to comment.
Renault on Tuesday tapped its chief operating officer and a senior board member to fill in for Ghosn, but the board refrained from firing him while waiting for details on the allegations - a decision that could buy more time for an accelerated, permanent succession process.
Shares in Nissan closed up 0.4 percent on Wednesday after falling nearly 6 percent a day earlier. Mitsubishi Motors closed down 1 percent after losing nearly 7 percent on Tuesday.

The sell-off that started in October is not the end of the bull market and investors should continue to fight the urge to overreact to negative headlines, wrote Darrell Cronk, president of the bank’s Investment Institute and team, in a note to clients Tuesday.
“We view now as a time to be ready to increase equity exposure in favorable areas, such as U.S. large-cap, U.S. mid-cap and emerging-market equities, and favor deploying cash now or even allocating incrementally over the coming days and weeks,” the strategists said. “Current conditions have the potential to create some of the best entry points into equity markets since the Nov. 2016 elections.”
A slump in U.S. technology stocks, emerging signs of stress in the corporate credit market and diminishing hopes for a resolution to the ongoing Sino-American trade dispute have renewed last month’s sell-off in global equity benchmarks. The S&P 500 briefly slid 10 percent below its September record close on Tuesday before clawing back just above the threshold.
The WFII team isn’t the only one looking for a recovery in U.S. stocks. Strategists at JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). were confident last week the S&P 500 would recoup its October losses. Still, their competitors at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). were less optimistic, recommending investors dial back on risk and increase their cash positions in a note to clients Monday.
While Wells Fargo would be concerned if the S&P 500 fell below its lows from October and the first quarter, the U.S. economic outlook remains solid and the Federal Reserve will stay flexible, the strategists said. In addition, the sharp decline in valuation multiples for previously high-flying tech shares suggest the worst of the sell-off may be over, they added.
“Concerns about a global growth slowdown are pulling down strong U.S. growth and investor sentiment,” they said. “The bottom line in our opinion, is that an economic recession is not imminent, even as many areas of financial markets are pricing like we are heading for one.”

BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. chipmaker  Nvidia Corp  (O:NVDA) has signed separate deals with Chinese electric vehicle startups XPeng Motors, Singulato Motors and SF Motors to develop autonomous driving technology, Chief Executive Jensen Huang said on Wednesday.
Huang, speaking at an event in the eastern Chinese city of Suzhou, said XPeng and Singulato will use Nvidia's artificial intelligence (AI) driving chip Xavier and its computing platform to develop hardware for autonomous driving, a strategic technology area in which China's leaders want to compete globally.
The companies separately said they will work on a series of projects from data collection to machine learning.
XPeng, in a statement, said it plans to implement level 3 intelligent driving features in its vehicles starting in 2020 using customized software and hardware developed with Nvidia and Huizhou Desay SV Automotive Co Ltd (SZ:002920).
Level 3 in autonomous driving technology refers to drivers being able to turn their attention away from driving tasks but still requires them to respond immediately in some scenarios.
Singulato said it will use Nvidia's Xavier platform to develop level 3 self-driving systems and eventually upgrade to level 4, in which vehicles are able to drive completely autonomously in most, but not all, conditions.
SF Motors, based in Silicon Valley in the United States, said it plans to launch its first electric crossover vehicle next year, and will develop its next-generation autonomous platform using Xavier.

Xavier is an artificial intelligence computing system-on-chip released by Nvidia earlier this year. Automakers using the chip can add specific software to adapt their vehicles to local traffic and infrastructure situations, Nvidia said.

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks attempted to steady on Wednesday following a bruising Wall Street session that wiped $1 trillion off the value of leading U.S. tech shares, while oil prices staged a modest rebound after slumping to one-year lows.
U.S. shares were set to open sharply firmer, futures indicated, after two days of losses that wiped out the S&P500's gains for the year and left the tech-heavy Nasdaq index teetering on the brink of falling into the red. 
Losses have been concentrated in the technology sector, as investors lightened holdings of FAANG shares -- Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) -- the group that had propelled the Wall Street's decade-long bull market.
The falls saw the Nasdaq index touch seven-month lows and energy shares too had dropped in line with a 6 percent oil price slump S&P 500 .
That fed through to Asia on Wednesday, taking MSCI's index of ex-Japan Asia-Pacific shares almost half a percent lower, but it clawed back some of those falls to trade flat by 0900 GMT. MSCI's all-country benchmark was flat too, attempting to snap two days of falls.
That, alongside a 1.5 percent bounce in Brent crude futures and some optimism over Italy's budget stance, helped European equities open 0.4 percent higher, with a tech index up half a percent.
David Vickers, senior portfolio manager at Russell Investments, noted however that gloom has tended to deepen as the Wall Street session progresses and more company earnings emerge.
""High-flying momentum stocks have come off in a fairly spectacular fashion. At one point Apple and Amazon accounted for 40 percent of U.S. equity gains and people were just recycling money into the winners,"" Vickers said.
""That's come off the boil and set the cat among the pigeons... We've seen a lot of reflexivity, when selling begets selling, the market starts to turn over, people take profits, it leads to another leg down and so on.""
Markets also appear to be preparing for a loss of momentum in global economic growth as China takes a hit from Washington's trade tariffs and the United States comes off the sugar-high of President Donald Trump's tax cuts. 
Graphic: Third-quarter earnings as of Nov 20 - https://tmsnrt.rs/2PDCn30
Vickers said that after 20 percent-plus earnings growth at U.S. companies, some investors were disappointed with signs this would slow to single digits as the stimulus effect wore off.
""If you have a market like the S&P500, which is two standard deviations expensive, it becomes difficult if you don't think you will get the same kinds of earnings growth in future,"" he added.
The growth concerns have also been revived by comments from U.S. Federal Reserve officials who suggested economic outlook concerns could slow the pace of its monetary policy tightening cycle or even end it. 
The comments have knocked U.S. 10-year bond yields to near two-month lows around 3.03 percent, after trading above 3.25 percent at the start of November.
But the recovery in global sentiment allowed yields to rise around three bps to 3.08 percent while the dollar's index, which had jumped 0.7 percent on Tuesday, slipped 0.2 percent.
The euro rose after a 0.75 percent drop on Tuesday, buoyed by reports that Italy may be open to reviewing its draft budget for 2019, possibly easing a confrontation with the European Union. The League party, part of the ruling coalition, later denied the report.
Italians bond yields fell up to 16 basis points initially, putting 10-year yields on track for their biggest daily drop in almost a month but the market gave up some of its gains after the denials.
Graphic: Third-quarter earnings as of Nov 20 - https://tmsnrt.rs/2PDCn30
Italian bank shares too eased off session highs but were still up 2 percent on the day after sinking to two-year lows on Tuesday. 
Focus is now on the European Commission which should take the first step on Wednesday towards disciplining Italy over its draft fiscal plan.
""This procedure will take several months, but stands to keep (government bonds) and the Italian banking sector under pressure. Favor euro underperformance in Europe and probably further choppy euro-dollar trading in a $1.1350-$1.1450 range,"" ING Bank analysts told clients. 
Oil's bounce helped commodity currencies such as the Australian dollar and Norwegian crown, which recovered around 0.4 percent versus the dollar after heavy recent slides.

SEOUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors are investigating if  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380) and affiliate Kia Motors' (KS:000270) vehicle recalls over engine defects were conducted properly, according to a person with knowledge of the matter and documents reviewed by Reuters.
The South Korean firms, together the world's No.5 automaker, recalled nearly 1.7 million vehicles in 2015 and 2017 in the United States in one of their biggest recalls in the country, citing an engine failure that increases the risk of a crash.
The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York (SDNY), part of the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ), has launched a criminal investigation, the person told Reuters.
It remains to be seen whether the probe will lead to charges, the person added. If criminal charges are filed, it could lead to hefty fines for Hyundai and Kia.
The DoJ is coordinating with the U.S. transport regulator, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), on the investigation, the person said, asking not to be identified as the matter is confidential.
Nicole Navas Oxman, a DoJ spokeswoman, declined to comment.
""The Justice Department generally does not confirm, deny or otherwise comment on the existence or non-existence of an investigation,"" she said in an emailed statement to Reuters.
The United States has previously investigated and imposed strict penalties on other automakers such as Toyota Motor (T:7203) and Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p).
In 2017, a U.S. judge dismissed a criminal charge against Toyota https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-toyota/u-s-judge-dismisses-criminal-charge-in-toyota-sudden-acceleration-case-idUSKBN1CA2R2 after it completed three years of monitoring under a $1.2 billion settlement in which it admitted to misleading the public about sudden unintended acceleration in its vehicles.
The settlement was the largest penalty levied by the United States on an auto company until Volkswagen admitted to diesel emissions fraud and paid $4.3 billion in fines in 2017.
Apart from the SDNY probe, Hyundai and Kia are also the subject of an investigation by NHTSA into whether their recalls covered enough vehicles and were conducted in a timely manner.
NHTSA has ""active"" investigations into engine issues related to certain Hyundai and Kia vehicles, the regulator told Reuters.
""These investigations are ongoing - no final conclusions have been reached,"" it added.
Hyundai declined to comment on the SDNY probe.
PROBE TO EXACERBATE WOES
An investigation by U.S. prosecutors will add to Hyundai and Kia's woes at a time when they are grappling with sluggish sales in the United States and China.
The pair have already set aside roughly 1 trillion won ($885 million) in 2017 and 2018 to cover costs mainly stemming from recalls over engine problems.
In the United States, Hyundai recalled 470,000 Sonata sedans in 2015 due to the failure of ""Theta II"" engines. In 2017, it expanded its U.S. recall to 572,000 Sonata and Santa Fe sport utility vehicles, citing the same engine issue, the NHTSA said.
Kia also recalled 618,160 Optima, Sorento and Sportage vehicles which use the same engine in the United States.
However, Kim Gwang-ho, an engineer at Hyundai and a company veteran of 26 years, told NHTSA that the companies should have recalled more vehicles in 2015, citing an internal report.

715,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2018 03:50AM ET</span>","Japan threatens to cut solar power subsidies, angering investors","By Aaron Sheldrick and Osamu Tsukimori
TOKYO (Reuters) - The Japanese government is threatening to cut existing solar power project subsidies angering the power producers and investors that say the cuts will undermine their profitability and violate earlier agreements. 
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) last month proposed that companies granted permits for solar projects between the fiscal years of 2012 to 2014 under so-called Feed-In-Tariffs that guarantee minimum power prices submit applications by March 2019 to connect to the grid.
Companies that miss the deadline will see their price guarantees under the tariffs of 32 to 40 yen ($0.28 to $0.36) per kilowatt hour (kWh) cut to 21 yen per kWh. Public comments for the proposal are due by Wednesday. 
Japan introduced the FIT to spur solar developments to fill the power gap after the country closed its nuclear power plants following the 2011 Fukushima disaster. Japan's FIT levels are among the highest in the world, compared to $0.19 per kWh in Germany and at least as much as those in Spain.
METI has said the cuts are necessary to reduce the public burden of the FIT subsidies, which are added to consumers bills. At the same time, METI is likely unhappy with the amount of unfilled permits. Data from the ministry shows 23 percent of the total capacity approved in fiscal year 2012 is not operating, with 49 percent approved in 2013 and 59 percent approved in 2014 also not operating. 
Investors and operators in solar projects are angry with the proposals, threatening lawsuits against the government for breaching the earlier contracts. A similar decision by Spain in 2013 led to compensation payments to investors.
""Litigation will inevitably ensue from Japan and abroad, and it will be difficult to convince the public that there is no risk of the government losing when the proposed changes so blatantly disregard the foundations of the FIT scheme,"" according to a note to clients from law firm Orrick reviewed by Reuters. Orrick confirmed the authenticity of the document.
METI estimates show the subsidy cut could affect 23.5 gigawatts (GW) of solar capacity, or nearly 44 percent of the amount the government approved in the three-year period after the FIT scheme was created in 2012.
Japan's total installed power capacity is around 250 GW, with 44 GW coming from solar.
""The suddenness of the proposal, its almost immediate implementation, and ambiguity around implementation could put future and existing investments at risk,"" said a group of business lobbying groups in Japan from the United States, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Canada in a statement on Friday. 
The changes could also ""undermine market participants' confidence in the security, stability, and predictability of Japanese market rules,"" the groups said.
Beyond Japanese investors, BlackRock and Goldman Sachs group's (N:GS) Japan Renewable Energy are among the biggest investors in the solar sector in Japan.
BlackRock declined to comment, and Japan Renewable Energy could not immediately comment.

An official who declined to be identified from a Japanese renewable power producer that submitted comments to METI said that some operators with bad intent have deliberately delayed projects. However, she argued that large-scale solar projects do take a significant amount of time to push forward because of environmental mitigation measures and discussions with nearby landowners. 
The company told METI a unilateral schedule for automatic cuts is hard to deal with. 
Several investors and lawyers involved said the changes will likely see many projects canceled.
Banks that have built up project finance teams to handle the billions of dollars of investment that has flowed into renewables in Japan have stopped or cut funding for projects, one investor said.
The investor spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The Japanese Bankers Association requested that projects which already have signed loan contracts be exempted from the new rule, saying that a significant reduction in FIT price would threaten default on payments, it said in its comments to METI.

The STOXX 600 (STOXX) rose 0.5 percent in early trading, on course to snap a five-day losing streak that pushed the pan-European benchmark close to the nearly two-year low hit last month. 
Germany's DAX (GDAXI) index rose 0.9 percent and London's FTSE 100 (FTSE) added 0.3 percent.
Italian banks (FTIT8300) rose 2.5 percent after a report said Italy's deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini may be open to review the government's 2019 budget, fuelling hopes the country could avert a clash with the European Commission.
""This suggests an increased likelihood of an agreement and no excessive deficit procedure,"" said AFS Group analyst Arne Petimezas. The EU is set to take the first step on Wednesday toward disciplining Italy over its draft fiscal plan. 
The broader European banking index (SX7P) was the biggest sectoral gainer in early morning trading, up 1 percent, while tech stocks (SX8P) advanced 0.4 percent. 
Even though the rebound was broad-based with most sectors trading in positive territory, investors remained cautious over the outlook for the market due to lingering concerns over slowing economic and earnings growth.
Elsewhere, corporate updates triggered sharp share price moves. Babcock (L:BAB) plummeted 12 percent after the British defense contractor took a one-off charge of 120 million pounds to reshape its business and warned that revenue from its nuclear decommissioning division would drop more than expected.

718,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2018 03:30AM ET</span>",Airbus names new finance and operations chiefs as overhaul continues,"By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) on Wednesday set in place the financial and operational pillars of a soon-to-be completely overhauled leadership as it emerges from months of internal strife caused by legal problems and delays in meeting record output goals.
The European planemaker named Dominik Asam, the finance director of German chipmaker Infineon Technologies (DE:IFXGn), as its next chief financial officer to replace fellow German Harald Wihelm, who already plans to step down next year.
Asam, an engineer who is also a former Siemens executive and began his career at investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), will join the on April 1, 2019, Airbus said in a statement. Wilhelm will stay in his role until the annual shareholder meeting 10 days later.
Airbus also appointed Bosch appliances executive Michael Schoellhorn as the new chief operating officer for its commercial aircraft business, replacing veteran troubleshooter Tom Williams (NYSE:WMB) who is due to retire at the end of this year. 
Schoellhorn is currently chief operating officer of Bosch subsidiary BSH Home Appliances, which makes washing machines under the Bosch and Siemens brands.
Airbus highlighted his experience in digital manufacturing techniques that the planemaker is boosting in its factories.
Chief Executive Tom Enders paid tribute to Williams, an industry veteran of 50 years who has been seen as one of the most dependable internal voices as the company targets an ambitious ramp-up in production to meet soaring jet demand.
The plans have been derailed by engine problems as well as quality problems at a plant in Hamburg, industry sources say.
Reuters reported on Tuesday that Airbus was poised to make top financial and operational appointments as incoming CEO Guillaume Faury tightens his grip after months of turmoil over corruption investigations and output delays. 
Wilhelm's decision in May to stand down was seen as a surprise after he ended payments to middlemen and opened the door to ongoing fraud investigations. He had shaped a more market-friendly stance and pushed a leaner corporate structure.
Although Wilhelm has not been accused of wrongdoing,, sources have said his exit reflects a board-driven clearout designed to present a new face to UK and French investigators.
Airbus shares stood 0.5 percent higher in early session trading.
Reuters reported last month that Wilhelm would be replaced by a fellow German from outside the group.
CEO Enders also steps down in April next year and the company is due to appoint a new chairman in 2020.
The appointments came weeks after Infineon Technologies took a new multi-million euro provision to cover the cost of a possible settlement with the administrator of its former memory chip unit Qimonda, sending its shares lower.

Infineon's chips activate car accessories and cut vehicle emissions, making the company - which was spun off from engineering conglomerate Siemens in 1999 - exposed to trade friction and shifts in the economy in the same way as Airbus, whose main competitor is U.S. planemaker Boeing (N:BA).

720,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 21, 2018 02:41AM ET</span>",Renault Names Bollore Interim CEO as Nissan Tension Deepens,"(Bloomberg) -- Tensions between Nissan Motor Co. and  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) over the future of their car-making partnership have exploded into the open as the downfall of Chairman Carlos Ghosn roils the automotive industry and top lieutenant, Hiroto Saikawa, moves to consolidate power in his absence.
The two companies, which are connected via a complex structure of cross-shareholdings and joint manufacturing, have drastically differed in their reactions to Ghosn’s arrest in Japan on suspicion of financial offenses.
Tuesday night in Paris, Renault’s board stopped short of firing the French-Brazilian executive, and asked Nissan to hand over details of his alleged misdeeds. Nissan, by contrast, said after he was detained on Monday that it intends to dismiss Ghosn, 64, as chairman -- acting with a haste that’s fueled open speculation that he was the victim of a coup by Saikawa, who serves as Nissan’s chief executive officer, and others opposed to deeper integration between the two companies.
Nissan’s board will meet on Thursday to make a formal decision on Ghosn’s future.
For its part, Renault’s board indicated that it was in the dark about the details of the allegations against Ghosn. “At this stage, the board is unable to comment on the evidence seemingly gathered against Mr. Ghosn by Nissan and the Japanese judicial authorities,” it said in a statement.
No Bail
Ghosn, who was among the best-paid executives in both France and Japan, stands accused of under-reporting income of about $44 million and misusing company funds at Nissan. According to NHK, Nissan paid ""huge sums"" toward Ghosn’s residences in four global cities, payments that the broadcaster said lacked a business justification, and also covered the cost of vacations for his family. Ghosn hasn’t commented on any of the allegations, or been seen in public since his arrest.
“Japan will not tolerate executive greed. And enriching for your own personal wealth -- and this superstar mentality where the CEO gets paid 20, 25 times what the average worker gets paid -- Japan does not want to tolerate,"" Jesper Koll, the CEO of fund manager WisdomTree Investments, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “There’s no question Carlos Ghosn is being used as a symbol to ensure that corporate leadership in Japan will stay close to its workers.”
Japan’s legal system is opaque even to locals, and basic details of Ghosn’s location and immediate future are unknown, although he’s likely at a detention facility in northern Tokyo. Bail cannot be granted until prosecutors decide whether to proceed with an indictment, a process that could take weeks, and Ghosn won’t necessarily be joined by an attorney when he’s questioned during that time. Prosecutors on Wednesday received court approval to hold Ghosn for another 10 days, the Kyodo newswire reported.
Partnership Tensions
More than Ghosn’s personal future is at stake.
The charismatic executive led both Nissan and Renault as well as their wider alliance, which unites the iconic French and Japanese companies with the smaller Mitsubishi Motors Corp. He had worked toward a merger of Nissan and Renault to solidify their two-decade-old relationship, a union that would create a direct rival to Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG and Toyota Motor Corp. for the title of the world’s largest automaker.
But Saikawa publicly played down that prospect earlier this year, prompting a private rebuke from Ghosn, his one-time mentor, who warned his Japanese colleague that his comments risked undermining Nissan’s credibility, according to a person with knowledge of the exchange.
Saikawa has so far been the face of Nissan’s reaction to Ghosn’s arrest, appearing alone at a press conference late Monday where he announced Nissan’s plan to fire him. He had harsh words for the detained boss. “This is an act that cannot be tolerated by our company,” Saikawa said, arguing that an excessive concentration of power in Ghosn’s hands created an environment ripe for misconduct.
Nissan Vote
Saikawa’s influence at Nissan will grow in Ghosn’s absence. Nissan’s board on Thursday probably won’t name immediate replacements for Ghosn and Greg Kelly, an American director also accused of wrongdoing, according to a person familiar with the matter. That would reduce the board to seven members, including Saikawa, and take the number of non-Japanese directors from four to two.
For now, Renault has named Chief Operating Officer Thierry Bollore as interim CEO, with the same powers as Ghosn. In a letter to Renault employees, he pledged “full support” for Ghosn and to protect the Nissan partnership.
The full scope of potential allegations against Ghosn and others is unclear. Nissan has told Renault board members that the company is looking into potential wrongdoing at the alliance’s Amsterdam-based joint venture, RNBV, according to three people familiar with the matter.
So far the French government, which is Renault’s largest shareholder, is reserving judgment on Ghosn. On Tuesday, Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire told France Info radio that “we will not demand he be removed” from the company because “we have no proof.” France has examined Ghosn’s local tax records and found “nothing particular,” Le Maire added.
While both Le Maire and his Japanese counterpart, Hiroshige Seko, reaffirmed their support for the alliance, the structure of the partnership between the two companies has been increasingly controversial in Japan as Nissan outgrows Renault in sales and profits. Renault owns a 43 percent voting stake in Nissan, which owns just 15 percent of Renault -- without voting rights.

The company sold 143.8 billion shares at HK$9.8 each, near the bottom of the range the company offered between HK$9.75 to HK$12.65 per share. The IPO raised far less than the $1 billion that had been originally touted.
Weak markets and a tumble in the share price of Ctrip.Com International Ltd ADR (NASDAQ:CTRP), another investor of Tongcheng-Elong, pushed the website firm to slash the size of the IPO, according to Reuters.
Reuters also reported that the company plans to use the funds raised in the IPO to enhance product and service offerings as well as to fund future acquisitions and investments.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Commonwealth Bank of Australia's (AX:CBA) chairwoman on Wednesday defended her testimony to a financial sector inquiry that she had raised governance concerns with senior management, even though lawyers said there were no records of her doing so.
Catherine Livingstone was also grilled over why the head of the scandal-hit retail division was later appointed CEO, and why executive bonuses were only affected after events were reported in the media rather than when the board became aware of them.
In her second day in the witness stand at the quasi-judicial inquiry, Livingstone said she had confronted management at a board meeting in late 2016 after regulators warned the bank about breaches of anti-money laundering and terror-financing laws (AML/CTF).
""Do you accept that they (the minutes) don't record a very significant exchange that you say occurred at this meeting but which we have no record of?"" barrister assisting the inquiry Rowena Orr asked.
""I do accept that, but I am also aware that I am giving evidence under oath. To the best of my recollection, it was at the October board meeting that I challenged management in relation to the AML/CTF reports,"" Livingstone said.
Australia's largest bank in May agreed to pay a record A$700 million ($506 million) fine to settle charges brought in late 2017 over tens of thousands of breaches of money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws.
The scandal led to a scathing report by the banking regulator, the Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority (APRA), about the bank's governance shortcomings.
Livingstone, who became CBA chairwoman a few months before the breaches became public, said the board had cut directors' pay in response to the scandal but that former chairman David Turner had refused a request to return 40 percent of his final year's fees. 
Turner could not immediately be reached for comment.
ACCOUNTABILITY
The money-laundering allegations and other scandals severely damaged CBA's brand and led to the departure of former CEO Ian Narev in April.
But that was just the beginning of the reputational and financial damage for Australia's biggest bank, which now faces mounting legal and compliance costs amid a slowdown in its core mortgage business.
From its first hearings in February, the Royal Commission inquiry has revealed systemic wrongdoing and a pervasive culture of greed at CBA and Australia's other big banks.
On Tuesday, Chief Executive Matt Comyn also blamed previous management for the bank's failings although at the time he was head of retail banking overseeing one of the most scandal-hit divisions.
Asked at the inquiry on Wednesday whether Comyn was an appropriate choice to replace Narev, Livingstone said his character and ability to admit mistakes were factors that helped the board decide in his favor.
She acknowledged that since the 2011 financial year the bank had not reduced an executive's short-term bonus because of ""a risk-related issue"" unless it had been made public.
The barrister asked what message that sent.
""Well, clearly that there will only be consequence if there is a public event, a media event,"" Livingstone said.
Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC) Chief Executive Brian Hartzer is testifying on Wednesday afternoon. The heads of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ), National Australia Bank (AX:NAB), and investment bank  Macquarie Group  Ltd (AX:MQG) are expected to testify before the end of the month.

729,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2018 08:50PM ET</span>",Renault names Ghosn stand-ins amid tension over Nissan probe,"By Laurence Frost and Chang-Ran Kim
PARIS/TOKYO (Reuters) - French carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) tapped its chief operating officer and a senior board member to fill in for embattled boss Carlos Ghosn, after an investigation by alliance partner Nissan led to his arrest on suspicion of financial misconduct.
Thierry Bollore, Ghosn's operational second-in-command, will become deputy chief executive, while lead independent director Philippe Lagayette assumes the function of interim chairman, Renault said after a board meeting late on Tuesday.
But the board refrained from firing Ghosn while awaiting more detail on the allegations - in a decision that could also buy more time for an accelerated, permanent succession process.
""Mr. Ghosn, temporarily incapacitated, remains Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"" Renault said in a statement. ""During this period, the board will meet on a regular basis under the chairmanship of the lead independent director."" 
Ghosn, one of the car industry's best-known leaders, was arrested on Monday after Nissan said he had engaged in years of wrongdoing, including personal use of company money and under-reported earnings. The Japanese company plans to remove him as chairman on Thursday.
The French government, Renault's biggest shareholder, had begun to distance itself from Ghosn, calling for new interim leadership before the meeting, as the Japanese investigation expanded to include Renault-Nissan alliance finances.
""Carlos Ghosn is no longer in a position where he is capable of leading Renault,"" Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said earlier in the day. ""Renault has been weakened, which makes it all the more necessary to act quickly.""
Statements by Le Maire, Renault and its board all echoed French preoccupations over the future of the alliance first articulated by President Emmanuel Macron within hours of Ghosn's arrest on Monday.
Following talks between Le Maire and his Japanese counterpart Hiroshige Seko on Tuesday, the ministers reaffirmed their ""shared wish to maintain this winning cooperation"".
But in a sign that Nissan may now seek to loosen its French parent's hold on the partnership, the Japanese company informed Renault it also had evidence of potential wrongdoing at Renault-Nissan BV, the Dutch venture overseeing alliance operations under Renault's ultimate control, three people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The private communication came from Nissan Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa, whose company is 43.4 percent-owned by Renault in a complex alliance forged by Ghosn over almost two decades.
MAJOR PLAYER
Close to bankruptcy when Renault bought its stake in 1999, Nissan has recovered to be the engine of an alliance that generates synergies for both companies and allows them to rival Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Toyota Motor Corp on the global stage. 
But there have long been tensions as Nissan, while almost 60 percent bigger than Renault by sales, remains the junior partner in their shareholding hierarchy with a smaller reciprocal 15 percent non-voting stake in Renault.
In its board statement, Renault invoked ""principles of transparency, trust and mutual respect set forth in the alliance charter"" to demand that Nissan provide ""all information in (its) possession arising from the internal investigation.""
Renault shares closed 1.2 percent lower before the meeting, extending Monday's decline of more than 8 percent. Nissan fell another 5.5 percent, while Mitsubishi Motors Corp, the third alliance member, ended down nearly 7 percent.
Mitsubishi Motors' CEO Osamu Masuko said it could be hard to manage the alliance without the unifying figure of Ghosn.
""I don't think there is anyone else on Earth like Ghosn who could run Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi,"" he told reporters in Tokyo.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) cut its rating on Renault to ""neutral"" from ""buy"", while Exane  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) moved to ""neutral"" from ""outperform"".
DIFFICULT TIME
The end of Ghosn's leadership poses questions and risks for an alliance he had pledged to consolidate with a deeper tie-up, before eventually stepping back from its operational leadership. 
It comes at a difficult time for the industry, already grappling with tighter emissions regulations, a diesel sales collapse and big investments in electric and self-driving cars. 
Ghosn's alleged improprieties also raise questions over governance at the alliance, over which he presided relatively unchecked as chairman of all three partners' boards. 
Japan's Nikkei business daily, citing unidentified sources, said Ghosn had received share price-linked compensation of about 4 billion yen ($36 million) over a five-year period to March 2015, but it went unreported in Nissan's financial reports. 
The financial reports also did not mention annual compensation of 100 million to 150 million yen Ghosn received from the automaker's overseas subsidiaries, the newspaper said. 
Nissan declined to comment on the report. 
Japanese public broadcaster NHK also said Nissan had paid billions of yen to buy and renovate homes for Ghosn in Rio de Janeiro, Beirut, Paris and Amsterdam, citing unnamed sources. The properties had no business purpose and were not listed as benefits in compensation filings to the Tokyo bourse, NHK said. 
There has been no comment from Ghosn on the allegations, and Reuters could not contact him for comment.
A French diplomatic source said the country’s ambassador in Tokyo had seen Ghosn on Tuesday as part of usual procedures for a French citizen being held in Japan.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said it would conduct a ""cultural assessment study"" of the companies, ""including the adherence to a drug-free environment,"" prior to crew test flights scheduled to take place in the coming months. 
""We fully expect our commercial partners to meet all workplace safety requirements in the execution of our missions,"" said NASA in a statement.
NASA did not give further details on the reasons behind the move, but the Washington Post, which first reported it, said the review was prompted by the recent behavior of SpaceX's founder Elon Musk, who was filmed drinking whiskey and briefly smoking marijuana during a live podcast in September.
SpaceX and Boeing are the two main contractors selected under NASA's commercial crew program to send astronauts to space as soon as 2019, using their Dragon and Starliner spacecraft respectively.
Boeing said in an emailed statement that it was committed to mission success as NASA's partner, while ensuring the integrity, safety and quality of its products, its people and their work environment.
SpaceX said it actively promoted a safe work environment.

731,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 20, 2018 08:40PM ET</span>",Where Does Noble Probe Leave $3.5 Billion Restructuring?,"(Bloomberg) -- After more than a year of marathon restructuring negotiations, Noble Group Ltd. looked to be entering the home stretch. The debt deal, which chairman Paul Brough described as ""probably the most complex restructuring ever undertaken in Asia,"" had run the gauntlet of all-night negotiations and court hearings. It was due to complete in less than a week.
Now the $3.5 billion restructuring hangs in the balance after Singaporean authorities on Tuesday announced a multi-agency investigation into the Asia-focused commodity trader, including a probe by Singapore’s white-collar crime squad.
Should the deal fail, it would be a blow to Noble’s creditors, including hedge funds Taconic Capital Advisors, Varde Partners and Owl Creek Asset Management, as well as  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) and  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV. Noble Group said Wednesday it will continue to work toward implementing its proposed restructuring within the previously disclosed timelines and it’s in the best interest of all shareholders and creditors.
The announcement of the probe came as a surprise to the company’s creditors and advisers, according to three people working on the deal, who asked not to be named discussing a private matter. They had been racing to complete the restructuring ahead of a deadline, the so-called ""longstop date"" of Nov. 27. According to an announcement last week, they were due to make it -- just -- with the deal due to be completed next Monday, Nov. 26.
How could the Singapore probe delay Noble’s restructuring?
The Singaporean regulators on Tuesday suggested that the probe could delay the restructuring deal. ""Trading can only start after restructuring has been completed and this is in turn dependent on our review,” said SGX RegCo, the regulatory arm of the Singapore Exchange.
The circular to shareholders that the company published in August shows how the Singaporean regulators’ approval is crucial for the deal.
One of the conditions without which the restructuring cannot go ahead is for the SGX to give consent for the restructured entity to be re-listed.
Another of the so-called ""conditions precedent"" is for the Securities Industry Council and the Monetary Authority of Singapore to grant waivers needed so that the restructuring can go through without Noble’s creditors -- who are due to take control of the company -- being forced to make a buyout offer for its shares.
Why would a delay matter?
The ""longstop date"" for the Noble restructuring is Nov. 27, according to a copy of its English scheme of arrangement, which was approved by a U.K. court last week. That means that if the restructuring hasn’t been completed by then, the schemes of arrangement -- by which Noble is implementing its debt restructuring -- ""shall be of no effect.""
Still, the scheme of arrangement provides that the date can be pushed back to any day until Dec. 31, with the agreement of Noble and its creditors.
A bigger problem may be that Nov. 27 is the day on which a key waiver expires. Granted by Noble’s shareholders under a ""whitewash"" resolution at a meeting in August, the waiver allows the deal to go ahead without Noble’s creditors being forced to make a buyout offer for its shares.
In its circular to shareholders, Noble said that Singapore’s Securities Industry Council had allowed it to go ahead with the restructuring without a buyout offer being made, as long as the deal was completed within three months of the approval of the whitewash resolution.
What might Noble and its creditors do now?
Noble and its creditors will make contact with the Singaporean authorities to work out if there’s anything they can do to persuade the regulators to approve the deal ahead of the Nov. 27 deadline, the people familiar with the matter said.
That could involve, for example, agreeing that the restructured Noble Group would guarantee to pay any fine that arises from the Singaporean investigation. However, at the moment it’s not clear what the authorities require to wrap up the restructuring.
What happens if there’s no resolution?
Noble and its creditors have repeatedly stated that the only alternative to the restructuring plan is to file for insolvency.
They’ve even set out a detailed account of how this would work: under an ""alternative restructuring"" plan set out in Noble’s shareholder circular, the company would file for administration in the U.K. The creditors would take control of the company, and shareholders and perpetual bondholders would likely be wiped out.
Still, Singapore would still have significant sway over what remains of Noble. One of the entities it’s investigating, according to Tuesday’s announcement, is Noble Resources International Pte. That’s Noble’s main operating subsidiary, based in Singapore, and the unit through which it carries out much of its trading activity.
For example, NRI is the entity through which Noble buys from Indonesian coal miner Berau, its single largest contract in its core thermal coal trading unit, according to people familiar with the matter. In 2017, NRI reported revenues of $6.02 billion, according to its financial statements. That’s 96 percent of Noble Group’s overall reported revenues of $6.24 billion.
Noble Group said it and NRI intend to cooperate fully with authorities in their investigation.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors who bought insurance meant to mitigate losses from Sears Holdings Corp's (PK:SHLDQ) bankruptcy proceedings are claiming that a hedge fund that sold the insurance is improperly influencing market proceedings, according to a letter seen by Reuters. 
According to the letter, Cyrus Capital Partners LP worked to ""torpedo"" an auction planned for Tuesday for company bonds by getting Sears to include wording in a bankruptcy court order that would disqualify the bonds in credit proceedings.
By selling the insurance, Cyrus had been wagering that Sears would avoid filing for bankruptcy. The investors, whose names were redacted in the letter, bet correctly that Sears would file for bankruptcy. It was not clear if the investors bought their insurance from Cyrus or another firm. 
The letter, which is not public, was submitted on Tuesday by attorneys for the investors to a committee of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) overseeing the market. Later on Tuesday, ISDA determined that the bonds would be included, according to a posting on its website. 
Sears and Cyrus declined to comment.
The outcome of the auction for the bonds could not be immediately determined. 
The proceeds from the sale of the notes will help fund an account for Sears designated for expenses that could eventually help Sears stay in business. The company filed for bankruptcy protection in October.
Cyrus, which has more than $4 billion in assets under management, sold a form of credit insurance to investors who believed Sears would file for bankruptcy. Cyrus could now be on the hook to pay out millions, said the people who asked not to be named because the matter is private. 
Investors have claimed that the credit derivatives market can be too easily manipulated, leading to situations like Hovnanian Enterprises Inc (N:HOV), which defaulted on purpose earlier this year as part of a planned refinancing. Those actions can hurt other investors. 
Billionaire Leon Cooperman's Omega Advisors Inc and Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC are among the biggest buyers of the credit insurance, indicating those hedge funds believed that Sears would file for bankruptcy, one of the people said.
Och-Ziff and ISDA did not immediately return requests for comment. 
According to the investors' letter, Cyrus negotiated with Sears to have the 125-year-old chain include language in the court order stating that the bonds may have claims related to its bankruptcy. 
That could hurt their value in the auction, the people said. 
Ultimately, these moves may help Cyrus mitigate its losses on its wrong-way bet on Sears, the people added.

733,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 20, 2018 07:20PM ET</span>",These Are the Key Players in Carlos Ghosn's Downfall,"(Bloomberg) -- Nissan Motor Co. has made shocking allegations against its longtime leader Carlos Ghosn, accusing him of understating his compensation in securities filings and using company assets for personal use.
The alleged misconduct has thrown an almost 20-year-old alliance between Nissan and France’s  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) into chaos.
Here’s a look at the cast of characters involved:
Carlos Ghosn
Role: Chairman of Nissan, Renault, Mitsubishi Motors and their three-way alliance; chief executive officer of Renault
Why he matters: The 64-year-old has been the glue binding together three automakers that were highly troubled before he took command starting in the 1990s. Ghosn relinquished the Nissan CEO role last year and had been trying to structure the alliance so that it was “irreversible,” potentially through an outright merger.
What he has said: Attempts to reach Ghosn and his representatives for comment since the news of his arrest emerged Monday have been unsuccessful. In an interview last year, he said he might remain a boardroom fixture as long as Ferdinand Piech, who was chairman of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG into his late 70s. “I am not just shutting the door and going fishing or something,” Ghosn said.
Greg Kelly
Role: Senior vice president of talent management for the Renault Nissan Mitsubishi Alliance and a Nissan director
Why he matters: Kelly became the first American to serve on Nissan’s board in 2012, having risen through the ranks of the company’s human-resources operations. CEO Hiroto Saikawa on Monday described Kelly and Ghosn as the “masterminds” behind years of alleged misconduct.
What he has said: As with Ghosn, nobody has seen or heard from Kelly or those representing him since his arrest. Unlike his oft-quoted and highly visible boss, he’s flown under the radar during the course of his 30-year career.
Hiroto Saikawa
Role: CEO of Nissan
Why he matters: A lifer who joined Nissan a month after graduating from Tokyo University in 1977, Saikawa became a Ghosn protege and served in key roles spanning the globe, including purchasing, supply chain, manufacturing and research and development. He publicly bristled at reports that Ghosn was pursuing a potential Renault-Nissan merger, saying there was no merit to combining the companies and emphasizing the need to preserve autonomy.
What he has said: During a press conference late Monday in Yokohama, Saikawa credited Ghosn with implementing reforms Nissan couldn’t have achieved on its own. But that was about the extent of the positive things he had to say about his longtime boss. “Beyond being sorry, I feel great disappointment, frustration, despair, indignation and resentment,” Saikawa said. “This is the negative outcome of the long regime of Mr. Ghosn.”
Thierry Bollore
Role: Chief operating officer and temporary deputy CEO of Renault
Why he matters: Ghosn hinted to French lawmakers in January that he would eventually hand off the day-to-day responsibility of running Renault, spurring months of speculation about his successor. He ended up agreeing to stay on as both chairman and CEO for another four years, but the company elevated Bollore to second-in-command. The 55-year-old French national started his career at tiremaker  Michelin  (PA:MICP) and joined Renault in 2012.
What he has said: In a letter to employees sent late Monday, Bollore expressed “full support” for Ghosn, while pledging to protect the partnership with the Japanese automakers.
Philippe Lagayette
Role: Lead independent director of Renault; chaired the board’s meeting late Tuesday
Why he matters: The 75-year-old chairman of French consultant and advisory firm PL Conseils has been on Renault’s board since 2007. He leads the audit, risk and ethics committee and is a member of the compensation committee. Renault appears to be taking a wait-and-see approach to dealing with Ghosn thus far, but these are the committees’ whose patience will be tested -- especially if French politicians are less forgiving.
What he has said: While Lagayette himself hasn’t spoken up, Renault’s board issued a statement saying it’s unable to comment on the evidence gathered against Ghosn by Nissan and Japanese authorities. The board also asked Nissan to share all the information it’s come up with in its investigation.
Hiroshige Seko
Role: Japan’s minister of economy, trade and industry
Why he matters: Seko already had a lot on his plate, including automotive trade frictions with U.S. President Donald Trump. The last thing he needed was a potentially catastrophic rupture involving one of Japan’s leading manufacturers.
What he has said: Seko said Monday that Ghosn’s situation is regrettable and emphasized the importance of the alliance remaining stable. Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga also threw his support behind the alliance in a meeting with Hitoshi Kawaguchi, Nissan’s executive in charge of government affairs.
Bruno Le Maire
Role: France’s Finance Minister
Why he matters: The French state has balked at Ghosn’s compensation packages in recent years, and he bowed to the pushback in February, accepting a 30 percent cut when his tenure was extended. But Le Maire has been hands-off in the wake of Ghosn’s arrest, saying the government wouldn’t demand his dismissal without evidence. He said the alliance has been weakened and France’s priority is to act quickly to preserve it.
What he has said: In a joint statement Tuesday, Le Maire and his Japanese counterpart Seko expressed their “shared wish to maintain this winning cooperation,” calling the alliance “one of the greatest symbols of Franco-Japanese industrial cooperation.”

739,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2018 06:15PM ET</span>","Australian drought, sporty shoppers push up prices of wool clothing","By Sonya Dowsett and Jonathan Barrett
MADRID/SYDNEY (Reuters) - A jump in the price of wool from drought-ravaged Australia, the world's top exporter of high-quality fleeces, is rattling through the global clothing supply chain, with some mills passing along costs and retailers cutting down on wool or raising prices.   
Italian clothmaker Botto Giuseppe, which supplies luxury brands Giorgio Armani SpA and Max Mara, says it has increased prices on average by 7 to 8 percent in the last year on wool fabric, while high-end Swiss-based sportswear label Mover has put up the retail price of its merino wool t-shirts by 15 percent. 
""The wool price has increased consistently over the past three years,"" said Silvio Botto Poala, Chief Executive Officer of Botto Giuseppe, a 142-year-old company. ""But the big jump has been in the past year.""
Neither Armani or Max Mara immediately responded to requests for comment.
Meanwhile, Swedish fast fashion company H&M (ST:HMb) has cut down on the amount of wool it uses in production, it said in an emailed response to Reuters' questions, thus avoiding price rises on items like wool-blend sweaters and coats. It declined to give further details. 
Botto Giuseppe has increased the price of wool flannel fabric used for suits to 19.50 euros per meter compared to 18 euros a year ago, CEO Botto Poala said. Pure merino wool t-shirts from Swiss skiwear label Mover retail for 75 euros ($85), compared to 65 euros last year, CEO Nicolas Rochat said. 
Pendleton, a sixth-generation-owned, Oregon-based textile company known for its plaid woolen shirts, said it would put up some of its prices next year due to higher wool prices.
""We won't go into less expensive wools, we will just have to take a sharper margin and we'll have to increase the price,"" said John Bishop, CEO of the company which has collaborated with  Nike  (N:NKE) on a range of plaid wool sneakers. 
The privately-held company declined to give details on how margins will be affected. Nike did not respond to several requests for comment. 
Wool has become increasingly popular for use in sportswear due to its temperature regulating properties and a surge in demand for sustainable fabrics, particularly from younger consumers, manufacturers and farmers say. 
But the jump in demand has coincided with a sustained drought in the east of Australia, which supplies over 90 percent of the world's exported high-quality wool used in clothing. 
BUYERS PUSH BACK 
Lack of rain has turned pastures barren, driving farmers to bring in expensive feed. Many have had to send livestock to abattoirs, prompting Australia's chief commodity forecaster ABARES to cut wool production forecasts by 4 percent this year. 
Anthony Uren, manager at the Congi farm in the north-east of New South Wales, said he was keeping his 36,000 merino sheep fed on parched paddocks by bringing in feed like hay and barley. 
""We've never had less rainfall than we've had this year,"" said Uren, who supplies wool to Botto Giuseppe, among others.
Benchmark prices for high-quality Australian wool were trading at more than A$21 ($15.40) a kg in August, up from A$16 a year earlier. 
The effects of drought are now clearly visible to wool growers and buyers. Fleeces of animals affected by drought are thinner and often tainted by dust, said buyer Andrew Blanch, managing director of Italian textile maker-owned New England Wool. Clients of Chinese wool mills are also starting to balk at the high prices, leading to a stand-off between buyers and sellers and some bales being left unsold, said Michael Jones, chief executive of Australia's dominant wool storage and export house, AWH.
As a result, prices have retreated 15 percent since September, according to Australian Wool Innovation auction price reports. But prices are still near historical highs and sellers know they are in possession of an in-demand product facing supply shortages, Jones said.
ACTIVE WEAR 
Demand for wool active wear in particular continues to grow. 
Italian clothmaker Reda started to produce woolen sports fabrics after the financial crash of 2008 which saw demand for suits tumble, said CEO Ercole Botto Poala, who is related to the chief executive of Botto Giuseppe. 
Wool active wear fabric now makes up 10 percent of the company's 110 million euro annual turnover and is its fastest-growing product range, he said. The company bought new factory space in May to keep up with consumer demand, he said. Reda's clients range from San Francisco-based wool sneaker brand Allbirds, popular with Silicon Valley tech workers, to luxury label Zegna which uses its trade-marked fabric Techmerino in a range of pure wool casual wear including sweatpants. Reda has put up its prices in response to higher wool prices, but declined to say by how much. Neither Allbirds nor Zegna would comment on the matter.

NEW YORK (LPC) - Bondholders of Greek fuel services provider Aegean Marine Petroleum Network Inc are objecting to a US$532m debtor-in-possession (DIP) loan from Mercuria Energy Group that could give the Swiss commodities trader a controlling stake in the company and push their recoveries into cents on the dollar territory, three sources familiar with the situation said.
    As part of a court-approved restructuring agreement, Mercuria will provide the DIP financing to bankrupt Aegean in exchange for a “stalking horse bid,” which allows it to bid first on the distressed company’s assets. 
    The move is part of Mercuria’s strategy to finance cash-strapped firms that are strategically linked to its core businesses of energy and commodities trading.
    Aegean Marine is a Greek company focusing on petroleum refining and trading and is one of the largest independent fuel suppliers in the world.
    Although Mercuria’s restructuring proposal values Aegean at US$681m, the ad hoc committee of convertible bondholders is opposing the plan as it would cut their recoveries on US$267m of outstanding bonds to 31% of face value, or US$82.7m.
    Mercuria’s DIP financing was approved on November 9. It includes a US$72m delayed-draw term loan and also gives Aegean access to a US$160m revolving credit facility (RCF) and a US$300m global RCF, according to court filings.
    Aegean filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in New York on November 6. Judge Stuart Bernstein, who is presiding over the bankruptcy case filed in the US Bankruptcy Court of the Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, subsequently approved Mercuria’s proposed DIP financing and an auction plan for the company’s assets, as long as there is an open and transparent bidding process for control of Aegean Marine.
    The ad hoc bondholder group is working on a competing restructuring plan that would boost their recoveries, two of the sources said.
    The final DIP hearing will take place on December 5.
LIQUIDITY STRAIN
   Aegean signed a US$750m three-year secured borrowing base loan in December 2017, but lenders were reluctant to allow the company to draw down on the credit facility due to concerns over its inventory levels and accounts receivables.
    The financing comprised a US$200m A facility and a US$550m letter of credit, guarantee and overdraft B facility, according to LPC data.
    ABN Amro was the lead bookrunner and mandated lead arranger on the transaction.  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), KBC Bank, Natixis, MUFG, HSH Nordbank, Belfius Bank,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and Mashreqbank are also lenders.
    As part of a financial audit overhaul in May 2018, Aegean named three directors – Tyler Baron, Raymond Bartoszek and Donald Moore – to its board of directors in a bid to turn around its liquidity woes and also terminated a consulting agreement with Aegean’s founder Dimitris Melissanidis. 
    The new board members started talks with the bank group to allow drawing on the credit facility but pushback from the lenders left illiquid Aegean hamstrung.
    “The company had no additional liquidity to procure supplies and had little fuel to sell to the markets,” one of the sources said. 
CHECKERED HISTORY
    The new board members ordered an audit of Aegean’s financials dating back to 2010. In November, Aegean confirmed it had written-off US$200m in accounts receivable, and a further US$100m may have been fraudulently siphoned away. 
    The audit committee, along with Aegean’s board members, believed a contract with Oil Tank Engineering and Consulting, a company incorporated in March 2010 in the Marshall Islands, was signed in 2010 to build an oil terminal in the United Arab Emirate of Fujairah but the contract was used to misappropriate funds through over-priced contracts, Aegean said in a press release on November 2. 
The audit also unveiled payment of oil receivables that were never delivered. Costs to construct the Fujairah oil terminal facility had also increased by more than US$100m to approximately US$222m, according to internal documents obtained by LPC.
    Aegean said in June it had reported the findings of the audit committee to the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice. Several Aegean employees deemed complicit in the fraud had been dismissed. 
     Armed with the audit’s preliminary findings, Aegean’s new board members approached commodities traders, such as Trafigura and Freepoint, hoping to find a trade financing partner to fund Aegean after commercial banks would not, two of the sources said.
    Mercuria stepped in and offered Aegean US$30m of incremental liquidity, along with US$250m and US$750m in revolving credit facilities through January 31, 2019, Aegean said on August 16.
    The transaction gave the Swiss commodities trader a 30% stake in Aegean, and effectively set the stage for a takeover. 
    Aegean Marine was founded in Piraeus, Greece in 1995 by Greek businessman Dimitris Melissanidis. The company went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 2006.

749,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 20, 2018 04:45PM ET</span>","Stocks - Dow Falls More Than 500 Points as Tech, Energy Plunge","Investing.com – A sea of red washed over Wall Street for the second-straight day Tuesday, led by a sharp selloff in energy as oil prices plummeted.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.21%. The S&P 500 fell 1.82%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.70%.
Energy names fell sharply, leading a broad-based decline across Wall Street, pressured by plunging oil prices as fears of a supply glut took center stage even as OPEC is widely expected to announce output cuts in December.
The selloff on Wall Street was exacerbated by an ongoing rout in tech as investors continued to abandon their bullish bets on Apple.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell 5%, deepening a selloff from a day earlier, after Goldman Sachs warned that weaker demand for Apple products and subdued demand for the iPhone XR outside the United States will keep a lid on the company's stock.
Goldman Sachs slashed its price target on Apple to $182 from $209.
Among FAANG stocks, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) closed modestly higher, while Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) closed in the red.
Elsewhere in tech, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) offered investors refuge from the selloff after short-seller Citron Research said it had snapped up the chipmaker's shares and downplayed concerns about excess inventories.
Corporate earnings did little to lift sentiment on stocks following weak earnings from Target and Kohl's.
 Target  (NYSE:TGT) slumped 10.5% and Kohl’s (NYSE:KSS) lost 9.2%,after both companies reported quarterly results that fell short of estimates, prompting investors to turn cautious on retailers ahead of the crucial holiday season.
On the economic front, a rebound in housing starts in October from a decline in the previous month drew a muted reaction as a subdued outlook on building permits data fuelled fears of a continued slowdown in U.S. housing activity.
In corporate news, Boeing (NYSE:BA) canceled a conference call with airlines to discuss the systems on the 737 MAX model, sending its shares more than 1% lower. A 737 MAX model was involved in a crash last month in Indonesia, killing all 189 people on board.

751,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2018 04:40PM ET</span>",U.S. judge selects first case in federal Monsanto weed-killer litigation,"By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - A U.S. judge overseeing the federal litigation against Bayer AG's (DE:BAYGn)  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) unit over glyphosate-based weed-killers allegedly causing cancer on Tuesday selected the first case to be tried in federal court in February 2019.
U.S. District Judge Vince Chaabria in San Francisco in an order said the case of California resident Edwin Hardeman will be the first out of more than 620 cases pending in the federal litigation to go to a jury.
Hardeman's case will mark the second trial in the U.S. litigation over glyphosate, after a California state court jury in August awarded $289 million to a school groundskeeper, finding Monsanto liable for the man's cancer.
Damages were later reduced to $78 million, and Bayer, which denies the allegations, said it would appeal the decision. 
Its share price, however, has dropped more than 30 percent since the Aug. 10 jury verdict and the company faces some 9,300 U.S. glyphosate lawsuits.
Bayer, which acquired Monsanto earlier this year for $63 billion, says its glyphosate-based products do not cause cancer, pointing to decades of scientific studies and regulatory approvals that have shown the chemical to be safe for human use.
Hardeman's case was picked as a so-called bellwether, or test trial, frequently used in U.S. product liability mass litigation to help both sides gauge the range of damages and define settlement options. 
Hardeman began using the Roundup brand herbicide with glyphosate in the 1980s to control poison oak and weeds on his property and sprayed ""large volumes"" of the chemical for many years on a regular basis, according to court documents. He was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph system, in February 2015 and filed his lawsuit a year later.
Glyphosate jury trials will ramp up next year. The company is scheduled to face jurors in another California state court trial in March, after a judge last week granted a couple's request for an expedited trial.
Another trial in St. Louis, Missouri, state court is expected to start later in 2019. 

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in September 2017 concluded a decades-long assessment of glyphosate risks and found the chemical not likely carcinogenic to humans. But the World Health Organization's cancer arm in 2015 classified glyphosate as ""probably carcinogenic to humans.""

752,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2018 04:37PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Chevron granted waiver from U.S. biofuel laws at Utah plant - source,"By Jarrett Renshaw and Chris Prentice
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency granted oil major  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) a 2017 hardship waiver from U.S. biofuel laws for its Utah refinery earlier this year, according to a source familiar with the company's operations.
Chevron, which reported a net income of $9.2 billion in 2017, becomes the largest known company to be awarded a hardship waiver from the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which requires refiners to blend biofuels like ethanol into their fuel pool or buy compliance credits from competitors that do. 
The waivers, which have grown significantly under the Trump administration, have angered corn-belt farmers who say it hurts demand for ethanol and other biofuels.
“When an oil company whose net profits surpass the total value of the Iowa corn crop claims it is experiencing ‘hardship,’ you know we’ve reached a new level of absurdity,"" said Geoff Cooper, CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association. 
California-based Chevron declined to confirm whether it received a small refinery hardship waiver, but did say that seeking them can level the playing field.
""EPA has acknowledged that it has granted several small refinery exemptions from the RFS. Any Chevron refinery not exempted from the RFS would be at a disadvantage in the highly competitive markets where we operate,"" the company said in an emailed statement.
The EPA did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Refineries with a capacity less than 75,000 barrels-per-day can receive waivers from the RFS if they prove compliance would cause them disproportionate hardship. Chevron's Salt Lake City, Utah, plant is 54,000 barrels-per-day.
The EPA, under President Donald Trump, expanded the waiver program, awarding 29 exemptions for the 2017 calendar year, up from 19 in 2016 and just seven in 2015, EPA data shows.
The EPA has attributed the program's expansion to a lawsuit brought by two oil refiners who challenged the EPA's denial of their waiver request. A federal judge ruled the EPA was using too narrow of a test to evaluate applications.
Biofuel backers say the expansion was politically driven by former EPA administrator Scott Pruitt, who sought ways to lower compliance costs for refiners. The Chevron approval was granted under Pruitt, the source said.
The surge in hardship waivers has pummeled the price for compliance credits some refiners must buy. 
Reuters previously reported that Chevron, along with  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM), sought a hardship waiver from U.S. biofuel laws.

Exxon Mobil's application status was unclear.

757,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2018 03:55PM ET</span>","CFPB fines Spain's Santander $11.8 million over misleading loans, insurance","By Patrick Rucker
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc  (N:SC), a leading subprime auto lender, will pay $11.8 million to settle claims that it misled customers about the cost and terms of auto loans and insurance, a U.S. consumer watchdog said on Tuesday.
Santander Consumer, an affiliate of the Spanish banking group  Banco Santander  SA (MC:SAN), promised drivers lower monthly fees by allowing them to make interest-only payments without explaining this would increase the total cost of the loan, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) said. 
The bank also failed to explain to customers that an insurance policy known as ""guaranteed auto protection"" (GAP) would not always cover the costs of replacing a car that was destroyed in an accident.
Reuters first reported details of the settlement in August.
Santander Consumer is one of the nation's largest subprime auto lenders and manages about $52 billion in loans to 2.7 million customers, the lender has said.
Santander Consumer will pay a $2.5 million fine and provide about $9.3 million in refunds to some drivers although the lender did not admit guilt, according to the settlement.
""We are pleased to put this matter behind us,"" the lender said in a statement on Tuesday. ""Strengthening compliance and consumer practices has been a key focus of ours.""
Santander Consumer has previously said it stopped offering its GAP insurance product last year and has updated its disclosures to consumers.
The fine from the CFPB is less than half the $26 million penalty that state officials in Massachusetts and Delaware fined the subprime lender in a separate settlement reached last year. (https://reut.rs/2ON2Gm6)
More than 70 percent of its customers are subprime borrowers who typically pay double-digit interest rates for car-buying credit, according to U.S. regulatory filings and research from credit rating agency Experian.
Drivers could lower their monthly payments by about 40 percent under Santander's Temporary Reduction in Payment Plan (TRIPP), which allowed them to pay interest only for a time. But the CFPB found that the lender did not explain how interest-only payments would expand the life and cost of the loan. 
The lender marketed the product aggressively, the CFPB found. More than 10 percent of Santander borrowers tapped the program within a year of a car purchase, according to a Santander investor presentation.

758,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 20, 2018 03:50PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Existing Home Sales, Durable Goods on Tap
With a holiday-shortened week the economic calendar is packed tomorrow.
The highlight will likely be the latest numbers on existing home sales, which come out at 10 AM ET (15:00 GMT).
Economists, on average, expect the National Association of Realtors to report October sales of existing homes at an annual rate of 5.2 million, up slightly from the month before.
At 8:30 AM ET, the Commerce Deportment will report October durable goods numbers.
Durable goods for the month are expected to have fallen, but a rise is forecast for core durable goods orders, which exclude transportation.
At the same time, the weekly initial jobless claims arrive, a day before usual due to Thanksgiving. Claims are predicted to stay around current levels.
2. Deere Leads Brief Earnings Schedule
The earnings calendar is as light as the economic calendar is heavy. But Deere’s numbers will get plenty of attention.
The farm equipment maker is expected to post a profit of $2.44 per share on sales of about $8.6 billion.
The company’s results will also give investors a glimpse of how much the trade war with China is affecting the U.S. agriculture sector, especially soybeans, where China is a huge market.
Shares Deere (NYSE:DE) are down slightly over the last three months.
3. Rise in Oil Stockpiles Forecast
Oil took another wild ride today, with traders skeptical that OPEC can do much at all to bolster prices in the face of strong global production and potentially weakening global demand.
Prices settled nearly 7% down.
At 10:30 AM ET (15:30 GMT) tomorrow, the Energy Information Administration will release its weekly oil inventories data.
Analysts are predicting a rise in stockpiles of a little more than 2.5 million barrels, although recently there have been strong outsize builds.
""The way the market sentiment is going, I think $50 a barrel or below is happening, if not this week then next,"" said Tariz Zahir, managing partner at New York's Tyche Capital Advisors, who typically trades in long-dated spreads of U.S. oil. ""I'm selling into any strength I see from here."""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. banking sector reported $62 billion in profits in the third quarter, up 29.3 percent from the same period a year ago, according to quarterly data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
The regulator said in a statement that profits were boosted by a lower effective tax rate and higher operating revenues.
Only 3.5 percent of banks reported net losses, down from 4 percent a year ago. The number of problem banks also fell from 81 in the second quarter to 71 in the third quarter, the lowest number since the third quarter of 2007.
The FDIC's chair, Jelena McWilliams, said that while profitability was strong, the industry had seen heightened exposure to credit and interest-rate risk as lenders searched for higher-yield loans.
""Attention to the prudent management of these risks will position banks to be resilient so that they can sustain lending,"" McWilliams told reporters. 

""The competition to attract loan customers has been strong, and it will remain important for banks to maintain their underwriting discipline and credit standards.""

762,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 20, 2018 03:20PM ET</span>",MUFG Scraps Yield Curve Inversion Call,"(Bloomberg) -- The risk that the Federal Reserve could soon hit the pause button on interest-rate hikes means the great flattening of the yield curve is almost over.
That’s the view of John Herrmann, a strategist at MUFG Securities Americas Inc. who has been accurately predicting for more than a year the compression between shorter- and longer-term rates. Herrmann has now abandoned his call from just a few months ago that the curve was on track to invert and believes that economic headwinds will prompt the Federal Open Market Committee to rethink how much it tightens policy.
The most recent projections from Fed officials themselves signal a hike in December followed by three quarter-point increases for 2019, although recent comments from policy makers suggest the consensus may be shifting. The market continues to see an increase as the most likely outcome for December, but with global stock prices sliding and concern about economic growth mounting, it has dialed back the amount of tightening priced in for 2019 to just 32 basis points from more than 50 earlier this month.
It’s “time to start thinking outside the box” about 2019 and 2020, Herrmann wrote in a note Tuesday. There has been “collateral damage” from the amount of rate increases since Jerome Powell took charge at the Fed, and along with signs of dimming U.S. growth that suggests the FOMC has to slow down the speed at which it hikes, according to Herrmann.
MUFG’s base case is for an increase in December, followed by just one hike in 2019 and another in 2020, and Herrmann warns that an even more dovish path is possible. MUFG’s models indicate there is a risk that the Fed won’t hike at all in 2019 as the global economy seeks to “digest” the increase in short-end rates that has already occurred.
This Fed backdrop means the yield curve lost its chance to invert, according to a separate email from Herrmann in response to questions. If the Fed were to pause for all of 2019, 2-year yields could decline another 16 basis points and 10-year yields might fall another 14 basis points, meaning the yield curve would not be biased to invert in 2019, he wrote.

763,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2018 03:18PM ET</span>",Hedge fund Elliott raises pressure on Mitek after takeover bid rejected,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Liana B. Baker
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hedge fund Elliott Management on Tuesday asked  Mitek Systems  Inc (O:MITK) to scrap a so-called ""poison pill"" to let it buy more stock and said it may press for board changes after the software company took steps to protect itself from the activist investor.
Elliott, which invests more than $34 billion, wrote to Mitek's board and asked for ""relief from the poison pill recently enacted"" in order to buy as much as 14.9 percent of the company's stock.
Elliott has not disclosed the size of its stake, which includes common stock and swaps, but has said it is one of the company's biggest shareholders.
Mitek did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Elliott is increasing the pressure on San Diego-based Mitek at a time when software company ASG Technologies, which the hedge fund owns, has been pushing to buy Mitek for $10 a share. Mitek has so far rebuffed the overture.
Mitek's share price has climbed 8.64 percent over the past month and was trading at $9.48 on Tuesday.
Elliott wrote that ASG President and Chief Executive Charles Sansbury first approached Mitek about a possible takeover in August, roughly one week before the company announced that long-serving CEO James DeBello and Chief Financial Officer Jeff Davison would be leaving. Earlier this month, the company said on its earnings call that ASG reached out ""after the announcement of our executive changes.""
Elliott said Mitek was adopting a ""path of entrenchment"" and had not properly engaged with the hedge fund.
On Oct. 31, ASG Technologies said it wanted to buy Mitek for $10 a share in cash, a 51 percent premium above the stock's closing price on Oct. 9, 2018.
The hedge fund noted that director Bruce Hansen sold Mitek stock at $8.66 earlier in the year, which prompted it to question, in its letter, why a deal at $10 a share would undervalue the company. Elliott also said a number of board members were stretched thin by serving on too many boards.
The deadline for nominating directors is Dec. 7. Elliott has often asked for board seats.
ASG received an investment last year from Evergreen Coast Capital, the private equity arm of Elliott Management. Elliott has been using Evergreen to acquire both public and private companies, and sometimes involves Evergreen when it pushes companies to explore a sale.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields fell to seven-week lows on Tuesday as global stock market declines boosted demand for safe haven debt, before giving up some price gains as investors closed positions before Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday.
Stocks were hurt by worries over softening demand for Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) iPhone and corporate growth prospects, while oil prices sank on concerns about rising global supply.
“The near-term guidance Treasuries are taking are from broader risk assets, so they are certainly paying attention to the fall in equities globally,” said Jon Hill, U.S. rates strategist at BMO Capital Markets in New York.
Benchmark 10-year notes (US10YT=RR) fell to 3.036 percent, the lowest since Sept. 28, before rising back to 3.052 percent.
Analysts attributed the rise off the yield lows to investors closing trades with liquidity expected to decline before Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday.
The 10-year yields have declined from 3.25 percent on Nov. 7 and are at the low end of the range they have traded in since the beginning of October.
The bond market will be closed on Thursday and will close early on Friday.
Fears about slowing global growth have also boosted demand for U.S. government bonds as investors contemplate how a slowdown will impact further rate increases by the U.S. central bank.
“The background for a lot of what’s going on is a reassessment of the Fed’s path of policy as it relates to the growing concern about global growth as well as a potential recession going into 2020 and 2021,” Hill said.
Two-year note yields (US2YT=RR), which are highly sensitive to interest rates, have fallen to 2.791 percent from 2.977 percent on Nov. 8, and are trading near their lowest levels since Sept. 18.
Richard Clarida, the Fed's newly appointed vice chair, on Friday noted there was “some evidence of global slowing,” adding “that's something that is going to be relevant as I think about the outlook for the U.S. economy.""
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said last Wednesday that softness in housing and high levels of corporate debt had caught the Federal Reserve's eye, even as a ""really strong"" U.S. economy was likely to continue growing.

New York Fed President John Williams (NYSE:WMB) on Monday said that the U.S. central bank was pushing ahead with gradual rate-hike plans next month as it marches toward a more normal policy stance.

767,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 20, 2018 03:00PM ET</span>",Ghosn's Fall Ripples From Tokyo to Paris as Allegations Spread,"(Bloomberg) -- The downfall of Nissan Motor Co. Chairman Carlos Ghosn reverberated for a second day as politicians and executives scrambled to fill the vacuum at the top of the world’s largest car alliance amid new reports about his alleged financial improprieties.
Renault’s board is convening for a crisis meeting tonight in Paris to discuss the future of its alliance with Nissan and to appoint interim leadership at the French automaker. Earlier, Nissan informed  Renault  (PA:RENA) that it was investigating potential financial wrongdoing at the Dutch-domiciled Renault-Nissan venture, people familiar with the matter said.
Back in Japan, where Ghosn has remained in custody since his arrest Monday, more details of his alleged transgressions began trickling out in local media. Combined, they painted a picture of an executive who dipped into company funds to bankroll a lavish lifestyle, from luxury residences dotted around the globe to money funneled into investment funds and family vacations. Ghosn hasn’t been seen in public and hasn’t responded to the allegations.
Alliance Future
The revelations, which followed a months-long internal probe, put key stakeholders in a bind because there’s no obvious successor. While all sides rushed to assure that the alliance was solid, Ghosn was the linchpin holding the partnership together. The French government, which owns 15 percent of Renault, signaled it will protect the automaker, which has benefited hugely from its participation in the French-Japanese pact.
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said he will meet with management of Renault and state representatives on the board of the company to put in place interim governance. While the French government isn’t demanding Ghosn’s formal dismissal, he is no longer in a position to run the automaker, Le Maire told French radio.
Yesterday, President Emmanuel Macron had already said he would remain “extremely vigilant” regarding the stability of the Renault-Nissan alliance. One immediate step will be to fill the post of Renault CEO, which might fall to Chief Operating Officer Thierry Bollore, whom Ghosn himself had previously called a “good candidate” to eventually replace him at the French carmaker.
Bollore will be proposed at the meeting tonight as Renault’s interim leader, together with Philippe Lagayette, an independent board member, as non-executive chairman, according to people familiar with the plan, who asked not be identified ahead of the meeting.
Le Maire said the government will seek evidence from Japanese authorities, after the French side was all but blindsided by the probe and subsequent arrest Monday. The board of Renault and the Macron government were both caught unaware by the allegations, according to people familiar with the matter. A Renault spokeswoman declined to comment on the minister’s plans.
Broader Probe
The alleged wrongdoing may have have been more widespread. According to Nikkei, Ghosn may have received unreported funds from the Dutch Renault-Nissan venture amounting to about 100 million yen ($880,000).
In a memo to employees sent on Monday, Bollore expressed “full support for our chairman and CEO,” calling the alliance an “industrial gem that must be protected and nurtured.” Renault confirmed the content of the letter, which was cited in full by the Financial Times.
While there’s little doubt that Ghosn’s ride atop the global car industry has come to a rapid halt, there’s less clarity on the nature of his transgressions. Japanese broadcaster NHK said Tuesday that Nissan paid “huge sums” toward Ghosn’s residences sprinkled across the globe. The real estate in Rio de Janeiro, Beirut, Paris and Amsterdam, had “no legitimate business reason” and Ghosn wasn’t paying at least some of the rent, the report said.
At a late-night press conference in Tokyo Monday, Nissan Chief Executive Officer Hiroto Saikawa declined to give details on the charges, only saying that had both understated his income and misused company funds, including expenses and investment funds.
Real Estate, Investments
All told, Ghosn failed to declare some 5 billion yen in his income on Nissan’s official securities reports submitted over five years starting from 2011, prosecutors in Tokyo said Monday. According to Japanese law, Ghosn can be held in custody for up to 23 days without being charged.
The sudden downfall of the larger-than-life executive has spooked investors. Nissan dropped as much as 6.5 percent in Tokyo Tuesday, while Renault continued its slide, falling as much as 4.8 percent in Paris. On Monday, the French stock fell to the lowest since January 2015.
Rating Reviews
Nissan’s credit rating is also at risk as a result. Standard & Poor’s put its long-term A rating on watch for a possible downgrade, saying profitability might weaken substantially in coming years if the alleged misconduct damages the brand image enough to seriously depress unit sales or hurt the alliance. Moody’s Investor Service separately called the probe “credit negative” for Nissan, though Renault’s outlook is unaffected, it said.
Over the course of almost two decades, Nissan has grown into the larger of the two main partners by deliveries and sales -- but it has less say. Renault owns just over 43 percent of Nissan, compared with the Japanese company’s 15 percent stake in the French partner. It also boasts full voting rights in the alliance, while Nissan has none. That lopsided structure was always a point of contention between the French and the Japanese side, and Ghosn was in no small part responsible for preserving the peace between both sides.
“The issue is who’s going to control the alliance, and Saikawa has clearly put his cards on the table,” said Kenneth Courtis, chairman of Starfort Investment Holdings, an investment, private equity and commodity group.

768,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 20, 2018 03:00PM ET</span>",Wider U.S.-German Yield Gap Is Money-Maker for One Quant Fund,"(Bloomberg) -- As 10-year U.S. and German yields go their separate ways, QS Investors LLC’s global macro strategy is wagering the spread has more room to run.
John Iborg, a portfolio manager at the $20 billion quantitative firm, expects the gap between the two rates will widen to a record 300 basis points by year-end, from about 270 now. The firm’s macro fund has expressed this view through interest-rate futures since the start of 2018, when the spread was about 200 basis points.
Underlying Iborg’s confidence is his bearish outlook for Treasuries, which he expects to be pressured lower by a combination of strong U.S. economic data, ballooning debt supply and a Federal Reserve intent on raising rates three or four times next year. On the other side of the trade, he sees bunds staying in a range as European growth cools and the European Central Bank keeps benchmark rates unchanged until late 2019.
“It’s been one of our highest conviction and most profitable trades this year,” said New York-based Iborg, who was previously an interest-rate strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). “It’s been our best position on a total return and risk-adjusted basis.”
The 10-year U.S.-German rate differential reached an unprecedented 279 basis points this month as benchmark Treasury yields flirted with their year-to-date high of 3.26 percent. Iborg expects 10-year U.S. yields to return to the 3.25 percent area by year-end, from about 3.05 percent currently. German 10-year debt yields about 0.35 percent.
Human Intervention
The global macro strategy he helps oversee relies on tactical models that take into account inputs such as momentum, yield curves and capital flows to identify potential trades. While the macro portfolio is “heavily driven” by those models, managers can intervene.
When it comes to the Treasury-bund spread, however, the computers and Iborg’s fundamental views align.
“The last employment report was strong, inflation continues to meet market expectations -- that all points to the Fed staying on track,” he said. But in Europe, “I don’t think there’s any reason for growth to exceed expectations in the near future, so that equals bunds treading water into year-end.”
While Treasury yields have climbed to multi-year highs across the curve this year, bunds have had a decidedly less dramatic 2018. After touching their highest level since 2015 in February, 10-year German yields have traded between 0.3 percent and 0.6 percent for the past few months, and are below where they ended 2017.
The same forces that should drive U.S. and German yields apart will likely send the euro and the dollar in opposite directions as well, according to Iborg. For that reason, QS’s macro fund is positioned to benefit from further dollar strength against the euro. The greenback has gained 5.5 percent against the common currency in 2018.
“We’re long the dollar and short euro, and that’s one of our higher conviction views as well,” Iborg said. “It’s along the same lines of reasoning for our Treasury-bund spread -- this divergence in economic growth, coupled with rates rising in the U.S. and not so much in Europe.”"

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walmart Inc (N:WMT),  Target  Corp (N:TGT) and  Best Buy  Co (N:BBY) have made changes to their gift card programs to reduce the risk of fraud as consumers enter the holiday shopping season.
Barbara Underwood and Josh Shapiro, the attorneys general of New York and Pennsylvania, announced the changes on Tuesday, as part of a more than year-long initiative to thwart scam artists.
The changes include reducing purchase limits on store-branded gift cards in a single transaction, limiting how much can be loaded onto the cards, and prohibiting the redemption of store-branded gift cards for other gift cards.
Walmart, Target and Best Buy also bolstered training to help employees spot scams and warn potential victims.
""By working collaboratively with these retailers, we've created a way for businesses to take proactive steps to prevent scams,"" Underwood said in a statement.
The National Retail Federation said gift cards are the most popular item on consumers' wish lists for the 12th straight year, requested by 60 percent of 7,313 people surveyed.
Last month, the Federal Trade Commission said 26 percent of victims reporting scams between January and September said they paid with gift cards, up from just 7 percent in 2015.
Losses through September from gift and 'reload' cards totaled $53 million, up from $40 million for all of 2017, with a median loss of about $500 per incident. (http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/data-spotlight/2018/10/scammers-increasingly-demand-payment-gift-card)
Regulators said scammers often use retail gift cards to buy third-party cards such as iTunes, Steam and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Play that can be resold on the black market, and impersonate other people to swindle unwitting victims.
Common impersonations include grandchildren claiming they got into trouble, such as arrests or accidents, and needed money for bail or lawyers; Internal Revenue Service agents claiming, often angrily, that taxes were owed; and tech support employees seeking payments to fix alleged viruses on victims' computers.
Underwood and Shapiro said retail gift cards cannot be used for such expenses, and that the IRS does not cold-call people.

They also said consumers should not volunteer gift card numbers to people they don't know, and should contact state consumer officials or law enforcement if they believe they were targeted.

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) is poised to make top financial and operational appointments as incoming CEO Guillaume Faury tightens his grip after months of turmoil over corruption investigations and output delays, sources familiar with the matter said.
The European planemaker could announce a new German chief financial officer as early as Wednesday to take over from Harald Wilhelm, who announced in May that he would leave next spring at the same time as current chief executive Tom Enders.
It could also name a new operations boss to succeed Tom Williams (NYSE:WMB), the chief operating officer of the main Airbus planemaking business, the sources said.
Airbus declined comment.
Williams, a Glasgow-born veteran troubleshooter and Airbus's unofficial UK ambassador, had agreed to postpone retirement until the end of the year to help tackle production delays but is likely to be succeeded by a German appointee in what could be seen as a blow to the profile of the company’s UK arm ahead of Brexit.
Programs chief Didier Evrard also delayed his retirement until the end of the year.
Reuters reported last month that Airbus was close to naming a German executive from outside the group to replace fellow German Wilhelm after a board-driven management overhaul hastened his surprise resignation.
British and French authorities are investigating the use of middlemen in jetliner sales and Airbus says it is supplying information to U.S. authorities.
Wilhelm has not been accused of wrongdoing and it was he who initiated the planemaker’s decision in 2014 to halt a decades-old system of middlemen supporting jet sales.
But sources have said that his departure reflects a clearout designed to help Airbus to win more lenient judicial settlements by presenting a fresh face to investigators. A number of operational appointments, meanwhile, is expected to underscore Faury’s focus on stabilizing output and fixing quality problems.

Airbus last month cut its core 2018 delivery target by 2 percent to 782 jets and faces a continued challenge to maintain that goal, people familiar with its production plans said.

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 hit a three-week low on Tuesday, as weak earnings from retailers including  Target  and Kohl's as well as a fall in energy shares added to worries for Wall Street, which is still reeling from a selloff in technology stocks.
Target Corp shares (N:TGT) slumped 10.28 percent after the retailer's third-quarter profit missed analysts' estimates as investments in its online business, higher wages and price cuts hurt margins.
Department store operator Kohl's Corp (N:KSS) shed 9.42 percent after its full-year profit forecast fell below expectations.
Warnings from retailers prompted caution ahead of the holiday season, increasing selling pressure on equities as investors fret about a slowdown in global growth, peaking corporate earnings and rising interest rates.
Apple Inc (O:AAPL) shares fell 3.80 percent amid concerns about slowing demand for iPhones. The stock, which has led the market through much of its bull run, is at its lowest level since early May.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell to its lowest level in more than seven months and is now down about 14.6 percent from its record closing high in late August.
""Market has clearly run into some headwinds. We've got rising rates, strong dollar, concerns over tariffs between U.S. and China and we've got the oil selloff,"" said Christopher Larkin, senior vice president of trading at E-Trade Financial in New Jersey.
""There are a lot of things working against the market right now ... We're seeing a couple of stocks, which are pretty popular specifically with retail investors, under quite a bit of pressure.""
Home improvement chain Lowe's Cos Inc (N:LOW) fell 4.76 percent after it unveiled further plans of restructuring in the face of worse-than-expected comparable sales numbers.
TJX Cos Inc (N:TJX) slipped 3.4 percent after the off-price retailer's holiday-quarter earnings forecast fell largely below estimates. Smaller rival Ross Stores (O:ROST) fell 6.94 percent as its fourth-quarter forecast for same-store sales came below analysts' expectations.
The S&P 500 retailing index <.SPXRT> lost 1.83 percent, falling for eight straight sessions.
At 13:05 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was down 455.04 points, or 1.82 percent, at 24,562.40, the S&P 500 (SPX) was down 40.17 points, or 1.49 percent, at 2,650.56 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) was down 91.79 points, or 1.31 percent, at 6,936.69.
However, the three indexes were off their session lows.
The FANG group eased off their earlier losses, while the Philadelphia SE semiconductor (SOX) index clawed back losses to edge 0.1 percent higher.
Signs of slowing demand for Apple's iPhones have wide-ranging implications for technology and internet companies.
Should Apple's loss hold through the day, its shares would have lost more than 20 percent of their value, or around $250 billion, since closing at a record high on October 3.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) trimmed its price target on Apple for the second time in just over a week, saying the balance of price and features in the new iPhone XR may not have been well-received by users outside of the United States.
The S&P energy index (SPNY) tumbled 2.92 percent as oil prices plunged another 5 percent amid concerns about rising global supplies. 
""We're in a holiday week so there are fewer traders than normal and that's a problem. Because whatever direction the markets go in, it's exacerbated,"" said Kim Forrest, senior portfolio manager at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 5.57-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 2.73-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P index recorded 20 new 52-week highs and 41 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded eight new highs and 244 new lows.

MONTREAL (Reuters) - Canada's  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) is the front-runner to win a New Jersey Transit (NJT) rail car contract, two sources familiar with the matter said, in a boost for the plane-and-train-maker's North American business which has wrestled with delivery delays and has lost orders to rivals.
The order for up to 999 multilevel passenger cars, including options, would be one of the largest contracts in years if most of the options are exercised, one of the sources said.
Chinese state rail giant CRRC Corp (SS:601766) was also vying for the contract. NJT ruled out the competing bid from the Chinese company, the sources said, although it was not immediately clear why.
CRRC and NJT did not respond to requests for comment. 
A Bombardier spokesman declined to comment on what he called an ""ongoing procurement."" 

Reuters reported in April that Bombardier was vying for the contract from NJT, which planned to order 113 multilevel passenger cars, with hundreds more in options, to modernize its aging fleet.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Buying a second-hand luxury watch on eBay (O:EBAY) should get easier next year as the company gets better at checking that only genuine timepieces are sold on the online platform.
""By the end of 2019, we look to have an entire suite of services available to all luxury watch sellers and buyers on the platform,"" James Hendy, in charge of eBay's authentication service for luxury goods, told Reuters in a recent interview.
While new watch sales have grown more slowly, the used market has been boosted by younger consumers happy to buy online, prompting Cartier owner  Richemont  (S:CFR) to buy second-hand platform Watchfinder.co.uk.
Hendy said eBay's transaction volume of second-hand luxury watches would exceed $1 billion in 2018. This compares to volumes of around 1.3 billion euros expected at German rival Chrono24 by its co-CEO and founder Tim Stracke.
eBay allowed approved professional sellers, like Watchbox, to list timepieces on eBay with an ""authenticity verified"" tag in September by extending its eBay Authenticate program from handbags to luxury watches.
And from the first quarter of 2019, eBay will allow consumers to instantly sell their luxury watch on the site, adding authentication services to cover all consumer-to-consumer (C2C) transactions during the second half of the year.
Swiss luxury watch brands have long hesitated to sell online and used to look at platforms like eBay or specialized websites Chrono24 or Chronext as a nuisance because watches which retailers find hard to sell often end up online at a discount.
However, eBay is now looking at partnerships with luxury brands as it targets a market estimated to be worth around 17.6 billion euros ($20 billion) when jewelry is included, a recent report by Bain & Company said. 
The used market has been boosted by younger consumers happy to shop online, prompting watch manufacturers like Richemont or Audemars Piguet to enter the market.
""I believe that in the next few years the primary and secondary market are going to come together,"" Hendy said, adding that brands working with eBay would be able to engage with customers directly via its platform.

Citron Research said in tweet that it had taken a long position in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), sending the company's shares soaring more than 4%.
""This is the first time in two years [that the] stock offers an appealing risk-reward to investors,"" Citron Research said.
Citron's upbeat outlook on Nvidia marked a change of heart from an earlier note in August, when the research firm detailed 10 reasons why Nvidia would drop to $200 stock by April 2019.
Nvidia reported mixed earnings last week and delivered a dour outlook on current quarter growth, blaming excess inventories, but Citron Research said the chipmaker ""will eat through [its] inventory issue.""
Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), which has also been plagued by struggles shifting excess inventories, rose more than 1%.
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), meanwhile, continued to be pressured by reports from a day earlier claiming that rival chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) was set to land an order from  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) for server chips, which would help the company challenge Intel in the data center sector. Intel fell 0.5%.

779,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2018 12:55PM ET</span>","Target shares tumble after profit miss, big jump in inventories","By Nandita Bose
(Reuters) -  Target  Corp (N:TGT) said on Tuesday that third-quarter profit missed estimates as investments in its online business, higher wages in a tight labor market and price cuts hurt margins and a big jump in inventories ahead of the critical holiday season worried investors.
Target shares tumbled as much as 15 percent as the retailer also reported that comparable sales missed expectations.
The third-quarter performance was in sharp contrast to rivals Walmart Inc (N:WMT) and Macy's Inc (N:M), which raised their forecasts for the current year as a strong economy boosted consumer spending. 
Addressing the margin pressures, Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell reiterated on a conference call that its efforts to boost growth ""involves a commitment of resources, which explains why I've already used the word investment five times in these remarks.""
Wall Street did not take well to Cornell's comments. ""It's becoming a margin story for Target,"" said David Russell, a vice president at TradeStation, the fifth largest U.S. digital trading platform, adding that investors expected better margins despite its investments.
""Brian Cornell was outspoken multiple times in the past months about how great business was and that adds to the shock on the Street today,"" Russell said.
During the second quarter, Cornell said the consumer environment is ""perhaps the strongest I've seen in my career.""
Analysts said the inventories were weighing on the stock. Cowen analyst Oliver Chen said they jumped 17.8 percent year over year versus sales growth of 5.3 percent, implying a negative 12.2 percent sales-to-inventory spread.
""(This) spread was negative for the third consecutive quarter,"" he said. Target said it was carrying higher inventories in anticipation of increased holiday spending.
Target expects to deliver a strong holiday performance by expanding its toy department in more than 500 stores, offering two-day free shipping with no minimum purchases on thousands of items and accelerating the pace of store remodels, he said.
Target expects same-store sales to rise about 5 percent in the final quarter, signaling a slowdown during the most critical time of the year for retailers even though it was above estimates of 4.8 percent. For the latest quarter sales rose 5.1 percent. 
Excluding items, Target earned $1.09 per share in the quarter, below the average estimate of $1.12. 
Gross margins were 28.7 percent, falling short of the estimate of 29.55 percent. 
Sales in the quarter totaled $17.59 billion, below the average estimate of $17.8 billion.
Online sales soared 49 percent, outpacing the 41 percent rise in the second quarter and a 28 percent gain in the first. Target is offering free two-day shipping on many items through Dec. 22 with no minimum order or membership required.
The Minneapolis-based retailer said it gained market share in all key product categories and customer traffic rose 5.3 percent.
Target was still confident of its earlier full-year adjusted earnings outlook of $5.30 to $5.50 per share versus the Wall Street view of $5.41, according to IBES Refinitiv.

Target shares slid 9.9 percent to $69.51 after falling as low as $66.12.

780,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2018 12:50PM ET</span>","Sainsbury's-Asda deal could hurt farmers, says union","LONDON (Reuters) - British supermarket group Sainsbury's (L:SBRY) proposed takeover of rival Asda could lead to a further price squeeze for farmers and reduce the choice and innovation of products available for shoppers, the National Farmers' Union (NFU) said on Tuesday.
Sainsbury's agreed in April a 7.3 billion pounds ($9.4 billion) cash and shares takeover of Walmart's (N:WMT) Asda - a combination that could overtake  Tesco  (L:TSCO) as Britain's biggest supermarket group if it is approved by the competition regulator.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is currently probing the deal and seeking views from interested parties.
In oral evidence to the CMA, the NFU's head of food and farming Philip Hambling said farmers were concerned whether the combined group could deliver its proposed 10 percent saving for shoppers without passing the pressure on to farmers.
""At a time when farms are already facing intense price pressure, the prospect of a further squeeze on price leaves farmers concerned about the potential impacts on their businesses,"" he said.
“Continually squeezing margins can take away the ability of the food and farming industry to invest and improve quality, range and sustainability,"" added Hambling.
Sainsbury's and Asda's key argument is that the deal would lower prices and improve the customer offer of both brands, while allowing suppliers to grow their businesses. 
Both grocers have said they believe the CMA will not insist on a level of store disposals that will make the deal, announced in April, unpalatable.
The CMA said last month it expected to issue provisional findings early next year, ahead of a final report in March.

791,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2018 12:11PM ET</span>",German watchdog asks Deutsche for information on Danske: source,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's financial watchdog has asked  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) to provide information on its dealings with  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE), which is caught up in money laundering allegations, a source close to the matter said on Tuesday.
After evaluating the data, the regulator - BaFin - will decide whether to launch a formal investigation into Deutsche Bank, the source said. 
BaFin declined to comment.
A spokesman for Deutsche Bank said: ""We are neither aware of any investigation by BaFin nor have we received any formal requests for information.""
On Monday, Deutsche Bank confirmed for the first time that it had acted as a correspondent bank for Danske Bank in Estonia. 
""Our role was to process payments for Danske Bank,"" a spokesman for Deutsche Bank said on Monday. ""We terminated the relationship in 2015 after identifying suspicious activity.""
A spokesman for Danske Bank declined to comment on its relationship with Deutsche Bank.
A whistleblower, who revealed alleged money laundering involving Danske Bank, had said on Monday that a major European bank helped process up to $150 billion in suspicious payments, or nearly two-thirds of the transactions under scrutiny.
The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said BaFin was trying to determine to what extent Deutsche, as correspondent bank, should have been aware of who was behind the transactions it was helping to process.
A finance industry expert at a major consulting firm said that regulators increasingly expect correspondent banks to know the senders and receivers of the funds they help to transfer, especially in high risk regions. 
The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that Deutsche Bank found in an internal investigation that it handled about $150 billion in potentially suspicious transactions for Danske Bank. A Deutsche Bank spokesman declined to comment on the Journal report. 
In September, BaFin ordered Deutsche Bank to do more to prevent money laundering and ""terrorist financing,"" and appointed a third party to assess progress.
Deutsche Bank is restructuring to recover from three years of losses and has been trying to draw a line under a legal and regulatory issues that the group has been caught up in since the financial crisis.
The bank's shares were down 4 percent in late trading in Frankfurt, and are down 48 percent so far this year.

Camp Fire is the deadliest wildfire in California's history, incinerating some 12,000 homes along the way, while the Woolsey Fire in the foothills above Malibu has threatened thousands of homes.
Catastrophe risk modeler Risk Management Solutions has estimated insured losses from the Camp and Woolsey fires to range from $9 billion to $13 billion.
Personal lines insurance, which includes property and casualty insurance, is expected to take the biggest hit, Fitch said, adding the losses could also extend to automobile insurance.
Commercial property and business interruption claims could also be significant, the ratings agency said.
Industry analysts, however, broadly expect the wildfire-related catastrophe losses to be manageable for insurers and reinsurers.
The insurance companies affected by the wildfires are generally the larger national carriers that have large capital bases, Fitch noted.
As a result, the ratings agency does not expect a major deterioration in financial strength if these companies incur losses roughly in proportion to their market share.

Shares of large-cap property and casualty insurers such as American International Group (N:AIG), Traveler (N:TRV) and Chubb Ltd (N:CB) were down nearly a percent each on Tuesday, in line with broader U.S. market weakness.

796,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2018 11:58AM ET</span>","Amazon, Blackstone among bidders for 22 Disney sports networks: CNBC","By Vibhuti Sharma
(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and private equity firm Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group are bidding for Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's 22 regional sports networks, including New York-focused Yes Network, CNBC reported on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.
Disney, which is buying Twenty-First Century Fox Inc's film and television assets, had said it would divest 22 of Fox's regional sports networks as part of its agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice.
The story gave no indication about the value of the bids. Sources had earlier told https://www.reuters.com/article/us-fox-m-a-comcast/comcast-lining-up-buyers-for-fox-sports-assets-sources-idUSKBN1JZ23Z Reuters that these networks could be worth as much as $20 billion.
An unnamed sovereign wealth fund and the New York Yankees are also bidding for the New York network, CNBC said.
If Amazon clinches the deal, it would pay a higher price than the $13.7 billion the retail giant paid to buy Whole Foods Co last year.
Amazon has moved aggressively into TV to bolster its Prime membership service, which offers free delivery and content for a flat monthly fee. Its bid for the sports assets underlines its ambition to take on traditional pay-TV broadcasters in one of their most reliable sources of revenue.
""I've always viewed Amazon's video strategy as having three elements to it – Prime Instant Video, the Channels business and live ad-supported TV,"" Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell said.
""The latter is the least built-out, but the RSNs (regional sports networks) would fit well in terms of establishing this part of the offering.""
Amazon already has rights to air 20 English Premier League soccer matches, giving its Prime Video online streaming service a foothold in the most-watched sports league in the world. It also has rights to America's National Football League and National Hockey League. 
Sports leagues are anticipating that the big tech companies will bid aggressively when rights come up for renewal in the next few years. 
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) already stream live sports events. 
Fox Executive Chairman Lachlan Murdoch had hinted earlier this month that it could buy back the regional sports networks it sold to Disney.
Fox did not submit a bid in the first round for the networks although there was the potential that they would join in the second round, CNBC reported.
The second round of bids are expected before the year ends and due diligence on the bids begin next week.
While Amazon declined to comment, Disney, New York Yankees and Blackstone did not respond to Reuters request for comment.

Shares of Walt Disney shares were down about 2 pct at $113.16, while those of Amazon were marginally higher.

(Reuters) - Lowe's Cos Inc said on Tuesday it was looking to shed its retail operations in Mexico and two of its smaller U.S. businesses as the country's second-biggest home improvement chain strives to compete with rivals including  Home Depot .
Shares of the Mooresville, North Carolina-based company fell nearly 3.6 percent in morning trading after Lowe's blamed inventory missteps for a smaller-than-expected rise in comparable store sales. Larger rival Home Depot Inc (NYSE:HD) shares were also down nearly 2 percent. 
Under Marvin Ellison, Lowe's newly-appointed chief executive officer, the company has been streamlining its business by shutting underperforming stores and cutting back on slow moving inventory.
The company has perennially lagged Home Depot in same-store sales, despite having roughly the same number of stores.
Lowe's said it was looking at all options for its chain of 13 stores in Mexico and that it was ""exiting"" its U.S. contracting services business Alacrity Renovation Services and security and smart home app Iris Smart Home.
Earlier this month, the company announced the closure of 51 underperforming stores in the United States and Canada, which followed the shutdown of 99 Orchard Supply stores in California.
""We believe Lowe's is moving in the right direction, but this quarter's results show that change is not linear or quick in large retail organizations,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Seth Basham said.
Sales at stores open for more than a year rose 1.5 percent in the third quarter, well below analysts' expectations of a 2.93 percent increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Ellison said the company failed to sell more due to the assortment of merchandise and an inability to restock shelves with the right kind of inventory, despite a rise in customer visits. 
""We see the issue as poor execution, not a macro concern,"" Ellison said on a post-earnings call, referring to the company's third-quarter sales.
""Although interest rates have ticked up and housing turnover has been pressured, the home improvement backdrop remains strong.""
The company cut its forecast for full-year sales growth to about 4 percent from 4.5 percent and comparable sales growth to about 2.5 percent from 3 percent.
Lowe's net earnings fell to $629 million, or 78 cents per share, from $872 million, or $1.05 per share, a year earlier.

Excluding items, Lowe's earned $1.04 per share, beating estimates of 98 cents. Net sales rose nearly 4 percent to $17.42 billion, edging past expectations of $17.36 billion.

801,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2018 11:05AM ET</span>",Denmark aims to improve whistleblower protection amid Danske Bank scandal,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Denmark pledged to improve legal protection for whistleblowers after a British man who helped expose alleged money laundering at  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE), spoke publicly for the first time.
In a widening scandal, authorities in Denmark, Estonia, Britain and the United States are investigating payments totaling 200 billion euros ($228.5 billion) made through the tiny Estonian branch of Denmark's biggest bank from 2007-2015.
But the lawyer for the main whistleblower in the case has said that Denmark's whistleblower protection rules are among the weakest in Europe, referring to surveys by anti-graft watchdog Transparency International and Blueprint for Free Speech.
""Denmark is rated zero, meaning the lowest - really no protection for whistleblowers, in the worst category for all of Europe,"" U.S. lawyer Stephen Kohn told a public hearing in Copenhagen on Monday.
His client, Howard Wilkinson, told a Danish parliamentary hearing on Monday that a major European bank helped process up to $150 billion in suspicious payments for Danske, or nearly two-thirds of the transactions under scrutiny.
But Kohn said Wilkinson, who headed Danske Bank's Baltics trading unit from 2007-2014, risks being prosecuted under Danish bank secrecy laws for sharing his knowledge about wrongdoings at Danske with authorities.
""If Howard Wilkinson is correct in that he can't talk to the Danish authorities without being prosecuted, that must obviously be changed,"" Business Minister Rasmus Jarlov said on Twitter on Monday. Jarlov was looking into the matter and had no further comment, a spokesman said on Tuesday.
Kohn said on Sunday Wilkinson was committed to cooperating with Denmark's parliament despite the risk of prosecution.
Though the Nordic nation has freedom of speech written into its 1953 constitution, rules governing whistleblowers are vague, Socialist lawmaker Lisbeth Bech Poulsen said.
""We need a law on whistleblower protection and a place where you can go anonymously and risk-free and get counseling and an authorization to go ahead and talk to authorities, even if legally (restrained) by a contract,"" she told Reuters.

Two other parties, the Social Democrats and Danish People's Party, have also called for better whistleblower protection in the wake of the Danske Bank scandal, suggesting there would be a majority in parliament for such a step.

806,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2018 10:47AM ET</span>","Canadian air force running short of pilots, jets: top watchdog","By David Ljunggren
OTTAWA (Reuters) - The Canadian air force is increasingly running short of combat-capable fighter jets and pilots and government attempts to address the problem have only made it worse, the nation's top watchdog said on Tuesday.
The report by Auditor General Michael Ferguson is the latest blow to a decade-long and trouble-plagued attempt by successive administrations to replace Canada's CF-18 jets, some of which have been flying for almost 40 years.
""National Defence (the defense ministry) has not done enough to manage risks related to Canada's fighter aircraft fleet ... until a replacement fleet is in place,"" said Ferguson.
Defense officials are set to issue final specifications for a new fleet of 88 jets next May. The contract will be worth between C$15 billion and C$19 billion ($11.3 billion to $14.4 billion).
Repeated delays mean some CF-18s will have to fly until 2032, much later than expected. Ferguson said the planes had not been significantly upgraded for combat since 2008 - in part because defense officials thought the new jets would be operating by 2020 - and were therefore increasingly vulnerable.
In 2016, at a time when qualified pilots and technicians were leaving in growing numbers, the ruling Liberals ordered the air force to increase the number of fighters available for operations by a quarter.
To help overcome the shortage of planes, the government vowed to buy 18 Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co F-18 Super Hornet jets. Ferguson said it did so even though the defense ministry indicated the move would worsen the personnel shortage.
Ottawa later scrapped the plan after a dispute with Boeing and moved to buy 25 used CF-18s from Australia.
Ferguson said the military would have to spend an extra C$3 billion to extend the lifespan of the CF-18s and buy and operate the Australian jets ""without a plan to deal with its biggest obstacles to meeting the new operational requirement: a shortage of pilots and declining combat capability"".
Ferguson said the defense ministry did not have a plan to boost the number of CF-18 pilots. If they continue to leave at the current rate, there will not be enough left to train the next generation, he added.
Canadian Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan is due to respond later on Tuesday.
The other U.S. contender to supply the new jets is  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) Corp's F-35. Dassault Aviation SA this month withdrew its Rafale fighter.
The other contenders are the Saab AB Gripen and the Eurofighter from Airbus.

808,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2018 10:40AM ET</span>",Dearth of Italian bond deals flashes long-term debt danger,"By Abhinav Ramnarayan and Giulio Piovaccari
LONDON/MILAN (Reuters) - Just eight months into a period of intense political strife, Italy's debt profile is starting to deteriorate as the country is forced to depend on shorter-dated local bond auctions and small individual savers to raise money.
Staggering under a debt ratio of 130 percent of annual economic output and one of the world's biggest bond issuance programs, Italy needs its borrowing to be low-cost but also long-maturity; generally, the longer the tenor of the debt, the lower the risk of repayment difficulties. 
Until recently it was succeeding -- the average maturity of Italian government debt reached 6.96 years in February, the highest in five years. But since then, it has been falling and stands now at 6.79 years, an 18-month low, according to a BBVA (MC:BBVA) analysis of Italian Treasury data. 
The reason is that Italy has not recently been able to attempt a debt syndication -- a deal structure in which borrowers appoint banks to sell debt directly to international investors, instead of just running bond auctions at home.
Such deals offer access to a far wider, deep-pocketed investor pool and allow borrowers to raise more money in one hit, often with longer tenors. But the populist government in Rome and its row with the European Union over budget spending have sapped appetite for Italian bonds. 
""Syndications allow you to open up new lines, such as the 50-year bond Italy issued in 2016, which helps them lock in low borrowing costs for many years to come,"" said a banker at one of Italy's three primary dealers, banks appointed by governments to manage their debt issuance.
Without regularly conducting syndications to sell long-dated debt, Italy's average debt maturity will likely drop further, bankers at Italy's two other primary dealers agreed. 
""(A syndicated bond deal) is a also a strong signal that you have market access. If Italy was to go the rest of the year without a syndication, it doesn't look good. If they still can't come in January (2019) - that looks very, very bad,"" the banker said. 
He asked to remain anonymous as he is not authorized to speak about his clients. 
Since May, Italian borrowing costs have marched steadily higher and yield spreads over Germany -- effectively the premium investors demand to hold Italian risk -- has doubled.
Foreigners have shed a net 69 billion euros ($79 billion) in Italian government bonds since May when the right-wing League and anti-establishment 5-Star Movement first joined forces. 
As a result, the Treasury has had to rely heavily on bond auctions, where it has limited control over the price and timing and is typically restricted to tapping existing bonds. 
Average maturity tends to be shorter too, as the auctions are a mix of shorter and longer-dated debt. The Nov. 13 auction for instance raised 5.5 billion euros via three-year, seven-year and 20-year bonds.
This week, the Treasury even turned to small savers to try to raise money, tapping a type of bond it first used during the 2011-2012 crisis. But bourse data showed retail investors were unenthusiastic, submitting orders for just 481.35 million euros on the first day.
""I wouldn't say that Italy is immediately in trouble because they aren't issuing any long bonds but it is still part of a big issue,"" said Marie Owens Thomsen, global head of economic research at Indosuez Wealth Management. 
""Many countries that have record debt levels and how they are going to manage this record debt, what the profile is going to be, what the average maturity is going to be, is an issue."" 
Graphic: Average maturity of Italian government debt - https://tmsnrt.rs/2PB3tYB
TERMING OUT
Italy undoubtedly benefited in recent years from investors' hunt for yield. As the European Central Bank's 2.6 trillion-euro bond-buying scheme depressed borrowing costs, investors sought out longer and longer maturities for a few additional basis points of return. 
Euro zone countries enjoyed not just record low borrowing costs but also were able to issue long-dated debt to smoothen out debt profiles swollen during the debt crisis. 
Between 2014 and 2017, Italy completed three syndications a year, mostly selling long-dated bonds including a blockbuster 9 billion euro 30-year deal in February 2016 and a 5 billion-euro 50-year bond in October the same year. 
This year, however, it has only completed one syndication, a 9 billion-euro, 20-year deal in January. 
Spain, on the other hand, has raised 27 billion euros from four syndications this year already. That has helped it stretch its average debt maturity this year to 7.47 years, just off the 7.58-year record hit in July, according to data from the Spanish Treasury. 
The primary dealers told Reuters Italy had been monitoring bond markets for a post-summer syndication, potentially a 30-year bond, but the government's contentious draft budget ruled this out. 
Italy's 30-year borrowing costs are close to their highest level in half a decade at 4.13 percent. The coupon on its last 30-year bond syndication, a March 2048 note, was 3.45 percent.  
Rome may still try next year to revive plans for a syndicated 30- or 15-year bond, said Filippo Mormando, a strategist at MPS Capital Services, the investment banking arm of Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena and one of Italy's primary dealers. 
But if political tensions are still simmering, the debt agency may have to rely more on retail bonds, Mormando said.

""What might be missing is more 'creative' stuff, like bonds in foreign currency, longer-dated inflation linked, green bonds like the one France is doing, social bonds and stuff like that,"" he added.

812,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2018 10:22AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Nissan expands Ghosn probe to include Renault alliance - sources,"By Laurence Frost
PARIS (Reuters) - Nissan's investigation into alleged misconduct by Chairman Carlos Ghosn is expanding to include Renault-Nissan finances, sources told Reuters - in a further sign that Nissan may seek to loosen its French parent's hold on their global carmaking alliance.
Nissan told Renault's board on Monday it had evidence of potential wrongdoing at Renault-Nissan BV, the Dutch venture overseeing alliance operations under Renault's ultimate control, three people with knowledge of the matter said.
The private communication from Nissan Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa came as the Japanese carmaker, 43.4 percent-owned by  Renault  (PA:RENA), announced that an investigation had uncovered misconduct involving Ghosn including under-reporting of his compensation and personal use of company assets.
Renault and Nissan both declined to comment.
Saikawa, once Ghosn's protégé, also disclosed plans to strip Ghosn of his chairmanship, after the 64-year-old industry veteran was arrested in Tokyo along with fellow director Greg Kelly.
Neither of the detained men has had the opportunity to comment publicly on the allegations against them.
The 19-year history of the Renault-Nissan alliance, enlarged in 2016 to include Mitsubishi Motors, has been marked by tensions among the carmakers and the French government, Renault's main shareholder with a 15 percent stake.
Under government pressure, Ghosn, who is also Renault chairman and CEO, had agreed this year to explore a closer tie-up that would tap deeper synergies, safeguard French industrial interests and make the alliance ""irreversible"". 
The plan raised hackles in Tokyo. Nissan, while almost 60 percent bigger than Renault by sales, remains the junior partner in their shareholding hierarchy with a smaller reciprocal 15 percent non-voting stake in Renault.
At a news conference in Japan late on Monday, Saikawa outlined three broad categories of accusation against Ghosn: under-reporting of compensation; misrepresenting company investments; and making personal use of company assets. He gave no examples, citing the secrecy of a police investigation.
The Nissan CEO nevertheless took aim at a Renault-led alliance setup that ""concentrates power in one individual"", and said a new board committee would examine its role in the scandal.
""In terms of structural issues, 43 percent is held by Renault and the head of Renault is currently serving as (chairman) of Nissan,"" Saikawa said.
""Of course this isn't the only cause, but it's one of the factors or drivers. So the committee ... will have a deep dive on this issue as well.""
French officials have mobilized to defend the alliance since Ghosn's surprise arrest in Japan - which came as both countries stage events to mark 160 years of diplomatic relations.
President Emmanuel Macron said France would ""remain extremely vigilant regarding the stability of the alliance"", the world's largest automotive grouping by sales.
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, who said the future of the industrial pairing was top priority, also pressed Renault's board to appoint interim leadership, saying Ghosn was ""no longer in a position where he is capable of leading Renault"".

The board, meeting later on Tuesday, will likely agree that director Philippe Lagayette should fill in as chairman, several people with knowledge of the deliberations said. It may also bolster Chief Operating Officer Thierry Bollore's powers.

Shares in Idea Bank have fallen by more than 40 percent since its owner, Polish billionaire Leszek Czarnecki, alleged corruption by Poland's financial regulator KNF last week.
Idea Bank, whose shares were down 12 percent at 1459 GMT, said in a statement that the central bank's suspension of its 50 percent requirement would last up to the end of 2021.
Czarnecki alleges that KNF head Marek Chrzanowski asked him to hire a specific lawyer and pay him 40 million zloty ($10.58 million) in exchange for the regulator's ""support"" for the billionaire' s troubled  Getin Noble Bank  (WA:GNB).
Chrzanowski, who has resigned from the post, denies any wrongdoing but analysts say the allegations have sparked concern among customers of Idea Bank and the larger Getin Noble.
This prompted the central bank to make a commitment at the weekend to offer liquidity and issue a reminder that deposits are guaranteed up to 100,000 euros ($114,040).
Idea Bank and the central bank did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters on Tuesday.
The central bank's rate-setting panel discussed the issue at its meeting on Tuesday and said it backed the decision to suspend the reserve requirement for Idea Bank. 
Opposition groups have called for a parliamentary inquiry into the allegations, but the eurosceptic Law and Justice (PiS) government says ongoing probes by prosecutors and anti-corruption officials are sufficient.
The central bank has supported Chrzanowski, with bank head Adam Glapinski, a close friend of PiS chief Jaroslaw Kaczynski, saying last Friday the regulator was ""an impeccably honest, noble, honourable, professional man"".

The exchange's announcement comes more than a month after another Chinese actress Fan Bingbing came under fire for failing to pay millions of dollars in taxes and fines.
On Tuesday, the exchange said Zhao and her husband Huang Youlong, as well as several other former executives of Tibet Longwei Culture Media and Zhejiang Sunriver Culture Co Ltd, were unfit to be directors, supervisors and senior executives of listed companies.
They will not be allowed to assume these positions for five years, the exchange said. 
Zhejiang Sunriver, Tibet Longwei, Zhao and Huang were all not immediately available for comment.
In late 2016, Tibet Longwei, controlled by Zhao and Huang, made a failed attempt to buy a 29.1 percent stake in Zhejiang Wanjia, which was later taken over by another investor and renamed Zhejiang Sunriver Culture. 
Longwei's bid had then drawn the scrutiny of the China Securities Regulatory Commission regarding information disclosure and its ability in financing takeovers as there were misleading statements and major omissions in the filings.
In November 2017, China's securities regulator fined and barred Zhao, who became a household name in China for starring in popular TV dramas, and Huang from trading in the mainland stock market for five years due to the takeover case.
""Due to the celebrity effect, Tibet Longwei has severely misled the market and its investors. This has seriously disrupted normal market operations and order,"" the exchange said on Tuesday.
Zhao and Fan's cases have prompted the Chinese government to crack down on celebrity hype.
In November, state media quoted the National Radio and Television Administration as saying that Chinese broadcasters and online entertainment sites should avoid celebrity hype and crack down on fake audience and click-through rates.

Tourism is a cornerstone of Egypt's economy, a source of income for millions of citizens and a major source of foreign exchange. But the sector suffered severely in the years following 2011's popular uprising and was further hampered by a spate of militant attacks which targeted visitors. 
Egypt's revenues from tourism jumped 77 percent year-on-year in the first half of 2018 to $4.8 billion, while the number of tourists arriving in the country increased by 41 percent to just over 5 million.
Travco Group, which owns over 40 hotels in Egypt and abroad and is the local agent for Germany's TUI Group (DE:TUIGn), raised its prices by 30-35 percent at the beginning of this winter season, its CEO Hamed El Chiaty told Reuters in an interview.
""The level of tourist bookings during the current winter holiday season in Egypt is promising,"" Chiaty said, adding that bookings from Germany, Italy, Poland and Ukraine were particularly promising.
In a devastating blow to the already struggling sector, Russia halted all flights to Egypt, and Britain stopped flights to Sinai, after an Islamist militant bomb attack brought down a Russian passenger plane in October 2015, killing everyone on board. 
There have not been any major attacks aimed at the tourist sector in well over a year and Russia resumed flights to Cairo in April, although it has yet to authorize its aircraft to land in the Red Sea resort of Sham al-Sheikh.
Chiaty said that Travco's price increases were the highest in seven years, rising to pre-2011 levels, while occupancy levels at the group's hotels were more than 80 percent, with the exception of Sharm al-Sheikh.
Travco has market share of between 15 and 20 percent of the Polish, Belgian, English, Italian, Ukrainian and Austrian markets, Chiaty said, adding that it had recently refurbished its hotels.

824,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2018 09:56AM ET</span>","Exclusive: India to probe alleged antitrust behavior by Maersk, DP World at Mumbai port - sources","By Aditya Kalra and Aditi Shah
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's antitrust regulator has ordered a probe into alleged anti-competitive practices by Denmark's A.P. Moller-Maersk (CO:MAERSKb) and Dubai's DP World (DI:DPW) at the terminals they operate at the country's largest container port in Mumbai, five sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The decision by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) to investigate follows a complaint by Singapore's PSA International Pte Ltd, which alleged that Maersk and DP World created entry barriers to hinder the growth of PSA's terminal by colluding on certain charges they levy at the state-owned Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT).
Handling 66 million tonnes of cargo in the last fiscal year to March, JNPT is critical to India's international trade. The port handles more than half of India's traffic of shipping containers each year.
Units of Maersk, DP World and PSA operate four of the port's five terminals, with the fifth owned by the government. The PSA terminal, inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in February, is planned to be the largest, expected to nearly double JNPT's capacity and help fulfill the government's vision of boosting India's economic growth by modernizing its ports.
The dispute centers around so-called inter-terminal transfers.
Under the system, which aims to make the most efficient use of common infrastructure, freight trains arriving at JNPT typically carry containers destined for several terminals, but stop at just one that handles all the cargo on a given day. Other operators then collect their containers by truck for loading at their own terminals. A similar procedure is followed, in reverse, when imported containers are unloaded.
In June, PSA, which is owned by Singapore government-owned investment fund Temasek Holdings, lodged a complaint with the CCI alleging it was facing discrimination because Maersk and DP World were imposing a higher fee on shipping companies for handling containers that arrived at the PSA terminal, the sources said. 
In an order passed on Nov. 9, the CCI said its preliminary probe found that Maersk and DP World had coordinated their efforts to prevent PSA from operating effectively at the Mumbai port, said two of the sources who have direct knowledge of the case.
A.P. Moller-Maersk, the world's biggest container shipping group, told Reuters that CCI was hearing a case brought forward by PSA, but said it would not comment as the matter was sub judice. 
DP World said it had not received any formal communication from the CCI, but added it has ""always been committed to ensuring our business meets the highest standards, complying with all laws and regulations"". 
PSA International did not respond to a request for comment. JNPT and the CCI did not respond to Reuters' questions.
COORDINATED CONDUCT
The CCI's decision to order a probe and details of PSA's allegations have not been previously reported.
""This co-ordinated conduct on the part of the opposite parties (Maersk and DP World units) prima facie hints at creating entry barriers for the informant (PSA),"" the CCI said, according to one of the sources privy to the order. 
The regulator asked its investigations unit to further probe the allegations and submit a report by January. The probe would also look at the role of individual company executives, the sources said. Such investigations, however, typically extend beyond a year.
JNPT, which began its operations in 1989, is ranked among the world's top 50 container ports. It plays a key role in Modi's plan to develop India's coastline and maritime sector.
In its complaint, parts of which were reviewed by Reuters, PSA alleged that Maersk and DP World had issued advisories to deter use of the PSA terminal, telling port users they would need to make their own arrangements to transfer their cargo if it was dropped at the PSA dock.
One of the sources who is privy to the Indian watchdog's order said the CCI found the coordinated conduct by Maersk and DP World had the potential to bring about an anti-competitive effect. 
Another source privy to the proceedings, though, disagreed, saying the dispute was only a commercial one and not a competition law matter as alleged by PSA. 

The complaint was filed by PSA's Indian unit Bharat Mumbai Container Terminals. The opposing parties in the case are Maersk's unit Gateway Terminals India, and DP World's Nhava Sheva International Container Terminal and Nhava Sheva (India) Gateway Terminal.

MILAN (Reuters) - Chocolate spread Nutella has long had pride of place on supermarket shelves but faces imminent attack from an Italian rival usually found in the pasta section.
Italy's Barilla, known internationally for its spaghetti and maccheroni packaged in blue boxes, is preparing to launch a chocolate spread next year in a major challenge to the brand that became a global phenomenon in the 1980s, sources said.
Nutella, invented by family-owned firm Ferrero, is a favorite among sweet-toothed youngsters at home and abroad and generates annual sales of more than 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion).
With 54 percent of the global market for chocolate spreads, Nutella is the leader and faces virtually no major competition as a mass-marketed brand.
Cokokrem of Turkey's Yildiz Holding is the second most popular spread with a share of only 2 percent, according to market research provider Euromonitor International.
But two sources familiar with Barilla's plan say its new spread, Crema Pan di Stelle, seeks to exploit a perceived weakness of Nutella: its use of palm oil.
The ingredient has drawn a consumer backlash due to health and environmental concerns. Ferrero launched an ad campaign in 2016 to defend its use of palm oil, saying it was safe when refined at controlled temperatures and that the company only bought oil from sustainable palm plantations.
Barilla decided to mount a challenge to Nutella after sensing that Ferrero was starting to encroach on the pasta-maker's lesser-known biscuit business, one of the sources said.
Industry sources said Ferrero will launch a Nutella-filled biscuit next year, seen as a direct challenge to Barilla's own chocolate cookie brand, Baiocchi.
Ferrero declined to comment on the new biscuit.
To take on Nutella, Barilla has prepared a recipe that contains sunflower oil, 10 percent less sugar, Italian-only hazelnuts and cocoa from sustainable farms, one source said.
CRUNCHY TASTE
Barilla, also a family-owned firm, has presented its spread to buyers at major supermarket chains and could launch it as soon as January in Italy, the sources said. 
Still, it faces a tough challenge.
One industry expert said it could cost several million euros just to secure a spot on the same supermarket shelves as Nutella, which commands a premium eye-level position.
""Crema Pan di Stelle will increase competition for Nutella in Italy thanks to the considerable brand awareness it has among domestic customers, but Barilla will find it difficult to take the challenge abroad,"" said Marco Eccheli, director at the Italian unit of consulting firm AlixPartners.
Contacted for a comment Barilla said it would answer questions about new products in coming weeks.
The name Crema Pan di Stelle is taken from another of Barilla's successful biscuits brands, Pan di Stelle or 'bread of the stars' which is sold mainly in Italy.
""It will contain crumbles of Pan di Stelle cookies to make it taste crunchy,"" the source said.

Micron shares fell 7 percent in early trading after brokerage Baird Equity Research downgraded the stock to ""underperform"", citing fall in memory chip prices.
Weak demand for chips has been hurting the semiconductor stocks. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc shares fell 7 percent, while those of Nvidia Corp shed 5.7 percent, taking an additional hit from one of the top cryptocurrency Bitcoin plunging to its lowest in 2018. Both companies get a share of their revenue by selling chips to cryptominers. 
Micron's NAND flash memory chips and dynamic random access memory (DRAM) memory chips help power servers and smartphones, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Inc's latest generation of iPhones.
""Continued deterioration in both DRAM and NAND pricing leads us to model eight consecutive quarters of gross margin and EPS contraction,"" Baird analyst Tristan Gerra, who also lowered his PT to $32 from $75, said in a note.
""NAND outlook continues to worsen, with contract pricing expected to decline mid teens in each of the next two quarters,"" Gerra said.
Shares of Micron also took a hit from a report on Monday that Chinese authorities would deepen their probe into the chipmaker and Korean firms Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) and SK Hynix Inc, claiming ""massive evidence"" of antitrust violations.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Campbell Soup Co on Tuesday reported a smaller-than-expected decline in quarterly earnings, sending shares of the embattled soup maker up 4 percent in premarket trading.
Campbell, which has struggled for years to attract young consumers to its namesake soups and Pepperidge Farm cookies, launched a dramatic cost-cutting and divestment plan at the end of August. 
Excluding items, the 149-year-old company earned 79 cents a share in the first quarter ended Oct. 28, beating analysts' average estimate of 70 cents, according to Refinitiv data.
""We're getting traction in our soup business, integrating in Snyder's-Lance, divestitures are well underway, we're driving out costs,"" Interim Chief Executive Keith McLoughlin told Reuters in a phone interview.
McLoughlin, who has been a Campbell board member since 2016, was tapped to fill in temporarily when CEO Denise Morrison unexpectedly stepped down in May. The company, which reported weak corporate earnings for years under Morrison, has said it will name a new CEO before the end of the year.
Campbell, owner of the Prego pasta sauce and Goldfish cracker brands, also said it had begun the process of divesting its international and fresh food businesses.
The company said the units, which were put up for sale in August, have both attracted strong interest from potential buyers.
Campbell, whose stock has lost about a third in value over the past two years, has been embroiled in a bitter proxy fight with activist shareholder Third Point LLC. The hedge fund, run by billionaire Daniel Loeb, has campaigned aggressively to replace some members of Campbell's board. 
Camden, New Jersey-based Campbell did not provide an update on its CEO search or fight with hedge fund Third Point.
""We are open to a solution (with Third Point) that makes sense and doesn't compromise our ability to deliver the plan,"" McLoughlin said.
Net earnings attributable to the company fell to $194 million, or 64 cents per share, in the first quarter ended Oct. 28, from $275 million, or 91 cents per share, a year earlier.
Earnings were hurt by ""significantly"" higher costs for steel and aluminum, as well as a rise in freight and logistics expenses, McLoughlin said. Costs for butter, wheat and grains also rose. 
Campbell, which uses steel and aluminum to make its iconic soup cans, has struggled this year with surging commodities and transportation costs. Some of this inflation has been exacerbated by global trade tensions, hurting earnings across the consumer goods industry. 
The company also said earnings were hurt by start-up challenges at a new distribution facility in Findlay, Ohio. McLoughlin said these problems had not continued into the second quarter.

Net sales jumped about 25 percent to $2.69 billion, boosted by Campbell's recent acquisitions of Snyder's-Lance and Pacific Foods. Organic sales fell 3 percent.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) has canceled a conference call it had scheduled for Tuesday morning with airlines to discuss systems on the 737 MAX model that crashed in Indonesia last month, two sources familiar with the matter said.
Boeing was not immediately available to comment and it was not clear whether the call was being rescheduled.
The U.S. aircraft manufacturer has faced scrutiny by regulators and pilots over the first major accident involving the 737 MAX, the latest version of its popular narrow-body plane.
All 189 people on board a 737 MAX operated by Lion Air died when the jet crashed into the Java Sea on Oct. 29. 
An investigation is still underway, but questions have arisen about the role that a new emergency system on the jet, designed to prevent the 737 MAX from stalling, may have played in the crash.
After the crash, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration warned airlines that erroneous inputs from the anti-stall system's sensors could lead the jet to automatically pitch its nose down even when autopilot is turned off, making it difficult for pilots to control the aircraft.
Boeing has already provided two updates for operators around the world that re-emphasize existing procedures to deal with situations relating to the system. The company has also held individual meetings with some airlines to address their concerns, sources have said. 
A preliminary report on the Lion Air crash will be released on Nov. 28 or 29, according to Indonesian investigators who have analyzed the doomed jet's flight data recorder.
Divers have yet to locate the airline's cockpit voice recorder, which would shed light on pilot interactions, important for gaining a fuller picture of the circumstances of the crash.

David Jacob took over as interim CEO earlier this month at the company, whose stock has nosedived after it suffered billions of francs in outflows and the aftermath of a botched acquisition.
Jacob said repositioning GAM and improving efficiency and profitability required some ""tough decisions,"" according to an internal memo reviewed by Reuters.
Under the changes, GAM will merge its European equities operations into one team while its fixed income operations in London, Zurich and New York will also be combined.
""By consolidating some teams we will be better able to deliver scalable products to our clients worldwide,"" Jacob wrote in the memo.

No figure was given in the memo, which said only that consultations with affected staff was now underway. According to industry sources the job cuts could affect around 20 out of the 188 people employed in these areas.
A GAM spokesman declined to comment on the figure.
GAM's share price has fallen by 62 percent this year as the asset manager has been hit by a string of difficulties, although
they recovered slightly after U.S. investor Mario Gabelli increased his holding to more than 3 percent earlier this month.

LONDON (Reuters) - Two shareholder advisory firms have backed Takeda Pharmaceutical's (T:4502) $62 billion takeover offer for drugmaker  Shire  (L:SHP), dealing a blow to a group of investors who hope to block the deal.
Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis both recommended on Tuesday that shareholders in Japan's Takeda vote for the acquisition at an investor meeting scheduled for Dec. 5, at which the pharmaceuticals company needs to secure two-thirds support. 
It is a boost for Takeda, which has faced a campaign by a small group of about 130 retail investors that includes former employees to derail the takeover of London-listed Shire. 
Those shareholders are worried about the significant debt that Takeda is taking on to complete the deal and the risks posed by the scale of the acquisition, which is the largest-ever overseas acquisition by a Japanese company.
But ISS and Glass Lewis said that investor support for the cash-and-shares transaction was warranted.
""The deal diversifies the company in terms of products and geographies, and provides strong cash flow generation that, combined with divestments, allows for relatively rapid deleveraging, despite maintaining top of the range leverage in the mid-term,"" ISS said in a report to clients. 
Glass Lewis said in a separate report that ""the strategic case is compelling for Takeda.""

Shares in Shire were up 0.4 percent in London while Takeda closed up 0.6 percent in Tokyo.

It's Even Worse in Europe,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). might be barreling toward bear-market territory, but most European blue-chip tech stocks have been exploring dark depths of their own for a while.
In the U.S., the FAANG giants were the market’s driving force for the bulk of 2018, with the Nasdaq 100 Index ascending to an intraday record at the beginning of October. The subsequent sell-off was accompanied by a range of worries over a U.S.-China trade war, the impact of higher interest rates, a possible peak in the semiconductor cycle and privacy concerns, coupled with some disappointing earnings.
While the Nasdaq is down 13 percent from its Oct. 1 record, the spillover has been even worse in Europe, with the Stoxx 600 Technology Index dropping 16 percent in the same period.
In fact, only a handful of heavily weighted stocks have stood between the European tech benchmark and a deeper rout. The sector’s worst-performer, iPhone supplier AMS AG, has dropped a staggering 80 percent from this year’s record as the outlook for Apple’s entire supply chain darkens with diminishing orders. The California giant itself is somewhat shielded against lower handset volumes, thanks to its other revenue sources, such as streaming music and its software business.
Even so, Apple’s dominance means the monetary impact of its share slump is acutely felt by investors, and a drop of almost 20 percent from Oct. 3’s record close pushed the market value lost to beyond $200 billion. That’s more than the combined value destruction in all 30 constituents of the European tech benchmark since their respective peaks.

LONDON (Reuters) - British companies selling everything from washing machines to flights, food and mortgages plan to spend tens of millions of pounds in case the political brinkmanship gripping the country leads to a disorderly Brexit. 
With barely four months until the world's fifth largest economy leaves the European Union, a raft of major companies set out plans on Tuesday to counter any trade delays and downturns that could stem from a no-deal scenario.
 Electrocomponents  (L:ECM), which stocks more than half a million industrial and electronics products, said it would spend 30 million pounds ($38.6 million) in the six months to the end of next March to increase its holding of high-turnover goods in Britain and Europe.
AO World (L:AO), the online electricals and white goods retailer, might increase stock to mitigate supply chain friction while Compass (L:CPG), the world's biggest catering firm, is looking to build inventory and vary menus before March 29.
""We are planning very seriously for all scenarios,"" said Chief Executive Dominic Blakemore of Compass which provides meals for train customers, hospitals and corporate headquarters. 
""We have been working with our suppliers for quite some time to think about how we carry a bit more inventory, how we source supply and how we vary our menu.""
Britain's vote to leave the world's largest trading bloc has created a raft of challenges for companies, with financial services groups shifting some assets and people to Europe while manufacturers hunt for storage space to stockpile parts. 
Supporters of Brexit say once it has left the country will be free to negotiate new trade deals around the world and ditch regulations they say hamper growth. 
But mounting tensions in Westminster, where lawmakers from all parties are opposed to Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal, have sparked fears Britain may leave the EU with no deal, prompting customs checks that clog up borders and fracture long-standing supply chains.
Issues being addressed include stockpiling, changes in suppliers and production, and changes to regulation. 
READY OR NOT?
Hours after a handful of companies put out their plans at 0700 GMT, the Bank of England had some sobering words.
""I have the impression from talking to businesses (...) that most are not prepared for a no-deal Brexit, and don't know really how to,"" Bank policymaker Michael Saunders said.
Those companies with a plan are pushing ahead. 
British low-cost airline easyJet (L:EZJ), which carried 88.5 million passengers in its latest financial year, has changed its legal structure and secured new operating licenses to enable it to continue flying into Europe. 
It is now working to change its shareholder base so that by Brexit day more than 50 percent of its investors will be based in the European Economic Area when excluding Britain. That measure currently stands at 47 percent. 
""Basically what me and Andrew (Findlay, CFO) are going to do right now after today is continue to go and see European shareholders and talk to them about the story of easyJet,"" Chief Executive Johan Lundgren told reporters as he presented results.
Many company executives in Britain have previously been reluctant to stray into politics for fear of angering customers, but with time running out they are starting to speak out.
AO World said it may need to increase inventory in the short term. It currently holds enough stock in Britain for 35 days. 
 Halma  (L:HLMA), a maker of safety equipment for the medical, infrastructure and resource markets, set out in detail how it could be affected, including higher costs and inflation, greater liabilities for pensions and disruption to its work force, supply chain and regulation. 
CEO Andrew Williams (NYSE:WMB) said the group had some flexibility because its string of companies around the world could work together to share production if required.
Other companies remained more coy. 

The owner of Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank (L:CYBGC) said the ""inherently uncertain"" environment was casting a shadow over the country's short term economic prospects.

The package delivery company will buy 100 Chanje V8100 vans from the Los-Angeles based startup and lease the remaining from U.S. truck rental company  Ryder System Inc  (N:R).
 United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS), FedEx and  Deutsche Post  AG (DE:DPWGn) unit DHL have faced pressure from regulators around the world to lessen the environmental impact of their fleets.
UPS, FedEx and DHL have placed orders for Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) all-electric Semis and already use Workhorse Group Inc's (O:WKHS) electric vans.
The Chanje electric vans will have a range of more than 150 miles when fully charged, with maximum cargo capacity of about 6,000 pounds.
Last year, Ryder said it would order electric delivery vans from Chanje and become the exclusive U.S. sales and lease partner for the company.
The Chanje V8100 vans are manufactured by FDG Electric Vehicles Ltd (HK:0729), the startup's main investor, in Hangzhou, China.

The vans would be used for FedEx's commercial and residential pick-up and delivery services in California.

843,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2018 07:47AM ET</span>","Explainer: What misconduct is Nissan's Ghosn accused of, and how did it come to light?","TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan was shocked by news that Nissan Motor Co Chairman Carlos Ghosn, who was widely respected for rescuing the car maker from near bankruptcy, was arrested on Monday for alleged financial misconduct.
Nissan said that Ghosn, who is also chairman and CEO of  Renault  (PA:RENA) and chairman of Mitsubishi Motors, would be fired from his post as Nissan chairman on Thursday.
WHAT IS GHOSN ACCUSED OF?
Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa told a packed press conference on Monday night that the company had found that Ghosn had been using corporate money for personal purposes and under-reporting his income for years in official company filings to the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
Another board member, Greg Kelly, was also deeply involved in the misconduct, Nissan said. Saikawa said he couldn't elaborate as the cases are being investigated by prosecutors, who have declined to comment.
Prosecutors said that Ghosn and Kelly conspired to understate Ghosn's compensation over five years starting in fiscal 2010 as being about half of the actual 9.998 billion yen ($88.9 million).
Public broadcaster NHK said Nissan paid billions of yen to buy and renovate homes for Ghosn in Rio, Beirut, Paris and Amsterdam, citing unnamed sources. The properties had no business purpose and were not listed as benefits in TSE filings, NHK said.
Ghosn, 64, has not been formally charged. The Asahi newspaper reported that he and Kelly had submitted to prosecutors' questions after getting off a plane on Monday afternoon at Tokyo's Haneda Airport. Saikawa confirmed they had been arrested.
Ghosn and Kelly have not been seen since and their exact whereabouts are not known. Suspects are typically taken to the Tokyo Detention Center, which is linked to the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office.
HOW DID THIS COME TO LIGHT?
Nissan's Saikawa said Ghosn's alleged improprieties came to light through a whistleblower, after which the company began an internal investigation and informed prosecutors. 
Japanese media reports say the informant is a member of Nissan's legal department. 
The Asahi reported, without citing sources, that the informant gave the prosecutors information in a plea bargain, implying the person may have provided evidence in exchange for a lighter sentence.
HOW MUCH CONTROL DID GHOSN HAVE?
After becoming CEO of a struggling Nissan in 2001, Ghosn was hailed as the automaker's savior by implementing an aggressive cost-cutting plan. Known for his flair and confidence, Ghosn won respect for his business acumen and for shaking up Nissan's traditional corporate culture, which may have made it difficult to hold him accountable.
Ghosn became CEO of Nissan partner Renault in 2005, chairman of Nissan of 2008 and chairman of Renault in 2009, giving him considerable sway over both companies. 
On Monday, Saikawa acknowledged that too much power had been concentrated in Ghosn. ""Looking back, after 2005 when he became CEO of both Renault and Nissan, we did not really discuss the implications,"" he said.
France's finance minister Bruno Le Maire said on Tuesday Ghosn should not remain in charge of Renault after his arrest in Japan.
HOW COULD HE PULL OFF THIS ALLEGED DECEPTION?
This is the big question. 
If the misconduct continued for years, as Saikawa said, analysts question how this could have passed undetected for so long, unless internal auditors and senior management turned a blind eye.
WHAT'S NEXT FOR GHOSN?
Under Japanese law, a suspect can be detained by prosecutors for up to 20 days before being charged or released. Tsutomu Nakamura, a former prosecutor at the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors office, predicted that Ghosn will be indicted on Friday, Dec. 7, the last working day before that maximum period.
Ghosn is allowed access to a lawyer during his time in detention.
If bail is granted, it would be ""exorbitant, in hundreds of millions of yen,"" or millions of dollars, Nakamura said. But in major cases like this, ""often no bail is granted until after the arraignment at the first court session"".

Falsifying corporate annual reports, which Ghosn and Kelly are accused of, carries a maximum penalty of up to 10 years in prison and/or a fine of up to 10 million yen, under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act.

851,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2018 06:29AM ET</span>","Noble Group faces regulatory probe, days before closing $3.5 billion restructuring deal","By Anshuman Daga and Aradhana Aravindan
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore authorities are investigating Noble Group Ltd (SI:NOBG) for suspected false and misleading statements, just days before the Singapore-listed company was to complete its $3.5 billion debt restructuring deal to prevent its collapse.
Noble, once Asia's top commodity trader, has seen its market value all but wiped out from $6 billion in February 2015 after its accounting was questioned by Iceberg Research. To rescue itself, Noble has shrunk its business by selling billions of dollars of assets, taking hefty writedowns and cutting hundreds of jobs, while defending its accounting.
The company, whose shares were suspended from trading from Monday due to the restructuring, is seeking to transform into an Asia-focused coal-trading business and list the overhauled business.
In a statement on Tuesday, the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) of the Singapore Police, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the city-state's central bank, and the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) said they were jointly investigating Noble for suspected violations of securities and company laws.
In addition to the suspected false statements, the probe also covers potential non-compliance with accounting standards by Noble Resources International Pte Ltd (NRI), a fully-owned Singapore-based subsidiary of Noble.
""CAD and MAS have directed Noble Group Ltd and NRI to produce documents relating to the preparation of Noble Group's financial statements,"" the authorities said in the statement.
They said this follows a thorough review of other relevant information, including information referred to authorities by the Singapore Exchange's regulatory arm and other third parties.
Noble did not provide a comment to a Reuters query about the Singapore authorities' statement.
The Singapore Exchange's regulatory unit said it will review if the investigations will impact the financial statements already disclosed by Noble Group related to its restructuring, it said a separate statement.
""Trading can only start after restructuring has been completed and this is in turn dependent on our review,"" it said.
However, Mak Yuen Teen, an associate professor of accounting at the National University of Singapore, said he did not expect the investigation by authorities to impact the restructuring.
""There's going to be a new entity with a largely new board, and the investigations will be focusing on the previous board and management,"" Mak said.
The CAD, the MAS and ACRA also said they were looking into breaches of disclosure requirements by Noble.
ACRA said it had informed NRI's board of directors of the suspected breaches of the Companies Act and that it must provide further information.
""This follows an extensive review of the financial statements of Noble Resources International (NRI) for the financial years ended 31 December 2012 to 31 December 2016,"" the statement said.
Last week, Noble reported halving its quarterly net loss from continuing operations to $43.3 million and said its soon-to-be-completed restructuring would enable it to reposition its business in Asia Pacific and the Middle East.

Tuesday's announcement comes just as Noble was looking to appoint a new chairman after current leader Paul Brough brought the company back from one of the biggest near-death corporate experiences in Asia.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - What if one of the largest U.S. coal-burning utilities became a leader in green energy? When David W. Crane was chief executive of NRG Energy (NYSE:NRG), he pursued that vision, pushing the company to transform itself by investing in solar power and electric vehicle charging networks.
Wall Street did not buy that - some believe his zeal cost him his job in 2015 - but the one-time lawyer and investment banker has not given up on the planet.
Crane, 59, is dedicating his career to advising and investing in clean energy, working for investment firm Pegasus Capital and serving as a member of the B Team, an executive council dedicated to changing business practices to improve the environment and society.
Crane reflects on the lessons he learned about money, business and family, and shares why the Cranes do not donate to environmental causes in the usual way. 
Q: When you were a kid, what were your parents' attitudes toward money? 
A: I grew up outside of Chicago, in a wealthy suburb called Lake Forest. Back then, Lake Forest split itself into townies and the truly rich — people who sent their kids to boarding school and Lake Forest Country Day. We were townies. They made it clear that I was going to have to work for a living: like, ""There's not going to be anything coming at the end of our lives for you.""
Q: You went to Princeton, then Harvard Law School. Did they pressure you to perform?
A: If anything, they did the opposite. In high school I was misdiagnosed as having ulcers. Later it turned out to be Crohn's disease of the stomach, I got half my stomach taken out. 
Man, when you're 14 and people think you've got ulcers, every person tells you to relax. So, I always tried to manifest this demeanor of being relaxed and cool. I didn't want another person to tell me to chill out.
Q: You have five children. Where does their work ethic come from?
A: If you treat extraordinary things as normal, kids just think that it's normal. I think our youngest child did his first marathon when he was seven. We don't make a big deal about it.
Q: Where did your fourth son get the idea to row across the ocean?
A: Pretty much everything good about them comes from their mother. She insisted that they take a gap year before college. It was actually my first son that started this thing — he wanted to use that time to become the first openly gay person to climb the seven summits. Our second child biked across Africa, and our third child, our only girl, walked the Pacific Crest Trail from Mexico to Canada.
Q: Did you hesitate about letting them do those things? 
A: I got worried once they actually left, but part of our world view is that often, a lot of places other people perceive as dangerous are just filled with normal people leading normal lives. Really, when my son first said he wanted to tackle the seven summits, I started bitching about the cost, about $200,000, but my kids can read the SEC documents — they knew how much money I was making.
Finally, I told him we'd fund the trip as long as he raised a comparable amount for charity. Since then, the kids have all raised money for a cause as part of the effort. 
Q: How do you teach your children about business? 
A: When my oldest child was 14, we put $20,000 in a brokerage account, something we've done for all the kids since. I'm trying to use investing to help them analyze current events, to look behind the headlines.
I'm trying to explain to them that business is largely about common sense, and that when humans are involved, it's not always rational. It's usually helpful to understand what pressures are weighing on the other guy.
Q: You've said you were fired from NRG for being too green. How do you fight climate change now?
A: As a family, we support the local watershed, and my son who biked across Africa raised money for Conservation International. But at NRG, we didn't make big donations to environmental causes — I don't want anyone to look at a donation and say that that's blood money, that's guilt. 

Personally, I'd rather get involved with policy and take the problems head on. The private sector needs to lead this fight, and the energy industry is ground zero for both causing the problem and solving it.

853,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 20, 2018 06:10AM ET</span>",Ghosn Downfall Ripples From Tokyo to Paris as Allegations Grow,"(Bloomberg) -- The downfall of Nissan Motor Co. Chairman Carlos Ghosn reverberated for a second day as politicians and executives scrambled to fill the vacuum at the top of the world’s largest car alliance amid new reports about his alleged financial improprieties.
Renault’s board is convening for a crisis meeting tonight in Paris to discuss the future of the Renault-Nissan car alliance. While the French government, which owns 15 percent of  Renault  (PA:RENA), isn’t demanding Ghosn’s formal dismissal, he is no longer in a position to run the automaker, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told French radio.
Back in Japan, where Ghosn has remained in custody since his arrest Monday, more details of his alleged transgressions began trickling out in local media. Combined, they painted a picture of an executive who misused company funds to bankroll a lavish lifestyle, from luxury residences across the globe to money funneled into expenses and investment funds. Ghosn hasn’t been seen in public and hasn’t responded to the allegations.
Alliance Future
The revelations, which followed a months-long internal probe, put key stakeholders in a bind because there’s no obvious successor. While all sides rushed to assure that the alliance was solid, Ghosn was the linchpin holding the partnership together. The French government, in particular, signaled it will protect Renault, which has benefited hugely from its participation in the French-Japanese pact.
Le Maire said he will meet with management of Renault and state representatives on the board of the company to put in place interim governance. Already yesterday, President Emmanuel Macron said he would remain “extremely vigilant” regarding the stability of the Renault-Nissan alliance. One immediate step will be to fill the post of Renault CEO, which might fall to Chief Operating Officer Thierry Bollore, whom Ghosn himself had previously called a “good candidate” to eventually replace him at the French carmaker.
Le Maire echoed those comments, saying Bollore has “great qualities” that make him capable of stepping in. He said the government will seek evidence from Japanese authorities, after the French side was all but blindsided by the probe and subsequent arrest Monday. The board of Renault and the Macron government were both caught unaware by the allegations, according to people familiar with the matter. A Renault spokeswoman declined to comment on the minister’s plans.
In a memo to employees sent on Monday, Bollore expressed “full support for our chairman and CEO,” calling the alliance an “industrial gem that must be protected and nurtured.” Renault confirmed the content of the letter, which was cited in full by the Financial Times.
While there’s little doubt that Ghosn’s ride atop the global car industry has come to a rapid halt, there’s less clarity on the nature of his transgressions. Japanese broadcaster NHK said Tuesday that Nissan paid “huge sums” toward Ghosn’s residences sprinkled across the globe. The real estate in Rio de Janeiro, Beirut, Paris and Amsterdam, had “no legitimate business reason” and Ghosn wasn’t paying at least some of the rent, the report said.
At a late-night press conference in Tokyo Monday, Nissan Chief Executive Officer Hiroto Saikawa declined to give details on the charges, only saying that had both understated his income and misused company funds, including expenses and investment funds.
Real Estate, Investments
All told, Ghosn failed to declare some 5 billion yen ($44 million) in his income on Nissan’s official securities reports submitted over five years starting from 2011, prosecutors in Tokyo said Monday. According to Japanese law, Ghosn can be held in custody for up to 23 days without being charged.
The sudden downfall of the larger-than-life executive has spooked investors. Nissan dropped as much as 6.5 percent in Tokyo Tuesday, while Renault continued its slide, falling as much as 4.8 percent in Paris. On Monday, the French stock fell to the lowest since January 2015.
Nissan’s credit rating is also at risk as a result. Standard & Poor’s put its long-term A rating placed on watch for a possible downgrade, saying profitability might weaken substantially in coming years if the alleged misconduct damages the brand image enough to seriously depress unit sales or hurt the alliance.
Over the course of almost two decades, Nissan has grown into the larger of the two main partners by deliveries and sales -- but it has less say. Renault owns just over 43 percent of Nissan, compared with the Japanese company’s 15 percent stake in the French partner. It also boasts full voting rights in the alliance, while Nissan has none. That lopsided structure was always a point of contention between the French and the Japanese side, and Ghosn was in no small part responsible for preserving the peace between both sides.
“The issue is who’s going to control the alliance, and Saikawa has clearly put his cards on the table,” said Kenneth Courtis, chairman of Starfort Investment Holdings, an investment, private equity and commodity group

854,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2018 06:00AM ET</span>",Brexit chill and insurance scandal hit UK bank CYBG,"By Noor Zainab Hussain and Muvija M
(Reuters) - British bank CYBG (L:CYBGC) said it would take another 150 million pound ($193 million) charge related to an industry-wide scandal over mis-sold insurance policies, helping to send its shares down as much as 10 percent on Tuesday. 
The company, which became Britain's sixth largest bank following its purchase of rival Virgin Money (LON:VM), also said short-term prospects in its key lending markets - homeowners and small businesses - were subdued due to uncertainty over Brexit. 
Shares in the owner of Clydsedale Bank and Yorkshire Bank fell to their lowest since June 2016, when Britain voted to leave the European Union. The stock has lost well over a quarter of its value since the start of 2018.
The bank reported a statutory loss before tax of 164 million pounds ($211 million) for the year ended Sept. 30, including a 352 million pound charge related to the mis-selling of payment protection insurance (PPI). 
Britain's banks have together had to pay out billions of pounds in compensation in the country's costliest-ever consumer scandal after regulators determined they had sold expensive PPI products to people who sometimes didn't need them.
Investec analysts said the extra 150 million pound provision was larger than expected. 
CYBG also said Brexit uncertainty had hit confidence among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
""We took a position in 2016 that Brexit would lead to lower economic growth environment. I think you are seeing some of that. We are seeing inertia in SMEs and their investment profiles,"" Chief Executive David Duffy told reporters on a call. 
CYBG forecast its net interest margin - the difference between what banks earn from loans and pay for deposits - would fall to 160-170 basis points (bps) in its new financial year from 178 bps in the one just ended. 
At 1020 GMT, CYBG shares were down 9.7 percent at 224.4 pence, the biggest fall on the UK mid-cap index (FTMC).

LONDON (Reuters) - European stocks fell on Tuesday, with banks weighing heavily on worries about slowing economic growth, fading earnings momentum, Italy's budget, and a lower likelihood of rate hikes in Europe next year.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) fell 0.7 percent by 0945 GMT, to a three-week low, with Germany's DAX (GDAXI) down 1.2 percent and Britain's FTSE 100 (FTSE) down 0.5 percent.

860,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2018 03:37AM ET</span>",Nissan shares slump as global alliance rocked by Ghosn arrest,"By Chang-Ran Kim and Sam Nussey
TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co's shares fell nearly 6 percent on Tuesday as Chairman Carlos Ghosn's arrest a day earlier sent shockwaves through the business world and threw into doubt the future of Japan's No.2 automaker and its global alliance.
Nissan said on Monday an internal investigation triggered by a tip-off from a whistleblower had revealed that Ghosn engaged in wrongdoing including personal use of company money and under-reporting for years how much he was earning. He was arrested and would be fired from Nissan's board this week, it said.
Ghosn is also chairman and chief executive of Nissan's French partner,  Renault  (PA:RENA), and chairman of Japan's Mitsubishi Motors Corp, the third partner in the alliance.
Ousting Ghosn will pose questions about an alliance that he personally shaped and had pledged to consolidate with a deeper tie-up, before eventually stepping back from its operational leadership.
It also brings into focus the future of Nissan - the biggest partner in the alliance - at a time it is seeing falling profits due to weak U.S. sales and is facing heightened competition from rivals who are investing heavily in new growth areas like internet connected cars and self-driving vehicles.
Ghosn's alleged improprieties also raise questions over governance at the alliance in which the three partners' boards are all chaired by a single executive.
One Nissan headquartered manager told Reuters he was concerned decision making at the alliance, which vies with Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and Toyota Motor Corp for the ranking of the world's biggest automaker, could slow due to the lack of a unifying figure.
The manager, who declined to be identified as he was not permitted to speak to the media, said he was also worried Ghosn's departure could hit sales as fans of the charismatic leader abandon the company and corporate customers bound by compliance rules put orders on hold due to the scandal.
Speaking at a late-night news conference on Monday, Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa said that too much power had been concentrated on Ghosn, and that the implications of his stewardship of both Renault and Nissan had gone unquestioned since 2005.
Prosecutors said in a statement that Ghosn and Representative Director Greg Kelly conspired to understate Ghosn's compensation over five years starting in fiscal 2010 as being about half of the actual 9.998 billion yen ($88.9 million).
Ghosn joined Nissan in 1999 and became its CEO in 2001. He remained in that post until last year and had received 9.2 million euros ($10.53 million) in pay for the final year as CEO.
""By under-reporting his corporate salary, he basically deprived Nissan's shareholders of opportunities to judge if the amount of his salary was appropriate,"" Toru Ibayashi, executive director of Wealth Management at UBS Securities Japan, said of Nissan's allegations.
CEO Saikawa, a top ranking executive since 2011, emphasized that Nissan was a victim of Ghosn's alleged misdeeds but declined to say whether others besides Kelly at the automaker were involved in the wrongdoing.
Nissan has been slow to strengthen its governance, with outside directors linked to the alliance or lacking business experience, said Zuhair Khan, head of Japan research at Jefferies. ""Even in poor governance Japan, Nissan under Carlos Ghosn stood out for bad governance structure,"" he said.
LUXURY LIVING?
Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported Nissan paid billions of yen for the purchase and renovation of homes for Ghosn in Rio de Janeiro, Beirut, Paris and Amsterdam, citing unnamed sources.
The properties had no business purpose and were not listed as benefits in filings to the Tokyo bourse, NHK said. Saikawa declined on Monday to discuss specifics on Ghosn's personal use of company money.
Nissan spent 2 billion yen on homes for Ghosn in Rio and Beirut via a Dutch subsidiary, with Kelly overseeing the transaction, the Nikkei newspaper reported, citing unnamed sources.
There has been no comment from Ghosn or Kelly on the allegations and Reuters could not contact them for comment.
In a sign of the broader political fallout, Hitoshi Kawaguchi, Nissan senior vice president handling government relations, met with Japan's top government spokesman on Tuesday, telling media he had requested good relations between Japan and France be maintained.
The Asahi newspaper cited unnamed sources as saying a company employee gave prosecutors information on Ghosn in return for lighter treatment, the second instance of a plea deal in Japan - a system introduced in June.
Nissan shares fell to a two-year low of 940 yen before closing down 5.5 percent at 950 yen. A record 140 million Nissan shares were traded on Tuesday, accounting for almost 6 percent of all trading on the Tokyo exchange's main board.
Shares of Mitsubishi, which also said on Monday it would remove Ghosn as its chairman, ended down nearly 7 percent. Renault shares lost 8.4 percent on Monday.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Global private equity group KKR & Co (N:KKR) is expanding its presence in Asia's infrastructure sector with new hires and is looking at launching a new fund as project spending in the region picks up.
The firm has poached David Luboff, CEO of Macquarie Group's Asia Infrastructure Fund, as its new head of Asia Pacific Infrastructure, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Luboff, based in Singapore, will lead the Asian operations of the firm's infrastructure business from early next year, the people said. Reuters could not reach Luboff for comment.
A KKR spokeswoman confirmed the hire to Reuters but did not provide additional details.
KKR has also hired Hardik Shah, formerly with Brookfield Asset management, as a Mumbai-based director, the spokeswoman said. He will focus on exploring infrastructure investment opportunities.
People familiar with the matter said KKR is also considering launching an Asian-focused regional fund, following strong demand from investors keen to increase exposure to Asian and emerging markets.
One of the sources said the fund could be as large as $1.5 billion and would look at areas such as power-related investments, toll roads and telecom infrastructure.
KKR declined to comment on the fundraising. The people could not be named as the information is confidential.
""Asia is an attractive part of KKR's global infrastructure investment strategy. Across the region, macroeconomic and societal trends are fostering a unique need for expertise and private capital solutions for projects in a wide range of infrastructure sub-sectors,"" Raj Agrawal, global head of KKR's infrastructure business, told Reuters last week. He declined to comment about a new Asia-focused fund.
The new hires follow the close of KKR's $7.4 billion global infrastructure fund in September, which focuses primarily on North America and Europe.
Asia is still a relatively small market for infrastructure funds, accounting for only about 15 percent of the total global fundraising pool over the past ten years, according to Preqin data. Only four Asia-focused infrastructure funds worth a combined $4.1 billion have been raised this year, just 5 percent of global activity.
Infrastructure deals in the region, however, picked up from 2015 to 2017, and accounted for more than a quarter of the global amount last year, Preqin data showed, as local economies spent trillions of dollars to improve creaking infrastructure.
KKR is a relative latecomer to infrastructure in the region compared with peers Global Infrastructure Partners, I Squared Capital and the infrastructure investment arms of Macquarie Group, Brookfield Asset Management and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).

Established in 2008, KKR's infrastructure business manages approximately $13 billion in assets under management.

HANOI (Reuters) - Bamboo Airways aims to make its first domestic flight on Dec. 29 should it receive its license to fly, beginning a journey which could see Vietnam's fifth carrier rival the market leader in size within a year, its chairman told Reuters.
The maiden flight will connect the capital Hanoi with the coastal resort city of Quy Nhon, where parent  FLC Group JSC  (HM:FLC) has one of its around 30 hotels and 20 golf courses, said Trinh Van Quyet, who is also chairman of FLC.
""As well as main cities, we'll fly to domestic destinations existing airlines don't reach,"" Quyet said in an interview on Monday. ""Our first international flights will connect Vietnam with South Korea and Japan, early in the second quarter.""
""There has been a surge in the number of golfers coming from South Korea to play in Vietnam recently,"" he added, saying that direct flights to the United States is also a Bamboo goal.
The launch comes as Vietnam clocks double-digit expansion in both domestic and inbound passenger numbers, at a time of rising incomes in one of Asia's quickest-growing economies. Meanwhile, the government aims to make tourism a growth driver through visa exemptions and promoting investment in related infrastructure.
Bamboo initially scheduled its maiden flight for October but delayed as it did not have a business license, which it received earlier this month. But it is still awaiting its air operator's certificate (AOC), without which it will remain grounded.
""We are processing Bamboo Airways' request for an AOC. We will issue the AOC when all the requirements are met,"" said Vo Huy Cuong, deputy director of the Civil Aviation Administration.
Bamboo hopes to begin ticket sales at the end of November. It plans to operate initial routes with leased aircraft.
FLEET BUILDING
Bamboo signed a memorandum of understanding with Airbus SE (PA:AIR) in March to buy up to 24 A320neo narrow-body jets, and a provisional deal in July for 20  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 787-9 wide-bodies worth $5.6 billion at list prices. 
""We will operate 10 planes when we start services and expand to 40 or 50 planes by the end of next year,"" Quyet said.
It took domestic market leader VietJet Aviation JSC (HM:VJC) around six years after launch to build a fleet of 50 aeroplanes.
One industry source, speaking on condition of anonymity, was skeptical Bamboo could reach such scale in the time frame given.
""It's impossible to add aircraft as fast as it says it will given regulatory restrictions preventing any airline from expanding its fleet so rapidly in the initial phase, plus slot restrictions and infrastructure constraints in Vietnam,"" said the source.
Quyet said the target was designed to increase plane availability to guarantee ticket supply. ""The risk would be higher if we chose to start with only 1 to 3 planes,"" he said.
Aviation consultancy CAPA said Bamboo would need to overcome ""intense competition"" from established players that serve destinations it is targeting and already have slots at major airports where demand is robust.
To differentiate itself, Bamboo will use its parent's golf courses, which will number 100 by 2022, Quyet said.
""We will offer packages that no other local airline can,"" he said.

""Once we do this, we want to do it big and different. Bamboo Airways has a different business orientation and we invest big right from the beginning, not from small to big"".

TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian stock markets skidded on Tuesday and Europe was expected to follow, pressured by sharp losses on Wall Street as technology firms tumbled on worries about slackening demand.
The dollar sagged after weak U.S. data further sapped confidence in the currency, while oil prices slipped despite expected OPEC supply cuts.
Spreadbetters expected European stocks to open lower, with Britain's FTSE falling 0.1 percent, Germany's DAX losing 0.5 percent and France's CAC dipping 0.3 percent. U.S. S&P mini futures were down 0.3 percent.

U.S. stocks came under heavy selling on Monday, with Nasdaq tumbling 3 percent, as investors dumped Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), internet and other technology shares. Conflicting signals between the United States and China on their trade dispute added to caution. (N)
""The drop by U.S. stocks will cut short any attempt by equity markets to mount a sustained bounce. Investor sentiment has been subdued by lingering weakness in U.S. technology shares,"" said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo.

Global stock markets have suffered a sharp shakeout in the past two months, pressured by worries of a peak in corporate earnings growth, rising borrowing costs, slowing global economic momentum and international trade tensions. Trillions of dollars were wiped off equities in a particularly torrid October month.
In currencies, the dollar struggled at a near two-week low against a basket of currencies.
Data released on Monday showed U.S. home builder sentiment recorded its steepest one-month drop in over 4-1/2 years in November.
The dollar had also been weighed down after Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida and Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan late last week raised concerns over a potential global slowdown.
The U.S. currency has rallied strongly this year, buoyed by three Fed rate hikes and a robust economy, though some expect the bull run may be nearing an end.
With long-term U.S. Treasury yields slipping to a seven-week low of 3.052 percent in the wake of weaker stocks and U.S. housing data, the dollar index against a basket of six major currencies hovered near 96.120, an 11-day low plumbed on Monday.
The euro was little changed at $1.1450 after gaining 0.35 percent overnight.
The dollar slipped to a three-week low of 112.40 yen and last traded at 112.55.
The Australian dollar, sensitive to shifts in risk sentiment, extended the previous day's retreat, slipping 0.3 percent to $0.7274.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Warburg Pincus LLC is looking to raise its second China-focused private equity fund of up to $4 billion, giving the U.S. investment firm more firepower to cut deals in the world’s second-largest economy, sources told Reuters.
The firm plans to formally launch the fundraising early next year, said the sources who declined to be named as the information was confidential. The move comes after it invested in Ant Financial's $14 billion financing round in June.
Warburg Pincus's new China fund will also invest alongside the firm's latest global PE fund which is set to close in the coming months, said the sources. The two funds will contribute equally to Warburg Pincus's future investments in China, they added. 
Warburg Pincus declined to comment. 
The latest fundraising will add to a massive industry-wide pool of money for Asian acquisitions and investments, notably in China, with investors attracted by rapid economic growth and a bigger pool of fast-growing technology companies compared to other major markets. 
As of mid November, Asia-focused PE managers raised a combined $49 billion in dollar-denominated funds for the region, up from $37.8 billion over the same period last year, according to data provider Preqin. 
China's Hillhouse Capital in September raised Asia's biggest PE fund at $10.6 billion. In June, Blackstone Group (N:BX) said it had raised about $9.4 billion for two new funds - the largest-ever fund dedicated to real estate investments in Asia as well as its first PE fund for the region.
Founded in 1966, Warburg Pincus was an early player in the Chinese market, with its first investment being made in 1994. Its second China fund will continue to invest in sectors including healthcare, financial services, technology, consumer and real estate, sources said. 
The firm's China investments include stakes in ESR, a pan-Asia logistics real-estate firm which plans a $1.5 billion Hong Kong IPO next year, according to Refinitiv publication IFR, as well as Chinese electric-vehicle maker NIO (N:NIO) and Chinese courier ZTO Express (N:ZTO), both of which are already listed in New York. 

Its first China fund, which raised $2 billion in late 2016, saw a 27.8 percent net internal rate of return as of the end of June, according to disclosures by one of the fund's limited partners - the Washington State Investment Board.

Nomura Holdings Inc. found that a push by companies in the U.S. and China for import substitution towards the rest of Asia will benefit Malaysia in particular, followed by Japan, Pakistan, Thailand and the Philippines, based on its analysis of specific products on the list of tariffs.
At the same time, Vietnam is the clear winner from companies switching production from China, followed by Malaysia, Singapore and India.
""As the saying goes, ‘when two quarrel, the third rejoices’,” analysts including Rob Subbaraman and Trevor Kalcic wrote in a note on Tuesday.

Of the 13 countries in its analysis, Bangladesh, India and South Korea are the least likely to gain from import substitution. Pakistan benefits least from the diversion of production and foreign direct investment.
Nomura’s Import Substitution Index is based on these criteria:
""The biggest benefit to Malaysia is likely to come from electronic integrated circuits, liquefied natural gas and communication apparatus,"" according to Nomura.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) plans to hold a conference call with airlines on Tuesday morning to discuss systems on the 737 MAX model that crashed in Indonesia last month, according to four sources with familiar with the matter.
A Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX crashed in the Java Sea on Oct. 29, killing all 189 people on board, in the first major accident involving the latest version of its popular narrow-body plane.
After the crash, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration warned airlines that erroneous inputs from the anti-stall system's sensors could lead the jet to automatically pitch its nose down even when autopilot is turned off, making it difficult for pilots to control.
 American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) last week said it had been ""unaware"" of some functions of the so-called Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) designed to prevent the 737 MAX from stalling.
Indonesian investigators said the system was not detailed in Lion Air's flight manual.
Bloomberg first reported on Boeing's plans to hold a call with airlines on Tuesday. One of the sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that the call might be postponed.
Boeing last week said it had provided two updates for operators around the world that re-emphasize existing procedures to deal with situations relating to MCAS. Boeing declined to provide further comment.
In a message to employees on Monday, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said news reports that claimed the manufacturer withheld information on MCAS from airlines were ""untrue"" and the function had been described in the flight crew operations manual, according to aviation journalist Jon Ostrower.
In a memo on Friday, a United Airlines (O:UAL) union said the carrier's pilots were properly trained to handle an MCAS malfunction even though the system was not mentioned in a course for those switching from older models to the new jet.
A preliminary report on the Lion Air crash will be released on Nov. 28 or 29, according to Indonesian investigators who have analyzed the doomed jet's flight data recorder.

However, divers have yet to locate the airline's cockpit voice recorder, which would shed light on pilot interactions that are important for gaining a fuller picture of the circumstances of the crash.

The deal marks the biggest contract by a South Korean carrier in numbers of a single aircraft type model, the company said. 
Reuters exclusively reported earlier this month that Jeju Air was in talks with Boeing and Airbus (PA:AIR) to buy 50 jets as the airline planned to expand its network that includes one of the world's busiest routes.
The purchase contract includes an option to buy an additional 10 aircraft, Jeju Air said.
The airline operator said it planned to take delivery of the planes between 2022 and 2026. 
Six South Korean budget carriers saw the number of passengers using international routes quadruple to 20.3 million in 2017 from 4.9 million in 2013, according to South Korea's transport ministry.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei fell on Tuesday morning as a drop in Nasdaq shares dragged down Japanese tech names, while Nissan Motor tumbled on news of Chairman Carlos Ghosn's arrest and dismissal. 
The Nikkei share average dropped 0.6 percent to 21,682.19 in midmorning trade.
Nissan Motor Co was the most-traded stock by turnover and tumbled 6.5 percent to 940 yen, its lowest since July 2016, after Nissan said Ghosn had been arrested over alleged financial misconduct and would be fired from the board this week.
Nissan said an internal investigation, triggered by a tip-off from a whistleblower, had revealed that Ghosn engaged in wrongdoing including personal use of company money and under-reporting his earnings for years.
""This is shocking,"" said Toru Ibayashi, executive director of Wealth Management at UBS Securities Japan.
""By under-reporting his corporate salary, he basically deprived Nissan's shareholders of opportunities to judge if the amount of his salary was appropriate. This incident will make investors review if Japanese corporate governance is working.""
While the market is in shock, some traders said that the downside for Nissan's share price may be limited.
""This is a big corporate governance issue, but it's not something that would affect its earnings right away,"" said Makoto Kikuchi, chief executive of Myojo Asset Management. ""With its stock trading way below its book value, it makes sense that some short-term investors are attracted to its cheap valuations.""
Mitsubishi Motors, another member of the Franco-Japanese partnership, also slid by about 6 percent. Mitsubishi said it would also remove Ghosn as its chairman.

Chip-equipment makers were sold as well, with Tokyo Electron falling 1.5 percent and Advantest Corp sliding 1.0 percent.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's Commonwealth Bank (AX:CBA) chief executive told a banking misconduct inquiry on Tuesday that his predecessor had told him to curb his ""sense of justice"" when he suggested halting sales of potentially harmful insurance products.
Australia's largest bank said last year it would have to refund about A$15 million ($10.9 million) to 64,000 customers after selling them unsuitable insurance when they obtained home loans or credit cards. 
""'Temper your sense of justice',"" the bank's CEO, Matt Comyn, said predecessor Ian Narev had told him in response to his advocacy for ceasing selling the products in 2015. 
""I was insufficiently persuasive,"" added Comyn, the former head of retail banking who replaced Narev in April in the wake of a money-laundering scandal at the bank.
Narev could not immediately be reached for comment.
Comyn was testifying under oath for a second day at the powerful Royal Commission inquiry which has exposed widespread misconduct throughout Australia's financial sector.
He is the first chief executive of a major bank to be grilled at quasi-judicial inquiry.
CBA Chairwoman Catherine Livingstone is also expected to face questioning from leading barrister Rowena Orr this week, followed by the heads of Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC), Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ), National Australia Bank (AX:NAB), and investment bank  Macquarie Group  Ltd (AX:MQG).
The bank stopped selling the poor-value insurance products in March this year, a few days before the Royal Commission began examining misconduct in the consumer credit industry. 
Comyn said there had been a number of other examples where the bank had put profits ahead of customers' interests, including charging clients fees without providing them with any services.
On Monday he told the inquiry that senior compliance staff had felt vindicated when regulators accused the bank of thousands of breaches of anti-money laundering laws.
The inquiry continues.

877,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 19, 2018 07:50PM ET</span>",India's Central Bank Signals Truce With Government Over Reserves,"(Bloomberg) -- India’s central bank signaled a compromise with the government by agreeing to study a demand for sharing a part of its capital -- an issue that had triggered a public spat between the monetary policy makers and their political bosses.
The Reserve Bank of India will form a panel to consider the funds transfer to the government, the central bank said in a statement after the board meeting that lasted a little over nine hours. It, however, did not immediately yield to demands for easing lending norms for weak banks while retaining capital buffers for banks at 9 percent.
“Both the RBI governor and the finance ministry walked the extra mile,” Sachin Chaturvedi, a member of the board said in an interview to Bloomberg. “They were flexible on several issues.”
The government and the RBI have been sparring over how much capital the central bank needs and how tough its lending rules should be. For a nation that relies on imported capital to fund investment, the reaching of a middle ground is key to retaining investor confidence in the world’s fastest-growing major economy.
India is not alone in witnessing friction between its monetary policy makers and the government. U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates while President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has leaned on Turkey’s central bank. Most economists argue leaving central banks to do their work free of political influence tends to lead to lower interest rates and inflation.
The rupee advanced and bonds rallied Monday before the meeting concluded, and amid optimism a common ground would be reached. The currency gained 0.4 percent to 71.6575 against the dollar, while the benchmark 10-year bond yield fell 3 basis points to 7.79 percent.
The board discussed Basel regulatory capital framework, a restructuring program for stressed small businesses, the health of weak banks placed under the so-called prompt corrective action and the economic capital framework of the RBI, the central bank said.
The 18-member board advised the RBI to consider restructuring of loans of up to 250 million rupees for small borrowers, it said.
Budget Goals
Getting the RBI to agree to its demands will help Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government, which faces an election early next year, meet budget goals by using a part of the central bank’s reserves. The government also wanted norms for some banks to be relaxed so they can lend easily and keep the economy firing ahead of an election next year. An RBI panel will review those norms, according to the statement.
Former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram said in a Twitter post he was glad the government had “stepped back and grudgingly acknowledged the independence of the RBI.” He added that most of the independent directors probably “realized that the government was on a perilous course and refused to go beyond giving advice to the RBI.”
The central bank -- led by Governor Urjit Patel -- had pushed back against some of the moves earlier, keen to burnish its inflation-targeting credentials and clean up one of the world’s worst bad-debt piles.
That approach has broadly helped anchor inflation expectations in a country where prices have often risen sharply, eroding investor confidence and leading to sell-offs in assets. The six-member monetary policy committee has raised interest rates twice this year and its decision has seen headline retail inflation slow to a 13-month low of 3.3 percent in October.
The board will meet again on Dec. 14, Chaturvedi said.

878,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 19, 2018 07:20PM ET</span>","IMF Sees Australia Risks Tilt to Downside on China, Trade War","(Bloomberg) -- The balance of risks to Australia’s economy are “tilted to the downside” due to a deteriorating global outlook, the International Monetary Fund said, urging the central bank to keep interest rates low.
In the concluding statement to its Article IV mission, the IMF said Australia’s economic expansion is expected to continue, further reducing slack in the economy and paving the way for “gradual upward pressure” on wages and prices. It welcomed the cooling of the housing market against a backdrop of strong growth, but warned that larger forces could buffet the economy.
“A weaker-than-expected near-term outlook in China, coupled with further rising global protectionism and trade tensions could delay full closure of the output gap,” the IMF said. “A sharp tightening of global financial conditions could spill over into domestic financial markets, raising funding costs and lowering disposable income of debtors, with the impact also depending on the response of the Australian dollar.”
Australia is the most China-dependent economy in the developed world and as a small, open trading nation is vulnerable to global volatility. Still, it grew at the fastest pace since 2012 in the second quarter and unemployment has fallen to 5 percent as record-low interest rates encourage firms to hire and invest.
Low Rates
“Despite recent strong growth and declining unemployment, it is not yet the time to withdraw macroeconomic policy support given remaining slack,” the IMF said. The Reserve Bank of Australia has kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 1.5 percent since August 2016.
“The disinflationary effects from continued strong retail competition still weigh on core inflation, while one-off declines in some administered prices have temporarily lowered headline inflation,” the IMF said, echoing RBA analysis.
The fund sees risks more evenly balanced on the home front.
“On the domestic side, a stronger pickup in the non-mining business sector, larger spillovers from public infrastructure investment, and the Australian dollar depreciation in real effective terms over the past year could boost near-term growth more than projected,” it said. “Domestic demand may equally turn out weaker if wage growth remained subdued or investment spillovers were smaller.”
Debt Warning
Treasury Secretary Philip Gaetjens on Sunday said government debt needs to be cut to restore Australia’s ability to combat any future economic downturn. “While the budget position has recently been improving on the revenue and spending sides, we have some work to do to reduce the government debt accumulated over the past decade, if we are to be as prepared to deal with future crises as we would like to be,” he said in a speech in Beijing.
Australian house prices climbed 70 percent in the past decade, led by a near-doubling of property values in Sydney and a 90 percent surge in Melbourne, the IMF said. It noted house prices have moderated recently due to tighter lending standards, increased supply, and easing foreign demand.
“The cooling of the housing market is welcome and can be weathered in a strong economy,” it said. “Housing supply reforms will be critical to restoring housing affordability.”

SEOUL/TOKYO (Reuters) - South Korean shipyards have boxed out their Japanese rivals from the market for building large ships carrying liquefied natural gas (LNG), winning all of the orders for the next three years worth more than $9 billion. 
Three South Korean yards -  Daewoo Shipbuilding  & Marine Engineering (DSME) (KS:042660),  Hyundai Heavy Industries  (KS:009540) and Samsung (KS:005930) Heavy Industries (KS:010140) - have won the more than 50 orders placed for new large-scale LNG tankers for delivery in the next three years, according to data from the companies and two tanker brokers.
The bulging orderbook illustrates the dominance the South Korean yards have achieved over their competitors, especially in Japan. It is also sign of how the companies have rebounded from a sector-wide slump only two years ago and how they are positioned to command the sector in the future.
""The demand for LNG carriers surged followed by increased global demand of LNG,"" said Park Hyung-gun, vice president of DSME. ""There is a bright outlook ahead for LNG demand and South Korean shipbuilders will be able to excel in the LNG market.""
(Graphic: LNG tanker orders - https://tmsnrt.rs/2PXkwDu) 
Including floating LNG storage and support vessels, ship brokerage Braemar estimates South Korean yards have bagged 78 percent of all LNG-related orders this year, with just 14 percent and 8 percent going to Japan and China, respectively. 
A set of data collected by another ship broker, who did not want to be identified, showed all of this year's orders for large LNG tankers went to South Korea, at a combined value of over $9 billion.
The new ships will increase the global LNG fleet by around 10 percent. Dominating this segment is key for shipyards, as gas consumption outgrows that of other fuels such as oil or coal.
The South Korean shipbuilders have outperformed their Japanese competitors this year with the equities for all three Korean firms rising while the Japanese builders are either flat or down.

KOREA RULES THE WAVES
With its dominance in new orders, this share will increase.
Virtually all the LNG from new projects in the Russian Arctic, Papua New Guinea, Australia, the United States, East Africa or Qatar will be delivered on South Korean ships made near the cities of Busan and Ulsan on the country's southern coast.
DSME said it has received 12 orders for LNG tankers this year. Those orders are worth about $2.2 billion to the company, according to data from Daiwa Capital Markets. 
LNG tanker orders this year have made up over half its business, DSME said, helping it recover from a near collapse in 2016/17, when its stocks were suspended amid one of the deepest shipping industry downturns on record.
An official at Samsung Heavy, who did not wish to be identified, said ""market conditions are improving"" and the firm has received 11 LNG tanker orders this year, around 40 percent of its total book.
Hyundai Heavy, which had its worst year ever in 2016, said LNG ship orders started rising in 2017.
This year, they will account for 21 percent of its new orders between January and September, up from 14 percent over the same period in 2017, company data showed.
Two-thirds of the global LNG vessels in service today were built in South Korea, according to Braemar, versus 22 percent from Japan, 7 percent from China, and the rest made in France, Spain and the United States.

MOSS TO MEMBRANE
South Korea's edge comes from its technological and service standards as well as investment into research and development. 
DSME developed the world's first ice-breaking LNG tankers and the company will deliver the eighth such ship, the Georgiy Brusilov, to Russia's Arctic LNG producer Novatek (MM:NVTK) this month. Another six are under construction.
Price is also a factor in South Korea's success, with the country's shipyards building LNG carriers for as low as $175 million, according to data from Daiwa. 
Japanese ships, however, are above $200 million, according a ship broker in Asia and a European shipping manager.
Further cementing South Korea's grip, the LNG industry has shifted away from the Moss tanker design, identified by the four or five spherical tanks holding the fuel and named for the company that designed them in 1973. 
Instead, customers are demanding Membrane-type vessels that leave less dead space within the ship's hull. This efficiency allows a Q-Max vessel, the largest class of Membrane carrier, to load up to 260,000 cubic meters of LNG versus 182,000 cubic meters on the biggest Moss-type tanker. 
""Ship designs are changing,"" said Park Moo-hyun, an analyst at Hana Financial Investment in Seoul, with customers preferring the Membrane tankers. 
""China and Japan are not well responding to the change... and this led to no orders (there)... and that's why European shipowners are placing orders to South Koreans,"" he added. 
Braemar estimates 71 percent of the global LNG tanker fleet is made up of Membrane carriers, versus 22 percent Moss tankers, and 7 percent using other systems.
This year, 93 large LNG carriers using the Membrane design were ordered versus only eight Moss style, according to Braemar. 
A spokesman for Japan's Mitsubishi Shipbuilding (T:7011) confirmed it has won no LNG carrier orders since 2015. A spokesman at Kawasaki Heavy Industries (T:7012) said the same. Japan Marine United last won an order in 2014.
UNFAIR SUPPORT?
Japan contends, however, that South Korea began unfairly supporting the shipyards during the 2016 downturn, when the South Korean government paid out subsidies and gave credit to keep the companies alive and their hundreds of thousands of workers employed. 
The country plans to file a complaint over the issue with the World Trade Organization (WTO), Japan's Nikkei paper reported this month.
Whoever dominates this market is set to reap large benefits.
Global LNG demand is surging from new users in emerging markets and because of a huge gasification program in China.
The fuel is set to become important for marine transport as the International Maritime Organization (IMO) will require shippers to use cleaner fuels from 2020.
The rising thirst is being met by new production projects, especially in North America and Australia, which will require more ships to transport LNG to its customers.
Korea's shippers are confident they will be the ones to ship most of this gas.

""I see the current cycle lasting for at least 10 years and South Korea is expected to keep dominating the LNG market. Rival countries can't catch up in the short term given their engineering skills and proficiency,"" said Hana Financial's Park.

880,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2018 07:00PM ET</span>",Norway's wealth fund should divest from RWE: green groups,"By Gwladys Fouche
OSLO (Reuters) - Green groups have urged Norway's $1 trillion wealth fund to sell its small stake in German power firm RWE, saying the company is a heavy polluter due to its coal-fired plants.
Greenpeace said in a report published on Tuesday that it was ""disgraceful"" that the world's largest sovereign wealth fund was still invested in RWE.
RWE is Germany's largest power producer and operates a number of coal-fired power plants. 
The report, entitled ""Last Gasp: The coal companies making Europe sick"", was co-authored by Greenpeace, the Sandbag climate think-tank and other environmentalists.
It used a European Commission-approved atmospheric model to estimate how coal power plant emissions impact pollution levels in the air over Europe and found RWE to be the worst offender. 
RWE said it was unable to comment specifically on the report as it had not seen it.
However, it said that all its coal-fired power stations fully complied with the emission limits established by law and the authorities. 
""The legislator's intention is to keep human health from being jeopardized, with the limits having the greatest protective effect on senior citizens and children. We constantly work on further reducing our specific emissions,"" RWE said in an emailed response to Reuters' request for comment. 
""In this context, account should be taken of the fact that the emissions of our power plants – above all nitrous oxides – only account for a very small portion of the emissions in the power stations' surroundings.
Norway's wealth fund, which is mandated to divest from companies that derive more than 30 percent of their revenues or activities from coal, had a 1.36 percent stake in RWE as of the end of 2017, worth $169 million, according to the fund's own data. 
""This new analysis should be a clear call for the Norwegian Government Pension Fund and other major RWE shareholders to exit the company,"" Martin Norman, head of Greenpeace Nordic's Sustainable Finance Campaign, told Reuters.
The wealth fund declined to comment. 
COAL EXCLUSION
Since it was mandated in 2015 to avoid companies heavily reliant on coal, the wealth fund has divested from 71 companies, mostly coal miners but also utilities using coal in their energy mix. 
It has kept investments in companies that have a credible plan to reduce their share of revenues from coal and/or increase revenues from renewable energy. 
It was not clear whether RWE derives more than 30 percent of its activities from coal.
The wealth fund's CEO, Yngve Slyngstad, said in an interview with Reuters last month that it was generally ""very difficult"" to get good data from power producers on this.
RWE said in its emailed response that it had a set a roadmap to sharply cut carbon dioxide emissions from lignite in 2015.
""The roadmap reveals that emissions will be cut by up to 50 percent by as early as 2030. It is regrettable that such facts have apparently not been considered in the report,"" RWE said.
RWE also said that after its asset swap transaction with German peer E.ON is completed, it would become ""Europe's third-largest renewables player"".

It said renewables would account for roughly 60 percent of its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and that 60 percent of its power generation portfolio would produce electricity with ""low or absolutely no carbon emissions"".

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Apollo Global Management LLC (N:APO) and billionaire co-founder Leon Black said on Monday they have uncovered proof that a former executive suing them for $1.5 billion stole confidential information as he prepared to bolt the private equity firm and compete with it.
The allegations were made in response to a July 12 lawsuit in which the former executive, Imran Siddiqui, said Apollo and Black tried illegally to undermine his new venture, Caldera Holdings Ltd, and prevent it from competing with their ""golden goose,"" the insurer  Athene Holding Ltd  (N:ATH).
It is rare for private equity firms to accuse former executives publicly of stealing trade secrets.
Apollo and Siddiqui have had multiple cases against each other, including in arbitration.
In a filing with a New York state court in Manhattan, Apollo and Black said emails uncovered from early 2017 show that Siddiqui was ""surreptitiously working"" with a more junior Apollo colleague and two former Athene executives, and using confidential information to form a competing company.
The emails are ""stark and blatant examples of Siddiqui's betrayal of Apollo and Athene"" when he was still a highly paid Apollo partner and should have been loyal, the filing said.
Siddiqui's lawyer Lisa Solbakken said the emails reflect no wrongful conduct, and the new allegations should be rejected.
""Apollo had released Mr. Siddiqui from any and all claims, known or unknown, prior to Feb. 21, 2018,"" she said in an interview. ""The reference to emails in 2017 smacks of desperation.""
A hearing on Apollo's and Athene's effort to dismiss Caldera's lawsuit has not been scheduled.
Black, 67, is worth $6.2 billion, according to Forbes magazine.
Athene and Caldera have battled each other for control of American Equity Investment Life Holding Co (N:AEL), an annuities specialist that put itself up for sale in May, the Financial Times has reported.
Apollo created Athene in 2009 to buy insurance assets that were hit hard during the global financial crisis.
Athene has since become a large U.S. annuity provider, with net income nearly doubling last year to $1.45 billion.
Apollo recently owned about 10 percent of Athene and controlled more than one-third of its voting power, according to a regulatory filing.
Siddiqui worked at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) and Oak Hill Capital Partners before joining Apollo. Caldera has said he denied possessing confidential Apollo materials.

The case is Caldera Holdings Ltd et al v Apollo Global Management LLC et al, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 652175/2018.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks dropped and the Nasdaq fell 3 percent on Monday as investors dumped Apple, internet and other technology shares, further shaking confidence in a group of stocks that has propelled the long bull market.
Conflicting signals over the state of play between the United States and China on their trade dispute added to caution in the market.
Shares of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell after the Wall Street Journal reported the company had cut production orders in recent weeks for all three iPhone models launched in September.
The iPhone maker's stock dropped 4.0 percent to $185.86 and is now down 19.9 percent from its Oct. 3 record closing high in the wake of a disappointing holiday quarter sales forecast and weak outlooks from several suppliers. The S&P 500 technology index, down 3.8 percent, led sector losses.
Other market leaders - including the 'FANG' stocks - also fell sharply. Shares of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) were down 5.7 percent, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) was down 5.1 percent, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) fell 5.5 percent and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) fell 3.8 percent.
Since the FANG outperformance run peaked on Aug. 30, the group has underperformed the S&P 500 by 16.25 percent. That is their worst underperformance since the first half of 2014, when they underperformed by around 20 percent.
""You're seeing that rotation away from tech. Certainly the indexes are much more growth-oriented because of the sheer size of those companies now, and they dominate the indexes,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. ""You're going to have more underperformance of the growth names.""
The S&P utilities and real estate sectors were the only two that ended in positive territory.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 395.78 points, or 1.56 percent, to 25,017.44, the S&P 500 lost 45.54 points, or 1.66 percent, to 2,690.73 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 219.40 points, or 3.03 percent, to 7,028.48.
Comments by New York Federal Reserve President John Williams (NYSE:WMB) on Monday that the U.S. central bank is pushing ahead with gradual rate-hike plans next month as it marches toward a more normal policy stance may have added pressure to stocks.
Some investors questioned whether the Fed will be able to continue raising interest rates, possibly harming growth.
Richard Clarida, the Fed's newly appointed vice chair, said on Friday that U.S. rates are nearing Fed estimates of a neutral rate, which ""makes sense.""
Over the weekend, Asia-Pacific leaders meeting in Papua New Guinea failed to agree on a communique for the first time, with U.S.-China trade worries on the forefront.
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said in a blunt speech on Saturday the United States will not back down from its trade dispute with China unless Beijing bows to U.S. demands, dampening Friday's trade optimism that was fueled by comments from President Donald Trump.
Shares of Apple suppliers were also hit, including Lumentum Holdings Inc, Universal Display Corp, Cirrus Logic Inc and Skyworks Solutions Inc.
The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index, which includes some Apple suppliers, dropped 3.9 percent, extending losses from the previous session.
""Lots of times we get a rally started the Friday after Thanksgiving, which is this week. If some of these dominos fall on the positive side, we could see this trend reverse,"" said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T (NYSE:BBT) Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. 
""But right now there are several things working against the market - the Fed, the uncertainty with regard to the trade deal with China and some sector disappointments, particularly in technology.""
Trading volumes were thin at the start of the holiday-shortened week ahead of Thanksgiving on Thursday and a shorter session on Friday, which brings slight volatility to markets, traders said.
About 7.7 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges. That compares with the 8.7 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.72-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.94-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 28 new 52-week highs and 18 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 17 new highs and 159 new lows.

902,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 19, 2018 04:49PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Lowe's Leads Earnings
The retail sector is in the crosshairs again tomorrow, as a host of companies reports earnings.
Investors will be focusing on Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW), which not only has numbers on retail, but also the housing market, which is the most problematic part of the economy.
On average, analysts predict a profit of 98 cents per share on sales of about $17.4 billion.
The housing sector has been hit hard recently, with KB Home (NYSE:KBH) tumbling last week due to cautious guidance.
Also reporting in the retail sector tomorrow are Kohl’s (NYSE:KSS), TJX (NYSE:TJX) and  Best Buy  (NYSE:BBY).
2. Housing Starts Expected to Climb
There’s more housing data arriving for investors tomorrow among the economic indicators.
At 8:30 AM ET (13:00 GMT), the government will report numbers on housing starts and building permits.
On average, economists predict that groundbreaking on new homes ticked up to an annual average of 1.225 million.
Building permits, an indicator of future demand, are forecast to tick up to a rate of 1.26 million.
3. Oil Keeps Going Higher
Oil could be volatile tomorrow, even with the holiday-shortened week.
Crude continued to see demand, rising some 0.5% today.
With this week’s Thanksgiving holiday, analysts had thought oil bears might be queasy about building new short positions due to the thinner trading volumes expected from Wednesday as the trade winds down for the break.
“There are signs that the bottom should now be in,” Phil Flynn at Chicago’s Price Futures Group said, citing “bulk demand ahead” in the new year. “Talk of oversupply and slowing demand are overstated in our view, so we are looking for a rebound.”"

905,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2018 04:10PM ET</span>",Danske whistleblower says big European bank handled $150 billion in payments,"By Teis Jensen and Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen
COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - The whistleblower who revealed alleged money laundering involving  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE) said on Monday that a major European bank helped process up to $150 billion in suspicious payments, or nearly two-thirds of the transactions under scrutiny.
Howard Wilkinson, who was head of Danske Bank's trading unit in the Baltics from 2007 to 2014, did not name the bank, but a source with direct knowledge of the case said he was referring to  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), which was one of the lenders clearing dollar transactions for Danske's Estonian branch.
A Deutsche Bank spokesman confirmed in a statement to Reuters the lender acted as a correspondent bank for Danske in Estonia. 
""Our role was to process payments for Danske Bank. We terminated the relationship in 2015 after identifying suspicious activity,"" the spokesman said. 
Wilkinson said two U.S. banks were also involved in handling dollar payments for Danske in Estonia, without identifying them. Alongside Deutsche, JPMorgan (N:JPM) and Bank of America (N:BAC) cleared dollar transactions for Danske's Estonian branch, sources have told Reuters.
JPMorgan ended the correspondent banking relationship with Danske in 2013 on grounds that transactions did not comply with anti-money laundering rules, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Bank of America declined to comment.
Authorities in Denmark, Estonia, Britain and the United States are investigating payments totaling 200 billion euros ($228.5 billion) made through Danske Bank's tiny Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015 in a growing global scandal.
""I would guess that $150 billion went through this particular bank (the large European bank) in the U.S.,"" the Briton told a Danish parliamentary hearing.
""No one really knows where this money went. All we know is that the last people to see it was these three large banks in the U.S. They were the last check, and when that failed, the money was into the global financial system,"" Wilkinson said.
Interim CEO Jesper Nielsen said the affair had tarnished the reputation of Danske Bank.
""We have breached the expectations society had of us. The case and the course of events around it does not reflect the bank we want to be,"" Nielsen told the Danish lawmakers after Wilkinson's testimony.
Wilkinson said that he had been offered cash by Danske Bank not to speak out, but had got a waiver last month allowing him to talk to some U.S. authorities, adding that he did not expect investigations into the ""dirty money"" to bear fruit.
""There is no chance in the world ... that any of that money is ever going to be tracked down and that any criminals lose a single cent,"" he said. 
""LACK OF INTEREST""
Danske Bank has acknowledged that its money laundering controls in Estonia were insufficient, but in a report issued in September said its board, chairman and chief executive had not breached their legal obligations.
""In April 2014 it became clear that the bank didn't intend to do anything,"" the former Danske Bank employee said, referring to earlier whistleblower reports. ""There was a curious lack of interest at senior management level.""
Wilkinson said that at the start of January 2014 he had looked at the three most profitable accounts involving British limited liability partnerships (LLPs).
""They were all fake. Not just that, they all basically looked the same. And it turned out they all had the same registered office in a suburb in North London ... I passed those on. By April none of the accounts ... had been closed down."" 
""I warned them (Danske) that if they didn't do a proper investigation and make the appropriate report to the police, then I was going to do it myself,"" Wilkinson said. 
In September this year Danske Bank said the first whistleblower report, which was titled ""Whistleblowing disclosure – knowingly dealing with criminals in Estonia Branch"", was sent to its executive board, group compliance and internal auditor at the end of December 2013.
However, the bank's report concluded that no ""red flags"" were shared with ex-CEO Thomas Borgen when he held ultimate executive responsibility for Estonia from 2009 to 2012. 
Borgen stepped down as CEO following the September report, saying that although he was ""cleared from a legal point of view"" he held ""the ultimate responsibility"". 
The scandal has emerged at the same time as a major government tax scandal and a fraud case in the Danish ministry for social affairs, undermining confidence in once trusted institutions and sparking calls for action from lawmakers.
Wilkinson said that Denmark's FSA financial regulator, which was not immediately available for comment, did not contact him before issuing a report on the allegations in May 2018 and called for Danish authorities to investigate the FSA's role.
""If Howard Wilkinson is correct in that he can't talk to the Danish authorities without being prosecuted that must obviously be changed. Authorities should investigate the case thoroughly and they can only do that if they can get the information,"" Danish business minister Rasmus Jarlov said on Twitter.
The FSA said in May it had not found sufficient basis for launching cases against members of Danske Bank's management.

906,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 19, 2018 04:03PM ET</span>",Stocks - Dow Drops Nearly 400 Points as Apple Leads Tech Rout,"Investing.com – A rout in Apple and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Monday swept through tech, prompting a wave of selling across the broader market.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 1.56%, the S&P 500 fell 1.66%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 3.03%.
Sentiment soured on FAANG stocks after investors digested a Wall Street Journal report that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was considering cutting production as demand for its newest slate of phones was not as strong as the company had hoped. Its shares fell 4%.
The plunge in Apple sent shockwaves throughout shares of its suppliers, some of whom had cut their growth outlook last week, adding further pressure in tech.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) also exacerbated the slide in the broader market as The Wall Street Journal reported that CEO Mark Zuckerberg may be driving out top executives. Its shares fell 6%.
The report from the Journal, indicating further signs of turmoil for the social media giant, comes just days after the company had denied allegations that it had conspired to cover up Russian influence and propaganda on its platform.
Energy, meanwhile, also played a role in the selloff even as U.S. oil prices settled higher, on potential European Union sanctions on Iran and possible OPEC production cuts.
In a sign of skittish sentiment on stocks, defensive sectors of the market like estate and utilities closed in positive territory for the day as investors sought refuge from riskier sectors.
Lingering optimism on U.S.-China trade was soiled, meanwhile, following Vice President Mike Pence's remarks Sunday, asserting that there would be no end to U.S. charges on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods unless China changed its practices toward trade. Pence's comments come ahead of a crucial meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit slated for the end of November.
So far, the United States has slapped tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, about half the value of U.S. imports from the country. China has retaliated with tariffs on $110 billion worth of American exports.
On the economic front, investors had to contend with yet another report pointing to a slowdown in the U.S. housing market, which did little to lift sentiment on equities.
The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index fell eight points to 60 in November. That was the lowest reading since August 2016.

907,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2018 03:42PM ET</span>","GE shakes up power unit leadership, taps retired exec to help","By Alwyn Scott
(Reuters) -  General Electric  Co (N:GE) shook up its ailing power business again on Monday, naming a CEO for its new gas-power division and bringing a veteran GE executive back from retirement to help.
The changes mark another step in new GE Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp's urgent effort to reduce heavy debt and restore profits at the 126-year-old, Boston-based conglomerate. 
It also highlights the problems at GE Power. Culp reorganized the division three weeks ago, separating its gas-turbine business from units that make coal- and nuclear-fueled power plants, power grids and other equipment.
""One of my top priorities is positioning our businesses to win, starting with GE Power,"" Culp said in a statement.
GE stock was down 1.1 percent at $7.94 in afternoon trading. The stock has fallen 56 percent this year. 
GE picked John Rice, a 39-year GE veteran who once headed its energy unit and retired last year, as chairman of gas power, reporting to Culp. 
Rice's ""knowledge of GE's gas customers and management experience"" will help him provide ""mentorship"" to the new gas power leaders and ""position this business and the team for success,"" GE said.
GE also named Scott Strazik, CEO of GE Power's repair and maintenance business, to be CEO of Gas Power, overseeing both equipment sales and services. 
GE Power's current Chief Executive Officer, Russell Stokes, will become CEO of other power activities.
Strazik and Stokes also will report to Culp, GE said.
Analysts said Rice's experience would help, but were cautious about prospects for a quick improvement in power's performance.
""GE is desperate for leadership,"" said Scott Davis, analyst at Melius Research, adding it was smart to bring Rice back.
Rice is ""a smart, prudent guy who is known for not taking any unwanted risk,"" said Nick Heymann, analyst at William Blair.
""Rice knows the business, but there is no quick fix,"" said Jeff Sprague, analyst at Vertical Research Partners. 
Stokes ""was handed a mess that's probably too big for one guy to fix,"" Sprague said of the new structure. 
But, he added, ""I don’t think this really changes anything."" 
GE Power's profits have plunged as demand for gas turbines has fallen, leaving GE, Siemens and Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems with overcapacity and fewer sales.

GE Power lost $631 million and wrote off $22 billion in the third quarter, reflecting the bleak profit outlook.

909,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 19, 2018 03:20PM ET</span>",Bargain Hunters Zero in on Saudi Bonds ,"(Bloomberg) -- As if the fallout over the killing of columnist Jamal Khashoggi wasn’t enough, oil’s decline has helped make Saudi bonds the worst performers among Gulf peers in the second half of this year. But all this panic has created buying opportunities.
“There are times when risks get overpriced,” said New York-based Shamaila Khan, director of developing-nation debt at AllianceBernstein. “We like to take advantage of that when it happens.”
The nation’s bonds have been roiled by the international outrage over the murder of Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Turkey. Meanwhile, the price of oil, the kingdom’s main source of income, plummeted into a bear market as the U.S. granted surprise waivers for sanctioned Iranian crude, spurring the yield on Saudi Arabia’s $5 billion bonds due 2028 to a record last week.
The kingdom’s five-year credit default swaps jumped 37 percent this quarter, the most among 40 contracts tracked by Bloomberg globally, to 94 basis points on Friday, according to CMA prices.
Not Just Saudi
Oman and Bahrain, which have the weakest finances in the region, have also seen their bonds decline with crude. The yield on Oman’s 2028 bonds have risen almost everyday this month to 6.6 percent on Friday, near the highest since the notes were issued this year, and the rate on similar maturity Bahraini securities climbed every day last week.
For Brett Rowley the Los Angeles-based managing director for emerging markets at TCW Group Inc., the short-term outlook for debt in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation council is being clouded by oil, and the selloff could provide an opportunity to gain “exposure to the energy producers at more attractive levels,” he said. “A 2014-style collapse is not our base case scenario.”
The economies of the six-member GCC are set to grow 2.4 percent this year and 3 percent in 2019, after contracting in 2017, the International Monetary Fund said last week.
Most of the countries in the region are “fairly strong credits” and will be able to withstand the recent drop in oil, said Khan at AllianceBernstein.

PARIS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - French banking giant  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) on Monday agreed to pay U.S. federal and state authorities $1.4 billion to resolve pending legal disputes.
The bank agreed to pay $1.34 billion to settle investigations into its handling dollar transactions in violation of U.S. sanctions against Cuba and other countries, the bank and the U.S. authorities said in separate statements.
Additionally, the bank said it agreed to pay $95 million to settle another dispute over violations of anti-money laundering regulations.
SocGen, as the bank is informally known, has been dogged for more than a year by a series of costly legal disputes. The last case it said remained to be settled was the one related to dollar transfers made on behalf of entities in countries subject to the U.S. economic sanctions.
""We acknowledge and regret the shortcomings that were identified in these settlements, and have cooperated with the U.S. Authorities to resolve these matters,"" the bank's Chief Executive Frederic Oudea said in a statement.
""These resolutions, following on the heels of the resolution of other investigations earlier this year, allow the Bank to close a chapter on our most important historical disputes,"" he added.
From 2003 to 2013, the bank executed billions of dollars in illegal transactions to parties in countries subject to embargoes or otherwise sanctioned by the United States, including Iran, Sudan, Cuba and Libya, the authorities said.
The fines were issued by the Federal Reserve, U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, the New York County District Attorney's Office and the New York Department of Financial Services. 
The $1.34 billion in penalties is the second largest imposed on a bank for violating U.S. sanctions, according to the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's office.
SocGen's French rival  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) agreed to pay $8.9 billion in a settlement on sanction violations in 2015.
SocGen has also signed deferred prosecution agreements, which provide that, following a three-year probation period, the bank will not be prosecuted if it abides by the terms of the agreements.
In a statement, the bank said the fine was entirely covered by the provision for disputes booked in Societe Generale's accounts and that the settlement would not have an additional impact on its results for 2018.
Societe Generale had a total provision of 1.58 billion euros to cover the financial cost the pending disputes could bring on its accounts.
In June, the bank had already agreed to pay $1.3 billion to authorities in the U.S. and France to end the disputes over transactions made with Libya and over the suspected rigging of Libor, a key interest rate used in contracts worth trillions of dollars globally.
As part of the process to settle the Libor case, the bank had agreed in march to let go Didier Valet, its deputy CEO in charge of investment banking activities, who was widely seen as a potential Oudea successor.
SocGen had already paid 963 million euros in mid-2017 to settle another dispute with the Libyan Investment Authority.

The deferred prosecution agreements are subject to court approval in the United States.

The proposals, which include an 8 percent pay increase for each year of a three-year agreement, were developed by the USW's National Oil Bargaining Policy conference in San Diego in late September. 
At least 75 percent of the USW locals representing 220 plants were required to ratify the proposals, which will be presented to negotiators from Shell (LON:RDSa) Oil Co., the U.S. arm of Royal Dutch Shell Plc (AS:RDSa), which will represent refinery and chemical plant owners.

OSLO (Reuters) - Nasdaq's Nordic clearing house will calculate additional risk-related capital requirements for trading members that move their accounts and positions from Britain to the European Union because of Brexit, the exchange said on Monday.
The new requirements are for the multimillion-dollar buffer fund that shields the market from defaults, the latest of which occurred in September when a Norwegian trader's failure forced members and the exchange to pay up about $130 million.
The default fund and its relevant mandatory contributions are calculated through Nasdaq's evaluation of the risk from important trading developments, such as Britain leaving the common market.
""In the coming months, several members of Nasdaq Clearing may carry out account and position transfers as part of a process to set up new memberships or change their memberships from the UK,"" the clearing house said in a statement.
To take into account the potential changes in open interest and risk, Nasdaq Clearing will carry out additional calculations of default fund requirements for the entities involved, it added.

A Nasdaq spokesman said changing accounts and positions from Britain to the EU is not mandatory for its members and the changes will only affect how capital demands are shared between members, not the total size of the fund.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Barclays  Plc (L:BARC) is not liable to investors who bought its U.S.-listed stock a few months before the 2008 financial crisis and accused the British bank of hiding its risky debt exposure and a capital shortfall, a U.S. court ruled on Monday.
In a 3-0 decision, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan upheld the dismissal of claims against Barclays and underwriters led by  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) over the British bank's April 2008 sale of $2.5 billion of American depositary shares. Barclays' share price had fallen 80 percent by the following March.
The 9-1/2-year-old case is among the last ones accusing big banks of having inflated their share prices by hiding or failing to fix soured credits on their balance sheets before the crisis.
Barclays was accused of concealing 21.6 billion pounds (then about US$42 billion) of mortgage-backed securities and other risky assets insured by monoline insurers, and a March 2008 ""directive"" by the U.K. Financial Services Authority requiring it to raise more equity capital.
Barclays might have had a duty to disclose its monoline exposure, but ""resoundingly"" showed that its omission had little or no impact on its share price, the appeals court said.
A regulator's ""expressions of concerns about a bank's financial status and vigorous requests - even if expressed urgently - to be kept apprised of the bank's contingency plans"" did not qualify as a ""directive,"" the court ruled.
Joseph Daley, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Barclays spokesman Andrew Smith declined to comment.
The decision on Monday affirmed a September 2017 ruling by U.S. District Judge Paul Crotty in Manhattan.
Crotty said the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc, the bailout of insurer American International Group Inc (N:AIG), and capital raisings by other British banks might also have contributed to Barclays' falling share price.

The case is In re: Barclays Bank Plc Securities Litigation, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 17-3293.

YOKOHAMA, Japan (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) Chairman Carlos Ghosn was arrested on Monday for alleged financial misconduct and will be fired from the board this week, a dramatic fall for a leader hailed for rescuing the Japanese carmaker from close to bankruptcy.
Ghosn is also chairman and chief executive of Nissan's French partner  Renault  (PA:RENA) and his departure will raise questions about the future of the alliance.
Nissan said an internal investigation, triggered by a tip-off from a whistleblower, had revealed that Ghosn engaged in wrongdoing including personal use of company money and under-reporting for years how much he was earning.
Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa said too much power had been concentrated on Ghosn, one of the best known figures in the global car industry and a rare foreign executive who enjoyed corporate superstar status in Japan for reviving the ailing Japanese brand. 
""The problem of governance was significant,"" Saikawa said, confirming the arrest of Ghosn in Japan. 
""Looking back, after 2005 when he became CEO of both Renault and Nissan, we did not really discuss the implications."" 
Saikawa, a long-standing lieutenant to Ghosn, said he could not give specifics on the personal use of company money but that the wrongdoing was serious and had gone on for years. 
Ghosn could not be reached for comment. 
""To have so greatly violated the trust of many, I feel full of disappointment and regret,"" Saikawa told a late night news conference. ""It's not just disappointment, but a stronger feeling of outrage, and for me, despondency.""
Saikawa took over as Nissan CEO from Ghosn last year. Ghosn once told reporters the two thought alike. 
Saikawa said he would propose at a board meeting on Thursday to remove Ghosn and Representative Director Greg Kelly, who was also accused of financial misconduct. Kelly could also not be reached for comment. 
Renault shares tumbled 11 percent in Paris to be among the worst performing stocks in Europe (STOXX). Nissan's German-listed securities (TG:7201) dropped 10 percent. 
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the government, Renault's top shareholder, would safeguard the long-term viability of the carmaker.
""The key question for us is to ensure the stability of Renault and of the alliance between Renault and Nissan, so I am working on that with all the parties,"" he told reporters in Brussels after a meeting of euro zone finance ministers.
GOVERNANCE 
Known as ""Le Cost Killer"" for overseeing turnarounds that included cuts, Ghosn has remained popular in Japan despite pushing through massive job losses and recent controversy over his pay.
Japanese media said Ghosn had reported about 10 billion yen ($88.9 million) of annual compensation as about 5 billion yen for several years.
Ousting Ghosn, 64, is bound to raise questions about an alliance that he personally shaped and had pledged to consolidate with a deeper tie-up, before eventually stepping back from its operational leadership.
""It is hard not to conclude that there may be a gulf opening up between Renault and Nissan,"" said Bernstein analyst Max Warburton, raising the prospect of a potential ""re-Japanization"" of Nissan and the end of the alliance.
Citi analyst Raghav Gupta-Chaudhary said the share price reaction showed how important Ghosn was to the partnership, adding that the alliance had long undervalued Nissan shares held indirectly by Renault investors.
""Ghosn is viewed as critical for value unlock,"" he added.
Renault owns 43.4 percent of Nissan, while Nissan owns 15 percent of Renault, with no voting rights in a partnership that began in 1999. Since 2016 Nissan has held a 34 percent controlling stake in its smaller Japanese rival, Mitsubishi.
A statement from Mitsubishi said it would propose removing Ghosn from its board.
Monday's news is likely to raise questions about Nissan's accountability at a time when Japan has been pushing companies for better governance. 
Recent cases of corporate malfeasance have hit companies including accounting irregularities at Toshiba Corp (T:6502) and data falsification and improper inspections by manufacturers including Nissan. 
The Asahi newspaper reported on its website that prosecutors had begun searching the offices of Nissan's headquarters and other locations on Monday evening.
Brazilian-born, of Lebanese descent and a French citizen, Ghosn began his career at  Michelin  (PA:MICP) in France, moving on to Renault. He joined Nissan in 1999 after Renault bought a controlling stake and became its CEO in 2001. Ghosn remained in that post until last year. 
In June Renault shareholders approved Ghosn's 7.4 million euro ($8.5 million) pay package for 2017. In addition to this, he received 9.2 million euros in his final year as Nissan chief executive.

932,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2018 12:08PM ET</span>",Apple cuts production orders for all three new iPhone models: WSJ,"(Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) has cut production orders in recent weeks for all three iPhone models launched in September, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing sources.
A lower-than-expected demand for the new iPhones and Apple's decision to offer more models has made it difficult to anticipate the number of components and handsets the company needs, according to the WSJ report https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-suppliers-suffer-as-it-struggles-to-forecast-iphone-demand-1542618587.
Apple shocked investors a few weeks ago with a sales forecast for the Christmas quarter below Wall Street expectations, prompting certain suppliers to issue warnings that pointed to weakness in new iPhone sales.
Screen maker  Japan Display Inc  (T:6740) cut its full-year outlook citing weaker smartphone demand, while British chipmaker IQE Plc (L:IQE) said it expects a material reduction in its financial performance in the current year.
 Lumentum Holdings Inc  (O:LITE), AMS AG (S:AMS), companies which supply Apple with software needed for its FaceID technology, also lowered their forecasts.
Another supplier  Analog Devices  Inc (O:ADI) is expected to report fourth-quarter results before markets open on Tuesday.
Apple shares were down 3.7 percent at $186.38 on Monday, while Lumentum,  Skyworks Solutions Inc  (O:SWKS) and  Qorvo Inc  (O:QRVO) were down between 2.7 to 6 percent.
Forecasts have been particularly problematic for iPhone XR with Apple cutting its production plan by up to a third of the nearly 70 million units some suppliers had been asked to produce between September and February, WSJ reported.
As recently as last week, Apple informed several suppliers that it had lowered its production plan again for iPhone XR, the Journal said.
The company started selling its latest generation of phones, the iPhone XS and XS Max, in September and the XR model in October.
Analysts at Cowen & Co expect a modest hit from iPhone production cuts on memory chipmakers like  Western Digital  Corp (O:WDC) and Micron Technology Inc (O:MU).
The brokerage forecast a 10 cent headwind to Micron and 15 cent headwind to Western Digital in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 on lower iPhone builds.
Micron's shares were down 3.4 percent while Western Digital was down 1.7 percent.

Apple did not respond to a request for comment.

The Fox assets being acquired include a cable group with FX Networks, National Geographic and 300-plus international channels, plus Fox's stake in Hulu. 
The deal would expand Disney's unrivalled portfolio of some of the world's most popular characters, uniting Mickey Mouse, Luke Skywalker and Marvel superheroes with Fox's X-Men, ""Avatar"" and ""The Simpsons"" franchises. 
Disney owns ABC, ESPN, Pixar, Marvel Studios and ""Star Wars"" producer Lucasfilm, plus an array of theme parks.

953,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2018 09:35AM ET</span>",Wedding gown seller David's Bridal files for bankruptcy,"(Reuters) - Wedding dress retailer David's Bridal Inc filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Monday, but said brides would receive their gowns on time during its restructuring.
The 68-year old company is the latest retailer to succumb to competition against online stores, which give customers more options and are often more transparent about prices.
David's Bridal stores have in recent years turned into mere showrooms where customers try on gowns and test designs, only to buy them online for cheaper.
More than 20 retailers have filed bankruptcy since the beginning of 2017, including Toys 'R' Us and more recently, Sears Holdings, once the world's largest retailer.
David's Bridal said Chapter 11 restructuring would help it reduce its debt by more than $400 million.
The company has secured $60 million in debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing from its current term loan lenders and a recommitment for a $125 million asset-based loan to keep its stores open during restructuring and pay vendors.

U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters on Friday that his administration may not impose tariffs on more Chinese goods after China sent a list of measures that it would be prepared to take in order to help resolve a trade dispute between the two nations.
But hopes that Trump’s remarks might signal a change in the direction of negotiations were dashed by Vice President Mike Pence on Saturday. Pence insisted that the U.S. will not back down from its trade dispute with China, and might even double its tariffs, unless Beijing bows to U.S. demands.
Pence’s comments dashed hopes of meaningful progress between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G20 meeting to be held at the end of the month.

Earlier Monday, Japan's Asahi News reported that the Brazil-born Ghosn was to be arrested on suspicion of violating Japan's Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. Another Japanese media outlet, Yomiuri Shimbun,  reported Monday that Ghosn had been arrested.
Nissan confirmed the subject of the investigation Monday and said it was cooperating with prosecutors.
""As the misconduct uncovered through our internal investigation constitutes clear violations of the duty of care as directors, Nissan's Chief Executive Officer Hiroto Saikawa will propose to the Nissan Board of Directors to promptly remove Ghosn from his positions as Chairman and Representative Director,"" Nissan said in the statement. ""Saikawa will also propose the removal of Greg Kelly from his position as Representative Director.""
Ghosn stepped down as CEO of Nissan in 2017. Nissan has been part of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance since 1999. Renault's shares, already battered by the US-China trade war, are down about 33% this year.

963,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2018 06:27AM ET</span>","China's Xiaomi swings to net profit in third-quarter on robust sales in India, Europe","By Josh Horwitz
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Inc said on Monday it swung to a net profit in the third quarter, beating analyst estimates, driven by robust sales in India and Europe.
Profit for the three months through September reached 2.48 billion yuan ($357.23 million), versus an 11 billion yuan loss in the same period a year earlier. That compared with a 1.92 billion yuan average of five analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv Eikon. 
Xiaomi also said operating profit sank 38.4 percent to 3.59 billion yuan in the third quarter. Revenue rose 49.1 percent to 50.85 billion yuan.
The mixed results come amid a slowdown in smartphone purchases both in China, where Xiaomi once was the top-selling handset brand, and overseas.
Nevertheless Xiaomi, along with fellow low-cost handset makers Oppo and Vivo, accounted for around a quarter of the global smartphone market in the first half of 2018, showed data from researcher IDC.
Xiaomi's fastest-growing markets are India, where it has had success with its budget Redmi phone series, and Europe, where it entered in 2017 with launches in Russia and Spain. Earlier this month it released its flagship Mi 8 Pro device in Britain.
But to weather the global market slowdown, analysts said Xiaomi needs to expand to new markets and also sell more higher-priced devices with wider profit margins.
The firm has been adding new brands to its smartphone portfolio to target niche consumers. Concurrent with today's earnings, it announced a partnership with Meitu Inc, a maker of a photo app popular with young women, to sell phones under its brand. Earlier this year it launched Black Shark, a phone targeted at gamers, and Poco, a value-for-money device aimed at India.
Mo Jia, who tracks China's smartphone makers at research firm Canalys, said attempts to sell more expensive devices requires changing its brand perception.
""It's still very hard for Xiaomi to change its perception of being a low-end device manufacturer as the majority of its smartphone shipments are the Redmi series.""
Xiaomi also aims to transform itself from a smartphone firm into a software company. As the firm prepared for its IPO, founder Lei Jun touted internet services - namely advertisements placed on the firm's in-house apps - as its future and key differentiator from other handset brands.
In the third quarter, Xiaomi's smartphone division grew revenue by 36.1 percent while its internet service division grew 85.5 percent. But phones made up 64.6 percent of total sales, while internet services made up 9.3 percent.
The results are the second set released by Xiaomi since the smartphone maker raised $4.72 billion in an initial public offering (IPO) in June, valuing the firm at about $54 billion - around half of some earlier industry estimates of $100 billion.

Its shares have fallen roughly 20 percent since they started trading in July amid a broader Chinese stock market sell-off and concern about a slowdown in China's tech industry.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - More than a dozen top U.S. energy companies have pledged $100 million toward easing stresses on health care, education and civic infrastructure from the shale oil and gas boom in West Texas and New Mexico, the group said on Sunday. 
 Chevron  (NYSE:CVX), EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG),  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) are among 17 companies backing the Permian Strategic Partnership, as the consortium is called, Don Evans, a former U.S. government official and energy executive helping launch the group, told Reuters on Saturday. 
The group seeks to address labor and housing shortages, overtaxed health care and traffic congestion caused in part by companies descending on the Permian Basin, the nation's largest oilfield, where they hope to pump billions of dollars' worth of oil and gas in coming decades, experts said.
“It's a significant amount of money, but these are huge challenges,” said Evans, a former U.S. Secretary of Commerce who lives in Midland, Texas, the epicenter of the shale oil revolution. “We don't have enough teachers. We don't have enough doctors.”
The group aims to work with regional and federal officials, companies, nonprofit groups and educators in New Mexico and Texas, said Evans, who started in the Permian and became CEO of producer Tom Brown Inc before joining the administration of former President George W. Bush. 
The group is assembling plans to hold meetings in communities across the region, so ""everyone have a voice"" in the undertaking. There is no timetable or plan for how the initial contribution will be spent. The group is recruiting staff and searching for office space, he said. 
In the last decade, the region's many pockets of oil and low production costs have led to gold rush-like conditions in the Permian. Companies are pouring staff and equipment into the oilfield, which is expected to pump 3.7 million barrels of oil per day by December, four times its rate in 2010, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
That boom has local employers, including restaurants and school systems, under pressure from staff leaving for oilfield jobs. Midland's unemployment rate was 2.1 percent in October, compared to the nation's 3.7 percent rate. 
The last decade's shale boom also has led to school overcrowding, soaring traffic fatalities, drug abuse and strains on the power grid because of the activity. 
“Our roads are not designed to handle the amount of truck traffic we have,” said Jeff Walker, transportation training coordinator at New Mexico Junior College in Hobbs.
Drug charges in Midland more than doubled between 2012 and 2016, to 942 from 491, according to police data. Traffic accidents also jumped 18 percent between 2016 and 2017 in Midland County, and 29 percent in nearby Ector County, according to Texas Department of Transportation data.

“They all agree that scaling up infrastructure is going to be a huge challenge,” said Bob Peterson, a partner at consultancy Arthur D. Little who advises producers. ""There’s a common agreement that there’s a whole bundle of problems.""

BOSTON (Reuters) - Fidelity Investments on Friday named technology executive Steve Neff to run its big asset management division, a move that shows the growing importance of data systems for fund companies.
Neff, a 22-year Fidelity veteran, replaces Charlie Morrison, whose pending retirement the privately held Boston firm announced in October.
""It's an opportune time for Steve to lead Asset Management, as technology is becoming increasingly important in our efforts to deliver outstanding investment performance and solutions for our customers,"" Fidelity Chief Executive Abigail Johnson wrote in a memo to employees seen by Reuters.
Johnson said Neff will continue to report to her and remain a member of the company's operating committee. His successor as head of technology and global services will be named soon, she said.
Fidelity had $2.5 trillion in total assets under management as of March 31, according to the company's website. In its latest annual report, Fidelity's parent said assets under management rose more slowly than at some rivals, but reported strong investment performance and said its operating profit rose.
Neff previously held jobs supporting Fidelity investment operations. In the new role he will oversee more than 500 investment professionals running Fidelity's best-known products like the $120 billion Contrafund.
Lately Fidelity has been aggressively lowering and eliminating fees as it battles industry rivals for cost-conscious clients, a dynamic that has increased the importance of smooth technology operations.
John Bonnanzio, who edits a newsletter for Fidelity investors, said via e-mail the selection of Neff could raise cultural questions since Fidelity's analysts and fund managers are ""investment geeks, not techno geeks.""
But the pick could make sense, Bonnanzio said: ""Perhaps it's also a reflection of the fact that technology is integral to everything Fidelity does and, increasingly, security selection, too.""

Germany's DAX (GDAXI) fell into the red and France's CAC 40 (FCHI) wilted to trade flat as Renault shares dented the index.

Spokesmen for Renault and the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Motors (T:7211) alliance did not immediately return calls and messages seeking comment.

Chipmaker stocks AMS (S:AMS), STMicro (MI:STM) and Siltronic (DE:WAFGn), which are highly sensitive to trade war news, were among top gainers, up 4.1 to 6.3 percent. 
The gains were helping the sector claw back some of the ground lost last week after a series of profit warnings ahead of the crucial holiday season.
 Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb) shares climbed 2.5 percent after JP Morgan upgraded the pharmaceuticals company to ""overweight"".
Salvatore Ferragamo (MI:SFER) shares fell 3.3 percent, bottom of Italy's FTSE MIB index, after Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) analysts cut the luxury stock to ""underperform"" after a four-day luxury goods field trip to China.
Swatch (S:UHR) shares also lost 3.9 percent after BAML slashed its price target on the stock by 27 percent, saying watch retailers they met confirmed a significant slowdown in recent months. 
The FTSE 100 (FTSE) managed a 0.3 percent gainas traders and investors said the lack of fresh bad news on Prime Minister May's draft Brexit deal drove relief. 
Overall Europe's earnings season has failed to impress investors, and analysts have continued to cut their earnings estimates for the STOXX 600 at the fastest pace since the Brexit vote selloff of June 2016.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) -  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE) has been caught up in one of the largest-ever money laundering scandals. Howard Wilkinson, the whistleblower who first alerted Denmark's biggest bank to the problem, testified before the Danish parliament on Monday. 
HOW BIG A SCANDAL IS THIS?
Some 200 billion euros ($227 billion) in payments flowed through the non-resident portfolio of Danske Bank's tiny Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015. The bank eventually commissioned a report which concluded in September that many of these payments were suspicious.
WHERE WAS THIS MONEY FROM?
Most of the payments came from Estonia, Russia, Latvia and Cyprus and Britain, the report said. Shell (LON:RDSa) companies were used to disguise the identities of those involved, former chairman Ole Andersen has told Reuters.
AND WHERE WAS IT GOING?
Payments went to Estonia, Latvia, China, Switzerland, Turkey, Britain and more than 150 other countries, the report said.
WHO BLEW THE WHISTLE?
Howard Wilkinson, the head of the bank's trading unit in the Baltics from 2007 to 2014, was the whistleblower who had warned the executive board in Copenhagen in 2013 and 2014 about suspicious activities at the Estonian branch, Danish newspaper Berlingske reported in September. 
WHY DIDN'T AUTHORITIES ACT SOONER?
Denmark's financial watchdog faces an inquiry by the European Union's banking supervisor, and the Danish business minister has criticized the regulator for not being critical enough toward the bank and for trusting it too much.
HAS ANYONE BEEN FOUND RESPONSIBLE?
Not yet. The case is under criminal investigation in Denmark, Estonia and the United States. 
The Danish state prosecutor's investigation includes whether top management can be held personally liable. 
Britain's National Crime Agency (NCA) has said it is investigating the use of UK-registered companies.
CONSEQUENCES FOR DANSKE BANK?
Denmark's financial regulator has said the bank's compliance and reputational risks have risen and increased its capital requirements by 10 billion Danish crowns ($1.5 billion).
In May the regulator, which is still looking at the case, imposed eight orders for reforms and eight reprimands.
HAS ANYONE TAKEN THE BLAME?
Danske Bank's former chief executive Thomas Borgen stepped down, saying that although he was ""personally cleared from a legal point of view"" he held ""the ultimate responsibility"". 
The Maersk family, which controls about 21 percent of the bank's shares, ousted chairman Ole Andersen and nominated Karsten Dybvad, who heads the Confederation of Danish Industry, to take over.
WHAT ABOUT DANSKE'S SHARES?
Danske Bank's shares are trading 40 percent below their level at the end of February, even following an uptick when its Nov. 1 earnings report showed lending increased in the third quarter despite the scandal. https://tmsnrt.rs/2PvfSwZ
WHAT NEXT FOR DANSKE BANK?
The U.S investigation is worrying for Danske Bank shareholders as U.S. fines tend to be much larger than those in Denmark and Estonia, and Europe in general.
For many, the worst-case scenario is if the bank suffers the same fate as Latvian bank ABLV, which lost access to dollar funding when U.S. authorities accused it in February of covering up money laundering, forcing its closure.
Danske Bank has said the two cases cannot be compared as it closed the part of the Estonian business under suspicion.
The U.S. authorities also alleged that ABLV violated sanctions imposed on North Korea. 
Danske Bank has said that it has not found any breaches of sanctions.
ARE THERE WIDER CONSEQUENCES FOR DENMARK?
Danske Bank is an integral part of Danish business and the scandal comes as a government tax scandal and a fraud case in the ministry for social affairs have undermined confidence in institutions on which its welfare society is built. 
The case is also a risk for Denmark's entire financial sector, the Systemic Risk Council said in September, prompting the government to increase the cash cushion financial firms must hold to protect against economic shocks.
WHAT DOES THE BANK SAY IN ITS DEFENSE?
Danske Bank has acknowledged that its money laundering controls in Estonia has been insufficient.
But in its September report it said the board had not breached its legal obligations.
The bank has since boosted compliance efforts, with around 1,000 of its 20,000 staff working on this.
IS IT ONLY DANSKE BANK?
Danske might only be the ""tip of the iceberg"" and investigators should examine major Western banks, Wilkinson's lawyer told Reuters.
HOW TO PREVENT A REPEAT?
Denmark plans to strengthen its financial regulator, while a broad majority in the Danish parliament has agreed to tighten the country's anti-money laundering laws, including increasing penalties by up to 700 percent. 

European Union states are still divided over an overhaul of rules for the supervision of banks against money laundering, two EU sources told Reuters.

However, the change has not ended the battle raging at  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) between activist investor Elliott and French media group  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) which remains the largest shareholder and voted against Gubitosi.
A former head of telecoms group Wind and now state-appointed commissioner of struggling airline Alitalia, Gubitosi succeeds Amos Genish, the third TIM CEO to leave in as many years, who was unexpectedly fired last Tuesday over what sources said were disagreements with board members over strategy.
Telecom Italia (TIM) shares rose 4.4 percent by 0940 GMT, outperforming a 0.7 percent rise in Europe's telecoms index. 
""The exit of Genish and the appointment of Gubitosi add speculative appeal but also strategic and governance uncertainty,"" Banca Akros said in a note. 
Gubitosi was appointed to the TIM board after a boardroom coup in May in which Elliott wrested control from Vivendi.
The former Merrill Lynch banker is expected to pursue the activist agenda proposed by Elliott, which included the spin-off of TIM's network infrastructure and its merger with smaller, state-backed broadband rival Open Fiber, asset sales and a conversion of its savings shares.
However, Genish, who had been pursuing a three-year turnaround plan, remains on the board and is determined not to give up without a fight.
He said on Sunday he would seek to call a shareholder meeting to have investors decide on the drastic change in strategy. 

Vivendi voted against Gubitosi, a spokesman for the French investor said, adding it would be up to shareholders to decide what is the right board to roll out TIM's future strategy.

LONDON (Reuters) - World shares started the week on the front foot on Monday, amid conflicting signals of a potential truce in the China-U.S. trade dispute, while the Federal Reserve's new-found concerns over the global economy sapped the dollar.
Asia took a while to warm up but made a strong finish [.T][.SS] and Europe started well too as a 1 percent jump in mining, tech and bank stocks helped traders shrug off last week's Brexit woes. (EU)
In the currency market, the pound saw some respite as the dollar went limp. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 also turned higher, having dithered in Asia.
Wall Street had firmed on Friday after U.S. President Donald Trump said that he might not impose more tariffs on Chinese goods after Beijing sent a list of measures it was willing to take to resolve trade tensions.
The comment stoked speculation of a deal when Trump meets Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of a G20 summit in Argentina this month.
However, Chinese-U.S. tensions were clearly on display at an APEC meeting in Papua New Guinea over the weekend, where leaders failed to agree on a communique for the first time ever.
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said in a blunt speech that there would be no end to U.S. tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods until China changed its ways.
""The comments from Trump were seen as offering a glimmer of hope that further tariff action could be held in abeyance,"" said NAB's head of FX strategy, Ray Attrill.
""The exchange of barbs between Pence and Chinese President Xi Jinping in PNG on the weekend continues to suggest this is unlikely.""
SENSING A FED SHIFT
Also uncertain was the outlook for U.S. interest rates.
Federal Reserve policymakers are still signaling rate increases ahead but also sounded more concerned about a potential global slowdown, leading markets to suspect the tightening cycle may not have much further to run.
Investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) chimed in, saying it expected the pace of U.S. economic growth to slow toward the global average next year. 
As a result, it now sees a broad dollar decline next year. It revised its long-standing bearish view on the Japanese yen and tipped Latin American currencies, the Swedish krona, the Canadian, Australian and New Zealand dollars and the Israeli shekel to rise.
""We see several changes to the global economic backdrop which, combined with a few negative medium-run factors, point to more downside than upside to the broad dollar in 2019,"" Goldman analysts said in a macroeconomic outlook report. 
That will focus attention on an appearance by New York Fed President John Williams (NYSE:WMB) later on Monday to see if he echoes the same theme.
Investors have already lengthened the odds on further hikes, with a December move now priced at 73 percent, down from over 90 percent. Futures imply rates around 2.74 percent for the end of next year, compared to 2.93 percent early this month. <0#FF:>
Yields on U.S. 10-year paper have duly declined to 3.08 percent, from a recent top of 3.25 percent.
The dollar followed to hover at 96.416 against a basket of currencies, down from a peak of 97.693. The euro was parked at $1.1417, while the dollar backed off to 112.72 yen. 
Sterling edged higher to $1.2854 after political turmoil over Brexit caused steep losses last week. 
British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Sunday that toppling her would risk delaying Brexit as she faces the possibility of a leadership challenge from within her own party.
With both pro-EU and pro-Brexit lawmakers unhappy with the draft agreement, it is not clear that she will be able to win the backing of parliament, increasing the risk that Britain will leave the EU without a deal.
In commodity markets, gold found support from the drop in the dollar and held at $1,1220.19.
Oil prices suffered their sixth straight week of losses last week, but have found some support from expectations that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will cut output. 

Brent crude was up 54 cents at $67.30 a barrel, while U.S. crude gained 70 cents to $57.16.

974,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 19, 2018 04:42AM ET</span>","Activist Investor `Wolves' to Focus on Industrials, Report Says","(Bloomberg) -- Large industrial companies are seen becoming the most preyed upon in Europe by activist investors looking to force through strategic change, according to a report by a global consulting firm.
The attention of activists is moving away from the consumer sector as many such companies, particularly retailers, are too weak, while others have already been targeted, according to Alvarez & Marsal Inc. Energy companies are also dropping off the radar as recovering commodity prices fuel improving profits and share prices.
Many industrial companies “operate under a conglomerate structure, often reporting uneven divisional performance,” said Malcolm McKenzie, a managing director at A&M in London. “At a time when private equity funds have record levels of dry powder to deploy, activists are well aware of the opportunities to spin off underperforming business lines.”
Insights From Report
Boards need to act fast in addressing underperformance “before the wolves come calling,” McKenzie said.
More than a hundred companies based in Europe have been publicly subjected to activist demands so far this year, according to a separate study by researcher Activist Insight and law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP. As of Sept. 30, 9 percent of those companies were in the consumer goods industry, while 8 percent were industrial goods, according to the report.
In recent instances of involvement by activists,  Whitbread  (LON:WTB) Plc agreed to the sale of its Costa Coffee business in August following pressure from billionaire Paul Singer’s Elliott Management Corp.

The FD newspaper, which also received a copy of the letter, published sections in which the authors ask for ""whistleblower status"" to air their grievances, which also include ""integrity"" concerns.
ABN said in its response that the bank wasn't sure the letter was actually written by employees and it was not clear why they would communicate by anonymous group letter rather than the bank's internal communications, which include whistleblower protections.
Former ABN chairwoman Olga Zoutendijk was forced out nine months ago over differences about her ""leadership style"". 
Zoutendijk, an outsider hired from  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN), pushed for the early departure of former CEO Gerrit Zalm, a former finance minister deeply embedded within the country's ruling elite. 
The Dutch government retains a 56 percent stake in ABN after its nationalization during the 2008 financial crisis.
Zalm left a year before his term expired in 2017, followed by Zoutendijk herself. 
New CEO Kees van Dijkhuizen was promoted from CFO and said that calm had been restored.
According to the FD report, the managers are concerned about the bank's lack of vision. 
Zoutendijk had pushed for ABN's investment banking arm to do more business abroad, but in the letter managers complain those plans have been rolled back under Van Dijkhuizen and new chairman Tom de Swaan, a former member of the country's central bank.
ABN's current strategic vision is to remain a profitable Dutch-focused bank and to grow its private banking business in Northwest Europe.

This month ABN reported a third quarter net profit of 725 million euros ($830 million), up from 673 million a year earlier.

The massive goodwill sitting on the books of Chinese listed companies - roughly 1.45 trillion yuan ($208.87 billion) by some estimates - threatens to worsen the financial woes of many small firms already struggling under margin call pressure.
Goodwill - an intangible asset class arising from one company acquiring another for a premium value - has exploded following China's mergers & acquisition (M&A) boom in 2013-2015. Now, as China's economy slows amid deleveraging and the Sino-U.S. trade war, regulators caution that goodwill would evaporate.
GRAPHIC: Proportion of goodwill impairment to Chinese listed firms' profits - https://tmsnrt.rs/2QULbxZ
Over the weekend, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) tightened disclosure rules around goodwill, urging listed companies to conduct timely impairment test at the end of each fiscal year. Companies are also required to make ""rational"" assessment of the need for goodwill write-down, by taking into account factors such as prolonged deterioration in profitability, a worsening competitive environment, and macro-economic risks.
Sectors with significant goodwill assets fell sharply on Monday, with leisure & entertainment <.CSI930654>, computers <.CSI930651> and technology, media & telecom sectors all down more than 1 percent at one point though most were able to claw back some losses. The start-up board ChiNext, home to many acquisitive firms, closed down 0.6 percent, compared with a 1.1 percent gain in the blue-chip CSI300 Index (CSI300)
""Investors are worried that goodwill impairment will dent the earnings of those aggressive buyers during the M&A boom,"" said Wu Kan, head of equity trading at Shanshan Finance.
Everbright Securities analyst Zhang Xu also cautioned that in an economic down cycle, the risk of goodwill impairment would surge as the acquired assets would likely fail to meet growth target.
Simei Media Co (SZ:002712), Wanda Film (SZ:002739) and Glodon Software (SZ:002410) - once acquisitive firms with large goodwill assets - were among the biggest losers on Monday, falling 3 percent, 2.2 percent and 3 percent, respectively. 
Market participants say the CSRC's goodwill assessment tweaks could knock speculation out previously acquisitive parts of the market, just as it seeks to support struggling firms in other market segments.
Goodwill-related losses have already been climbing rapidly over the past few years. In 2017, China's non-financial companies recognized 35.8 billion yuan in combined goodwill impairment losses, tripling from the previous year, according to data from Guosen Securities.
For example, battery maker Shaanxi J&R Optimum Energy Co (SZ:300116) reported a loss of 3.68 billion yuan in 2017, after writing down 4.6 billion yuan as goodwill impairment, a heavy price for its aggressive expansion.
The impact to companies' 2018 earnings is not yet clear, but Liu Xiaolan, CEO of Shanghai Qianyi Certified Accounts Tax Co Ltd, said that in a slowing economy, companies' goodwill impairment tends to get bigger.

(Reuters) - Shares of cash-rich firms in Asia have weathered this year's sell-off in much better shape than key stock indexes, a Reuters analysis showed, reinforcing views that investments in companies with strong finances safeguard returns during market crises. 
An analysis of top 200 Asian firms based on their cash and short-term investments showed they outperformed the broader MSCI Asia-ex-Japan index (MIAPJ0000PUS) during the market crashes in 2008, 2013 and 2015.

GRAPHIC: Asia's cash rich firms - https://tmsnrt.rs/2PzDlNH
With U.S. interest rates slowly but steadily rising, companies with higher debt burdens are likely to face more pressure and hence investments in cash-rich firms could be safer bets, analysts said. 
""In times like this, I think the focus of investors moves from the profit and loss account toward the balance sheet....If you are an investor and you are looking for safety in markets, ultimately the one metric that does not change despite market volatility is the absolute cash balances of companies,"" said Jim McCafferty, head of Asia-ex-Japan equity research at Nomura. 
He said South Korea, China and Japan appear to be the safer markets in terms of cash balances in Asia. 
Traditionally, Asian companies prefer to sit on huge cash piles, keeping them idle, but recently the culture has started to change due to government's efforts and corporate governance reforms to enhance shareholder returns. 
A Reuters analysis of Asian companies with market capitalization of at least $1 billion showed their total dividends rose to $203.9 billion in the first three quarters of this year, the highest in at least 10 years.
Refinitiv data showed Asian firms have announced $10 billion worth of share buybacks so far this year, the highest since 2012. 
""We may see some of those improvements in the return on equity (through dividends and share buybacks) that we have seen in the U.S equity market in the last 5 years,"" said Paul Kitney, chief equity strategist at Daiwa Securities in Hong Kong.
""In Japan, we have seen efforts over recent years, promoting corporate governance, including increasing share buybacks, dividends through government policies."" 
Some companies are also expected to cut their expansion plans due to slowing global demand and divert their cash to improve shareholder returns.
“Given the uncertainty arising from U.S-China trade tensions, we have observed that corporates in Asia are deferring or are more cautious on capital expenditure,” said Colin Ng, Head of Asia (ex-Japan) Equities at UOB Asset Management.
Refinitiv data showed Asia's companies' capex growth is expected to fall 2 percent in the next 12 months, at the same time dividends are to grow by 6.5 percent.

""The downward capex intensity trend suggests likely cash redirection into shareholder returns,"" said HSBC analysts in a note.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The CEO of Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA) told a public inquiry into financial-sector misconduct on Monday that senior staff had felt powerless to stop wrongdoing including thousands of breaches of anti-money laundering laws.
Matt Comyn was the first chief executive of a top bank to be grilled at the powerful Royal Commission inquiry which has shocked Australia with revelations of widespread misconduct across the financial industry since it began in February.
The heads of Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC), Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ), National Australia Bank (AX:NAB), investment bank  Macquarie Group  Ltd (AX:MQG) and wealth manager AMP Ltd (AX:AMP) are due to appear at the commission's final scheduled hearings over the next two weeks.
Comyn, who replaced Ian Narev in the wake of the money-laundering scandal in April, was given a frosty welcome when Rowena Orr, barrister assisting the quasi-judicial inquiry, opened proceedings saying she wanted ""no more apologies"" from bank executives, only explanations.
Australians have grown accustomed to hearing apologies from the heads of the country's wealthiest financial firms in response to the inquiry's evidence of bribery, fraud, fee-gouging, predatory sales tactics, greed, and deception.
Under questioning from Orr, Comyn said that when a regulator accused the bank of systemic complacency resulting in thousands of breaches of anti-money laundering protocols, he wrote to his top 500 staff asking for their views.
Staff wrote back expressing overwhelming ""disappointment, embarrassment, very much an acceptance of some of the key issues that were there, in terms of our inability to escalate (or) resolve conflict"", he said.
Orr read a response to Comyn from CBA's compliance boss, who said she felt ""'vindicated and relieved in relation to comments concerning risk management and culture, which reflected what the team was feeling and saying for some time now'"".
""These are troubling observations from the head of compliance within a retail bank. Do you agree with that, Mr Comyn?"" Orr asked.
""Yes I do,"" Comyn said.
The inquiry is expected to recommend sweeping reform of the financial sector when it hands its final report to the government in February, particularly around the use of conflicted bonuses and incentives that have been found to encourage staff to exploit customers. 
Comyn said he wanted to replace bonuses for mortgage brokers with flat fees, to stop brokers selling loans larger than people could afford to repay.
But he said the mortgage broker industry would not support him and CBA would not be able to do it alone without action from the other major banks.
""Unilaterally it would be extremely challenging,"" he said.
CBA has said it cut A$60 million ($43.8 million) from executive bonuses, while Comyn has said the bank has cut A$100 million in overall annual bonuses since the middle of the year.
Asked how much service mortgage brokers gave in exchange for trailing commissions, which are paid over the life of an investment whether the customer receives advice or not, Comyn said ""limited"".
The response generated laughter in the inquiry's packed public gallery.

Net income for companies on the Taiex index is expected to drop 9.2 percent on-year this quarter after undershooting estimates in the three months through September, the first miss since the second quarter of 2017, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
In a market where semiconductor firms account for more than a quarter of the benchmark’s weighting -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. alone accounts for 21 percent -- the performance of tech giants like Apple can sway earnings. Suppliers including Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. saw disappointing profits after Apple reported stagnant iPhone sales and a worse-than-expected revenue forecast.

Sino-American tensions have continued to simmer. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said during the weekend that the U.S. wasn’t in a rush to end the trade war and would “not change course until China changes its ways.”
With trade frictions threatening to increase costs for manufacturers and consumers, and with economic growth slowing, earnings for Taiwan companies could slide in the coming quarters, said Richard Lin, vice president at Reliance Securities Investment Consultant Co. “We’ll see the impact from the China-U.S. trade war gradually.”
Signs of a slowing economy have emerged of late, with the island’s exports rising at a slower-than-expected pace in October.

987,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 18, 2018 07:40PM ET</span>",PG&E May Face More Volatility After Reporting Power-Line Failure,"(Bloomberg) -- PG&E Corp. may be poised for further volatility Monday after disclosing a second power-line failure on the morning that California’s deadliest fire began.
A circuit in Concow, Butte County, failed at about 6:45 a.m. on Nov. 8, the utility said Friday in a filing to the state’s Public Utilities Commission. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire, collected equipment on that circuit and “has secured a location near PG&E facilities,” the company said.
“The information provided in the report is preliminary, and there has been no determination on the cause,” PG&E said in a statement Friday.
At least 76 people have died in the Camp Fire, which is 60 percent contained. More than 149,000 acres have been scorched and close to 10,000 homes were destroyed.
San Francisco-based PG&E has filed two incident reports since the fire began -- and seen about half its market value, roughly $12 billion, vanish in little more than a week. It previously told state regulators that aerial inspection found damage to a transmission tower near Pulga, which is east of Concow.
“The more that investors hear about an incident report -- some event that may be connected -- the more concerned they might get,” Kit Konolige, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said Sunday in an interview.
The latest revelation came amid mounting scrutiny of PG&E, California’s biggest utility. Earlier on Friday, the president of the California Public Utilities Commission singled out PG&E’s board as an impediment to reform -- and said he isn’t ruling out carving up the company as officials launch a deep corporate review.
Cal Fire revealed that investigators had identified a second potential origin point for the Camp Fire. Scott McLean, a Cal Fire spokesman, declined in an interview Sunday to reveal the location of that potential ignition point.
“The investigation is going to be more than likely a lengthy one,” he said.

988,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2018 06:46PM ET</span>",China moves closer to allowing foreigners to control insurance ventures: sources,"By Sumeet Chatterjee and Shu Zhang
HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - China will accept applications early next year from foreign insurers seeking to take control of their local joint ventures and is even weighing giving them full ownership earlier than flagged, people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
The regulator is expected to publish its final guidelines as soon as the first quarter of 2019 and would begin taking applications from interested foreign insurers soon after that, they said
Britain's  Prudential  Plc (L:PRU) and Canada's  Sun Life Financial  Inc (TO:SLF) are among insurers who expressed interest in recent months in owning more of their China operations.
And Hong Kong-based FWD Group, owned by tycoon Richard Li, is also in the process of obtaining regulatory approval for a majority-owned China insurance joint venture, according to a separate person with knowledge of the matter.
China has set an agenda to open up its financial sector and has already taken steps this year to relax foreign ownerships in securities ventures.
Beijing said in November last year that for insurance ventures it would first raise the foreign ownership cap to 51 percent from 50 percent. It has also pledged to remove the limit completely in three years.
But there has been little clarity on the status of the sector's opening up, and doubts about Beijing's commitment has crept in amid an escalating Sino-U.S. trade war and a regulatory overhaul.
The plans for the insurance sector, the world's third-largest insurance market, show the liberalization plan has not been derailed.
The regulator is now considering advancing the three-year timeline for allowing foreign insurers to take full control of their onshore joint ventures, two of the people said.
""We have seen no signs of China looking to delay or put on hold its commitments to open up the financial sector despite the challenges on other fronts. If anything, they are looking to advance the process,"" said a top executive at a large foreign insurance company with a China presence.
The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) is currently reviewing the feedback it received as part of a sector consultation process that ended recently, the people told Reuters.
The regulator, in a consultation paper issued earlier this year and seen by Reuters, has proposed, among other measures, that the major shareholder of a foreign-funded insurer will not be allowed to sell the equity within five years from its acquisition.
The CBIRC did not respond to an emailed request seeking comment. All the sources declined to be named as they were not authorized to discuss regulatory matters.
A spokesman for FWD said it applied to the CBIRC for a joint venture license in May. ""China is obviously somewhere where we see huge opportunities to meet the financial and insurance needs of mainland customers,"" it said. 
SMALL MARKET SHARE
It has not been smooth sailing for foreign insurers in China, despite low market penetration at 3 percent of gross domestic product, and a growing middle-class.
Insurers including  Aviva  Plc (L:AV) and Prudential have been in China for decades, but their collective market share is still below 10 percent as a result of ownership curbs and limited awareness about insurance.
The total market share of foreign life insurers in China was just 6.97 percent last year, while the same was 1.96 percent for foreign property and casualty insurance companies, according to Guotai Junan Securities.
""For foreign life insurers, that's mainly caused by the conflicts between Chinese and foreign shareholders over management styles, and a slow buildup of branches,"" the brokerage said in a report in May. 
While a 1 percentage point rise in the equity ownership would not have a big impact on the balance sheets of the global insurers, winning management control would help drive the business and facilitate decisions on expansion, industry sources said.

The regulator is likely to make it easier for foreign-owned joint ventures to expand into new provinces, moving away from its current practice of rationing of new branch opening applications, the people said.

989,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2018 06:20PM ET</span>","With new CEO, Telecom Italia 'opera' edges towards finale","By Agnieszka Flak 
MILAN (Reuters) - Barely a year into the job as the boss of Italy's biggest telecoms company, Amos Genish had just finished celebrating a joint venture with electronics group Samsung (KS:005930) at a dinner in South Korea when a WhatsApp message arrived sealing his fate.
The  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) CEO had been in conflict with some of his fellow board members over strategy at the former state phone monopoly but the company had said there would be no board meeting while he was away.
""Amos, the board has been called for tomorrow morning at 7 to resolve on the revocation of your delegation of power. I'm sorry it happened when you're out,"" read the message, a copy of which has been viewed by Reuters.
Twelve hours later, the telecoms industry veteran was fired in a board meeting he dialled into from Seoul. He was the third CEO to leave the group in as many years and his successor was chosen on Sunday.
The new CEO, Luigi Gubitosi, is backed by U.S. activist investor Elliott Management, which had pushed for the spin off of the company's fixed line network (NetCo) and the sale of other assets, shifting the focus from the operational turnaround pursued by Genish.
The sacking, which Genish called a Soviet-style putsch, was the latest twist in a corporate drama that one board member described in an email as an ""opera"".
In theory, it paves the way for Elliott's plan. But conversations with sources both inside and close to the company show that in practice there may be many more twists to come.
The underlying plot pits Elliott against TIM's main shareholder, French media group  Vivendi  (PA:VIV), over how to revive an underperforming business whose shares have dropped 27 percent this year alone.
The outcome will decide both the future of TIM and whether Italy can overcome the digital divide that separates it from more advanced economies in Europe.
Genish, who was appointed by the French investor last year, wants TIM to keep control of the network, deeming it strategic both to the deployment of fifth-generation (5G) mobile services and to the survival of the company's service operations.
Elliott, which took control of the board in May, has an ally in Italy's anti-establishment government elected in June, which has prioritized the creation of a single broadband network to help Italy catch up digitally with European peers.
A new draft amendment to a government fiscal decree, seen by Reuters on Friday, aims to advance the project via incentives to twin TIM's network with small, state-backed rival, Open Fiber.
""All the stars are aligned, this is a massive project and it needs to be pursued, you can’t say you won’t do it because there are risks associated with it,"" a source familiar with the matter said of Genish.
""DYSFUNCTIONAL"" ENVIRONMENT
Genish supports the idea of a single network provided TIM is in control of the merged entity. A former Israeli army captain, he told Reuters he will remain on the board ""to fight and defend"" shareholders' rights.
On Sunday, Genish said he would seek support to call a shareholder meeting as soon as possible to ask investors to vote on which strategy they prefer: his focused on organic growth or one he said would bring about a ""dismantling of TIM"".
Gubitosi, a former CEO of telecoms group Wind, is politically well-connected as commissioner for struggling carrier Alitalia, making him well placed to negotiate with the government over a potential spin-off and merger with Open Fiber.
Coming out of the board meeting that sealed his appointment, Gubitosi said he would seek to ""boost cash-flow generation, cut debt and examine with care and speed the project for the creation of a single network"".
But if the last six months are anything to go by, getting the board to approve the network spin-off and a merger with its rival will not be a smooth ride.
Genish said he had been working in a ""totally dysfunctional"" environment inside TIM, adding that several directors had been campaigning against him from day one.
""It was totally counterproductive and there was constant uncertainty about my position,"" he told Reuters.
Genish had been pursuing a three-year turnaround plan - backed by both Elliott and Vivendi in May - focused on a digital transformation and fixing TIM's finances. Some directors, however, wanted to see the shake-up proposed by Elliott, calling Genish's plan ""obsolete"", one source said.
Business decisions were leaked to the media hours after they were taken, sometimes being texted even as board meetings were ongoing, sources said.
New CEO Gubitosi campaigned for the job against another director from the Elliott camp, three sources said, pointing to rivalries that could persist. ""Some board members have been after Genish's job for months,"" said one. Gubitosi did not reply to a request for comment.
Last week Genish was forced to agree to a 2 billion euro writedown of TIM's domestic assets, the people added, in a move that overshadowed signs of an operational recovery applauded by sector analysts. 
""All these months, it was all about the network,"" a person familiar with board proceedings said. ""There was a lot of pressure to do the spin-off and sell assets.""
The government's draft amendment said the creation of a single network company would have to be on a consensual basis. That means Vivendi, which owns 24 percent of TIM, will have to agree to any inclusion of its network.
Vivendi Chief Executive Arnaud De Pufyontaine said a full spin-off of the network was ""crazy"", although that comment came before Rome's plans were leaked. 
The French investor said this week it has no intention of selling its stake in TIM, so its battle with Elliott is only bound to intensify in the months to come. 
THE PERFECT ASSET?
The Netco, TIM's biggest asset, is worth up to 15 billion euros ($17 billion), according to analyst estimates.
Elliott has argued that spinning it off would realize up to 7 billion euros in hidden value, attract new investors and drive a re-rating of shares. It would help TIM offload big chunks of its 25 billion euros of debt and leave behind a capex-lighter service stub. 
Italy plans to introduce a regulated asset base (RAB) for the merged network firm, allowing regulated returns on investments made, the draft amendment showed.
""This huge change makes NetCo into the perfect infrastructure asset investors love,"" one source said, adding a RAB would allow NetCo to trade at the 10-12 times EV/EBITDA multiple of RAB-regulated utilities such as Snam or Terna. TIM trades at 4.6 times, according to Refinitiv.
With no examples of RAB-regulated NetCos in Europe, it could take at least 18 months to put such framework in place, a critic said, adding Italy's fragile political front could complicate matters further.
Italy ranks 25th out of 28 EU member states in terms of take-up of ultrafast Internet, also raising questions about the possible returns for massive broadband rollout. 
TIM management has argued Elliott's calculations for the ServiceCo's cashflow and dividends were too optimistic and a NetCo spinoff risked leaving a much weaker stub behind, without the financial benefits that vertically integrated telcos enjoy, potentially putting thousands of jobs at risk. 
""They have no idea what they are up against. If not done right, this will be financial suicide,"" one source said.
An industry source said a single network operator made sense from an industrial and financial perspective but the competing interests of Elliot, Vivendi and the state made it very complex.
""It's not so much about the issue as it is about the power play between the two opponents and the government on the sidelines that has nothing to do with industrial logic.""

990,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2018 05:04PM ET</span>",PG&E reports another outage on morning when California fire started,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - California utility PG&E Corp (N:PCG), facing investor concerns over its possible role in the deadly Camp Fire in Northern California, has reported another power-line outage that it experienced on the morning of Nov. 8 when the blaze started.
The incident report, which was filed on Friday with the safety division of the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), said a line near the area of Concow in Butte County suffered an outage at 6:45 a.m. on Nov. 8.
The information in the report is preliminary, according to a spokesman for PG&E, who said the company was cooperating with any investigations.
The utility has said it could face liability that exceeds its insurance coverage if its equipment were found to have caused the Camp Fire.
The cause of the blaze, which was 60 percent contained on Sunday, is under investigation. In a previous regulatory report, PG&E, which operates in the northern part of California, said it experienced an outage on a transmission line on the morning of Nov. 8 near the town of Pulga, near where the fire is thought to have started.
Authorities were still searching for signs of the 1,276 people listed as missing after the Camp Fire tore through the mountain town of Paradise. The remains of 76 people have been recovered so far in what is considered the state's deadliest-ever wildfire.
A CPUC spokesman confirmed that the agency received the second report on Friday, and said the incident would be incorporated into its investigation ""to assess the compliance of electric facilities with applicable rules and regulations in fire impacted areas.""
Investors are watching for clues about whether California's government will step in to save PG&E should it eventually be found responsible for the fire and should any potential liability exceed the utility's resources.
CPUC President Michael Picker told Reuters on Friday that utilities must be able to borrow money cheaply in order to properly serve ratepayers. Similar comments from Picker a day earlier caused PG&E's stock to surge in after-hours trading.

The company's stock had slumped more than 60 percent since the wildfire broke out, on fears that without help from California's government, the utility could go bankrupt should it eventually be found responsible.

991,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2018 01:41PM ET</span>","Grim search for 1,276 missing after deadliest California wildfire","By Terray Sylvester
PARADISE, Calif. (Reuters) - Authorities sifted through the charred wreckage of California's deadliest ever wildfire on Sunday, searching for any signs of the 1,276 people now listed as missing after the Camp Fire tore through the mountain town of Paradise.
The remains of 76 people have been recovered so far, 63 of whom have been tentatively identified pending DNA confirmation. Early on Sunday the blaze, which ignited on Nov. 8, was 60 percent contained, officials said, up from 55 percent Saturday.
Rain is forecast for the area this week, potentially helping douse the flames but raising the risk of floods and mudslides, adding to the misery of 46,000 people under evacuation orders.
Many refugees from the fire have taken up temporary residence with friends and relatives, while others have pitched tents or were camping out of their vehicles.
The death toll far surpasses the previous fatality record from a single California wildfire - 29 in the Griffith Park fire of 1933 in Los Angeles - and already ranks among the deadliest U.S. wildfires since the turn of the last century.
Eighty-seven people perished in the Big Burn firestorm that swept the Northern Rockies in August 1910. Minnesota's Cloquet Fire in October 1918 killed 450 people.
In Paradise, the flames moved so fast that some victims died in their cars in a chaotic evacuation as gridlock formed on the two exit routes out of town.
The Butte County Sheriff's Office said the list of the missing is compiled using information received from a special hotline, as well as emails and emergency-911 calls that came in during the first chaotic hours of the blaze.
Authorities said some of those listed likely survived but have not yet notified family or officials, either because they lack phone service or were unaware anyone was looking for them.
In Paradise, home to nearly 27,000 people before the Camp Fire struck, two forensic anthropologists for the University of Nevada, Reno, were helping firefighters on Saturday sort through the wreckage at a mobile home park for senior citizens.
Firefighters peeled back the metal sheet of a collapsed roof as the anthropologists picked up charred bone fragments, sorting them into paper bags.
Roger Fielding, chief deputy coroner with the Martin County Sheriff's Office, said each site was treated as a crime scene, with every step of recovery documented with photographs.
""Our job is to pick up any items that might reflect who this person might be,"" he said.
THOUSANDS OF HOMES DESTROYED 
Besides the toll on human life, property losses from the blaze make it the most destructive in California history, posing the additional challenge of providing long-term shelter for many thousands of displaced residents.
At the latest count, the Camp Fire had destroyed more than 12,700 homes and other structures, authorities said on Sunday.
Up to 4 inches (10 cm) of rain is expected to fall from late Tuesday through Friday in the Sierra foothills, the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center said.
Rain will also drop on San Francisco, helping to clear the air filled with unhealthy levels of smoke.
Patrick Burke, a lead forecaster with the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland, said the rain will be a ""one-two-punch.""
""It'll bring much needed relief to the firefighters and to the air quality, but there's a potential for dangerous mudslides wherever vegetation is burned away on slopes and hills,"" he said.
Up to 2 inches of rain is also expected to fall on southern California this week, where the Woolsey Fire claimed at least three lives, Burke said.
The Woolsey Fire was 88 percent contained on Sunday, authorities said. Full containment is expected on Thanksgiving Thursday.
On Saturday, U.S. President Donald Trump visited Paradise and the scene of the Woolsey Fire.
Trump has blamed the recent spate of fires on forest mismanagement, and he said he discussed the issue with California Governor Jerry Brown and Governor-elect Gavin Newsom.
Scientists have said the growing frequency and intensity of wildfires in California and elsewhere across the U.S. West are largely attributable to prolonged drought that is symptomatic of climate change.
The precise causes of the Camp and Woolsey Fires were under investigation, but electric utilities have reported equipment problems in the vicinity of both blazes around the time they erupted. 

PG&E Corp has said it could face liability that exceeds its insurance coverage if its equipment were found to have caused the Camp Fire.

992,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2018 12:15PM ET</span>","Rio Tinto, Nespresso join forces to make coffee pods greener","By Barbara Lewis and Martinne Geller
LONDON (Reuters) - Nespresso, part of food giant Nestle, aims to use sustainable aluminum in all of its coffee capsules by 2020 under a deal with mining major  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) announced on Monday.
Both companies have faced criticism for adding to pressure on the planet, with campaigners saying Nespresso coffee machines are wasteful and many of the used capsules end up in landfill. 
Under the deal, Anglo-Australian Rio Tinto will supply aluminum produced with renewable power and respect for biodiversity to Nespresso, the world leader in the coffee pod market.
The companies are seeking to position themselves as sustainable to boost their investor and customer appeal, and Nespresso has committed to 100 percent sustainable aluminum for its capsules by 2020, Rio Tinto said in a statement released on Monday Australia time.
Rio Tinto Chief Executive Jean-Sebastien Jacques said last month that miners needed new partnerships as the sector competes for talent and seeks to improve its image.
Its aluminum assets use hydropower - for economic as well as environmental reasons - and in April the miner became the world's first producer of aluminum to be certified by the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI). 
ASI standards are based on protecting biodiversity, respecting indigenous peoples' rights and traceability throughout the supply chain, as well as lower emissions and renewable energy.
So far, only part of Rio's aluminum production is ASI-certified. 
Rio Tinto Vice President Sales and Marketing Tolga Egrilmezer said in an interview that the deal with Nespresso was ""a significant milestone for the industry"" towards wider use of responsibly-sourced aluminum.
While the mining sector has recovered from the commodity crash of 2015-16, it is struggling to win investment because of concerns about governance in difficult regions where mines are often located and because of its exposure to coal, the most carbon-intensive fuel.
Rio Tinto has sold its coal mines, but still uses coal power in some operations.
In May, Rio Tinto announced a venture with aluminum maker  Alcoa  (NYSE:AA) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) on technology to eliminate direct greenhouse gas emissions from the aluminum smelting process. 
Rio has already supplied aluminum to Nespresso, but is not its exclusive supplier. 
Nespresso said in an email it would take time for all capsules to be ASI-certified but it was working with its manufacturers to achieve this and on making recycling as easy as possible.
Holder of nearly a third of the coffee pod market, Nespresso faces competition from other companies marketing themselves as sustainable.

British coffee brand Halo said on Friday it had created ""the world's first fully home compostable paper-based coffee capsule and packaging,"" which can break down in about a month.

The Dubai government-controlled ports operator cautioned in August about geopolitical risks and changes in trade policies as first-half profit fell 2.1 percent.
DP World Chairman Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem told Reuters he believed the psychological impact of trade tensions involving the United States were starting to translate into reality.
Financial institutions were becoming increasingly cautious and taking measures such as tightening lending in reaction to trade tensions, he said in an interview at the DP World Tour Championship golf tournament in Dubai.
That is likely to negatively impact growth in emerging markets, he said.
Trade tensions were evident in Papua New Guinea on Sunday when Asia-Pacific leaders failed to agree on a communique at a summit for the first time in their history as deep divisions between the United States and China over trade and investment stymied cooperation.
DP World, one of the world's largest port operators, was taking measures to reduce costs, and is addressing how it will manage a challenging 2019, said bin Sulayem.
""We are finding ways to make sure that we do good in 2019,"" he said. He declined to comment when asked if the company would report a higher profit this year.
""Historically, we have managed worse scenarios than this,"" he said of global market conditions, adding that DP World had reached its goals in 2018.
DP World is in a dispute with the government of Djibouti which in February seized a port in the country operated by the Dubai company under a 50-year concession.
Bin Sulayem repeated a denial that the government of Djibouti has offered to buy DP World's stake in the concession. He said he asked them to make an offer in January.
They have not taken ""any measures to contact us,"" he said.

DP World has also launched legal proceedings in Hong Kong against China Merchants over allegations they have infringed on their concession rights in Djibouti, he said.

994,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2018 10:18AM ET</span>",Nearly half of German firms expect growing trade strains with U.S.: survey,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Forty-four percent of German firms expect a further escalation of trade tensions between Europe and the United States, which is likely to continue to dampen new investments, the RND newspaper chain reported, citing a survey by the IW economic institute.
Thirty-four percent do not see trade ties growing more strained, RND reported.
It said 41 percent of firms surveyed considered it unlikely that the United States and the European Union (EU) would reach agreement on a transatlantic trade agreement.
U.S. President Donald Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker struck an agreement in July that should shield European firms from U.S. auto tariffs while the two sides continue to work on trade issues. 
But the EU's trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmstrom, last week said any U.S.-EU trade deal would be limited in scope, covering industrial goods, but not agriculture.
Pascal Lamy, the former director general of the World Trade Organisation, last month said the EU should also prepare for its companies to be targeted by U.S. sanctions in a worsening trade dispute between the United States and China.
The IW study said continued uncertainty about the global trade environment would weigh on firms' willingness to invest, which in turn would depress German firms' export prospects in the United States and elsewhere.
""Given worldwide economic developments, the downturn of the German economy is expected to continue,"" IW said in the study, according to RND.
The DIHK German Chambers of Commerce also sees no signs that the United States will change course and back away from threatened tariffs, a situation that is of particular concern to German automakers, the media group reported.
DIHK President Eric Schweitzer said it was imperative to continue dialogue with Washington, with the goal of negotiating a longer-term free trade agreement that would give industry more certainty and room for maneuver.
""For the moment, we are far from such a reasonable agreement with our second most important trading partner, the United States,"" he added.

He said the group had halved its export growth forecast for 2018 to 2.8 percent, and expected modest growth of just 2.5 percent next year.

Facing the nation's weakest economic growth since the global financial crisis, Chinese policymakers are fast-tracking road and rail projects, pushing banks to increase lending, and cutting taxes to ease strains on businesses. 
""There is room for cutting the two (corporate and personal) income taxes,"" Lou, now chairman of the National Council for Social Security Fund (NCSSF), told a finance forum. 
China in October raised the threshold for collecting individual income tax to 5,000 yuan ($720) per month from 3,500 yuan, hoping to boost consumption.
The government has also been cutting value-added taxes and fees for companies, but it has yet to lower a corporate income tax rate of 25 percent. 
China should not launch another round of large-scale infrastructure investment to spur growth given that such a move could worsen the country's debt risks, Lou said. 
Local governments in China are already burdened by heavy debt, he said, and the government should instead use its fiscal tools to help defuse debt risks at financial institutions. 
Government subsidies for social security funds nationwide reached 1.2 trillion yuan last year and are still growing quickly, Lou said. 

China's social security system is fragmented and unsustainable as its population ages, he said.

The decision, which leaves the retailer without a CEO ahead of the key holiday shopping season, was described in a statement as a mutual agreement between Brett and the New York-based company's board of directors.
Brett, a long-time retail veteran who was named to the job in June 2017, said he and the board were ""unable to bridge our beliefs on how to continue to evolve all aspects of the company.""
He had replaced retail legend Mickey Drexler, who remains chairman of the J.Crew board.
In the company's second quarter, it said same-store sale rose 5 percent following a decrease of 5 percent in the same quarter last year. Net losses in the quarter totaled $6.1 million, down from $18.5 million a year earlier.
The executive's responsibilities will be assumed by an office of the CEO, comprised of four senior J.Crew executives including President and Chief Operating Officer Michael Nicholson.

That office will manage the company's operations as the board works to establish a permanent management structure, according to J.Crew.

999,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2018 01:20PM ET</span>",Investors eye holiday sales for market salve,"By Chuck Mikolajczak
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors will get a glimpse of consumer health next week as the holiday shopping season gets under way with Black Friday sales, and a solid start could help equities steady after several tumultuous weeks. 
The day after Thanksgiving has been regarded as the traditional start of the holiday buying season, although deals and bargains are being unveiled earlier this year.
Wall Street has been struggling with uncertainty over U.S. congressional midterm elections, the path of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, tariffs, the trade war and the possibility corporate earnings have already peaked. But a strong start to the gift buying season could help ease some concerns.
After an October that saw the S&P 500 (SPX) slump nearly 7 percent, Wall Street has struggled to find its footing, rising 0.7 percent so far in November. That puts the index on pace for its biggest quarterly loss since the third quarter of 2015 and its worst fourth quarter performance in a decade. 
About 38 percent of American consumers plan to shop on Black Friday this year, and six in 10 of those shoppers anticipate making at least half of their holiday purchases on that day, a Reuters/Ipsos poll showed on Thursday. 
""Of all the other factors, the consumer has been hanging in there - they drove third quarter growth, we are seeing wage growth over 3 percent, financing rates are still reasonable,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors in Chicago. 
""If we see any kind of disappointment in Black Friday sales, that is going to cause some real concern.""
Same store sales for the fourth quarter are expected to come in at a healthy 3 percent, according to Refinitiv data. Still, that number is trending downward from the previous two quarters and is slightly below the year-ago result of 3.1 percent. 
Refinitiv same store sales index - https://tmsnrt.rs/2QFVypg
A strong start to holiday sales might not translate to strong earnings, however, reinforcing concerns about the best of corporate profits being in the rear-view mirror as retailers have to grapple with deal-conscious consumers. 
""Even a healthy consumer doesn't necessarily mean that retail sales and profitability and performance will be off the charts,"" said Shawn Kravetz, president of Esplanade Capital in Boston, who spoke at the Reuters Global Investment 2019 Outlook Summit in New York this week.
Muddying the picture was data on Thursday that showed U.S. retail sales rebounded sharply in October, boosted by purchases of motor vehicles and building materials, but the prior two months were revised lower and the trend indicated slower consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity in the country.
Big name retailers such as  Target  (N:TGT), Lowe's Companies (N:LOW) and Gap Inc (N:GPS) are expected to report quarterly results next week and investors will watch for any guidance for the holiday season. 
Still, a strong start to the holiday shopping season will only partially alleviate investor concerns, with a G20 meeting at the end of November and the final Fed policy announcement of the year in December likely to cause some market volatility.
The market will need to digest these events for it to have a chance for what is known as a Santa Claus rally. Since 1950, the S&P has rallied in December three-fourths of the time, according to the Stock Traders Almanac. The benchmark index has gained an average of 1.6 percent for December, the best month of the year.

""These are all important things but if the mosaic is either constructive or negative then that is going to provide a wealth of information to either drive the market higher or drive the market lower."" said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist, at Federated Investors, in New York.

""We can create new possibilities, especially in rural areas and for older people, with car services and pooling systems,"" said Scheuer, a member of the Bavarian conservatives. ""That is a giant opportunity.""
Current law bans drivers from accepting contracts directly from individuals, reserving that right for taxi drivers licensed by local authorities.

PARADISE, Calif. (Reuters) - Forensic recovery teams pressed their search for more victims in the flame-ravaged northern California town of Paradise on Friday as authorities sought clues to the fate of about 1,000 people reported missing in the state's deadliest wildfire on record.
Remains of at least 71 people have been recovered in and around a Sierra foothills hamlet that was home to nearly 27,000 residents before the town, 175 miles (280 km) north of San Francisco, was largely incinerated by the deadly Camp Fire on the night of Nov. 8.
More than a week later, firefighters have managed to carve containment lines around 45 percent of the blaze's perimeter, up from 35 percent a day earlier, even as the burned landscape grew slightly to 142,000 acres (57,000 hectares).
Besides the toll on human life, property losses from the blaze make it the most destructive in California history, posing the additional challenge of providing long-term shelter for many thousands of displaced residents.
With more than 9,800 homes up in smoke, many refugees from the fire have taken up temporary residence with friends and family, while others have pitched tents or were camping out of their vehicles.
At least 1,100 evacuees were being housed in 14 emergency shelters set up in churches, schools and community centers around the region, with more than 47,000 people in all remaining under evacuation orders, authorities said.
(Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Plpuui) 
Search teams with cadaver dogs, meanwhile, combed through charred, rubble-strewn expanses of burned-out neighborhoods looking for bodies.
On Friday night, Butte County Sheriff Korea Honea said the remains of eight more fire victims were recovered during the day, bringing the death toll to 71. That far surpasses the previous fatality record from a single California wildfire - 29 in the Griffith Park fire of 1933 in Los Angeles.
'RAW DATA'
Honea said the total roster of people unaccounted for had swelled to 1,011 - up from the 630 names posted Thursday night and well more than triple the number counted as missing on Thursday afternoon.
""This is a dynamic list,"" Honea told reporters, saying it was compiled from ""raw data"" that likely included some duplication of names reported with more than one spelling.
Honea said it was too soon to conjecture on the fate of those on the list, noting that as of Friday, 329 individuals previously reported missing had turned up alive.
""I don't think it's appropriate for any of us to sit and speculate about what the future holds."" 
The names were being compiled from information received from a special hotline, along with email reports and a review of emergency-911 calls that came in on the first night of the fire, Honea said. 
Some listed have likely survived but not yet notified family or authorities, either because they lack phone service or were unaware anyone was looking for them, authorities said. Others may not have been immediately listed because of delays in reporting them.
HISTORIC PROPORTIONS
The disaster already ranks among the deadliest U.S. wildfires since the turn of the last century. Eighty-seven people perished in the Big Burn firestorm that swept the Northern Rockies in August of 1910. Minnesota's Cloquet Fire in October of 1918 killed 450 people.
Authorities attribute the Camp Fire's high death toll partly to the speed with which flames raced through the town with little advance warning, driven by howling winds and fueled by drought-desiccated scrub and trees.
Weather conditions have since turned more to firefighters' favor, though strong, gusty winds and lower humidity were expected to return late Saturday through early Sunday, ahead of rain showers in the forecast for mid-week.
The rain is good news for fire crews but will add to the misery of evacuees camping outdoors, including at least 300 people living in a tent village that sprang up in the parking lot of a Walmart (NYSE:WMT) store.
That spot lies in a flood plain, so occupants are being urging to vacate the parking lot by Sunday afternoon, said Bryan May, a spokesman for the California Office of Emergency Services.
Outbreak of the Camp Fire coincided with a series of smaller blazes in Southern (NYSE:SO) California, most notably the Woolsey Fire, which is linked to three fatalities and has destroyed at least 500 structures near the Malibu coast west of Los Angeles. It was 78 percent contained on Friday night.
Scientists have said the growing frequency and intensity of wildfires in California and elsewhere across the West are largely attributable to prolonged drought that is symptomatic of climate change.
The precise causes of the Camp and Woolsey Fires were under investigation, but electric utilities have reported equipment problems in the vicinity of both blazes around the time they erupted. 
U.S. President Donald Trump, who has taken to Twitter to blame the recent spate of fires on forest mismanagement, was due to visit the fire zones on Saturday to meet displaced residents. Governor Jerry Brown and Governor-elect Gavin Newsom planned to join Trump on his tour.

Smoke from the Camp Fire has spread broadly. Public schools in Sacramento 90 miles (150 km) to the south, and as far away as San Francisco and Oakland, canceled classes on Friday because of poor air quality.

(Reuters) - The chief of California's top utilities regulator said on Friday he was shocked to learn that reassurances he made to investors about PG&E (N:PCG) caused the embattled power utility's stock to surge over 40 percent in a matter of minutes.
PG&E's stock had slumped over 60 percent since the state's deadliest-ever wildfire broke out last week on fears that without help from California's government, the utility could go bankrupt should it eventually be found responsible. The fire destroyed the town of Paradise and has killed at least 63 people.
California Public Utilities Commission President Michael Picker told Reuters on Friday that utilities must be able to borrow money cheaply in order to properly serve ratepayers. That echoed comments he made on an investor conference call organized by Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) on Thursday, when he said he could not imagine allowing the state's largest utility to go into bankruptcy.
Picker was surprised hours later on Thursday to learn that PG&E's stock had surged over 40 percent in extended trading in reaction to his comments.
""I was stunned and terrified,"" Picker said. ""I left the call yesterday and I went back to a workshop I was in, so I didn't find out about it until several hours later.""
Picker's market-moving remarks to a private group were unusual, in part because public companies and their executives must follow federal rules aimed at avoiding selective disclosure of material news, but a government official or other outside parties sharing an outlook on a public company does not face the same obligations, experts say.
PG&E shares on Friday closed up 37.54 percent at $24.40 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock is still down about 50 percent from before the fire started, erasing nearly $13 billion in market capitalization.
The cause of the Camp Fire that destroyed the town of Paradise remains under investigation.
With PG&E potentially facing mounting costs from wildfires, the regulator would also consider potential options to restructure the company, including separating its electricity and gas units, Picker told Reuters.
Keeping Wall Street interested in investing in PG&E and other California utilities is key to reducing the state's carbon emissions and making the power system more efficient, he said.
""I don't think we over-reward people. ... But we want to make sure that we can continue to keep the lights on, and be cleaner and cleaner, and ideally more reliable.""
GRAPHIC: PG&E shares surge after Thursday's close on utility regulator's comments - https://tmsnrt.rs/2QNMYF1
California state Senator Bill Dodd told Reuters it was ""too soon"" to speculate about future legislation that might provide relief to PG&E in case it is found liable for the Camp Fire.
Dodd sponsored legislation passed this year that lets utilities pass some of the costs related to liability from wildfires on to ratepayers, but the bill did not specifically provide for 2018.

 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) on Friday upgraded PG&E's stock to ""buy"" from ""neutral."" 
""Given the reaction in the stock market, we think there was an appropriate level of urgency that something needed to be done,"" Citigroup analysts wrote, referring to the regulator's statement. 
The price for PG&E's more than $18 billion of bonds also rose. The price of the March 2034 <694308GE1=> bond was up about 5 points in afternoon trading after earlier trading as much as 11 points higher.
PG&E's debt was pressured earlier this week after the utility borrowed $3.3 billion under its credit lines and warned it could face liabilities in excess of its insurance coverage should its equipment be found to have caused the fire.
The gains in bond prices came even after both Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's cut their credit ratings on PG&E late Thursday to just one notch above junk bond territory and said the outlook remained negative. 
Fitch Ratings on Friday also downgraded the utility's long-term issuer default ratings.
With the collapse in its bond prices this week, most of PG&E's bonds were trading as though they were already speculative-grade securities, although Friday's recovery brought many of them back in line with comparably low-investment-grade-rated corporate bonds.
PG&E has about $500 million of floating rate notes maturing in two weeks and does not face another maturing security until October 2020. 
That October 2020 $800 million bond, with a 3.5 percent coupon <694308GT8=RRPS>, yielded more than 10 percent at one point in trading on Thursday, the first of PG&E's securities to have breached that threshold. On Friday, the October 2020 note was up more than 4 points to 95.25 cents on the dollar, with the yield dropping to 6.24 percent.
Shares of Edison International (N:EIX), whose Southern (NYSE:SO) California Edison subsidiary provides power in Southern California, jumped 15 percent. While investors view it as at less risk than PG&E to massive liabilities from wildfires, its stock has been volatile over the past week as a second fire burned in that region.
The Woolsey Fire in Southern California also remains under investigation. 

The volatility in PG&E shares has drawn a rush of trading in options. Traders are betting the stock will remain prone to wild gyrations in the near term.

The Montreal meeting with Bombardier Chief Executive Alain Bellemare and Chief Financial Officer John Di Bert was previously scheduled but ""the (high) participation and level of interest was driven by recent events,"" said one of the two sources.
Bellemare had already met with investors following the free cash flow forecast on Nov. 8, which sent its shares down more than 23 percent on that day.
The Canadian company said it would only be able to meet its 2018 free cash flow estimate by using $635 million in proceeds from the sale of a Toronto plant earlier this year. Analysts had expected Montreal-based Bombardier to achieve its target of roughly breaking even on cash without relying on those proceeds.
Bellemare, credited with improving Bombardier's finances after a crippling 2015 cash crunch, sought to reassure investors that the company would still achieve the company's five-year turnaround plan designed to boost revenues and margins by 2020, said the source who could not provide further details on the meeting.
The sources declined to be identified as the information is not public. A Bombardier spokesman declined to comment when asked about the meeting.
On Thursday, the province of Quebec's securities watchdog asked Bombardier to halt stock trades under a plan set up to facilitate share sales by certain senior company executives.
The Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) said it was ""reviewing"" transactions and ""various announcements"" related to Bombardier's creation of an Automatic Securities Disposition Plan on Aug. 15.
Bombardier stock closed down 20 percent at C$1.67, adding to last week's 31 percent slide. 
The sell-off in the stock also spread to bonds. Bombardier has about C$12.3 billion ($9.35 billion) of bonds outstanding, much of which has been issued in U.S. dollars, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. 
The yield on Bombardier's 7.5 percent U.S. dollar bond maturing in March 2025 has jumped by nearly 300 basis points over the last two weeks to 9.87 percent, its highest since July 2016.

Jamie Koutaoukis, Moody's lead Bombardier analyst, said by email that she downgraded the company's senior unsecured debt in 2017 ""highlighting at that time that we expected continued negative free cash flow in 2018, in contrast to guidance.""

MILAN (Reuters) - Veteran Italian manager Luigi Gubitosi is seen ahead in the race to become the new chief executive of Italy's biggest telecoms group  Telecom Italia  (TIM) (MI:TLIT), two sources familiar with the matter said.
Telecom Italia on Tuesday lost its third boss in the span of two years when CEO Amos Genish was sacked while he was away on business in Asia.
Genish had been appointed last year to run the underperforming former monopoly by TIM's then controlling shareholder, French media group  Vivendi  (PA:VIV).
Since then however directors backed by activist U.S. fund Elliott have wrested control of the board.
TIM's board meets on Sunday to appoint Genish's successor.
One of the sources said Gubitosi had the full backing of Elliott and state lender CDP, which earlier this year took a stake in TIM, siding with Elliott in the boardroom coup against Vivendi.
A second source said Gubitosi could count on a majority of board votes at present but added the situation could still change before Sunday.
Telecom Italia was not immediately available for a comment.
Gubitosi is currently one the commissioners managing loss-making state carrier Alitalia. 
The chief financial officer of car maker  Fiat  until 2005, Gubitosi is pitted against Alfredo Altavilla, who until recently was also a top manager at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (MI:FCHA).
Both Gubitosi - who also headed telecoms group Wind - and Altavilla sit on TIM's board as independent directors proposed by Elliott.
The first source said the name of Rocco Sabelli, a former head of Alitalia, was also ""drifting around.""
Telecom Italia has given no reason for Genish's abrupt exit.
Genish had been pursuing a three-year turnaround plan, focusing on a digital transformation and fixing TIM's finances, but sources say some Elliott directors wanted him to put higher priority on a possible spin-off of its fixed-line networks.
The spin-off could pave the way for the creation of a single broadband infrastructure company combining TIM's network with that of smaller fiber-optic rival Open Fiber.
The populist 5-Star Movement, which took office with ruling coalition partner the League in June, has placed the creation of a fast broadband network at the heart of its industrial policy.

A document seen by Reuters on Friday showed Italy was set to introduce measures to help create a single broadband infrastructure company.

1024,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 16, 2018 04:41PM ET</span>",Stocks - Dow Fails to Avert Weekly Loss Despite Triple-Digit Rally,"Investing.com - The Dow closed lower for the week, despite a rally Friday that came even as the White House reportedly walked backed President Donald Trump's upbeat comments on trade.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.49%. The S&P 500 rose 0.22%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.15%.
Wall Street went into rally mode Friday after Trump said he was hopeful the U.S. and China will reach a consensus on trade deal. The White House, however, peddled a more sombre narrative on trade in the wake of Trump's comments, telling CNBC that a deal was not coming soon.
Still, the broader averages held their gains, but that did little to avert a weekly loss following a rout in tech.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) fell 3% amid the fallout from a New York Times article detailing how the company conspired to cover up warnings that Russia had used the social media platform to disrupt the U.S. election in 2016.
Weakness in tech was exacerbated by a slump in semiconductor stocks as Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) soft earnings and light guidance, owing to excess inventories (an industry-wide problem for many chipmakers), triggered fire-selling across the industry.
Rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) fell 4%, while Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) was rewarded for its quarterly results, which came in line with consensus. Its share rose 1%.
The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fell 1%.
Energy added steel to the rally on Friday as oil prices settled flat, but slumped 6% for the week on concerns about a  global glut in supplies.
Retailers kept the broader market in check, however, following a rout in both Nordstrom and Williams-Sonoma.
Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) fell 14% after its earnings, including a one-time item, fell short of estimates. The retailer grew comps 2.3% in the third quarter, below estimates for a 2.4% increase.
Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM) was punished for delivering mixed third-quarter results as earnings beat, but revenue missed consensus estimates, sending its shares tumbling 11%.
The pair of quarterly results followed strong quarterly earnings from other retailers this week, including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Macy’s (NYSE:M), but that did little stop the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (NYSE:XRT) falling 4.5% for the week.
Sentiment on stocks were also lifted by easing concerns about steeper U.S. rate increases after Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida indicated that the U.S. central bank may stop at the neutral rate, rather than continue hiking beyond the neutral rate, which might be interpreted as an effective ""rate cut,"" JPMorgan said in a note to clients.

1025,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2018 04:36PM ET</span>","S&P, Dow advance on trade optimism; Nvidia sinks Nasdaq","By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Dow Industrials rose on Friday after President Donald Trump said the United States may not have to impose further tariffs on Chinese goods, but falling shares of  Nvidia Corp  (O:NVDA) dragged down the Nasdaq.
All three indexes had been lower in early trade as an underwhelming outlook from Nvidia weighed on the tech sector.
U.S. stocks moved higher after Trump said China seemed willing to make a deal on trade.
""The market is paying attention very closely to anything surrounding trade,"" said Veronica Willis, investment strategy analyst at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute in St. Louis. ""(A trade deal) would boost expectations for global growth, which would ultimately be good for stocks.""
But lagging Nvidia shares kept the Nasdaq in negative territory.
Nvidia's shares tumbled 18.8 percent after the chipmaker pointed to the decline in cryptocurrency mining as the cause of its declining sales. The chipmaker's shares also weighed on the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index (SOX), which declined 1.2 percent.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) shares also dropped 3.0 percent upon renewed concerns that the company could face regulatory scrutiny following a New York Times report on Wednesday about the company's attempts to deflect criticism of its handling of Russian propaganda.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 123.95 points, or 0.49 percent, to 25,413.22, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 6.07 points, or 0.22 percent, to 2,736.27 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 11.16 points, or 0.15 percent, to 7,247.87.
Comments from Richard Clarida, newly appointed Federal Reserve vice chair, that U.S. interest rates were nearing the central bank's estimates of a neutral rate also lent support to stocks, investors said.
For the week, however, all three indexes posted losses. The S&P 500 fell 1.61 percent, the Dow lost 2.22 percent, and the Nasdaq shed 2.15 percent. 
S&P 500 energy (SPNY) stocks rose 1.1 percent as oil prices recovered from sharp losses this week on expectations that OPEC and its allies would agree to cut output next month.
S&P 500 utility stocks also jumped, advancing 1.3 percent, as PG&E Corp (N:PCG) shares surged 37.5 percent. Statements from the California Public Utilities Commission raised hopes that the embattled company could be spared from bankruptcy if it were found liable for the state's deadliest-ever wildfire.
Consumer discretionary stocks fell 0.5 percent. Continuing a gloomy week for retailers, shares of department store operator  Nordstrom Inc  (N:JWN) tumbled 13.7 percent after quarterly same-store sales missed estimates and the company reported charges from a credit card problem.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.20-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.03-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 27 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 26 new highs and 109 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 8.18 billion shares, compared to the 8.61 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) fell 14% after its quarterly results fell short on earnings, revenue and comps. The retailer grew comps 2.3% in the third quarter, below estimates for a 2.4% increase.
The retailer blamed the earnings miss on a non-recurring credit-card-related charge after disclosing that some cardholders with delinquent accounts were erroneously charged higher interest. Excluding that charge, Nordstrom actually beat profit expectations. 
But there is little mercy for retail stocks lately, even those like Macy’s (NYSE:M) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) that had strong results and guidance.
 Williams-Sonoma Inc  (NYSE:WSM) was punished for revealing a slowdown in comps and compressed margins in the third quarter, sending its shares down more than 11%.
The company recorded third-quarter earnings of $0.95 a share, $0.01 above analysts' estimate of $0.94. Revenue for the quarter came in at $1.36 billion, just below the consensus estimate of $1.37 billion.
RBC singled out slowing comps and compressed margins as headwinds for the company in the quarter, partly driven by delayed product receipts from Chinese port congestion.
Walmart added to losses from a day earlier, when its upbeat quarterly results were overshadowed by concerns over whether the retailer can sustain the pace of growth seen in quarter. Its shares fell 2%."

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Former  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) product chief Thomas Kurian will replace Diane Greene as head of the cloud division at Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google in the coming weeks, Greene announced in a blog post on Friday, after a tumultuous year for the business.
Greene said she had joined Google three years ago with plans to leave after two years and will move into investing and philanthropy in January. She will remain on Alphabet's board.
Kurian, who spent 22 years at Oracle and had been a close confidante of its founder Larry Ellison, resigned in September after struggling to expand its cloud business.
Greene has served as chief executive of Google Cloud; Kurian will be senior vice president for Google Cloud, a company spokesman said.
Google announced in February that the cloud division, which sells computing services, online data storage and productivity software such as email and spreadsheet tools, was generating more than $1 billion in quarterly revenue. 
It faced a setback months later when thousands of Google employees revolted against Greene's unit supplying the U.S. military with artificial intelligence tools to aid in analyzing drone imagery. Greene responded by announcing the deal would not be renewed.
The backlash over military work prompted an internal committee of top employees to issue company wide principles to govern the use of Google's artificial intelligence systems, including a ban on using them to develop weaponry. The move essentially limited the cloud unit's potential customer base.
Google also bowed out from bidding for a $10 billion military cloud computing contract, citing its lack of certifications to handle sensitive data.
Closing and extending such deals would have given Google Cloud a major boost as it tries to catch up to rivals Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). Oracle's cloud business trails Google's.
Steve Koenig, a financial analyst following Oracle for Wedbush Securities, said Kurian is better positioned at Google to drive business sales growth than at his former employer.
""Like Diane Greene, Kurian has serious enterprise chops,"" Koenig said. ""Google clearly remains serious about scaling up its enterprise business.""

Greene said Kurian interviewed with her, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and long-time infrastructure chief Urs Hölzle and will join Google on Nov. 26.

1033,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 16, 2018 01:30PM ET</span>",GE Fall Sets Up Worst Month Since Depths of 2009 Bear Market,"(Bloomberg) --  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co. shares tumbled toward their worst month since the depths of last decade’s recession after  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). warned of a potential “tail risk” at the troubled manufacturer’s finance arm.
A thorough review of GE’s 10-Q financial report still shows more questions than answers around the company, especially because GE Capital could face additional headwinds, analyst Joe Ritchie wrote in a note.
GE investors are grappling with two key questions -- how big of an equity infusion GE Capital needs, and whether the Power unit business is close to a bottom. Goldman sees a chance that the equity infusion from GE to GE Capital might be larger than the $3 billion previously stated for 2019.
Goldman does not “see GE as inexpensive given its leverage profile...and tail risk associated with GE Capital,” the analyst said Friday, slashing the price target on the stock to $9 from $12. The stock sank as much as 5.4 percent at 12:55 p.m. in New York, on pace to close at its lowest since March 2009.
While GE shares have plunged by more than half this year, the pace of decline has been especially sharp over the past month, with the stock down 22 percent since the beginning of the month. At that rate, November would be the worst month for the stock since February 2009, when it fell 30 percent. The company disclosed an expanded federal accounting probe in late October, and analysts have warned about escalating liquidity concerns, as well as deteriorating results at GE’s troubled power division and financial business.
GE “has a long road to repair its balance sheet ahead of it, and based on the timing of certain events, GE could potentially have to put more than $10 billion of equity into GE Capital,” Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) analyst Andrew Obin wrote in a note. But Obin, who rates GE a neutral, said the company still has a number of levers to meet the liabilities, including monetizing its assets.
Concerns aside, the recent plight of GE shares is driven more by “sentiment, not as much fundamentals,” Obin said.
“... GE’s valuation partly reflects the ‘fear of unknown’, as the company’s balance sheet is thinly stretched to be able to absorb any incremental bad news and the Street has gone through multiple negative surprises over the past year,” Bank of America added.

1034,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 16, 2018 01:30PM ET</span>",MarketPulse: Traders Turn Negative on Nvidia as Semis Sag,"Investing.com - Nvidia fell sharply Friday, wreaking havoc in the broader semiconductors sector, after the chipmaker's third-quarter results and guidance for the current quarter fell short of estimates.
Nvidia tumbled 18% after missing third-quarter estimates and guiding fourth-quarter sales well below expectations for the second quarter in row as it struggled to sell excess supplies of GPUs following a slowdown in cryptocurrency activity.
The chipmaker guided fourth-quarter revenue to a range of $2.65 billion to $2.75 billion, well below analysts' expectations for $3.4 billion, according to S&P Capital IQ Consensus.
Analysts delivered a downbeat outlook on the Nvidia shares, which they expect to remain under pressure until the company releases its next report in February.
""Nvidia is a momentum stock that missed fiscal fourth-quarter consensus revenue by over 20%. This coupled with modest datacenter growth will likely keep the stock under pressure until the next report (February),"" Nomura said.
Nvidia said its competitors were also feeling the pressure of surplus inventories, prompting investors to bail on its rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), which fell 6%.
Semiconductor equipment maker Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) overcame some of the selling, rising 2% despite reporting subdued guidance and quarterly results that met expectations.
AMAT expects fiscal first-quarter earnings per share in the range of $0.75 to $0.83 on revenue of $3.56 billion to $3.86 billion, below consensus of $0.92 a share and $3.96 billion.
The overall Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fell 2%, as a recent string of underwhelming outlooks for the next quarter from some semis in the space kept investors on the sidelines."

1042,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2018 12:20PM ET</span>","Airbus, Dassault finalizing bid for early work on new fighter jet","By Andrea Shalal
BERLIN (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) and France's Dassault Aviation (PA:AVMD) will shortly submit an unsolicited proposal for initial conceptual work on a next-generation fighter jet to German and French officials, according to sources familiar with the matter.
The two companies agreed in principle in April to work together on an ambitious Franco-German program to design a new warplane, but are anxious to get some early funding so they can start work on new technologies required for the multi-billion project - with a goal of fielding a new aircraft around 2040.
Germany and France signed a memorandum of understanding about the project in April, but progress has been halting amid disputes between the governments about future exports, and among industry about how to divvy up work on a system to integrate the new jet with drones and other weapons.
One source familiar with the matter said the two companies could submit their proposal by the end of the year or early next year, paving the way for the first contract awards next year.
One French military official told the International Fighter conference in Berlin this week that the two governments hoped to conclude an initial contract in January.
Peter Harster, senior executive with MTU Aero Engines (DE:MTXGn), said the study contract was needed, along with a medium-term budget plan, to help set a realistic timetable and key requirements to ensure the new jet would be ready by 2040. 
Harster also called for a separate contract for work on an engine for the new jet to enable optimal flexibility and give the customers direct control over the propulsion system.
Bruno Fichefeux, head of future combat air systems at Airbus, told the conference he expected conceptual work on the program to begin soon, ""bilaterally or with Spain.""
A Spanish official told the conference his country was in discussions with both the Dassault-Airbus team, and a separate project being led by Britain's BAE Systems (L:BAES) to secure a role on one of the projects. A French military official said the two projects could also be merged at a future date.
Douglas Barrie, senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said government and industry ties would likely shift again, as in the 1970s and 1980s during work that ultimately led to the Eurofighter Typhoon and Dassault's Rafale.
""We're at the start of that process again now. And I don't think it will take a decade to shake out, but it will take some time,"" he said. ""I think shifts are inevitable.""
Senior executives from Airbus and other companies discussed the next generation fighter with German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen at a meeting hosted last week by the German Aerospace Industries Association (BDLI), the sources said.

BDLI declined to comment on the meeting. No comment was immediately available from the defense ministry.

Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock fell about 4% at 12:05 PM ET (17:05 GMT).
The S&P 500 Communication Services index was down about 1%.
The company has endured intense scrutiny over its business practices following a New York Times article with the headline beginning “Deny, Deflect, Defend” about how the company fought criticism of its handling of Russian influence and propaganda on its platform.
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg have been on the defensive amid calls by some for change at the top of the company.
Sandberg said in a post Thursday she did not know Facebook hired a PR firm that tried to tie grassroots Facebook protests group to George Soros, but also said she “should have.”
Criticism from other outlets about the company has been swift, with blistering articles coming from publications like Bloomberg and Slate.
All this is adding further pressure to a stock that is still reeling from a July earnings plunge.
Shares are down about 24% in the last six months.

1051,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2018 12:04PM ET</span>",PG&E options traders bet stock not out of the woods yet,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The wild swings in the shares of PG&E Corp (N:PCG) over the past week have drawn a rush of trading in the electricity provider's options contracts and traders are betting the stock is going to remain prone to wild gyrations in the near term.
Shares of the electricity provider in the northern California region ravaged by a deadly wildfire jumped 36 percent on Friday. Fears of bankruptcy, stemming from the utility's potential liability from the fire, eased amid signs of support from one regulator for the company.
The stock has shed about half its value over the last week and its bonds came under intense pressure.
In the options market, trading volume jumped to a record high this week with more than 50,000 contracts changing hands on average daily, data from New York-based options analytics firm Trade Alert showed.
While the majority of the trading over the last few days was due to investors rushing to load up on protection as the shares plunged, trading sentiment on Friday was more mixed with some traders betting on a rebound in the shares.
Investors' expectation for volatility, however, remained elevated.
""Some of the concerns have eased, but options traders expect the volatility to continue in the short term,"" said Fred Ruffy, options analyst at Trade Alert. ""The stock is certainly not out of the woods yet."" 
Investors are watching for clues about whether California state officials will intervene should PG&E be found responsible for the Camp Fire.
The California Public Utilities Commission issued a statement on Thursday saying that state law requires it to consider a utility's financial health when weighing a request to cover costs associated with wildfires.
Still, even if PG&E dodges bankruptcy, it was not immediately clear that PG&E shareholders would not take a hit. The regulator also said it would be examining PG&E's corporate governance, structure and operations as part of an existing investigation of the company's safety culture.

On Friday, options trading volume was active with about 40,000 contracts traded by 11:30 a.m. (1630 GMT).

Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said, ""Probably some deliveries in March, but April is more certain"", after a Twitter user asked when the deliveries in China would begin.
Tesla declined to comment.
The company has been banking on its Model 3 sedan, the performance of which is seen crucial to the carmaker's future. Shares of Tesla rose 1.6 pct at $353.93 in morning trading.
China is the largest market for electric vehicles and most forecasters predict that its sales in the country will speed up rapidly as government regulation drives toward a goal of 100-percent electric vehicles by 2030.
Tesla had signed a deal with Shanghai authorities in July to build its first factory outside the United States, which would cost around $2 billion to construct and would double the size of its global manufacturing.
The Shanghai Gigafactory, based in eastern China, aims to manufacture Model 3 and Model Y cars, with annual capacity of 250,000 vehicles, according to a filing.
Tesla is also developing plans to start producing about 3,000 Model 3s per week in Shanghai in the initial phase of its Gigafactory 3 to reduce the impact of tariffs.

1053,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2018 11:39AM ET</span>",UBS lures more money from U.S. super rich to Switzerland,"By Angelika Gruber
ZURICH (Reuters) - A decade after a U.S. crackdown ended Swiss banking secrecy, rich Americans are flocking back to UBS (S:UBSG) as they look to diversify their investments in a volatile U.S. political landscape, a senior executive at the Swiss group told Reuters. 
""The interest has increased, for political reasons and for reasons of diversification,"" Juergen Wegner said in an interview, without elaborating. 
Wegner is in charge of Swiss Financial Advisers (SFA), a subsidiary of UBS which handles funds that wealthy U.S. customers bring to Switzerland, historically seen as a safe-heaven destination for investments. 
Although many U.S. customers continue to hoard money at home, they are increasingly interested in a broad diversification of their assets.
""We notice this very strongly especially in terms of assets of more than $100 million,"" said Wegner. 
Ten years after a U.S. tax crackdown cost Swiss banks billions of dollars and put an end to their tradition of banking secrecy, the world's private banking hub is reestablishing ties with American customers.
""If you suggested to a customer in 2012 to bring his money to Switzerland - even if it's legal - then the customer was afraid to appear on a blacklist. There is a lot less of this, we can tell,"" Wegner said. 
For UBS, the world's biggest wealth manager, SFA is part of growth plans that focus in part on attracting wealthy North Americans as new customers. 
In the next three years, it wants to collect $70 billion of new money from so-called ultra-high net worth individuals, and convince them to invest their money not only at home, but internationally, Wegner said. 
In a unit for people with a net worth of more than 100 million Swiss francs, UBS had assets under management of 643 billion francs ($642 billion) at the end of the third quarter. 
UBS is the only Swiss private bank with extensive U.S. business, and is counting on this to help differentiate itself from powerful U.S. rivals. 
A growing interest of U.S. clients to invest in Switzerland is also reflected in new money flowing to SFA, Wegner said.

PARIS/CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. carrier Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) said on Friday it ordered 10 Airbus (PA:AIR) A330neo long-haul jets, becoming the first U.S. airline to operate the next-generation of Airbus aircraft and giving a boost to the slow-selling European model.
The A330neo purchase, first reported by Reuters, is a welcome endorsement from an influential buyer for the jet worth $3 billion at list prices.
Yet it comes to Airbus at some expense to the near term backlog of its A350. As part of the order, Delta said it was deferring the delivery of 10 pricier A350 jets to 2025-26. The agreement contains the right to convert the A350 orders to A330-900s. 
""Expanding our A330 order book not only ensures that Delta's near-to-medium-term widebody needs are taken care of, but also drives our strategic, measured international growth,"" said Delta Chief Operating Officer Gil West.
The A330neo is powered by next-generation engine technology from Rolls-Royce (L:RR) that provides better fuel performance and range for transoceanic travel, Delta said.
The jet will feature the latest in design and technology and become the first Delta aircraft to include all cabins: Delta One suites, Delta Premium Select, Delta Comfort+ and Main Cabin.
With the order, Atlanta-based Delta's A330 fleet will grow to 35 from 25. It is part of the company's long-term policy of investing 50 percent of operating cash flow back into the business, West said. 
For Airbus, it is the second order for the A330neo in as many weeks after Kuwait Airways ordered eight of the long-haul planes in mid-October.
Airbus is aggressively seeking more orders for the latest version of its profitable A330 franchise. Sales of the engine-upgraded A330neo model fell short of expectations in the face of heavy competition from Boeing Co's (N:BA) newer Boeing 787.
Industry sources have questioned how far recent A330neo orders represent net new sales for the European aircraft maker because they could water down some earlier orders for the A350.
The new-generation A350 is a longer-term bet for Airbus and competes with the Boeing 787 and 777. But one market source said Airbus was willing to give up some orders for the newer plane in order to keep the A330neo afloat and prevent production cuts.

Delta currently operates 11 A350-900 aircraft and expects to take delivery of two A350s in 2019 and two in 2020. It will retire older Boeing 767s in coming years as the aircraft reach the end of their serviceable life cycle.

1058,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2018 10:54AM ET</span>",VW embarks on $50 billion electrification plan,"By Edward Taylor
WOLFSBURG, Germany (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) expects to become the most profitable manufacturer of electric cars thanks to a multi-billion euro expansion plan to mass produce battery driven vehicles, Chief Executive Herbert Diess said on Friday.
VW will spend almost 44 billion euros ($50 billion) on developing electric cars, autonomous driving and new mobility services by 2023 and explore further areas of cooperation with U.S. automaker Ford (N:F).
Diess said he hoped to have an outline agreement on cooperation with Ford fleshed out by the end of the year, with the initial focus on commercial vehicles. He added that a merger with Ford was not on the agenda and also said there were no plans to take a stake in the American company.
Mass producing electric cars will help the carmaker reduce the cost to the same level as current diesel vehicles, Diess said at a news conference in Wolfsburg, VW's home town .
""Very emotional vehicles, high economies of scale, I think we will be the most profitable company in electric vehicles,” Diess said, responding to a question in English.
The supervisory board of Europe's largest carmaker voted on far reaching capital spending plans to begin mass production of electric vehicles in Europe, the most radical strategy shift since VW's diesel cheating scandal in 2015. 
Volkswagen will retool three of its German plants to build electric cars and to explore alliances with battery partners and rival carmakers.
VW plans to increase productivity of its factories by 30 percent by 2025 by building more vehicles from different brands on the same production line. It wants to lower the carmaker's research and development ratio at the group's automotive division to six percent of revenues from 2020 onward.
""Volkswagen must become more efficient, more productive and more profitable in order to finance the high expenditure in he future and stay competitive,"" Diess said.
JOBS FEAR
Labor unions, who control half the seats on Volkswagen's supervisory board, need to sign off on the plan to create global production capacity for 1 million electric vehicles by 2025 amid their concerns that assembling battery driven cars will require fewer workers.
Around 436,000 industrial jobs in Germany are tied to building petrol and diesel engined vehicles.
Jobs are under threat because a combustion engined car has 1,400 components in the motor, exhaust system and transmission, while an electric car's battery and motor has only 200 components, according to analysts at ING. 
Volkswagen's management this week outlined plans for converting car plants in Zwickau, Emden and Hannover to build electric cars, providing job guarantees to workers until 2028.
The first ID electric car is due to roll off the production line in Zwickau in 2019, as the plant ramps up to a production capacity of 330,000 electric vehicles. Zwickau currently builds the VW Golf and the Golf Estate.
Volkswagen's MEB electric vehicle platform is also being eyed by Ford as the two companies continue exploratory talks about an alliance to develop self-driving and electric vehicles. 
""Our two companies complement each other very well in terms of both products and regions. The joint development and manufacture of a range of light commercial vehicles is at the core of the envisaged cooperation,"" Diess said.
VW expects significant synergy effects from this alliance, which may allow potential for developing a next generation Amarok pickup truck series and further sports utility vehicles, Diess said.
Ford Chief Executive Jim Hackett told Reuters this week that the company was open to investment in its autonomous vehicle business by automakers and others, but cautioned that expanding partnerships with VW was a ""delicate dance.""

1059,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 16, 2018 10:24AM ET</span>",HSBC's Bloom Doubles Down on Dollar as Morgan Stanley Calls Peak,"(Bloomberg) -- One of the world’s biggest dollar bulls is sticking to his guns as the U.S. economy powers ahead and dangles some of the highest interest rates versus Europe in history.
Wall Street’s “America First” playbook in 2019 will pack more punch, boosting the greenback along the way, according to David Bloom at HSBC.
“The market is perpetually looking for a U.S. slowdown, and it’s just not happening,” Bloom said in an interview in Madrid. “Why wouldn’t you buy the dollar? Even if the world goes risk-off, and the Fed has to cut rates, the dollar -- and the yen -- will win.”
Wall Street banks are divided on the direction of the dollar for 2019 after its surprising strength this year upended investment strategies across the globe. Morgan Stanley’s Global Head of FX Strategy Hans Redeker said the dollar has peaked, pointing to investment flows and what he sees as a slowing economy. Goldman Sachs. also says it will be tough for the greenback to gain. At HSBC, however, the chief currency strategist is seeing vindication for his bullish stance held since April, after the dollar advanced more than 6 percent against the euro.
Bloom reckons the dollar will strengthen to $1.10 per euro by the end of next year -- a 3 percent upside from current levels for the world’s most-traded pair. That’s a weaker euro forecast than any of the 19 estimates tracked by Bloomberg. Bloom is also more dollar-bullish than consensus across a slew of FX pairs, including the South African rand.
Investors are set to gobble up U.S. assets anchored by a robust business cycle that’s sustaining rate hikes, while haven demand may fuel the greenback should traders turn skittish, he said.
Rooting for Euro
Data this week underscore the uphill battle for traders rooting for a rebound in the euro. German output contracted in the third quarter while investors surveyed by ZEW showed little optimism about the prospect of a pick-up -- spurring 10-year German real yields to 2018 lows.
“It is this theme of ‘divergence’ between the U.S. and everywhere else -- now evident since the first quarter of 2018 and reinforced in the recent data -- that has driven our strong, steady view for the dollar,” Thierry Wizman and Gareth Berry, strategists at Macquarie Group Ltd., wrote in a note this week.
Meanwhile, inflation-adjusted U.S. rates over Europe are at some of the highest levels in history, with nominal yields outpacing other Group of 10 nations. All that has helped the dollar rise 4 percent against 10 of its peers in 2018.
The dollar has given the Swiss franc a run for its money this year, benefiting from haven demand during risk-off market trading -- a trend that could intensify in 2019, according to the HSBC strategist.
Third Scenario
Only in a third scenario, where the Fed calls off further hikes, does Bloom see the dollar weakening. “You’ve got a dice with three sides, and only one side loses,” he said.
While arch-dollar bears at Morgan Stanley say weaker equity and credit prices give reason to pare U.S. currency exposures, optimism in the derivatives market has swelled over the past week.
Traders in three-month options have increased their dollar bets versus a basket of six major currencies, risk reversals show. The premium for calls over puts has pulled to within 10 basis points of the 2018 closing high seen mid-August, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
“No one is more bullish,” Bloom concluded.

1061,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2018 10:07AM ET</span>",Germany's Schroeder warns against demonizing China,"By Noah Barkin 
BERLIN (Reuters) - Weighing into Germany's debate about its ties with China, former chancellor Gerhard Schroeder warned Berlin against demonizing Beijing, saying the two economic powers should work more closely together in the face of Donald Trump's trade threats.
Known for his close ties to Russia, Schroeder is also a long-time advocate of a closer relationship with China. He visited Beijing frequently as chancellor, championed its entry into the WTO and controversially pressed the EU to lift an arms embargo it imposed after China's Tiananmen Square (NYSE:SQ) crackdown.
Speaking to Reuters in his office overlooking the Russian embassy on Unter den Linden avenue in Berlin, Schroeder pushed back against a wave of scepticism towards China sweeping across western capitals.
""We need to think about who our allies are, who has similar interests. And of course I think about China,"" said Schroeder, whose staunch opposition to the looming U.S. invasion of Iraq helped secure his re-election in 2002. 
""Those countries that are affected by conflicts emanating from the United States will have to get closer. We can't become part of an American trade war with China.""
Despite booming business for German companies in China, industry here has been unsettled by what it sees as growing state control over the economy under President Xi Jinping and unfair competition from Chinese rivals.
Concern about Chinese takeovers in Europe is rising. Germany is soon expected to lower the threshold at which it can vet foreign investments. In Brussels, EU member states are finalizing an agreement to ensure closer scrutiny of such deals.
Schroeder questioned that approach, saying Chinese investors were preferable to American ""locusts"", a term coined by his party colleague Franz Muentefering to describe U.S. private equity firms and activist hedge funds.
He rejected the exclusion of Chinese firms like Huawei from building Germany's next-generation mobile networks. The United States and Australia have introduced such bans on security grounds, and some in Berlin are pushing for similar action here.
CONTROVERSIAL FIGURE
Schroeder, 74, enacted reforms credited with ending Germany's economic malaise in the early 2000s. But the reforms divided his Social Democrats, where he is now a controversial figure, in part due to his closeness to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Within months of his defeat to Angela Merkel, he took a job as chairman of Nord Stream AG, a consortium led by Russian state-owned gas giant Gazprom (MCX:GAZP). Last year he was denounced by SPD colleagues when he became chairman of Russia's biggest oil producer Rosneft.
Still, his views on China and Russia are shared by some members of his party and pockets of the German political establishment.
Asked about detentions of China's Uighur minority, Schroeder echoed the language of Chinese officials who have described eye-witness reports of camps as ""gossip"".
""I'm not sure. I'm very cautious about this discussion because I don't have any information,"" Schroeder said, rejecting the idea of sanctions against China in response to the camps, an idea being floated in Washington.

""I don't think much of a values-based foreign policy,"" Schroeder said. ""Our interests should drive our foreign policy.""

1068,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2018 08:34AM ET</span>",'Mission Impossible' powers Viacom profit and revenue beat,"(Reuters) - Viacom Inc (O:VIAB), the owner of MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon, beat Wall Street estimates for profit and revenue on Friday, lifted by the strong performance of ""Mission: Impossible - Fallout.""
The upbeat results boosted the company's shares by around 4 percent to $33.50 in trading before the bell.
The results are a welcome respite from two years of turmoil over its future as a standalone company or part of a larger player in a merger with CBS Corp (N:CBS). 
An attempted merger of Viacom and CBS earlier this year fell apart over disagreements about executive management. CBS sued its controlling shareholders, Shari Redstone and National Amusements Inc, to block the merger. CBS and Viacom are both controlled by Redstone family through National Amusements.
CBS Chief Executive Leslie Moonves, who led the opposition of a merger, stepped down in September following allegations of sexual harassment. 
In a settlement that led to CBS dropping its lawsuit, Shari Redstone agreed to refrain for two years from proposing a merger either herself or through others affiliated with National Amusements. However, people close to the company expect others to rekindle merger discussions well before the standstill expires.
Since taking the helm in 2016, Chief Executive Bob Bakish has focused on Paramount and the company's cable TV business, which like its peers has been losing subscribers in the face of competition from Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) and Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) Prime video.
Viacom said worldwide affiliate revenue was $1.19 billion, beating estimates of $1.17 billion, according to data from Refinitiv. Total revenue in its fiscal fourth quarter, ended Sept. 30, rose 5 percent to $3.49 billion from $3.32 billion a year earlier.
Paramount, which returned to profitability in the second quarter, racked up nearly $800 million in worldwide sales from the latest installment of the Tom Cruise-helmed ""Mission Impossible"" action series, the company said.
Net income attributable to Viacom fell, however, to $394 million, or 98 cents per share, from $674 million, or $1.67 per share. 
On an adjusted basis, earnings reached 99 cents per share, the company said.

Analysts on average had expected a profit of 95 cents per share and revenue of $3.37 billion.

PARIS (Reuters) - Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR) is planning for a ""no deal"" Brexit as its ""baseline"" scenario amid a political storm over a draft transition deal, according to a staff memo seen by Reuters.
Europe's largest aerospace group on Thursday welcomed a draft divorce agreement between London and Brussels, but said there needed to be more clarity to allow businesses to plan.
With Prime Minister Theresa May facing a battle to get her draft agreement on the terms of Britain's departure from the European Union through parliament, and a potential revolt from members of her party, Airbus vowed to pursue contingency plans. 
""The draft agreement is certainly encouraging but we must remember it is subject to parliamentary approvals,"" the head of the company's internal Brexit task force told staff.
""For the teams working on preparing for Brexit we must stay focused and keep working at full speed from a baseline of no deal.""
An Airbus spokesman declined to comment on the memo but told Reuters, ""the situation remains unclear, so we have to continue planning and putting in place mitigation measures,"" adding this position was unchanged since a paper published in June.
The comments echo those of German carmaker BMW (DE:BMWG), which has said that with the politics so uncertain, it would continue to prepare for 'no-deal' or leaving the single EU market and customs union with no agreed transition.
Airbus, which employs 14,000 people in Britain and builds most wings for its jetliners there, said in June a 'no-deal' exit would cost it billions of euros and force it to reconsider its investments and ""long-term footprint"" in the country.

Chief Executive Tom Enders on Thursday called for ""the removal of uncertainty as soon as possible"".

Ineos Chief Executive Officer Jim Ratcliffe said last year that an off-roader modeled on Land Rover's classic Defender could be rolling off British production lines if the owner of petrochemicals giant can win government backing for it.
Ratcliffe had also said he would invest 600 million pounds ($770.16 million) to begin output of the new off-roader from 2020-21, adding that he would prefer to build in Britain but that there are cheaper alternatives in countries such as Germany where the workforce is already trained.
""INEOS is not intending to 'resurrect the Land Rover Defender'. We are building an all-new 4x4 vehicle from the ground up, which meets all current safety and legislative requirements,"" the company said in a statement.

The Canadian technology company, which dominated the smartphone market a decade ago, has shifted to selling software to manage mobile devices, as well as emerging areas like autonomous cars.
Privately owned Cylance uses machine learning to preempt security breaches before they occur. Its applications seek to block malware or infiltration attempts rather than react after a breach.
Cylance, which has over 3,500 active enterprise customers, had been considering filing for a stock market floatation, according to a report in Business Insider. https://read.bi/2PuA7uN

The California-based company's Chief Executive Stuart McClure, in turn, said it would be able to leverage Blackberry's strength in mobile communications and security to adapt its AI technology.
Besides the $1.4 billion that BlackBerry will pay, the deal also includes the assumption of Cylance's unvested employee incentives, BlackBerry said.
Cylance will continue to operate as a separate business unit after the deal closes, BlackBerry said. The deal is expected to close by Feb 2019.

T-Mobile, majority owned by Deutsche Telekom AG (DE:DTEGn), agreed in April to buy wireless carrier Sprint and the deal was initially expected to close in the first half of 2019.
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Department of Justice are currently scrutinizing the deal.

""At this point, it's more pointing to the second quarter as more probable (but) it could still be first quarter,"" Carter said.
Both the agencies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The agreement between the third and fourth largest U.S. wireless carriers in April was reached after four years of on-and-off talks that set the stage for the creation of a company that would compete more favorably with the top two wireless players,  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ) and AT&T Inc (N:T).
Their first round of merger talks had ended unsuccessfully in 2014 after the then Obama administration expressed antitrust concerns.
Carter said on Friday the companies have provided 25 million pages worth of documents to the DoJ, filed 600 pages public information statement with the FCC and held meetings with other U.S. government departments.
The two companies have also defended their deal by saying they need to merge to build the next generation of 5G wireless technology in a robust nationwide network. 
""The combined assets of Sprint and T-Mobile can create 8 times the 5G capacity that either of us could do on a standalone basis and 15 times the speed,"" Carter said.
Telecom companies are pegging their future success on implementation of 5G networks, which are expected to be at least 100 times faster than current 4G networks and cut latency, allowing for innovations in a number of fields.
Governments have started auctioning 5G spectrum on both sides of the Atlantic.
The FCC on Wednesday launched the agency's first high-band 5G spectrum auction while Germany is expected to start its 5G auctions in early 2019.

There would be ""very, very significant"" revenue synergies in the new company resulting from the merger, Carter said at the conference.

1075,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2018 05:55AM ET</span>",Tractor maker Deere aims to ride green revolution in Africa,"By Joe Bavier
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - U.S. Deere & Co (N:DE) expects to see demand for its farm equipment in Africa grow 8 to 10 percent annually in the coming years, driven by expansion in key markets like Ethiopia and Zimbabwe, a local company executive said.
Farming accounts for around 60 percent of total employment in Africa, according to the World Bank. In Ethiopia, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia, food production is projected to add more jobs than the rest of the economy combined through 2025.
A global policy shift away from food aid toward local production - championed at the start of the decade by the World Food Programme among others - has sparked a green revolution, increasing Africa's potential as a market, said Jacques Taylor, managing director of John Deere Ltd Sub-Saharan Africa.
""We started to see a commercial market developing for agricultural commodities ... That gave an incentive for farmers to produce more,"" he told Reuters in an interview late on Thursday. 
Taylor said around 80 percent of its equipment shipments to Africa currently go to 10 markets, including South Africa, Zambia, Kenya and Ghana. 
""We see three or four countries with significant upside growth potential in the medium-term,"" he said. ""We see opportunity in countries like Angola, Zimbabwe, Ethiopia and obviously Nigeria."" 
Deere, best known for its John Deere branded tractors, currently ships its products to local dealers in Africa where its main competitors include  CNH Industrial  (MI:CNHI) and Landini. 
Deere's dealer in Ethiopia is partnering with the government, in the midst of reforms, to set up an assembly plant to supply farm machinery to the market of around 100 million inhabitants. 
Zimbabwe is also undergoing of a major transition after long-time president Robert Mugabe, who was criticized for overseeing disastrous farm seizures, was ousted last year.
""We have high hopes for Zimbabwe. It used to be the food basket for southern Africa. The potential is known,"" Taylor said. ""Zimbabwe could easily recover and get back to the levels of production they've seen in the past.""
In neighboring South Africa, Deere's most important market on the continent, President Cyril Ramaphosa's ruling African National Congress has made land redistribution a key issue ahead of 2019 elections.
Ramaphosa has promised the process will not threaten food security or growth, but the move has nonetheless unnerved some investors.
""We do see it as a growth opportunity for us. There will be new entrants coming into agriculture,"" Taylor said. ""I think for the sake of the sector and the economy, it's important for us to get clarity sooner than later."" 
Deere reported $2.8 billion operating profit from its equipment business last year, with 39 percent of that coming from its business outside of the United States and Canada. Sales grew 5 percent last year in those home markets. 
The company does not break down sales data further.

1077,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2018 05:40AM ET</span>",Shares and sterling try to shake Brexit blues,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - European stocks recovered but sterling and the euro remained fragile on Friday, after some of the most dramatic 24 hours yet in the Brexit process and another turbulent week for world markets.
London, Paris and Frankfurt markets all gained around 0.4 percent (EU), having been punished the previous day by the resignation of Britain's Brexit minister roughly 12 hours after a draft agreement with the European Union was released.
Sterling also attempted to reset after what had been its worst day against the euro since the post-Brexit vote fallout of 2016 and a slump of more than 2 cent versus the dollar. 
But with reports of a UK leadership coup still rife and fear that the country could crash out of the EU without an agreement, it struggled to make it much beyond 88.72 pence per euro and $1.2788.
""As long as no deal remains as likely as it is, there is a risk of a sterling depreciation spiral that is self-intensifying,"" said Ulrich Leuchtmannan, an FX strategist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Frankfurt. 
UK and euro zone government bond yields also edged up as some stability returned to fixed-income markets.
Still, 10-year yields on German bonds, considered one of the safest assets in the world, were set for their biggest weekly fall in three weeks, in a sign that the Brexit uncertainty and worries about Italy's finances, continued to support demand.
In Frankfurt, the head of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, said the bank still plans to dial back its stimulus at the end of the year, but acknowledged the economy had hit a soft patch and inflation may rise more slowly than expected.
""If firms start to become more uncertain about the growth and inflation outlook, the squeeze on margins could prove more persistent,"" Draghi told a conference. 
Asian shares had ended their session firmer, after reports the United States might pause on further China tariffs gave Wall Street a fillip, but a near 17 percent plunge in Nvidia's stock tempered the mood. 
The chip designer forecast disappointing sales for the holiday quarter, pinning the blame on unsold chips piling up with distributors and retailers after the cryptocurrency mining boom evaporated.
Also falling after hours were shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Losses in semiconductor shares dragged Japan's Nikkei down 0.5 percent, while Nasdaq futures fell 0.5 percent.
""It started with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), then Nvidia ... Since performances of these companies set the tone for the global tech and chip industries, related Japanese stocks will likely be sluggish for a while,"" said Takatoshi Itoshima, a strategist at Pictet Asset Management.
POUNDED
Europe's tech-linked firms were proving mostly resilient as Brexit remained the clear focus.
Fears that UK Prime Minister Theresa May's hard-fought deal could collapse had sent British markets into gyrations not seen since the June 2016 referendum on EU membership.
""If and when a vote on the withdrawal agreement occurs is uncertain. Whether the withdrawal bill is passed by both houses of Parliament is uncertain,"" Joseph Capurso, a senior currency strategist at CBA, said in a note.
""Whether the Prime Minister resigns or is challenged for the leadership is uncertain. And, whether there is a second referendum and/or an election is uncertain.""
The plunge by sterling lifted the dollar against a basket of currencies to 96.993, even as the euro strengthened a touch to $1.1333. 
Also under water was the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, which hit a one-year trough overnight. It had tumbled 10 percent early in the week when support at $6,000 gave way. It was last changing hands at $5,500 on the Bitstamp platform.
In commodity markets, gold was up at $1,214.30.
Oil prices rose, helped by a decline in U.S. fuel stockpiles and the possibility of a cut in OPEC output. 

U.S. crude was trading up 70 cents at $57.15 and Brent crude rose roughly 1 dollar to $67.70 a barrel. It was still set for a sixth straight weekly loss, however.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares staged a modest recovery on Friday as investors licked their wounds after a tumultuous week while strong results from  Vivendi  boosted the media sector.
The pan-European stocks index (STOXX) lost steam only an hour into trading, though, as UK media reports suggested that lawmakers are likely to trigger a vote of no confidence in Prime Minister Theresa May. 
The index was on course for a weekly loss as Brexit chaos, Italy's budget showdown with the European Commission and anxious oil markets sapped risk appetite.
The STOXX 600 opened 0.7 percent up but that slipped to 0.4 percent by 0950. Germany's DAX (GDAXI) rose by 0.6 percent. 
Britain's FTSE 100 (FTSE) and FTSE 250 (FTMC) recovered slightly, up 0.2 percent and 0.4 percent respectively after Thursday's sharp sell-off in domestic stocks on ministerial resignations.
French media company Vivendi's (PA:VIV) quarterly results helped to lift the media sector (SXMP) by 1.5 percent. 
Vivendi shares topped the CAC 40, climbing 5.9 percent after the company posted stronger than expected third-quarter sales, helped by growth in music streaming at its Universal Music Group (UMG). It also said it was lining up banks for a possible sale of part of the UMG division.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analysts said the fourth-quarter slate for Universal looks ""strong"" with releases announced for multiple platinum sellers and ongoing Drake and Eminem sales.
""With solid steps toward a stake sale in 2019, this is a timely reminder that valuations of over 20 billion euros for UMG are not hype,"" they wrote in a note to clients. 
Bollore (PA:BOLL), which is also owned by French media tycoon Vincent Bolloré, gained 3.7 percent.
The technology sector (SX8P) lagged the market after worse than expected results from U.S. chipmaker Nvidia (O:NVDA), the latest in a string of negative news for tech components producers.
German semiconductor maker Siltronic (DE:WAFGn) slid 3 percent, among the biggest STOXX fallers. 
Dutch lender ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd) also fell 2.7 percent after its results.
ABB (S:ABBN) shares were up 2.5 percent after sources said the Swiss industrials group is in talks with three Asian suitors for the sale of its Power Grids business.
Swiss chocolate producer Barry Callebaut (S:BARN), meanwhile, dropped 3.7 percent after members of the majority stakeholder Jacobs family sold 150,000 shares, amounting to 2.7 percent of the company.
Swedish electrical components company Nibe (ST:NIBEb) jumped 6.7 percent, the top STOXX gainer, after its results.
Outside large-cap stocks, Danish industrial component maker NKT (CO:NKT) plunged 19.2 percent after it cut its full-year earnings outlook and CEO Michael Hedegaard left the company.
Shares in the maker of the ""Angry Birds"" mobile game,  Rovio Entertainment  (HE:ROVIO), jumped 10.2 percent after third-quarter results.
Fewer companies than usual have beaten expectations in Europe's third-quarter results season, with companies facing difficulties converting sales into profits as costs climbed. 

IBES Refinitiv data showed analysts expect third-quarter earnings to grow 15.8 percent year on year, in euro terms and 2019 European earnings to edge higher than the United States.

“In the short term, weaker demand, weaker end-demand is beginning to materialize,” Amir Anvarzadeh, a senior strategist at Asymmetric Advisors in Singapore, said by phone. “Expectations are still too high despite the recent declines. Whether it’s Advantest or whether it’s Disco, or whether it’s Tokyo Electron, those are the equipment guys that will see the impact, and they’re already seeing it.”
Both Nvidia and Applied Materials released weak forecasts. Nvidia was hit by a loss of demand from the collapse of cryptocurrency mining and Applied Materials’ disappointing outlook indicated the chip industry is holding off on expansion plans in the face of a murky outlook for electronics demand.
Global chip companies have been whipsawed by worries over prices amid slowing demand. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, or Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, tanked 12 percent in October for its worst monthly performance since 2010.

1083,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2018 04:00AM ET</span>","China probes Marriott, Hilton hotels over poor hygiene after undercover expose","BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's tourism regulator has launched an investigation into poor hygiene at a slew of five-star hotels, including global chains such as the Ritz Carlton and Shangri-La, after an undercover expose went viral and prompted a public outcry.
The undercover video report, posted by an internet celebrity named Huazong on Wednesday, showed cleaning staff at various luxury hotels using a single cloth to clean toilets as well as water cups and basins.
China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism said in a statement it was concerned by the reports and had asked authorities in five provinces to investigate the issue, which has already prompted a flurry of apologies from big-name hotel chains.
The roughly 12-minute-long video features international chains such as  Hilton Worldwide  Holdings Inc-owned (N:HLT) Conrad Beijing and Waldorf Astoria, as well as Marriott International Inc's (O:MAR) Sheraton and Le Royal Meridien. 
Huazong, who has 322,000 followers on China's Twitter-like Weibo, said he recorded the videos during stays at deluxe hotels over the past few years. He said he was disheartened to realise it was common for staff to use dirty towels to clean cups.
His revelations drew wide attention and caused a nation-wide public outcry. Hotels including the Park Hyatt in Beijing, the Shangri-La in Fuzhou, and the Four Seasons in Shanghai issued apologies and vowed to improve service quality.
The Mandarin Oriental hotel in the commercial hub of Shanghai vowed ""it would not tolerate the inappropriate cleaning behavior in guest rooms shown in the video"".
The Shangri-La said it was taking steps to ensure hygiene standards. The Four Seasons in Shanghai said it would improve internal training.
The expose also led to heated discussion online as some argued the cleaning staff were not getting paid much for working in some of the most expensive hotels in the world. 
""Luckily I cannot afford to stay in any of these hotels,"" one commenter said in an online post responding to the video.

1086,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 16, 2018 03:05AM ET</span>",China private education firms tumble as Beijing tightens grip,"By Adam Jourdan and Kane Wu
SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese private education stocks sank on Friday after Beijing moved to tighten the reins on the early education sector, citing child safety issues that have hit some firms over the last year and saying that others were making too much profit.
China's State Council said on Thursday it would not allow private kindergartens to go public as individual entities or as part of asset packages and would block listed firms from buying private kindergartens via share sales or by cash.
The move could roil a private education market estimated to be worth $260 billion and which has been forecast to see deals worth billions of dollars this year. 
U.S.-listed  RYB Education  Inc (N:RYB), which was hit by a child abuse scandal in China last year, dropped over 50 percent overnight, wiping off $200 million from its market valuation. In Hong Kong and Shenzhen peers dropped sharply on Friday.
The move by Beijing is the latest regulatory crackdown to rattle investors, following its moves to rein in sectors from online lending to gaming.
""It came as a surprise,"" said one Hong Kong-based investor in China's education sector, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue. ""If the education companies are legal, they should be treated as any other business.""
The investor said the rules had created a lot of confusion about what already-listed private education firms should do, including whether they would be forced to delist.
In a draft document laying out the plans, China's cabinet said it would look to standardize pre-education, bolster ""lagging"" teaching standards and look to curb excessive profit-seeking.
""Some kindergartens are overly profitable and some child safety issues have occurred,"" the state council said.
""This relates to the healthy development of millions of children, social harmony and stability and the future of the Party and the state.""
Brokerage Jefferies said in a note the move was likely part of a government push to gain more control over the sector as it looks to improve access to pre-school education.
""We believe the new regulations may be a response to the large amount of private equity money flooding the market trying to buy up private kindergartens, driving up prices,"" it said.
Jefferies added a final draft of the law would likely come out by the first quarter of next year and that key questions were whether rules would be applied retroactively and if variable interest entity (VIE) ownership would be allowed. 
China's overall private education market is worth around $260 billion, according to a June note from LEK Consulting, and is growing at around 9 percent per year. The consultancy expects around $3.5 billion worth of education deals in China in 2018.
China has been cranking up regulation of the private education sector this year, with earlier draft rules released in August also spooking the market then.

The RYB case last year, involving allegations of child abuse, had sparked widespread anger in China about the lack of trained teachers, low wages and poor regulatory oversight in the massive and fast-growing private pre-school sector.

SAN FRANCISCO/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - PG&E Corp shares soared 40 percent in after-hours trade on Thursday following a report that a regulatory official told investors the agency does not want the utility to go into bankruptcy should it be found responsible for this month's deadly wildfire in northern California.
(Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2QJvpWH) 
Bloomberg reported the comment by a California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) official on a call hosted by Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), citing a person familiar with the matter. 
A CPUC spokesman said he could not confirm the remarks and Bank of America declined to comment. CPUC issued a statement emphasizing that state law requires it to consider a utility's financial health when weighing a request to cover costs associated with wildfires.
""A utility filing bankruptcy is not in the best interest of consumers, but that decision is not the CPUC’s,"" a CPUC spokeswoman told Reuters. 
Late on Thursday, Moody's cut parent PG&E's credit rating to one notch above junk, although many of the company's bonds were already trading at non-investment grade levels earlier in the day.
S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings, citing rising risks that the company may face from the wildfire, also lowered its rating on PG&E by one notch to BBB-minus.
It placed the company on CreditWatch with negative implications, saying the risks increase the probability of another downgrade over the next few months.
Investors are watching for clues about whether California's government will step in to save PG&E should it eventually be found responsible for the Camp Fire, which destroyed the town of Paradise a week ago, and should any potential liability exceeds the utility's resources. 
""The CPUC is mindful that in order for a utility to operate safely, it must have the financial means to function and implement new safety measures,"" the commission said in the statement.
The after-hours surge in PG&E's stock more than erased a 31 percent drop during Thursday's regular trading session. 
PG&E warned on Tuesday that it could face liability that exceeds its insurance coverage if its equipment caused the Camp Fire. 
PG&E currently has no plans to file for bankruptcy, people close to the company said on Thursday. 
The wild trading swings on Thursday illustrate the uncertainty investors face in valuing PG&E's stock. The company's market value dropped to a low of $9 billion on Thursday from $26 billion just last week.
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) analysts on Wednesday estimated the company's potential exposure from the blaze could exceed $15 billion.
The Camp Fire, and a second in Southern (NYSE:SO) California, the Woolsey Fire, are still burning, with 56 people confirmed dead and nearly 300 still missing. The fires destroyed nearly 9,000 homes and threatened 15,500 buildings, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire).
The cause of the fires, the deadliest in California's history, is under investigation. Pacific Gas and Electric Co, PG&E's subsidiary, and Edison International's Southern California Edison have both told regulators they experienced equipment problems in areas around the times the fires were first reported.
TAPPING CREDIT LINES
In a bid to shore up its finances, PG&E said this week it borrowed more than $3 billion under credit lines available to it and Pacific Gas and Electric Co, the maximum available from those sources. 
Distressed companies often tap their credit lines to boost cash as they work through their financial troubles. Citigroup analysts said PG&E may use the money to pay near-term maturities and in case credit ratings agencies downgrade the utility.
""As the company's cash position diminishes, the risk of bankruptcy could increase unless politicians intervene,"" Mizuho analyst Paul Fremont wrote in a note to clients on Thursday.
""For now, we look for signs of additional legislative and regulatory support for PG&E as the company works through the various legal processes with the Cal Fire.""
Trading in PG&E bonds was mixed after they fell broadly a day earlier. 
Yields on its nearest maturities remained very elevated, however, and its October 2020 $800 million note shot above a 10 percent yield at one point, the first of PG&E’s bonds to pierce that threshold.
To keep PG&E from going bankrupt, California policymakers will face pressure to extend assistance provided in a bill approved last September for utilities to pass on to customers some of the costs related to wildfires, according to Moody's. The bill mitigates liability from fires in 2017 and others starting in 2019, but made no provision for fires this year.

S&P said it expected the CPUC to support the company's credit quality, adding there could be political pressure from public outrage over the wildfires that may hamper the CPUC's efforts.

1094,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2018 11:19PM ET</span>",China's U-turn on market curbs brings back the speculators,"By Samuel Shen and John Ruwitch
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Speculators are staging a forceful comeback in China's stock market, bidding up shares in loss-making companies as regulators ease rules around trading, fundraising and backdoor listings to prop up struggling bourses.
In a bid to stop the kind of market meltdown China saw in 2015-16, authorities are urging funds to invest in cash-strapped companies and encouraging others to do mergers and acquisitions (M&As).
The measures mark a reversal of the more restrictive curbs introduced two to three years ago, which were designed to prevent a repeat of the boom-and-bust cycle that triggered the last major rout.
The relaxations, however, have resulted in an immediate surge in speculative bets on possible acquisition targets and trading in small-cap shares. 
(Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2PtbYoh)
For some, the moves simply clear unnecessary regulatory interference that inhibits robust and open capital markets. But for others, the new policies are a dangerous ""Faustian Bargain"" that delivers short-term stability at the expense of sustainable valuations.
""Currently, all the emergency measures are deals with the devil,"" said Yuan Yuwei, partner at Water Wisdom Asset Management. Imploring speculators to rescue the market could set the stage for trouble, he added.
Over the past year, speculators have largely laid low due to a relentless crackdown on market manipulation and insider trading.
However, a pledge by China's top securities regulator on Oct. 19 to boost market confidence through a series of measures has prompted a rapid return of the punters.
An index tracking so-called ""Special Treatment"", or ST, stocks - loss-making companies that involve high risks or are candidates for possible delisting - has surged over 30 percent since Oct 19.
That compares with a mere 3 percent rise in the CSI300 index (CSI300), whose blue-chip constituents were market darlings last year.
Money is also pouring into companies that speculators think might become acquisition targets for backdoor listings, dubbed ""shell companies"".
One company that appears to have benefited is Hengli Industrial Development Group Co (SZ:000622), whose share price tripled over the past three weeks as investors bet on a possible acquisition.
Speculators have ignored repeated warnings by the automotive air conditioner maker, who said the price surge defied fundamentals.
Based on current profitability and valuation, investors buying the stock would need to wait 2,800 years to recoup investment through dividend payments. An investor relations official at Hengli declined to comment, saying the company had no undisclosed information.
Speculators have also piled into Changsheng Bio-technology (SZ:002680), the company at the center of a nationwide vaccine safety scandal that faces the risk of delisting.
A ""special treatment"" stock, Changsheng rose the maximum 5 percent on Thursday for the sixth consecutive session, despite the Shenzhen Stock Exchange flagging risks to investors. Changsheng could not be reached for a comment.
MARKET LUBRICATION?
Between 2013 and 2015, lax regulation contributed to a boom in M&As and private share placements, which led to reckless expansion, overpriced deals, bubbly stock prices and mountains of inflated goodwill sitting on companies' books.
Following the crash of 2015-16, the China Securities Regulatory Commission tightened scrutiny of share sales and M&As to prevent the rapid buildup of speculative positions.
The regulator's moves in recent weeks, however, reverse these curbs. On Oct. 19, the CSRC said it had initiated fast-track approvals for M&A deals. The next day, it said it would support backdoor listings by companies whose applications for initial public offerings (IPO) are rejected.
And last week, the CSRC revised regulations to allow listed firms to issue additional shares more frequently, and for broader use.
Easier fundraising enables indebted firms to pay debts and expedite M&As. Also fuelling investment flows are expectations the central bank will loosen the monetary spigot by cutting interest rates.
However, Yuan, of Water Wisdom, said that relaxing rules to prop up companies that might otherwise fail is a concession to interest groups and a sign the government has been ""kidnapped by populism"".
Shen Weizhen, a fund manager at LC Securities, said the moves skewed market behavior.
""If buying garbage companies can make a lot of money ... who would be interested in blue-chips any more?""
The CSRC did not respond to Reuters' request for comment for this story.
For now, market authorities appear more worried about falling share prices than a new speculative bubble.
The Shanghai Stock Exchange said on Nov. 2 that it would seek to avoid interfering with trading, and vowed to largely refrain from restrictive measures such as suspending trading accounts. CSRC said on Oct. 30 it would reduce ""unnecessary intervention"" in the market.Retail investor Wu Beicheng said he welcomed what he saw as ""corrective"" measures by the government.

""Speculation is the lubricant of the market,"" he said. ""Without speculation, the market would be lifeless.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The CEOs of Australia's top banks and wealth manager will testify at a public inquiry into financial-sector misconduct in two weeks of hearings starting on Monday, in the final stages of a year-long process that looks set to transform the industry. 
All eyes will be on the new heads of Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA) and AMP Ltd (AX:AMP), Matt Comyn and Mike Wilkins respectively, who were appointed earlier this year after the inquiry exposed widespread wrongdoing.
The two executives at the helms of those firms when rampant fee-gouging and other abuses were taking place, former CBA boss Ian Narev and AMP's Craig Meller, have moved on without being publicly grilled by barristers assisting the inquiry.
Allan Fels, a former chairman of consumer watchdog the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, said that ""if these were legal or prosecutorial proceedings you would expect former executives to be questioned"".
""I'm sure the commissioner will not accept any story that this should only be blamed on previous managers,"" he added, referring to the appearances of Comyn and Wilkins.
Tim Finney, of law firm Phi Finney McDonald, which is running shareholder class actions against both companies, said the inquiry had highlighted the need for financial firms to link incentives to ethical behavior.
""If your financial incentives are based on short-term financial performance, that may encourage corporate practice which encourages long-term sleeper issues which really only burst open after you've departed the scene,"" he told Reuters. 
Comyn, 42, has said short-term bonuses helped create the culture that led to misconduct. In response, the bank has cut A$100 million ($72.8 million) from annual bonuses.
The inquiry - a powerful Royal Commission headed by a retired High Court judge - has heard instances of bribery, fraud, the charging of fees for no service and from the accounts of deceased people, and board-level deception of regulators.
CBA, Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC), Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ) and National Australia Bank (AX:NAB) have acknowledged the wrongdoing and promised to repair the trust of the community. 
Wealth manager AMP has also admitted to charging customers fees without providing a service, then tampering with a supposedly independent report to a regulator about the practice.
So far, none of the heads of the big four banks or AMP has appeared before Commissioner Kenneth Hayne.
Hayne's final report due in February could recommend charges, stiffer penalties and sweeping reform of Australia's highly profitable financial sector.
Already the banks have started selling non-core units in anticipation that the inquiry will recommend greater separation between the interests of consumers and shareholders.

Katherine Temple, of the Consumer Law Action Centre nonprofit, said she wanted the CEOs who appear at the inquiry over the next two weeks to commit to ""getting rid of conflicted remuneration, stopping the sale of inherently poor-value products like junk insurance, and making sure they only lend money to people who can afford to repay it"".

(Reuters) - A second South Carolina jury on Thursday failed to reach a verdict in the retrial of a case by a woman whose family said her long-term use of Johnson & Johnson's (N:JNJ) baby powder led to her death from asbestos-related cancer.
The case of Bertila Boyd-Bostic, who died of a rare form of cancer in 2017 at the age of 30, is the latest in a series of trials in the United States that center around allegations that the company's talc-based powder contains cancer-causing asbestos.
In May, a deadlocked jury at the Darlington County Court of Common Pleas in Charleston failed to reach a verdict in the first trial.
J&J, which denies the allegations, to date has lost two trials and won three in the litigation over whether Johnson's Baby Powder causes mesothelioma, a tissue cancer closely linked to asbestos exposure. Jury trials in another four mesothelioma cases have resulted in mistrials because jurors could not agree on a verdict or because the plaintiff died.
J&J, faced with some 11,700 U.S. talc lawsuits, in a statement on Thursday said it believed the mistrials, as well as the verdicts clearing it of liability reflected the ""diligent review"" by juries in the cases.
""We look forward to a new trial to present our defense, which rests on decades of independent, non-litigation-driven scientific evaluations, none of which have found that Johnson's Baby Powder contains asbestos,"" the company said.
Christopher Swett, a lawyer for Boyd-Bostic's family, in a statement said plaintiffs were disappointed with Thursday's result. Swett said the trial court judge had urged the parties to consider a settlement, but that J&J ""refuses to be reasonable and take responsibility.""
The New Brunswick, New Jersey-based company in the past has said that it was not considering to settle talc cases and currently is appealing all jury verdicts against it.
Of the 11,700 talc lawsuits, more than 9,700 involve claims over ovarian cancer, recent filings in federal court in New Jersey, where most of the cases are consolidated, showed.
The remaining plaintiffs allege asbestos in J&J's talc caused them to develop mesothelioma.
J&J has been fighting talc cancer lawsuits for several years, but the litigation shifted in recent months to include allegations of asbestos contamination. 

In July, a Missouri jury hit J&J with a massive $4.69 billion verdict in the first trial alleging asbestos contamination has caused ovarian cancer in 22 women. That decision is under appeal.

WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (Reuters) - Sears Holdings Corp (PK:SHLDQ) won U.S. bankruptcy court approval on Thursday to move forward with plans to stay in business and sell itself, even as it continues to evaluate offers to liquidate its business.
The 125-year-old retailer, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last month, faces opposition to its plan to sell from some creditors, who argued in court papers that Sears would be squandering hundreds of millions of dollars by pursuing a sale instead of winding down its business. 
To address the creditors' concerns, attorneys for Sears said the retailer would be considering offers for its business from liquidation firms that sell companies' assets in pieces and shut them down. 
Liquidators won an auction for the assets of sporting goods retailer Sports Authority in 2016 and then sold them off in pieces. Retailer Toys ""R"" Us decided to liquidate this year, shutting all of its U.S. brick-and-mortar shops.
Ray Schrock, an attorney for Sears, told the court that liquidating Sears right away would destroy value, and potentially lead to the failure of profitable businesses, such as the retailer’s home services division.
“We recognize that we have a tough task ahead to save the company,” Schrock said. Sears employs about 68,000 people.
Sears filed for bankruptcy with its bank lenders promising to give it $300 million in bankruptcy financing. The retailer late Wednesday filed papers with the court showing that it had secured an additional $350 million bankruptcy loan from Great American Capital Partners, an affiliate of liquidation specialist Great American Group. 
The company faces a mid-December milestone to find a bidder for its approximately 500 remaining stores and other assets. Sears already announced it plans to close about 180 of its stores.
Sears Chairman Eddie Lampert, a billionaire who runs hedge fund ESL Investments Inc, is working ""around the clock"" with possible lenders to finance a bid to keep Sears in business, according to bankruptcy-court papers.

Lampert, who was Sears' chief executive until it filed for bankruptcy, has loaned the company billions of dollars over the years, and plans to use some of the money he is owed to finance his offer for company assets, according to court papers.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Top U.S. proxy advisers outlined different processes for sharing their influential research and voting recommendations with stock issuers at a hearing in Washington on Thursday, highlighting one of the charged issues facing regulators as they weigh new rules for corporate elections.
Gary Retelny, chief executive of the largest U.S. proxy adviser, Institutional Shareholder Services, said his firm distributes drafts of its of research to S&P 500 companies and other large global firms before publishing to its own clients, and offers free copies to all stock issuers eventually.
In contrast Katherine Rabin, CEO of rival proxy adviser Glass, Lewis & Co, said it does not provide the full reports to companies ahead of time and charges for them, although it does share early the underlying data driving its opinions and analysis. 
Rabin said Glass Lewis tries to share the data well before annual meetings to give executives time to speak to investors on how to vote. ""If you're doing it too late I think that companies are sort of scrambling,"" she said at the hearing, which was webcast.
The differing approaches could prove important to regulators considering calls from industry groups to impose new rules on the advisers and on other parts of the process used to decide questions at corporate annual meetings. 
Among other reforms, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has suggested proxy advisers should show public companies drafts of their research reports to let them check for inaccuracies ""or other concerns.""
Officials made no decisions on Thursday, though late in the day Republican U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission member Elad Roisman alluded to the idea of giving executives more time to respond when he said having a ""rebuttal period"" for companies ""sort of makes sense to me."" 
But Roisman also said he gained a new appreciation for the help proxy advisers provide to large and small asset managers who cast votes at thousands of companies per year.
Executives from several investment organizations including  State Street  Corp (N:STT), the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System and investment adviser R.M. Davis Private Wealth Management spoke in support of the proxy advisers and worried new rules could raise their costs and in turn diminish shareholder engagement.
On an earlier panel, speakers came to a rare agreement that companies and investors could benefit if the names of shareholder proponents were included in corporate proxy statements.

1104,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2018 06:43PM ET</span>",California judge orders next Monsanto weed-killer cancer trial for March,"By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - A California judge on Thursday granted an expedited trial in the case of a California couple suffering from cancer who sued Bayer AG's (DE:BAYGn)  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) unit, alleging the company's glyphosate-containing weed killer Roundup caused their disease.
The order by Superior Court Judge Ioana Petrou in Oakland, California, comes on the heels of a $289 million verdict in the first glyphosate trial in San Francisco, in which a jury found Monsanto liable for causing a school groundskeeper's cancer. 
Damages were later reduced to $78 million, and Bayer, which denies the allegations, said it would appeal the decision. 
Its share price, however, has dropped nearly 30 percent since the Aug. 10 jury verdict and the company faces some 9,300 U.S. glyphosate lawsuits.
Petrou's ruling clears the way for the second California jury trial over glyphosate, the world's most widely used weed killer. The trial of California residents Alva and Alberta Pilliod is scheduled to begin on March 18, 2019, according to a court filing.
""While we have great sympathy for the plaintiffs, we are confident that our glyphosate-based herbicides were not the cause of their injuries and we will vigorously defend them at trial,"" the company said in a statement.
Glyphosate jury trials will ramp up next year. The company is scheduled to face jurors in a Missouri state court in St. Louis, where the first trial was set to begin in early February. That date, however, was vacated by a judge, Bayer said, and the trial is likely to be postponed to later in 2019.
A trial in San Francisco federal court, where federal Roundup lawsuits are consolidated, is scheduled to begin at the end of February.
Bayer, which acquired Monsanto earlier this year for $63 billion, says its glyphosate-based products do not cause cancer, pointing to decades of scientific studies and regulatory approvals that have shown the chemical to be safe for human use.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in September 2017 concluded a decades-long assessment of glyphosate risks and found the chemical not likely carcinogenic to humans. But the World Health Organization's cancer arm in 2015 classified glyphosate as ""probably carcinogenic to humans.""
The Pilliods, who are in their 70s, allege their regular use of Roundup between 1975 and 2011 caused them to develop non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph system.

The couple filed their lawsuit in June 2017, after being diagnosed with the cancer in 2011 and 2015 respectively. Their lawyers earlier this year asked for an expedited trial, citing the couple's risk of a relapse and their short life expectancy.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. automakers and parts suppliers on Thursday warned that President Donald Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs and threatened car tariffs would undermine the benefits of the new deal to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement, causing widespread job losses.
At a wide-ranging hearing before the U.S. International Trade Commission, labor representatives said the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) fails to include adequate enforcement of labor standards, while Southeastern U.S. fruit and vegetable growers said it leaves them vulnerable to subsidized Mexican competition.
The testimony will feed into a study by the commission on the economic impact of the trade deal reached on Sept. 30, which could heavily influence support for it in the U.S. Congress. A vote on the pact is not expected until the spring of 2019, following a lengthy consultation process.
Several automotive trade groups said side letters to the USMCA deal that allow Canada and Mexico duty-free auto import quotas in the event that Trump imposes car tariffs was an indication that such a move seemed inevitable.
The Trump administration is considering recommendations from the Commerce Department on whether to impose tariffs on national security grounds under Section 232 of a Cold War-era trade law.
No decisions have been made, but President Donald Trump has frequently threatened to impose 25 percent tariffs on autos and parts to pressure the European Union and Japan to make trade concessions.
""If implemented, increased auto tariffs would not only undermine the potential success of the USMCA, they would also pose a material threat to the economy and may result in the loss of as many as 700,000 jobs across the U.S.,"" said Jennifer Thomas, vice president of government affairs for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers.
The groups also said the failure of the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) to lift steel and aluminum tariffs have cost the industry billions of dollars and trade turmoil in general has paralyzed investment decisions.
""The current state of play on trade has placed our industry in turmoil,"" said Ann Wilson, senior vice president of government affairs at the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association. ""In the last year our members have faced Section 232 steel and aluminum tariffs, other Section 232 tariffs proposed, and Section 301 tariffs on goods from China.""
DETROIT VS FOREIGN BRANDS
There also was a divergence of views among domestic and foreign automakers on the overall benefits of the USMCA agreement, which requires autos to have 75 percent regional content and at least 40 percent from the United States or Canada.
John Bozzella, president of the Association of Global Automakers which represents foreign brand automakers with U.S. plants, said he was concerned that the ""many layered"" content requirements would hurt automakers' competitiveness by requiring ""unnecessary"" supply chain shifts and investment in compliance.
Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, which represents Detroit automakers General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford and Fiat Chrysler, described the trade deal as ""workable"" for these companies which have larger U.S. manufacturing footprints than their competitors.
He said it would not require massive manufacturing and supply chain changes immediately but over time, automakers would need to consider changes in where they build cars and major components.
CORN VS TOMATOES
A similar divergence came from agriculture groups, where grain farmers and shippers said it was a ""significant advancement"" that expands market access but seasonal produce groups said it fails to address Mexican subsidies that are driving Southeastern growers out of business.
An initial U.S. demand for the ability to impose seasonal tariffs to protect U.S. fruit and vegetable growers was abandoned during the 13-month negotiations.
""We have gotten the short end of the stick since the ink dried on the agreement,"" said Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam.
AFL-CIO trade policy specialist Celeste Drake said that the enforcement mechanism for new, higher labor standards was weak, relying on a seldom used state-to-state dispute settlement mechanism.

""We urge the commission to make clear that if the obligations are not enforced, the lure of cheap and easy labor exploitation in Mexico will continue to draw production and hold down wages in both countries,"" she said.

1108,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2018 06:10PM ET</span>","Dell sweetens tracking stock offer, Icahn drops opposition","By Carl O'Donnell and Vibhuti Sharma
(Reuters) - Dell Technologies on Thursday raised its offer to buy back shares tied to its interest in software maker VMware (N:DVMT) to $23.9 billion from $21.7 billion, prompting billionaire investor Carl Icahn to abandon his campaign to scupper the deal.
The acquisition of the publicly traded tracking stock will result in Dell becoming a publicly listed company without an initial public offering (IPO). Dell decided to shun a traditional IPO amid uncertainty over how stock market investors would respond to its $50 billion debt pile. 
Dell said on Thursday it would borrow an additional $5 billion from banks to finance its revised tracking stock offer. Dell made its first offer for the tracking stock in July, and ran into investor opposition over the value of its bid.
The revised terms, announced ahead of a scheduled vote on the deal by tracking stock owners on Dec. 11, came following negotiations with several large shareholders.
Icahn said he would abandon his proxy fight and lawsuits against Dell. While Dell's new offer still undervalues the tracking stock, the company managed to secure enough investor support to be able to overcome a challenge, Icahn said.
""We believe we have greatly enhanced value for all tracking stock stockholders, which includes my favorite tracking stock stockholder,  Icahn Enterprises  LP (O:IEP),"" Icahn said in a statement.
Dell issued the tracking stock in 2016 to buy data storage company EMC (NYSE:EMC) for $67 billion because it could not pay for the entire deal in cash and did not want to add to its debt burden. EMC owned a majority stake in VMware, which Dell inherited.
The security ""tracks,"" or depends on, the financial performance of VMware, and has been trading at a significant discount to VMware's stock. This emboldened investors such as Icahn to argue that Dell's offer undervalues the tracking stock.
Dell had previously offered $109 in cash for each tracking share, up to $9 billion in total, with the remainder payable with 1.3665 shares of Dell's Class C common stock for each tracking share. These Class C shares will become publicly traded once the tracking stock deal closes.
Dell is now offering $120 in cash for each tracking share, up to $14 billion in total, with the remainder payable with Dell Class C common stock at an exchange ratio of between 1.5043 and 1.8130, Dell said.
The exact exchange ratio will depend on how the tracking stock trades in the period between Dec. 3 and Dec. 19, Dell said. The lower the tracking stock trades, the more Dell Class C shares investors will receive. With this mechanism, the final value for each tracking stock share is guaranteed by Dell to be between $120 and $130 per share, the company said. 
Dell, which is owned and controlled by Michael Dell and private equity firm Silver Lake, also said on Thursday that its proposal includes the ability for shareholders to elect an independent director.
Dell said it received binding agreements from investors representing 17 percent of tracking stock owners to vote in favor of it. They include Dodge & Cox, Elliott Management, Canyon Partners and Mason Capital Management. 
“We believe the revised terms announced today align with the best interests of all Class V shareholders,"" said Charles Pohl, chairman of Dodge and Cox.
Mutual fund BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) also plans to back the deal, two people familiar with the matter said. BlackRock could not be reached for comment. 
“It will start to move forward at this new price of $120 a share. It seems many of the large holders are agreeing to accept it,"" said Ivan Feinseth, director of research at Tigress Financial Partners.
ECHOES OF OLD BATTLE
The tracking stock battle has echoes of the $24.9 billion deal that Dell and Silver Lake clinched to take the company private in 2013, a transaction that Icahn also opposed. In that case, Icahn also managed to secure a slight improvement to the offer.
Michael Dell has turned to deal-making to transform his company from a PC manufacturer into a broader seller of information technology services, ranging from storage and servers to networking and cyber security. 

Reuters reported on Tuesday that Dell was working with investment banks to add more cash to its buy back offer.

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) has cut prices on its residential solar systems by as much as 25 percent in a bid to lift lagging sales after the company streamlined its sales and marketing organization, a company official told Reuters on Thursday.
Effective on Thursday, price quotes for potential solar customers will be between $3,000 and $5,000 lower, representing savings of about 15 to 25 percent, according to Sanjay Shah, the company's senior vice president of energy operations.
Tesla said the $3,000 to $5,000 in savings was an average and that the actual amount could be lower or higher depending on the size of the rooftop system and where a home is located.
Since Tesla's acquisition two years ago of SolarCity, which at the time was the largest U.S. residential solar company, the company has sharply cut the vast sales organization that underpinned its rapid growth.
Last year, Tesla stopped selling solar door-to-door, and earlier this year it ended a long-standing deal to sell solar at 800  Home Depot  Inc (N:HD) stores - a relationship that some analysts estimated brought in roughly half of Tesla's solar sales but added up to $7,000 to the cost of a residential system.
That has come alongside a big drop in installations. Tesla deployed just 93 megawatts of solar in the third quarter, down from SolarCity’s more than 200 MW a quarter in early 2016.
Shah said that with lower prices, customers will seek out Tesla at its stores and online. 
""Every customer wants a greater value in terms of price,"" he said. ""When you do that the customer comes to you rather than you going to the customer.""
He said the price cuts should make Tesla “highly competitive” and added that the company ultimately wants to be the lowest-cost solar provider in the United States.
Solar energy systems from large installers on average are about 10 percent more expensive than those sold by smaller companies, according to a 2017 report by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, a U.S. government research lab.
Shah said Tesla’s premium solar products are more efficient than most other panels, and should not be compared with standard systems on price.
The price cuts are made possible in part by the savings Tesla has produced from streamlining its sales operations. By selling directly through its website and roughly 100 retail stores, Tesla has been able to cut sales and marketing costs in half, Shah said.
Shah joined the company six months ago from Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and has focused on making its solar supply chain more efficient, reducing sales and marketing costs, and bringing down the time it takes for rooftop systems to be installed, he said.

Tesla shares closed 1.3 percent higher at $348.44 on the Nasdaq on Thursday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Thursday on optimism the United States and China could resolve their trade dispute, after a news report said Washington would pause further tariffs on Chinese imports.
Wall Street's major indexes reversed an early drop after the Financial Times reported that U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told a group of industry executives the next tranche of tariffs on Chinese imports was on hold.
Wall Street momentarily pared gains after a spokesperson for Lighthizer denied the report, saying plans for the tariffs had not changed. But stocks resumed their upswing and rose further in the last half-hour of trading.
""We're getting conflicting messages, but the market is absolutely primed for any piece of good news it can get a-hold of,"" said Michael Antonelli, managing director of institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. ""The market has been beaten down, and it's weary. If it catches a ray of sunshine, it gets excited again.""
The benchmark S&P 500 index (SPX) gained 28.62 points, or 1.06 percent, to 2,730.2, snapping five days of losses. Shares of Apple Inc (O:AAPL) advanced 2.5 percent to end a five-day losing streak and help the technology sector (SPLRCT) climb 2.5 percent, the biggest gain among the S&P 500's major sectors.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 208.77 points, or 0.83 percent, to 25,289.27 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 122.64 points, or 1.72 percent, to 7,259.03.
Shares of Cisco Systems Inc (O:CSCO) advanced 5.5 percent after the network equipment maker's quarterly revenue and earnings beat analyst estimates. Cisco was among the biggest boosts to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.
Department store operator Dillard's Inc (N:DDS) tumbled 14.8 percent after third-quarter earnings missed analyst estimates. Retailer J.C. Penney Co Inc (N:JCP) also reported same-store sales below analyst expectations. But J.C. Penney shares shed initial losses to climb 11.5 percent after Chief Executive Officer Jill Soltau indicated plans to turn a profit.
The gloomy Dillard's and J.C. Penney results hurt Walmart Inc (N:WMT) shares, which fell 2.0 percent even though the world's largest retailer beat same-store sales estimates and raised its full-year outlook.
KB Home (N:KBH) slumped 15.3 percent after the company cut its fourth-quarter revenue forecast. Shares of other homebuilders, including D.R. Horton Inc (N:DHI),  Toll Brothers  Inc (N:TOL) and  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN), also fell.
Shares of PG&E Corp (N:PCG) extended their losing streak to a sixth day, hitting a 15-year low of $17.26 and ending down 30.7 percent. The utility company warned it could face liability in excess of its insurance if its equipment caused the deadly Camp Fire in northern California.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.35-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.05-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted six new 52-week highs and 19 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 17 new highs and 154 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 8.67 billion shares, up from the 8.58 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 0.83%. The S&P 500 rose 1.06%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.72%.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told some industry executives that the United States would hold off launching planned tariffs on China, the Financial Times reported, citing an unnamed person familiar with the situation.
Lighthizer, however, denied the report, insisting that plans to launch the tariffs outlined in September ""has not changed at all.""
Still, the report fuelled expectations that both the U.S. and China would seek to deescalate tensions at the upcoming G20 summit in Argentina, triggering a rally in trade-sensitive stocks and lifting the broader market.
 Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), whose shares have been directed by trade rhetoric, rose more than 3%, pushing the industrials to a 1% gain for the day.
Beyond trade, tech stocks led the rebound on Wall Street as bargain-hunting investors piled into beaten-down names like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), while a rally in semiconductors also lifted sentiment.
Energy names were also in favor as oil prices continued their rebound from a day earlier despite a large build in crude inventories.
U.S. corporates, meanwhile, continued to serve up upbeat earnings, but were greeted with mixed reaction from investors.
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) topped earnings estimates and raised its full-year estimates for earnings per share and comparable store sales. Its shares struggled to hold onto early gains, falling 2%, with some blaming the weakness on concerns over valuation.
Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) rose 5.5% after reporting fiscal first-quarter earnings Wednesday that topped expectations.
Homebuilders struggled to participate in the rally, keeping gains the broader averages in check, after KB Home (NYSE:KBH) plunged after slashing its full-year guidance in the wake of an ongoing slump in the housing market. Its shares fell 15%.
On the economic front, investors cheered signs of ongoing consumer strength, which has underpinned strong quarterly U.S. economic growth so far this year, as data showing consumers continued to splurge boosting retail sales.
The Commerce Department said on Thursday that core retail sales rose0.7% last month, above economists’ forecast for a 0.5% increase.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department plans to be more aggressive in pressing antitrust charges against companies that have rigged bids for government contracts, the agency's antitrust chief said on Thursday.
Makan Delrahim, head of the antitrust division, made the remarks in a speech a day after the department settled bid-rigging charges with three South Korean companies which supplied fuel to U.S. military in that country. 
SK Energy Co Ltd ; GS Caltex Corp , 50 percent owned by  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) CVX.N; and Hanjin Transportation Co Ltd (KS:002320) agreed to pay $236 million in civil damages and criminal fines, the department said on Wednesday.
The investigation is ongoing, said Delrahim.
Delrahim said few cases of bid-rigging had been prosecuted in the past decade in which the federal government was the victim, but he expected that to change.
In the next couple of months, the Justice Department will announce a task force on state and local conspiracies involving procurement fraud, said Delrahim.

Companies that come forward to report bid-rigging in procurement will pay lower damages and criminal fines, he added.

1130,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2018 04:18PM ET</span>",FDA to ban flavored e-cigarettes at U.S. convenience stores,"By Chris Kirkham
(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday announced sweeping new restrictions on flavored tobacco products, including electronic cigarettes popular among teenagers in an effort to prevent a new generation of nicotine addicts.
The much-anticipated announcement will mean that only tobacco, mint and menthol e-cigarette flavors can be sold at most traditional retail outlets such as convenience stores. Other fruity- or sweet-flavored varieties can now only be sold at age-restricted stores or through online merchants that use age-verification checks.
The FDA also plans to seek a ban on menthol cigarettes, a longtime goal of public health advocates, as well as flavored cigars.
FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said the moves are meant to prevent young people from continuing to use e-cigarettes, potentially leading to traditional cigarette smoking.
""I will not allow a generation of children to become addicted to nicotine through e-cigarettes,"" Gottlieb said.
The agency has faced mounting pressure to act on e-cigarettes amid their surging popularity among U.S. teenagers in recent years. One of the most popular devices, made by San Francisco-based Juul Labs Inc, has become a phenomenon at U.S. high schools, where ""Juuling"" has become synonymous with vaping.
E-cigarettes vaporize a liquid containing nicotine, the addictive stimulant that gives smokers a rush. They are widely believe to be less harmful than combustible cigarettes, but the long-term health consequences of using the devices are unknown.
Data released on Thursday by the FDA and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed a 78 percent increase in high school students who reported using e-cigarettes in the last 30 days, compared with the prior year.
More than 3 million high school students, or more than 20 percent of all U.S. high school students, used the products, along with 570,000 middle school students, according to the survey. 
SUPPORT TO RESTRICT YOUTH ACCESS 
Juul and tobacco giant  Altria Group  (NYSE:MO) Inc had announced measures to pull flavored e-cigarette products from retail outlets, after the FDA threatened in September to ban Juul and other leading e-cigarette products unless their makers took steps to prevent use by minors.
Juul, Logic, a unit of Japan Tobacco Inc, Altria, which makes e-cigarettes under the MarkTen brand,  British American Tobacco  (LON:BATS) Plc (BAT) and Imperial Brands (LON:IMB) Plc, the maker of blu e-cigarettes, all said they supported efforts to reduce youth access.
Altria said it believes the devices have the potential to be ""less harmful products that can deliver nicotine to adults who want them.""
Imperial said it was developing a technology that can lock the devices if an underage person tries to use it. 
BAT said that while ""flavors play an important role in an adult smoker’s transition out of smoking, we understand the FDA’s concern that some flavors can play a role in increasing youth appeal."" 
E-cigarettes have been a divisive topic in the public health community. Some focus on the potential benefit of shifting lifelong smokers to less harmful nicotine products, while others fear it will create a new generation addicted to nicotine.
Last year the FDA under Gottlieb extended until 2022 a deadline for many e-cigarette products to comply with new federal rules on marketing and public health. Today's restrictions on flavors are interim measures that companies must follow before submitting detailed plans before the deadline.
The new rules on e-cigarette flavors mean that many of the sweet and fruity varieties believed to be most popular among minors will only be available in stores such as vape shops or tobacco shops that do not allow under-age people inside.
Stores could also have a separate, age-restricted section that allows sale of other flavors, the FDA said.
FIERCE RESISTANCE TO MENTHOL BAN
The agency cited survey data showing that mint and menthol flavors were more popular with adult e-cigarette users than teenagers. 
Anti-tobacco and public health groups commended the FDA on its proposed ban on menthol cigarettes, which data show are far more popular among young smokers and particularly young African-Americans.
Any move to ban menthol is expected to face fierce resistance from the tobacco industry. 
Menthol cigarettes represent more than 30 percent of U.S. cigarette volumes and approximately 55 percent of BAT's U.S. volumes, through its Newport brand, according to a research note from AllianceBernstein earlier this week.
The FDA must go through a rulemaking process, which requires significant public comment before finalizing any regulation on menthols.

Imperial, BAT and Altria said the ban on menthols or flavored cigars was not supported by science and evidence.

1131,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2018 04:10PM ET</span>",Labor unions file pension lawsuit against Puerto Rico,"By Karen Pierog
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Puerto Rico violated a law meant to safeguard the pensions of its public-sector workers who have been unable to invest the more than $300 million they contributed to a new retirement plan, according to a lawsuit filed against the U.S. commonwealth's government and others by two labor unions on Thursday.
The litigation, filed in U.S. District Court in San Juan, joins a long list of adversary cases in a form of bankruptcy Puerto Rico's federally created oversight board initiated in May 2017 to restructure the island's $120 billion of debt and pension obligations.
It is also the latest chapter in a fraught relationship between Puerto Rico and its government employees, particularly teachers. 
In the latest lawsuit, the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) and the American Federation of State, County & Municipal Employees (AFSCME) point to Law 106, enacted in August 2017 to require wage deductions from workers participating in a new retirement plan to be placed into segregated employee-controlled, 401(k)-style accounts that they said have not been created.
The unions claim that while workers' contributions totaled $316 million as of July 31, employees have been unable to invest the money, missing out on ""historically high stock market returns."" 
""For all intents and purposes, the commonwealth is seizing employees' own funds and hiding them under a mattress - in this case, upon information and belief, government bank accounts at Banco Popular earning virtually zero interest,"" the lawsuit claimed.
Defendants in the lawsuit include the bank, Puerto Rico's governor, chief financial officer, treasurer, fiscal and financial advisory authority, retirement board, as well as the oversight board. The latter, an entity established by a federal law known as PROMESA, failed to force the commonwealth government's compliance with the law, according to the lawsuit. 
The unions, which represent thousands of teachers and government workers in Puerto Rico, asked the court to find the defendants in violation of Law 106 and of their fiduciary duties and require the creation of accessible retirement accounts by yearend. The lawsuit also seeks an undetermined amount of compensation for lost investment income.

1132,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2018 04:07PM ET</span>",Goldman CEO 'personally outraged' by Malaysia's 1MDB corruption scandal,"By Aparajita Saxena
(Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) Chief Executive Officer David Solomon has told employees he is ""personally outraged"" that any of the bank's officials would take the actions laid out in U.S. government charges of fraud involving Malaysia's state controlled investment bank, 1MDB. 
Solomon made the comments in a voicemail sent to employees on Wednesday, weeks after U.S. prosecutors unveiled criminal charges against two former Goldman bankers tied to the alleged theft of billions of dollars from 1MDB, according to a transcript of a voicemail sent to employees on Wednesday which the bank gave to Reuters on Thursday.
The government of former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak set up 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB, in 2009.
An estimated $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB by high-level officials of the fund and their associates between 2009 and 2014, the U.S. Justice Department has alleged. Najib has consistently denied wrongdoing in connection with alleged graft involving 1MDB.
Tim Leissner, a former partner for Goldman Sachs in Asia, has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to launder money and conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and agreed to forfeit $43.7 million. 
Roger Ng, the other charged former Goldman banker, was arrested in Malaysia at the request of U.S. authorities. 
""It goes without saying that they (the former employees) violated the firm's policies and procedures and acted in conflict with all that we stand for,"" Solomon said in Wednesday's voicemail to Goldman staff. 
Goldman has been under scrutiny for its role in helping 1MDB raise funds through bond offerings, from which it earned around $600 million in fees, an amount critics said exceeded the normal level for fees. 
Goldman has previously said that it ""continues to cooperate with all authorities investigating this matter."" It has denied any wrongdoing. 
""1MDB remains an ongoing investigation, and we will continue to work with the Department of Justice and other authorities to get to the bottom of what happened and to move forward,"" Solomon added in Wednesday's voice mail.
Malaysia's current Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Tuesday said Goldman's bankers ""cheated"" the country in dealings with the state fund, while Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng said his country would seek a ""full refund"" of fees the bank earned.
Goldman's shares have fallen nearly 10 percent since the U.S. prosecutors filed a lawsuit against two former Goldman bankers. The stock has fallen more than 20 percent this year.
While U.S. prosecutors have previously filed civil asset forfeiture suits for assets allegedly bought with some of the stolen funds, the action against the former Goldman bankers are the first criminal charges the Justice Department has brought against individuals in the case under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a federal law targeting official bribery abroad.
At least six countries, including Malaysia, the United States and Switzerland, have been investigating alleged thefts from 1MDB.
The 1MDB investigations in the United States and Malaysia have gathered pace since Najib unexpectedly lost a general election in May to Mahathir Mohamad, who returned to power 15 years after he retired as prime minister.

1133,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2018 04:05PM ET</span>","JetBlue wants U.S., European regulators to review joint ventures","By Tracy Rucinski 
(Reuters) - The chief executive of JetBlue Airways Corp, which has made no secret of its desire to expand into transatlantic service, said on Thursday that U.S. and European regulators should review joint ventures that have allowed big airlines to dominate the market.
JetBlue CEO Robin Hayes, speaking at an airline industry event in New York, said consumers were at risk of decades of high fares because of legacy transatlantic partnerships.
JetBlue (O:JBLU), the sixth largest U.S. airline, wants to service Europe from its main hubs in New York, Boston and Fort Lauderdale, Florida, but is concerned about challenges posed by the big three U.S. legacy airlines' control of important foreign markets through their global alliances. 
 American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL), Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) and United Airlines (O:UAL) are each part of a global airline alliance that together control nearly 80 percent of the transatlantic market. The three carriers also have joint ventures with member airlines in Europe that allow them to coordinate prices and schedules and share revenues. 
""We believe that regulators should be doing everything they can to make it possible for new players and new models to have a fair shot at competing,"" Hayes said.
Hayes believes competition authorities in the United States, the UK and the European Union should force slot divestitures to create a level playing field for new entrants, particularly in the wake of major consolidation among U.S. carriers over the past decade.
For example, since American Airlines forged a commercial tie-up with fellow oneworld alliance member British Airways (L:ICAG) in 2010, it has merged with US Airways to become the world's largest airline.
Such mergers have made it more difficult for younger, low-fare carriers like JetBlue to access gates and slots - as airport take-off and landing rights are known - at congested airports where the larger airlines dominate.
A handful of Europe-based budget carriers, including Norwegian Air (OL:NWC) and WOW Air, have broken into the transatlantic market, but two - Primera Air and Monarch Airlines - were forced into bankruptcy over the past year. 
JetBlue argues that Mint, the carrier's version of business class, has driven a 50 percent decline in premium fares on some competing U.S. routes. It believes it can drive a similar reduction for premium travel between the United States and Europe.
Separately on Thursday, JetBlue announced a biometric self-boarding gate for international flights at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), becoming the first domestic airline to launch the use of facial recognition technology to verify passengers with a quick photo capture for international travel.

JetBlue has 14 million annual JFK customers.

1134,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2018 03:49PM ET</span>","Wells Fargo plans 1,000 U.S. job cuts","By Imani Moise
(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co said on Thursday it notified about 1,000 employees in its Consumer Lending and Payments, Virtual Solutions and Innovations groups of plans to eliminate their positions.
The layoffs are consistent with the bank's previously announced plans to reduce headcount by up to 10 percent by 2020, spokesman Tom Goyda said. Wells Fargo, the No. 4 U.S. bank by assets, had about 262,000 employees as of Sept. 30.
Most of those affected received 60-day notices, but some received pre-notices, meaning they will get a 60-day notice sometime next year. 
About 900 of the layoffs are in the bank's home lending unit, reflecting declines in application volume and the number of customers in default. The cuts will be spread across the United States but are concentrated in Des Moines, Iowa, which is expected to have about 400 reductions, and Fort Mill, South Carolina, which is expected to have 111 cuts. 
""We are committed to retaining as many team members as possible and will do everything we can to help them identify other opportunities within Wells Fargo,"" Goyda said. 
Earlier this year, the company announced plans to reduce its overall headcount by up to 26,000 over the next three years to reflect changing consumer preferences as more customers use self-service technology to do their banking.
The cuts are intended to help the bank reach its goal of reducing costs by $4 billion by 2020 as it tries to increase profit and recover from a series of scandals while operating under the Federal Reserve’s asset cap.
Over the summer, the bank laid off 600 employees in its mortgage division which has faced challenges due to a slowdown in refinancing demand.

Aside from headcount reductions, Wells Fargo has pledged to lower costs and become more efficient by reducing its branch count by about 800 by 2020 and by selling noncore businesses.

1. Chip Sector Earnings Look Grim
The chip sector could hamper the market tomorrow after disappointing results from two major companies after the bell today.
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) sank about 14% after hours. The company missed on revenue expectations and forecast current quarter revenue well below consensus.
Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) reported earnings and revenue right at consensus. But its guidance for next quarter’s profit and revenue was below Street estimates.
The stock fell 5% postmarket.
In retail, Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) plunged 11% after hours. It beat on the top and bottom lines, but fell a little short on same-store sales.
Tomorrow morning, Viacom (NASDAQ:VIAB) will report numbers. On average analysts are predicting a profit of 96 cents a share on revenue of $3.4 billion.
2. Can Oil Make It Three in a Row?
Oil confounded expectations by settling slightly higher today, but there’s a lot of push and pull still going on in the market.
Prices were resilient in the face of a massive increase in U.S. oil inventories reported by the EIA today. Stockpiles of crude jumped by almost 10.3 million, about three times what the market was expecting.
U.S. crude production edged up to 11.7 million barrels per day, making the U.S. the leading producer of crude in the world. But bulls are relying on Saudi Arabia to be the driver of prices, hoping it will sharply curb production to keep another selloff at bay.
Tomorrow the market will get U.S. rig count data from Baker Hughes at 1 PM ET (18:00 GMT). There were 886 rigs active, according to last week’s count.
3. Industrial Production Data Coming
Economic numbers are light tomorrow, not unusual for a Friday.
The latest figures on industrial production and capacity utilization arrive at 9:15 AM ET (14:15 GMT).
On average, economists expect that industrial production in October rose 0.2%, down slightly from the month before.
October capacity utilization is forecast to come slightly in slightly higher than the month earlier at 78.3%.
Manufacturing production for last month is also expected to post a 0.2% rise."

""The application for the granting of protective measures was submitted in order to secure the time frame needed to finalize the terms of the company's restructuring plan,"" it said.
Securing interim protection would mitigate the risk of a large number of job losses in Greece and abroad, Follie said, adding it had ""strong support of over 50 percent of its unsecured creditors.""
It said management was in the process of producing a revised business plan together with Deloitte for the total restructuring of its operations.
Follie plunged into trouble when hedge fund Quintessential Capital Management said in a May report that it had overstated the number of its outlets. It also questioned its accounting practices in Asia where the company had expanded rapidly.

That report sent Folli shares down sharply, led to a fine from the Greek securities commission and an investigation and the resignation of its founders, Dimitris Koutsolioutsos and Ekaterini Koutsolioutsou, in September, after a preliminary audit revealed wide discrepancies in 2017 financial statements.

UBS denies any wrongdoing. 
For more than a month, the bank and six former executives have faced allegations of laundering the proceeds of tax fraud and illegally soliciting clients in France, which could cost the bank up to 5.3 billion euros ($6 billion) if it is found guilty - an unprecedented sum in France. 
After a seven-year investigation of UBS's dealings, the prosecutor has demanded the bank be fined 3.7 billion euros, while lawyers representing the French government are seeking 1.6 billion euros in damages.
UBS's lawyers say prosecutors have failed to bring material evidence against the bank and that the case is politicized.
""It is difficult now to defend UBS. French people hate banks,"" said UBS's main lawyer Jean Veil. He accused the lawyer representing the French state of xenophobia against the Swiss and demagoguery.
Under French law, those convicted of money laundering can be ordered to pay a fine worth half the amount laundered. The prosecution estimates UBS's customers hid several billion euros from the French tax man.

UBS lawyers called the size of the possible penalty ""irrational"" and ""extravagant.""

KB Home (NYSE:KBH) dropped 19% to remain on track for its worst day of trading since August 1992 after its lower-than-expected fourth-quarter guidance prompted a wave of price target cuts from Wall Street banks.
Credit Suisse, Wells Fargo, Barclays and Wedbush all slashed their price targets on KB Home stock.
KB Home lowered its fourth-quarter revenue guidance to a range of $1.31 billion to $1.34 billion from $1.39 billion to $1.45 billion previously, below consensus of $1.42 billion, according to S&P Capital IQ.
The homebuilder blamed the downbeat outlook on higher mortgage rates and higher home prices, both of which have forced homebuyers to remain on the sidelines.
The bleeding from KB Home spilled across homebuilders and served as warning that there's more road for further downside in the sector.

1159,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 15, 2018 12:09PM ET</span>","Home Depot, Amazon Follow Walmart Down Midday","Investing.com - Retail stocks are rolling over in midday trading, in what could be an ominous sign for the sector.
Investors are selling retail stocks overall, with the SPDR S&P Retail (NYSE:XRT) ETF down about 1.6% at 11:55 AM ET (16:55 GMT).
What should be particularly troubling for investors is that the selling is coming after what looked very solid quarterly numbers and optimistic holiday outlook from Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and better-than-expected official October retail sales data.
Walmart’s same-store sales topped expectations, with key online sales jumping 43%, and guidance was in line with forecasts. But instead of applause from the market, shares sank about 2.2%.
And the bearish sentiment wasn’t localized.  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD), which sold off after its own strong earnings report this week, was a bigger drag on the Dow than Walmart, falling about 2.3%.

1163,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2018 11:54AM ET</span>","Cheap stocks back in vogue, even if laced with 'value traps'","By Danilo Masoni and Josephine Mason
MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - With world equity markets set to call time on one of the longest bull markets in history, so-called 'value stocks' - wallflowers during the technology-led boom years - are suddenly back in fashion. 
European value stocks, defined generally as firms whose fundamental worth is not reflected in their current share price, have outperformed growth stocks since early October as a dramatic sell-off swept across global equity markets unnerved by gradual end of a decade of easy money and rising trade tensions.
Companies that boast a faster pace of growth like the big U.S. tech names or Europe's luxury giants have been particularly favored during the past decade of central bank largesse.
In contrast, the so-called value end of the market has become cheaper and cheaper, creating some opportunities.
Heading into 2019, investors in search of better returns are scanning stocks in beaten-down sectors like banks, builders, autos or telecoms, looking whether cash flows reflect poorly in shares prices or whether other valuation metrics have fallen below historical averages or are disconnected from the sector.
""After ten tough years, it's finally getting interesting,"" said Luiz Sauerbronn at U.S.-based Brandes Investment Partners.
""It has all been about technology and the high-flying growth stuff. In the last decade, value has only outperformed a couple of years in Europe, and October has been much better,"" added Sauerbronn, who helps manage nearly $28 billion.
In October when world stocks lost $7 trillion of market cap at one point, European value stocks <.MIEU0000VPEU> fell only 4.3 percent while the region's growth stocks <.MIEU0000GPEU> suffered their worst month since August 2015, down 6.5 percent.
The outperformance has continued so far in November.
Still from the 2009 lows, European growth has risen 150 percent, against a rise of 100 percent for value.
Last week, the Fed signaled it was still on course to increase rates next month.
""The growth stocks benefited tremendously from having zero rates. That's the status quo forever? I hope not, and I don't think it will be the case,"" Sauerbronn also said.
GRAPHIC: Value outperforms since early October - https://tmsnrt.rs/2QsVqJw
AVOIDING VALUE TRAPS 
Buying value, however, is easier said than done, with the main challenge for investors being avoiding the so-called value traps, companies whose share price are cheap for a good reason.
""Value investing relies on a handful of stocks that go on to deliver high returns,"" Bernstein strategists said this month.
""Investing in the entire Value portfolio is not only impractical for most active investors, but is also subject to a massive return drag from the losers,"" they added.
Among their value picks they singled out several European companies in sectors such as mining, oil, airlines, construction and retail:  Anglo American  (L:AAL),  Saipem  (MI:SPMI), Lufthansa (DE:LHAG), LafargeHolcim (S:LHN), and Ahold-Delhaize (AS:AD).
Sauerbronn said that battered tobacco stocks also looked attractive now and that he was increasing exposure to the sector.
One feature of value stocks is that their valuations have generally fallen below historical averages, whereas growth stocks trade above in a gap that has been widening ever since 2008. Easy monetary policies and the growing success of passive investing has just amplified this spread. 
Among miners, Anglo American, for example, is traded at around 0.5 times its cash flow, against a historical average of nearly 0.7 times, while peer  Glencore  (L:GLEN) is traded at 0.5 times vs more than 0.7 times. 
In banks, Italian lender UniCredit (MI:CRDI) prices at around 0.5 times its book value, a 28 percent discount to euro zone banks, while French cement maker Lafarge  Holcim  is trading at its lowest PE multiple since 2011 and builder Saint Gobain (PA:SGOB) at its lowest in nearly a decade. 
""Today there is very apparent value staring you in the face in certain parts of the market. Does that mean that those stocks go up tomorrow? Probably not,"" said Mark Breedon, who manages a 1.8 billion fund of global equities for Investec in Hong Kong.
""The question is getting the timing right. What you need is to start seeing those companies beating expectations or getting some technical momentum behind them as you never want to try catching a falling knife,"" he added.
According to Breedon, the most interesting opportunities can be found outside the main benchmarks, whose constituents have been lifted indiscriminately by the big flows provided by passive investing. Most stocks with a market cap above $1 billion are traded outside the dominant benchmarks, he said.
GRAPHIC: Growth vs Value over 10 years - https://tmsnrt.rs/2QuNDuU
START OF A TREND?
Even though it is too early to call the start of the trend in favor of value stocks, this market segment is increasingly becoming a hunting ground for investors.
Chris Hiorns, portfolio manager of the EdenTree Amity European Fund with just under 100 million pounds in assets under management and a long-time value bull, believes the recent shift in the market has been a move away from growth rather than a reallocation into value.
Hiorns still sees chances for further outperformance and has recently increased exposure to cheaply valued stocks such as tiremaker  Michelin  (PA:MICP), construction company Saint Gobain (PA:SGOB), staffing firm  Randstad  (AS:RAND), as well as banks ING (AS:INGA) and Santander (MC:SAN).

""The market is still very growth-oriented, but there's lots of capacity for value to outperform this year and into next year,"" he said. ""Value bias is the place to be at the moment.""

1164,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2018 11:50AM ET</span>","U.S. bankers say lower ag income pressures farm finances: Kansas City, St. Louis Fed Banks","By P.J. Huffstutter
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Farm incomes and agrarian credit conditions continued to erode in the third quarter of 2018, as economic pressure from the U.S.-China trade war has bankers seeing loan repayment rates fall, according to separate reports released on Thursday by the Federal Reserve Banks of Kansas City and St. Louis.
Expectations for farm income and loan repayment rates were particularly low for areas and operations more concentrated in soybean, corn, hog and dairy production as uncertainties surrounding trade continued, according to the banks' latest reports on the agricultural economy.
The Kansas City Fed surveyed bankers for its report in the Tenth Federal Reserve District, which includes all or parts of Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Wyoming. The St. Louis Fed surveyed bankers in the Eighth Federal Reserve District, which includes all or parts of Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee. 
Alongside lower loan repayment rates, farmers' working capital deteriorated moderately while bankers' loan portfolios in crop-producing states showed slightly higher levels of risk, the reports found.
Although farmland values remained stable - or improved slightly in some areas - increasing stress in the farm sector could put downward pressure on farm real estate values moving forward, according to bankers.
One key concern for bankers: How much farmland could come up for sale within the coming months, and whether that could negatively impact prices.
Nearly 85 percent of bankers surveyed by the Kansas City Fed reported that farm borrowers plan to sell mid- to long-term assets before year’s end to improve working capital or make loan payments, up from about 75 percent a year ago.
More than 80 percent of responding bankers in Missouri and 60 percent of bankers in Nebraska reported lower income - states where the halt of soybean exports due to the U.S.-China trade war is being felt keenly: Soybeans there comprise 27 and 15 percent of farm revenues, respectively, according to the report.

1166,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2018 11:33AM ET</span>",Explainer: Unraveling the Boeing 737 MAX Lion Air crash,"By Jamie Freed and Tim Hepher
(Reuters) - The crash of a Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737 MAX jet in Indonesia on Oct. 29 has raised questions on whether the manufacturer shared enough information with regulators, airlines and pilots about the systems on the latest version of its popular narrow-body plane.
The jet operated by budget carrier Lion Air crashed into the Java Sea shortly after take-off from Jakarta, killing all 189 people on board.
WHAT IS NEW ON THE 737 MAX?
The most hyped features of the 737 MAX compared with its predecessor, the 737NG, are more fuel-efficient engines. 
But as a result of the larger engines, which are placed higher and further forward of the wing, the jet's balance changed. To address that, Boeing put in place more anti-stall protections, Leeham Co analyst Bjorn Fehrm said in an online post.
An automated protection system called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) kicks in when the angle of attack is too high, when the plane's nose is too elevated, threatening a stall.
WHAT IS 'ANGLE OF ATTACK'?
On paper, it measures the angle between the air flow and the wing. But it is so fundamental to flight that historians say the only instrument on the Wright Brothers' first aircraft was a piece of yarn designed to measure it. (https:// If the angle of attack is too high, the airflow over the wing is disturbed, throwing the plane into an aerodynamic stall. One of two angle of attack sensors on the Lion Air jet was faulty, according to Indonesian investigators. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) last week warned airlines that erroneous inputs from those sensors could lead the jet automatically to pitch its nose down even when autopilot is turned off, making it difficult for pilots to control. WHICH AIRLINES OPERATE THE 737 MAX? Boeing has delivered 241 of the jets to customers since it entered service last year, according to its website. Major operators include Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), American Airlines, Norwegian, Lion Air, Air Canada, China Southern (NYSE:SO), China Eastern and flydubai. Another 4,542 have been ordered but not yet delivered. WHAT DID AIRLINES AND PILOTS KNOW ABOUT THE SYSTEM? Lion Air's flight manual did not contain information about the new anti-stall system, according to investigators and an airplane flight manual seen by Reuters. U.S. pilots were also not made aware in training courses, pilot unions say.  American Airlines said it was ""unaware"" of some of the functionality of the MCAS system. [L4N1XQ23Q] Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg told Fox Business Network on Tuesday that Boeing provides ""all of the information that's needed to safely fly our airplanes"". HOW WOULD A PILOT SHUT OFF THE SYSTEM? Pilots can stop the automated response by pressing two buttons if the system behaves unexpectedly, the FAA says. That action is set out in a checklist used by Lion Air pilots for in-air troubleshooting, an instructor said. It is also required to be committed to memory by pilots. Pilots on a flight from Jakarta to Bali the day before the crash experienced a similar sensor issue but managed to land safely by turning off the system, the New York Times reported. HOW WAS THE SYSTEM APPROVED? The FAA holds the main responsibility for certifying Boeing jets and training programs for pilots, but local regulators also issue approvals for airlines based in their countries. An unresolved question is how Boeing measured the system's reliability and on what basis the FAA certified it as safe. HOW ARE PILOTS TRAINED? An FAA document on training requirements for 737 MAX pilots transitioning from the older 737NG, available online (https:// has no reference to the new anti-stall system. Lion Air says it followed a training regime approved by U.S. and European regulators. The training was restricted to three hours of computer-based training and a familiarization flight. However, Brazil's regulator told Reuters that it had required specific training for pilots on the anti-stall system. WHAT HAS CHANGED SINCE THE CRASH? Boeing last week issued a bulletin to airlines reiterating existing procedures and advising them to add information on the anti-stall system to flight manuals, which was quickly followed by an FAA directive making that mandatory. The FAA and Boeing are studying the need for software changes, as well as revisions to training and operating procedures on the 737 MAX, the regulator said. WHEN WILL THE FIRST REPORT ON THE CRASH BE RELEASED?  
A preliminary report will be released on Nov. 28 or 29, according to Indonesian investigators. However, divers have yet to locate the airline's cockpit voice recorder, which would shed light on pilot interactions that are important for gaining a fuller picture of the circumstances of the crash.

LONDON (Reuters) - Business leaders expressed alarm on Thursday as a draft Brexit agreement seen as the only chance of preserving some stability in UK-EU trading relations threatened to unravel, sending stock prices and the pound plunging.
Just 12 hours after British Prime Minister Theresa May announced that her cabinet had agreed to the terms of the draft agreement, Brexit minister Dominic Raab and work and pensions minister Esther McVey quit, saying they could not support it.
Their departures and those of other, junior ministers, revived the specter for business of Britain leaving the European Union without a deal next March, and sent shares in British housebuilders, retailers and banks tumbling. 
""The situation this morning saps the confidence of the City and the country,"" said Martin Sorrell, ex-CEO and founder of ad agency group WPP (L:WPP) and one of Britain's best-known businessmen. 
The European Union is Britain's biggest trading partner, accounting for 44 percent of UK exports and 53 percent of imports to the UK. 
After 45 years of membership, industries including defense, cars and aerospace have created intricate supply chains that rely on smooth, ""just-in-time"" delivery of thousands of parts across the sea that divides Britain from the continent.
Business leaders fear that the country could stumble toward a no-deal Brexit where border checks block ports and fracture the supply chains that support the likes of Rolls-Royce (L:RR) and BAE Systems (L:BAES) .
'ONLY DEAL IN TOWN'
A senior executive at one of Britain's biggest banks said this was the most disastrous government he had ever seen.
""The rest of the world is looking at us and laughing. When I travel everyone wonders whether we have gone completely mad,"" he said.
""It is time to have some stability so business can get some certainty. This is what the country needs.""
Industry bosses who had been briefed on the draft agreement by ministers late on Wednesday had broadly welcomed it as the best chance of a compromise that would secure a transition period and avert the chaos of no deal at all.
May's office also released statements from a number of major companies such as  Diageo  (L:DGE), the  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE) and  Royal Mail  (L:RMG) welcoming the draft deal. 
""Most business people ultimately are pragmatists and this is about playing the cards we have been dealt rather than wishing for a better hand,"" Roger Carr, chairman of BAE Systems, told BBC Radio on Thursday morning.
Iain Anderson, executive chairman of public affairs firm Cicero, which represents many finance companies, said although most executives did not like May's deal they realized it was now the only game in town. 
""Business is watching with horror the resignations now taking place,"" he said. ""Yesterday we had a plan and stability and today we do not. 
""There is now no time to negotiate another deal. We thought we had stability - now we have instability writ large,"" he said. 
The UK chief of German industrial group  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn), which employs 15,000 people in the UK, reiterated his call to get behind the draft agreement even as senior politicians called for May to quit.
""We hope all sides keep calm, look at the facts, and move to support this draft to provide UK business with greater certainty,"" Juergen Maier said in an emailed statement.
Even if May survives, her chances of winning a vote in parliament to approve the draft agreement are seen as slim.
MARKET JITTERS
One senior executive at a FTSE 100 company was still holding out hope however that lawmakers would eventually be persuaded to vote for the deal when it comes before parliament before the end of the year. 
""We're going to need the market to throw up and scare them all into voting for it,"" he said. The pound was down 1.5 percent against the dollar in afternoon trading. 
Lawmakers across the political spectrum have said May's deal will leave Britain bound by EU rules without having any say. Many have argued it will also damage the integrity of the United Kingdom by aligning Northern Ireland with the rest of the EU in order to avoid a hard border with EU-member Ireland. 
The CEO of French outdoor advertising company JCDecaux (PA:JCDX), which runs London's bus-shelter advertising and makes 10 percent of its sales in Britain, called the situation ""obviously very serious"".

""Today's events reinforce the uncertainties in the market,"" Jean-Charles Decaux told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of an industry conference in Barcelona.

1179,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2018 10:27AM ET</span>","Third Point gains ISS, Glass Lewis support in Campbell proxy fight","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shareholder advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis backed a push by Daniel Loeb's hedge fund to make changes at  Campbell Soup  Co (N:CPB), including replacing some board members.
ISS recommended that investors elect all five of Loeb's Third Point LLC board nominees, giving a boost to the activist firm, which is fighting a high profile proxy battle with the company.
""The dissident slate seems well qualified to contribute to the company's turnaround by providing relevant industry expertise, fresh ideas, and a greater sense of urgency,"" ISS said in a report, adding ""As such, votes FOR all dissident nominees are warranted.""
Days ago Loeb backed off his call to replace the entire 12-person Campbell board. Investors are expected to vote on directors at the Nov. 29 annual meeting. ISS is generally seen as being reluctant to recommend ousting all board members.
In its report, ISS backed former Blue Buffalo CEO Kurt Schmidt and former Hostess Brands Inc CEO William Toler as well as ComScore Inc president Sarah Hofstetter and former Uber Technologies executive Bozoma Saint John. It also recommended support for Third Point partner Munib Islam.
However, Glass Lewis was not as whole-hearted in its support of Third point, recommending only three of its nominees.
""We believe shareholders would be best served by supporting changes to the board intended specifically to increase the number of directors who have applicable, recent operating and branding experience in the packaged food industry,"" Glass Lewis said.
The firm added that the appointment of a Third Point representative to Campbell's board would not be warranted at this time. 
Third Point has said its nominees can provide operational, marketing and branding as well as financial expertise to help turn around Campbell's lagging stock performance. The company has been hurt by falling soup sales plus its fast paced acquisitions spree. In August, it announced plans to sell its fresh foods and international units.
Campbell responded to the ISS and Glass Lewis reports by urging shareholders to support its full slate and said again that it had offered to expand the board to include two Third Point nominees, Schmidt and Hofstetter. It again voiced its objection to having a Third Point employee on its board.
Third Point said in a statement that the findings of the two advisory firms conveyed a clear message to shareholders ... ""the time has come to refresh the recipe in Campbell’s boardroom.""
ISS said Campbell's underperforming total stock return and weak fundamentals are linked to its acquisition strategy and poor execution on mergers as well as a lack of focus on its core business.
""In light of these factors, the dissident has presented a compelling case that change at the board level is warranted,"" the report said.
Third Point owns roughly 7 percent of Campbell's stock and it has allied with George Strawbridge, a descendant of John Dorrance who invented condensed soup and ran the company about a century ago. Three Dorrance heirs currently serve on the Campbell board and they plus another family member control roughly 40 percent of the shares, making Loeb's proxy contest all the more difficult.
At the outset, Loeb was pushing for a sale of the company but later backed away from that and more recently recommended splitting the company to make it more attractive to potential buyers. It also warned the company against hastily hiring a new chief executive during the proxy contest.
The company had criticized the hedge fund for not having a concrete plan to turn around the company. 

ISS said it may make more sense for the company to improve its operations instead of pursuing a sale right now. ""The dissident's seemingly premature focus on a sale may have caused some investors to worry that a dissident-controlled board might not thoroughly explore all strategic options,"" the report said.

1180,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2018 10:27AM ET</span>",Strong U.S. economy boosts Walmart's third-quarter sales,"By Nandita Bose
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walmart Inc (N:WMT) reported higher-than-expected quarterly U.S. comparable sales on Thursday and raised its full year outlook as a strong economy boosted customer store visits and e-commerce purchases grew as it sold more groceries online.
The retailer's profits, however, continued to be under pressure. Margins were impacted as Walmart absorbed higher transportation costs and invested heavily in its online business.
Walmart's shares, which traded up premarket and opened higher, reversed course in early trade. Shares were down 1.04 percent at $100.47 per share as investors were spooked by poor performance from J.C. Penney (N:JCP) and Dillard's Inc (N:DDS), turning bearish on retail stocks, analysts said.
Strong consumer spending has helped many brick-and-mortar retailers post solid sales gains this quarter, ahead of the key U.S. holiday season even as e-commerce investments have gnawed away profits.
""Fresh (food) continues to do very well but there is strength across the board from a category standpoint,"" Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs told Reuters in an interview. 
Grocery sales make up 56 percent of Walmart's revenue, and at its investor day last month Walmart's Chief Executive Doug McMillon emphasized Walmart's advantage in the food category, an area that rival Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) is trying to crack, particularly following its acquisition last year of organic grocer Whole Foods. McMillon said Walmart can offer fresh food within 10 miles of 90 percent of the U.S. population.
The company has expanded its grocery pickup program, which allows customers to order online and pickup at 2,100 of its U.S. stores. Walmart will also add grocery delivery services to about 800 stores by the end of the year, the retailer's U.S. CEO Greg Foran said.
Walmart will overtake Apple Inc (O:AAPL) as the third largest e-commerce retailer by sales this year, behind Amazon and eBay Inc (O:EBAY), according to data released Thursday by market research firm eMarketer. Walmart is expected to grab 4 percent of U.S. e-commerce sales, or about $20.9 billion, up from 3.3 percent last year, eMarketer said. 
Walmart's sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 3.4 percent in the third quarter, excluding fuel price fluctuations, higher than analysts' estimates of a 2.87 percent increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Walmart has recorded over four straight years of U.S. growth, unmatched by any other retailer. 
E-commerce sales soared 43 percent, topping the 40-percent growth in the previous quarter. The retailer has said it is on track for e-commerce sales to rise by 40 percent this year.
The retailer has also been on an acquisition spree, buying brands aimed at millennial shoppers who typically don't shop on the retailer's website. Walmart recently bought lingerie retailer Bare Necessities after purchasing plus-sized clothing startup Eloquii a week earlier.
The company's e-commerce business is expected to post a slightly greater operating loss next year, the retailer said during investor day.
Walmart's international sales grew 1.6 percent to $30 billion excluding currency impact. In India, one of its key overseas markets, Walmart suffered a setback on Tuesday when the chief executive officer of its Indian e-commerce business Flipkart Group, resigned following an allegation of sexual assault. 
Walmart paid $16 billion for a roughly 77-percent stake in Flipkart in May, its biggest acquisition and a major move in competing against Amazon.
Walmart's quarterly total revenue increased 2.4 percent to $126.1 billion, excluding currency changes, beating analysts' estimates of $125.56 billion.
Adjusted earnings came to $1.08 per share, above expectations of $1.01. Consolidated net income attributable to Walmart for the third quarter stood at $1.71 billion versus $1.75 billion a year ago.

Walmart raised its adjusted earnings outlook for fiscal year 2019 to $4.75 to $4.85 per share from $4.65 to $4.80. It also said it expects comparable sales, excluding fuel, to grow ""at least"" 3 percent, a change from ""about"" 3 percent earlier in fiscal 2019.

LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling tumbled and the rest of Europe's share markets groaned on Thursday after a long-awaited Brexit agreement was thrown into chaos as Britain's chief negotiator for the deal quit just hours after it had been unveiled.
Up until that point markets had looked relatively calm. Asia had cheered news that China and the United States were back in contact about their trade dispute, and oil was inching up again having halted a record losing streak.
But then came the hammer blow with Brexit minister Dominic Raab quitting in protest at Prime Minister Theresa May's deal for leaving the European Union. 
""No democratic nation has ever signed up to be bound by such an extensive regime, imposed externally without any democratic control over the laws to be applied, nor the ability to decide to exit the arrangement,"" he said in his resignation letter. 
Cue a sterling meltdown. The currency slumped a full 2 cents to $1.2750  and though that made the FTSE stronger -- a weaker pound makes life easier for exporters on the index -- big UK banks (L:RBS) the rest of Europe sank swiftly into the red. (EU)
""The reaction is sterling shows that the chance of no Brexit deal has spiked,"" said Tim Graf, Head of Macro Strategy for EMEA at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Markets. 
""It also introduces thoughts of a leadership challenge (for British Prime Minister Theresa May) which seems likely now.""
The turmoil also boosted demand for safe-haven German government bonds. Ten-year yields on what is regarded as one of the safest assets in the world, fell over three basis points to 0.36 percent (DE10YT=RR) -- its lowest in over two weeks. 
UK government bonds saw a rush of demand too with the reflex dive for cover and the sight of state owned bank RBS stocks down almost 9 percent, drove the biggest fall in 5-year yields since just after the June 2016 Brexit vote.
EU leaders had said they would meet on Nov. 25 to endorse the divorce deal, but May now faces the much more perilous struggle of getting parliament to approve what was agreed.
""We are basically trading the headlines."" said Ned Rumpeltin European Head of Currency Strategy at TD Securities in London. ""I think a leadership challenge is imminent."" 
OIL SIMMERS
Investors were also starting to look ahead to U.S. trading where futures were pointing to a modestly higher start as forecast topping earnings from Walmart (NYSE:WMT) provided a welcome appetizer ahead of U.S. retail sales later. (N)
In the commodity markets, where Brexit may be a sideshow but turbulence is still acute after a 12-day losing streak was set this week, the mood was much calmer.
U.S. oil futures (CLc1) steadied at $56.35 a barrel, after a slight bounce overnight. Brent (LCOc1) was up 0.4 percent at $66.42. 
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) had also ended up 0.8 percent having fallen the previous day as the sharp slide in oil prices had heightened anxiety about the global growth outlook.
Shanghai Composite Index (SSEC) gained 0.9 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng (HSI) rose 0.8 percent on the China-U.S. communications, while Australian stocks (AXJO) inched up 0.05 percent and Japan's Nikkei (N225) shed 0.2 percent.
""While it's difficult to pin-point a specific event for the risk-off move, recent themes appear to be keeping markets cautious include oil's recent plummet, Apple's fall, U.S. political gridlock, China's slowing growth, tightening liquidity, a hawkish Fed, earnings peak, Italian jitters, and Brexit uncertainty,"" wrote economists at ANZ.
The S&P 500 (SPX) had fallen for a fifth straight day overnight too, with financial stocks hit by fears of tighter regulations once the Democratic Party takes control of the House of Representatives. (N)
U.S. equities have also been pressured by concerns that earnings growth might be peaking, trade tensions and a slowing global economy - factors that had triggered a rout in riskier assets in October.
""If U.S. stocks are to bounce back, economic indicators will be key,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior forex strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.

""Focus will be on today's U.S. retail sales data, which will provide a view of how private consumption -the main component of economic growth- is faring."" U.S. retail sales for October will be released at 1330 GMT.

1210,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 15, 2018 08:40AM ET</span>",Irish Stocks Pummeled as Concern Mounts for May's Brexit Deal,"(Bloomberg) -- Irish stocks slumped the most in western Europe on Thursday amid mounting concern that the U.K. could crash out of the European Union without a deal.
While U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May has sealed an accord with the EU on the terms of Britain’s departure from the bloc, opposition in Westminster is growing with two Cabinet ministers quitting on Thursday. The benchmark ISEQ fell 2.2 percent at 12:15 p.m. in Dublin, with Ryanair Holdings Plc and Bank of Ireland Group Plc each down about 5 percent.
“The challenge of getting the deal passed through Cabinet was one thing, but getting a majority vote in Parliament is a different beast, as the numbers seemingly don’t add up to have the deal voted through,” Alexander Wilson, an analyst at Goodbody Stockbrokers in Dublin, wrote in a note. 
Ireland is considered the European economy most vulnerable to Brexit, with about 15 percent of exports going to the U.K. This week, Irish insulation maker Kingspan Group Plc said it’s monitoring a “general sense of nervousness prevailing globally.” As well as concerns over the health of the British economy, sterling weakness hurts Irish companies, which make a large chunk of their earnings in pounds.
Sterling tumbled after Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and fellow U.K. minister Esther McVey announced their resignations, with the pound falling 1.2 percent to $1.2832, the weakest in more than two weeks.
The ISEQ’s biggest percentage faller was unrelated to Brexit concerns. Minnow Great Western Mining Corp. Plc slid 33 percent and has lost almost two thirds of its value since saying on Wednesday that it is suspending drilling in Mineral County, Nevada, until next spring due to freezing weather."

But ever since hitting record highs early in the year, several equity indexes have been undermined by a poisonous cocktail of rising interest rates, trade tensions, and currency crises in emerging markets. 
In fact, the bull has turned into a bear in several places: a growing number of equity indexes across the globe have slipped into 'bear' territory – commonly defined as a price drop of 20 percent or more from their highest levels in 52 weeks.

The share of bears by index is catching up all over the world too – from West to East, from developed to emerging markets. Korea's KOSPI Composite index (KS11) - considered by some to be a bellwether for the global economy - recently dipped past the bear market threshold.

Penney Co Inc (N:JCP) cut its forecast for annual sales on Thursday while also withdrawing its outlook for full-year earnings, adding to nerves over the future of another one of America's best known retail names.
Shares in the company dropped nearly 12 percent to $1.10 in premarket trade after the department store chain's same-store sales in the third quarter fell well short of Wall Street estimates.
J.C. Penney has for years struggled to excite consumers with its mid-priced range of apparel as they increasingly prefer fast-fashion brands and shop online.
The Plano, Texas-based company said sales at stores open for at least 12 months fell 5.4 percent in the three months ended Nov. 3. Wall Street analysts on average had expected a 0.61 percent decline, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
""While restoring JCPenney to sustained profitable growth will be a lengthy process, I understand the need for quick action,"" said Jill Soltau, the retailer's newly appointed chief executive officer.
The company now expects comparable-store sales for fiscal 2018 to fall in the low single digits, compacted with an earlier projection of sales being unchanged year-over-year.

1216,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2018 07:30AM ET</span>",Former UBS trader jailed for Britain's biggest fraud deported,"LONDON (Reuters) - Kweku Adoboli, a former UBS trader jailed for Britain's biggest fraud over unauthorized trades that cost the Swiss bank $2.3 billion, has been deported to Ghana, his spokesman said.
Adoboli was put on a commercial flight from Heathrow on Wednesday after being detained in Scotland earlier in the week, the spokesman said.
Adoboli's case made global headlines when he was arrested in 2011 and tried in 2012 over the huge losses to UBS, caused by trades far in excess of his authorized risk limits which he had pretended to hedge by booking fictitious off-setting trades.
A Ghanaian national who has lived in Britain since he was 12, Adoboli, now 38, was released from prison on probation in 2015 after serving half of a seven-year sentence.
A spokesman for the interior ministry declined to comment directly on Adoboli's case, but said: ""All foreign nationals who are given a custodial sentence will be considered for deportation."" 
Adoboli has been living in Scotland with his two godsons and their parents, and had garnered support from locals and lawmakers for his bid to stay.
Born in Ghana in 1980, Adoboli moved to Jerusalem with his family in 1984 when his father, a United Nations official, was posted there. The family later moved to Syria, and Adoboli never lived in Ghana again apart from during a short stint when the family had to leave Damascus because of the first Gulf War.

In 1992, aged 12, he was sent to a Quaker boarding school in Yorkshire, northern England. He has lived in Britain ever since.

1218,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2018 07:27AM ET</span>","Ready, set, shop: More than a third of Americans to buy on Black Friday: poll","(Reuters) - About 38 percent of American consumers plan to shop on Black Friday this year, and six in 10 of those shoppers anticipate making at least half of their holiday purchases on that day, a Reuters/Ipsos poll showed on Thursday.
The day after Thanksgiving, which this year falls on Nov. 23, has been regarded as the traditional start of the holiday shopping season although deals and promotions are being unveiled earlier every year. 
Fifty-nine percent of the people who plan to shop Black Friday deals intend to finish at least half of their holiday shopping that day, the Nov. 7-13 poll showed. 
The poll showed 37 percent of consumers intend to do their shopping primarily or totally online, while 16 percent expect to shop primarily or totally in a physical store. 
""I'm doing all of my Black Friday shopping online because I don't want to get killed!"" Joseph Adetayo, 71, of Upper Marlboro, Maryland joked about the crush of shoppers who have historically flooded stores in search of bargains. 
""The crowds are too crazy, and this (shopping online) just makes my life easier,"" said Adetayo, one of the 1,819 people who responded to the poll. 
The retired computer programer has eight grandchildren, four children and a wife. He said that, as his family grows, he will spend more Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc's  websites for toys, electronics and clothes and at  Nike  (NYSE:NKE).com and Payless.com for shoes. He has a budget of $1,200, up from $900 last year. 
Free delivery is the biggest draw for online shopping, followed by coupons and door-buster deals, the poll showed. 
American consumers are less interested in buying clothing, jewelry, electronics, toys and gift cards this year compared to years past, the survey found. 
But they are eager to spend more on food. Retailers including Walmart,  Target  Corp (N:TGT), Kroger (N:KR) and Amazon have been spending heavily to get consumers to buy more groceries online.
By 2022, online grocery shopping could be a $100 billion industry, and as many as 70 percent of consumers could be doing a portion of their food shopping online, according to a report co-authored by the Food Marketing Institute and Nielsen. 

The Reuters/Ipsos poll surveyed 1,819 adults with a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 3 percentage points for the entire group and 4 points for Black Friday shoppers.

1221,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2018 06:32AM ET</span>",Swiss watchdog investigates banks over alleged payments system boycott,"By John Miller and Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi
ZURICH (Reuters) - Switzerland's competition watchdog has raided the offices of financial companies, including  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) and UBS (S:UBSG), to investigate a suspected boycott of mobile payment solutions such as Apple Pay (O:AAPL) and Samsung Pay (KS:005930).
The competition authority said it was investigating whether the banks, including state-owned PostFinance, colluded with local payments providers not to use the mobile payment systems of the big tech companies.
""There is the suspicion that the companies agreed not to make their credit cards available for use with Apple Pay and Samsung Pay, in order to favor the Swiss solution TWINT,"" Competition Commission WEKO said in a statement on Thursday.
Some of the companies targeted in the probe said the regulator's accusations were without merit.
""We are surprised about this investigation and are convinced that the allegations will prove to be unfounded,"" Credit Suisse said in a statement.
Credit Suisse said it offers Swiss consumers access to Apple Pay and Samsung Pay through its 50 percent subsidiary Swisscard and has also been in talks with Apple, Samsung and Google (O:GOOGL) over how their solutions can be used.
UBS acknowledged the investigation and said it had tried to reach an agreement with Apple Pay over use of the Swiss bank's credit cards as early as 2016, but had not managed to come to an understanding with the company.
""Although we offered a number of alternative solutions, unfortunately we weren't able to reach an agreement with Apple Pay to cooperate,"" a UBS spokeswoman said.
Postfinance, part of Switzerland's postal service and one of the country's largest banks, also said it did not breach Swiss cartel law and said it was cooperating with the WEKO probe.
TWINT AG, a joint venture between Switzerland's biggest banks to create a digital payments system, said it was ""astonished"" by the competition commission's approach.
TWINT said its offices were raided by the watchdog even though it is not under investigation. TWINT also said it had previously submitted a complaint against Apple over unfair competitive practices. 
""TWINT itself asked the (Competition Commission) some time ago to investigate discriminatory behavior by Apple toward TWINT, because Apple prevents the trouble-free use of the TWINT app on IOS devices,"" it said. ""A decision of the WEKO in this matter is expected shortly.""
An Apple spokesman in Switzerland could not immediately be reached for comment on the TWINT allegations.
Disputes between mobile payment systems and banks have cropped up elsewhere too. 
Last year, a decision by Australia's competition watchdog stopped the country's banks from collectively trying to introduce their own mobile applications for contactless payments on Apple's phones and watches. [https://reut.rs/2TcUGdn]
Apple Pay entered Switzerland in 2016 as the first major rival to TWINT, which was launched in the same year but has not yet made big inroads into Switzerland's payments market.
TWINT in April said mobile payments in Switzerland had yet to gain traction the way they had in other countries, with just an estimated 0.2 percent of all payments occurring over smartphone in the country.
It said it had reached 750,000 users as of April 2018, a step down from the one million it had been targeting by end-2017.
The competition watchdog said its investigation included Aduno Holding, PostFinance, Swisscard AECS GmbH and Swiss units of Credit Suisse and UBS.

Aduno confirmed that its offices in Zurich were searched by Swiss authorities and said it was cooperating with the investigation. It declined further comment.

Liberty is looking to divest assets where it does not see a profitable way into mobile markets. It has sold its Austrian unit to Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn), while the $21.8 billion sale of its operations in Germany and Central Europe to  Vodafone  (L:VOD) is being reviewed by regulators.
In Switzerland, there has been persistent speculation that UPC would merge with Sunrise Communications (S:SRCG), whose German anchor investor  Freenet  (DE:FNTGn) has said it is also open to offers to sell its stake.
""We're not desperate, that's really important,"" Bracken said at the  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Technology, Media and Telecoms Conference in Barcelona.
Bracken saw the opportunity for strategic rationalization on the Swiss market but in the meantime UPC was reinvesting capital to strengthen its Swiss video content offering, which has been identified as a weakness.
UPC also ran a virtual mobile network in Switzerland, meaning it could compete as a converged fixed-to-mobile player.
""It’s not like we have to do a deal on any terms,"" he said. ""We’re ready to stand alone if we have to, and can stand alone.""
More broadly, Liberty, founded by U.S. investor John Malone, isn't in takeover mode. The multiple on offer in the Vodafone deal, at 12 times enterprise value, was such that it was better to take the money off the table and put it to work elsewhere, said Bracken.

""We feel strategically complete, there are no acquisitions that we need to do,"" said Bracken. He said Liberty was comfortable with continuing to run leverage of four to five times, but may tend towards the lower end of that range in future.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Companies should set up portable accounts to pay for life-long learning to help workers upgrade their skills and remain employable as robots take over more jobs,  Adecco  Group (S:ADEN) Chief Executive Alain Dehaze said. 
As increasing automation eliminates many roles, government and the private sector should work together to fill skills gaps, while workers must become more flexible, the head of the world's largest staffing services company told Reuters in an interview.
""If they don't quickly reform their education system, countries will create a time bomb,"" said Dehaze. ""They won't have the correct talent any more and companies will move away.""
The 55-year-old Belgian who has led Switzerland-based Adecco Group since 2015 said its customers - employers who take on temporary and permanent staff - want more flexible and more skilled workers.
""Digital skill shortages are one of the biggest problems for many of our clients. In Europe alone there will be 900,000 unfilled vacancies by 2020 due to a lack of digital skills,"" Dehaze said, citing a European Commission study.
Companies and workers must improve training to fill these gaps, he said, especially as every four years people effectively lose 30 percent of their technical skills because the environment is changing so rapidly.
Employers could either lay off existing workers and recruit new staff - an expensive exercise - or retrain them. Cutting a job can cost roughly $100,000 in Switzerland, three times more than retraining, he said.
""Our current system comes from the time of the industrial revolution and is based on permanent work contracts,"" Dehaze said at the company's Zurich headquarters. 
""But the era of life-long jobs will soon be over. Society needs a new social contract.""
OFFICE CLERKS, FOOD WORKERS BEWARE
Up to 375 million employees globally may need to change their work category by 2030, according to a study by consultancy McKinsey & Co. 
Areas like office administration and food preparation will be among the hardest hit by the rise in automation, as robots and artificial intelligence programs take over repetitive tasks.
Against this backdrop, Adecco Group - which competes with  Randstad  (AS:RAND) and ManpowerGroup (N:MAN) - has invested in training, buying General Assembly for $412.5 million this year. 
To simplify career-long training, portable accounts, dubbed ""life-long learning accounts"", could be created, Dehaze said.
Employees and companies would pay into the accounts and when they change jobs, employees could take the accumulated capital with them. If they need further training they could activate the account to pay for it. 
Dehaze has discussed the idea with government officials in France, Italy and Singapore, an Adecco spokeswoman said. Employees could be given tax incentives to pay into the scheme, the spokeswoman said.
Individual training will be particularly important as freelance workers make up an increasing portion of the workforce in the so-called gig economy, as shown by ride-hailing company Uber.
Manual workers like plumbers and electricians will still be needed, and those with broader training have the best chances, he said, adding fears about jobs completely disappearing are too pessimistic.
He cited the United States, where the proportion of people working in agriculture has fallen to around 2 percent from 40 percent in 1902 even while U.S. unemployment hits its lowest level since the late 1960s.

""The main concern is not that we will have no or too little work, it is about quickly finding or developing the right skills when old job profiles disappear,"" Dehaze said.

1226,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2018 06:05AM ET</span>",How U.S. seniors on Medicare can bridge the gap in dental insurance,"By Mark Miller
CHICAGO (Reuters) - During a recent visit to my dentist, we got talking about his frustrations with Medicare. “It’s amazing - they have managed to eliminate teeth from the human body.”
Here is what he meant: traditional Medicare does not cover most dental care. This comes as a surprise to many people at the point of retirement. Studies have shown that more than half of workers aged 50-64 are unaware that Medicare does not cover preventive dental care or more expensive and complex procedures.
But dental care is a critical part of overall good preventive healthcare. Research shows clear links between poor oral health and chronic disease such as diabetes, as well as pain, chronic infection and reduced quality of life. 
Many seniors simply pay for dental care out of pocket - the average out-of-pocket expense among Medicare enrollees who needed dental care in 2016 was $607, according to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, a research arm of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
But expense can run much higher if you need a crown, bridge or root canal, for example.
With Medicare fall enrollment season in full swing (https://reut.rs/2yj24dB), this is a good time to consider your dental options.
Traditional Medicare will pay for dental care only in very limited circumstances - it must be deemed necessary as part of a covered procedure, for example a tooth extraction needed in preparation for radiation treatment. But many Medicare Advantage plans - the managed-care alternative to traditional Medicare offered by private insurance companies - do include some dental coverage.
Advantage plans usually include prescription-drug coverage, and cap out-of-pocket expenses. But they often include some level of coverage for vision and hearing care - and 63 percent of Advantage enrollees had access to dental coverage in 2017 according to Avalere Health. Among the Advantage beneficiaries with dental benefits, more than half were covered for x-rays, oral exams and cleaning; a smaller number were covered for restorative procedures.
Many of the Advantage plans that cover dental work require no copayments for preventive services, Avalere data shows, but cost-sharing rises sharply for surgery, restorative services and periodontal procedures.
And they usually cap annual benefit payments at $1,000 to $1,500, notes Beth Truett, chief executive officer of Oral Health America, a nonprofit group that advocates for better dental health. “The coverage in Advantage plans typically mirrors many of the lower-reimbursed plans that cover people while they are working,” she said. 
On average only 5 percent of patients hit these maximums in any given year, according to Evelyn Ireland, executive director of the National Association of Dental Plans. But if you do, the prices negotiated by insurers with providers in your plan network can bring down out-of-pocket expenses, she notes. “In the dental PPOs, the prices can be as much as 30 to 40 percent below the actual fees,” she said. For example, the plan-negotiated rate for a crown might bring the price down from $1,200 to $800, she said.
COVERAGE OPTIONS
For traditional Medicare enrollees, individual dental plans offer another way to get covered. For example, in Illinois a Delta Dental PPO offered through AARP for $72 per month will cover most preventive services; it has a $50 annual deductible and an annual cap on benefits of $1,500.
And some providers of Medigap supplemental policies - for costs not covered by original Medicare - offer add-on options for dental and vision care, or discount programs to help customers save money on out-of-pocket costs.
Low-income seniors lacking the resources to pay for care out of pocket or to buy commercial insurance face the most limited options. Medicaid is an important source of dental coverage for low-income elderly and disabled people who also are enrolled in Medicare (so-called dual-eligibles).
Federal law does not require states to cover adults through Medicaid, but most states have some level of adult dental benefit, Ireland said. And the expansion of Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act has more than doubled the number of adults covered by Medicaid, to 65 million in 2017, she notes.
PUSHING FOR REFORM
U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has proposed adding a dental benefit to Medicare Part B as part of his ""Medicare for All"" legislative proposal. The American Dental Association has estimated that integrating a comprehensive dental benefit into Part B - applying the program’s existing cost-sharing rules - would cost the federal government $32.3 billion (2018 dollars); the base premium paid by enrollees would need to increase by $14.50 per month.
Ireland doubts that a comprehensive dental benefit will be added anytime soon. Her group is part of a coalition lobbying Medicare to expand coverage of medically necessary dental care, which could be done through administrative authority. “We are talking about the idea of a comprehensive benefit, but for now we are focusing on things we think can be accomplished in the near term.”

The resignation of two British cabinet ministers including Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab triggered a rout in UK housebuilders and banks, while investors continued to fret about Rome's standoff with Brussels and Washington's row over trade with Beijing.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) was down 0.5 percent by 1036 GMT, with German, Spanish and French bourses firmly in negative territory. Britain's FTSE 100 (FTSE) was flat.
Optimism after China delivered a written response to U.S. demands for wide-ranging trade reforms ahead of an expected meeting between the two countries' leaders evaporated as worries over a global economic slowdown returned.
With the steady stream of resignations, the UK's deal with Europe over Brexit may be dead in the water.
""Risk appetite has taken a hit across the board, as this breakdown comes just as Italy ramps up its standoff with Brussels, and investors continue to fret that the great boom in tech earnings has come to an end,"" said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG.
Autos (SXAP) hit the skids, down 1.4 percent after the Chinese government doused hopes that Beijing was preparing to cut auto purchases taxes in a bid to shore up demand and boost the world's second-largest economy.
 Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) was at the bottom of the DAX, also knocked by a Citi downgrade.
The banking sector, the worst performing industry along with autos this year, also dropped 1.8 percent led by UK banks as sterling plunged after the cabinet resignations.
UK housebuilders - Barratt Development (L:BDEV),  Persimmon  (L:PSN) and  Taylor Wimpey  (L:TW) - were also hit hard. 
Capita Plc (LON:CPI) sank 7.8 percent to the bottom of the STOXX 600 index after a Financial Times report that the outsourcing group faces the loss of an NHS deal after a blunder over sending letters to women about their cervical screening results. https://on.ft.com/2Dky8BU 
Basic materials stocks (SXPP) were among the few gainers, up 0.3 percent buoyed by higher copper and industrial metals prices and a weaker U.S. dollar.
British asset manager  Intermediate Capital Group  (L:ICP) jumped 9.4 percent to the top of the STOXX and London's FTSE midcap index after reporting record net inflows. 

French conglomerate  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) rose 3.4 percent after delivering better-than-expected nine-month profits.

1229,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2018 05:18AM ET</span>",China Southern Airlines to quit SkyTeam alliance next year,"By Brenda Goh and Jamie Freed
SHANGHAI/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China Southern (NYSE:SO) Airlines (SS:600029) (HK:1055) said it will leave the SkyTeam airline alliance on Jan. 1 next year to meet the needs of the company's own development strategy. 
SkyTeam is one of the world's three major airline alliances and had two big Chinese carriers, China Southern and rival China Eastern Airlines Corp Ltd (SS:600115), as members, which is unusual given they operate in the same market.
The three alliances, which also include Star Alliance and oneworld, provide recriprocal benefits for passengers such as lounge usage and frequent flyer points and give airlines transfer passengers from partners in a boost to revenue.
China Southern, the country's largest airline by passenger numbers, is leaving SkyTeam because it believes it is expensive relative to the benefits of membership, a source at the airline told Reuters on condition of anonymity. 
It will consider joining oneworld but has not yet made a decision and would not do so immediately, the source added.
Cathay Pacific (HK:0293), as a founding member of the oneworld alliance, however, has the right to veto other entrants from the greater China region, said two sources familiar with the situation, who were not authorized to speak to media.
China Southern's Guangzhou hub competes against Cathay Pacific for international traffic.
Cathay Pacific and oneworld did not immediately respond to Reuters emails. China Southern also did not respond to Reuters' requests for a comment on future alliance plans.
However, in a statement to the Shanghai stock exchange, China Southern said it did not expect its decision to not renew its SkyTeam membership to significantly impact its operations.
SkyTeam has said it will work with China Southern to ensure a seamless transition for all customers and partners - a process that will run throughout 2019 and be completed by the year-end.
Xiamen Airlines Co Ltd, a subsidiary of China Southern that is also a SkyTeam member, however, has no plans to quit the alliance, Xiamen spokesman Qiu Dapeng said on Thursday.
Among the other members of SkyTeam are Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) and Air France KLM SA (PA:AIRF). Both have close partnerships with China Eastern.

Oneworld member  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) last year spent $200 million buying a stake in China Southern, a partnership the latter on Thursday said it would strengthen.

""After discussions of almost a year, (Beyoncé's) Parkwood has acquired 100 percent of the Ivy Park brand,"" Ivy Park said in a statement.
It said Green's Topshop and Arcadia businesses will fulfill existing orders to Ivy Park. No financial details were disclosed.
Ivy Park sells items such as hoodies and leggings, part of a trend toward so called athleisure. Beyonce, who is married to rapper Jay-Z, has a six-year-old daughter called Blue Ivy.
Green's representative referred to the Ivy Park statement, without further comment. A representative of Beyoncé could not be reached for additional comment.
The deal was first reported in the Financial Times.
Green, one of Britain's best known businessmen, was named in parliament last month as having taken legal action to prevent publication of allegations of sexual harassment and racial abuse of staff.

In a statement last month Green denied having broken the law and said his businesses fully investigated employee grievances.

Once again, traders were reminded never to get too hopeful about a Brexit deal.
Not even a day after the accord was reached, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab resigned, imperiling yet again an agreement that would pave the way for the U.K.’s orderly departure from the European Union.
The reaction in markets was swift -- and, in many ways, predictable. The pound plunged, boosting the international-packed FTSE 100. British mid-caps, which tend to be more domestic-facing, fell. Even the Stoxx Europe 600, which reacts less to the day-to-day Brexit headlines, reversed its gains to drop 0.3 percent.
“We are barely past 9 a.m. and already the situation is slipping out of control,” Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG Group Holdings Plc, said in an email. “Brexit has just blown up again and, thrown together with Italy, trade wars and U.S. earnings, risk appetite is unlikely to recover for long.”

(Reuters) - Bearish bets on most Asian currencies slackened over the last two weeks, a Reuters poll showed, as a plunge in oil prices benefited the region's major crude importers, India and to a lesser extent Indonesia and the Philippines.      
More short positions were unwound in the Indonesian rupiah  than in other regional currencies, a poll of 12 respondents showed. Short rupiah positions were at their lowest since early September.
The poll was conducted before Indonesia unexpectedly raised its policy interest rate on Thursday, when most analysts had predicted it would be left unchanged.
Indonesia's surprise trade surplus in September had improved sentiment toward the rupiah after the currency hit its weakest levels since the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis back on Oct. 10. 
Bearish bets on the Indian rupee , Asia's worst performing currency this year, and Philippine peso  declined to their lowest since late August.
""If oil remains low, we may see rupee outperforming compared to other EM currencies and vice versa,"" said Anindya Dasgupta, head of local market trading at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Bank PLC in Mumbai.
India's easing retail inflation and recent reports that tensions were easing between India's central bank and the government had also offered the rupee some respite.
The Philippine central bank also raised its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points on Thursday, its fifth hike this year. It said further policy tightening was needed to curb inflationary pressures. 
Bearish bets against the Chinese yuan  fell slightly. 
The yuan has been hovering near the critical seven-to-a-dollar mark. The People's Bank Of China is expected to exercise its administrative powers to stem further outflows, but the yuan could come under more pressure if the psychologically significant level is breached. 
Market participants were keenly waiting to see whether talks between China's President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump could lead to a de-escalation in the Sino-U.S. tariff war, when they meet during a Group of 20 gathering in Argentina later this month.
Any reduction in trade tensions would be positive for regional currencies.
Short bets in the Taiwan dollar  and Korean won  saw some reduction, while participants in the poll increased short positions in the Malaysian ringgit  to its highest since February. 
Bearish positions on the Singapore dollar  rose to their highest levels since September. 
The Reuters survey is focused on what analysts believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht .
The poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3.

A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long U.S. dollars. The figures included positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese financial firm JD Group has put its Hong Kong insurance business, FTLife Insurance Co Ltd, up for sale and a deal could fetch between $2 billion and $2.5 billion, three people with knowledge of the matter said.
JD Group, a Beijing-based financial holding firm, has hired  Citigroup  (N:C) to run the sale and second-round binding bids are expected in coming weeks, the people said, declining to be named as the process is confidential.
Earlier this year, local media reports had indicated that JD Group could be looking to offload a part of FTLife. 
A sale of the whole business, if completed, will be one of the top five insurance M&A deals ever in Hong Kong, a key market for insurers due to rapidly growing wealth and demand for insurance products from Chinese investors, Refinitiv data shows.
Hong Kong is home to a developed life insurance market, with a life and health insurance premium to GDP ratio of 17.94 percent in 2017, the second-highest in Asia after Taiwan, according to insurer Swiss Re.
JD Group acquired FTLife for HK$10.7 billion ($1.4 billion) in 2016 from Belgian insurer  Ageas  NV (BR:AGES), underscoring Chinese companies' strong appetite to grow through acquisitions in the Hong Kong financial sector.
Potential bidders for FTLife are expected to include Hong Kong conglomerate  Chow Tai Fook  (HK:1929) and Asian private equity firm PAG, two of the people said. 
JD Group could decide to retain a minority stake in FTLife, one of the sources said, adding the sale could also attract a bid from a Japanese insurer looking to tap the rapidly growing Hong Kong insurance market. 
JD Group, also known by its Chinese name of Jiuding Group, FTLife and PAG did not immediately respond to requests for comments. Chow Tai Fook and Citigroup declined to comment.
JD Group, which has brokerage, trust, mutual funds and private equity businesses, was once the most valuable company on the Chinese National Equities Exchange and Quotations, the country's most active over-the-counter equity exchange.
It had invested in more than 200 companies, of which about 60 are either listed or in the process of going public, according to the company website.
BUSINESS DIVESTMENT 
FTLife was the 12th-largest individual life insurer in Hong Kong by annualised premium equivalent, with a 1.4 percent market share at end-2017, according to a September Fitch ratings report on the company.
The insurer has more than 2,800 financial consultants and staff, as per its website. 
JD Group is looking to exit FTLife at a time when China is cracking down on privately-owned financial holding firms, whose sprawling business shareholdings and overseas investments have raised some concerns amid a wider deleveraging exercise.
China's acquisitive conglomerate Anbang Insurance [ANBANG.UL] was this year put into government control. 
The group is undergoing a shareholding restructuring and planning to sell overseas assets including real estate, hotels and insurance companies.
Another financial group, Tomorrow Holdings, is also in the process of divesting some of its businesses after its chairman, Xiao Jianhua, a billionaire with links to China's Communist Party elite, was put under investigation last year.

Boeing and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued guidance on the system last week after a Lion Air jet crashed in Indonesia on Oct. 29, killing all 189 people on board.
The FAA warned airlines last week that erroneous inputs from the system's sensors could lead the jet to automatically pitch its nose down even when autopilot is turned off, making it difficult for pilots to control. 
The system was designed to prevent the jet from stalling, according to information provided by Boeing to airlines.
""We value our partnership with Boeing, but were unaware of some of the functionality of the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) installed on the MAX 8,"" an American Airlines spokesman said. 
""We must ensure that our pilots are fully trained on procedures and understand key systems on the aircraft they fly.""
Indonesian investigators said on Monday the situation the crew of a doomed Lion Air jet was believed to have faced was not contained in the aircraft's flight manual. U.S. pilot unions were also not aware of potential risks, pilot unions told Reuters.
The FAA and Boeing are evaluating the need for software or design changes to 737 MAX jets in the wake of the Lion Air crash, the regulator said on Tuesday.
The American Airlines spokesman said his airline was continuing to work with Boeing and the FAA and would keep pilots informed of any updates.
A Boeing spokeswoman said the manufacturer could not discuss specifics of an ongoing investigation but it had provided two updates for operators around the world that re-emphasize existing procedures to deal with situations relating to MCAS.

""We are confident in the safety of the 737 MAX,"" she said. ""Safety remains our top priority and is a core value for everyone at Boeing.""

1249,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 14, 2018 11:01PM ET</span>","Asian Stocks Mixed; China-U.S. trade hopes, Brexit Deal in Focus","Investing.com - Asian stocks were mixed in morning trade on Thursday following reports that China delivered a written response to U.S. trade demands. Meanwhile, U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May secured backing from her cabinet for a draft Brexit deal, according to reports.
The Shanghai Composite rose 0.7%, while the SZSE Component inched up 0.3% by 10:45 PM ET (03:45 GMT). Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 0.5%.
Chinese stocks were lifted by reports that Beijing and Washington resumed talks to diffuse their trade disputes earlier this week.
Citing three U.S. government sources, Reuters reported that China delivered a written response to the U.S. for trade reform. However, the sources did not provide any further details.
Trump has repeatedly accused Beijing over intellectual property theft, industrial subsidies and the U.S. trade deficit with China. The two leaders are expected to meet at the G-20 summit later in the month.
Meanwhile, U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May has secured backing from her cabinet for a withdrawal agreement with the E.U., reports on Wednesdays said.
The deal keeps the U.K. within the customs union of the EU for an unspecified amount of time and includes a 21-month transition period after U.K.’s departure in March next year, according to the BBC.
“The collective decision of cabinet was that the government should agree the draft withdrawal agreement and the outline political declaration,” May said outside her Downing Street residence after a five-hour cabinet meeting.
“I firmly believe with my head and my heart that this is a decision in the best interests of the entire United Kingdom.”
“The choice before us is clear: This deal,” she said, “or leave with no deal, or no Brexit at all.”
However, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, says there's much work still to do, and the path may be difficult.
Reports on Wednesday said U.K. Pensions Secretary Esther McVey and fellow cabinet ministers including Andrea Leadsom and Penny Mordaunt might resign in the days ahead as they weighed up whether they can stay in May’s government to see through the proposed terms of Brexit.
Elsewhere in Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 0.6% while South Korea’s KOSPI slipped 0.2%.
Down under, Australia’s ASX 200 slid 0.7%.
In other news, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said in Dallas on Wednesday that the U.S. economy is “in such a good place right now” and that markets should be prepared that the central bank could raise rates at any time starting in 2019.
Powell reiterated the central bank is independent and would continue to do what is best for the U.S. economy.
His comments came after Trump accused the Fed of raising rates too fast during his administration.

PG&E said liabilities related to the wildfire ravaging northern California could exceed its recently renewed insurance cover if its equipment was found responsible for starting the Camp Fire.
Shares in California's largest public utility plunged nearly 22 percent on Wednesday, and have lost nearly half of their value since the fire began last week.
Seth Klarman's $30 billion Baupost Group raised its exposure by 321 percent during the third quarter to own 18.9 million shares at the end of September, according to regulatory filings and data from Symmetric.io.
Viking Global Investors put on a new position buying 5.7 million shares during the quarter. BlueMountain Capital bought 4.1 million shares to own 4.3 million at the end of the quarter. Appaloosa Management raised its exposure by 122 percent to own 3.9 million shares at the end of September.
A number of hedge funds that sometimes make bets on distressed investments had been moving into PG&E after deadly fires last year.
Even before the Camp Fire began this year, PG&E was facing some 200 lawsuits on behalf of 2,700 plaintiffs stemming from last year's fires. Some of last year's fires were caused by trees toppling into or making contact with PG&E power lines.
While the cause of this year's fire is still under investigation, the company told regulators they had experienced equipment problems in areas around the time the fire was first reported.
The funds all declined to comment on their investments.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Several prominent investors raised their stakes in  General Electric  Co (N:GE) in the third quarter, before its shares sank in recent weeks, filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission showed on Wednesday.
D.E. Shaw & Co LP, Viking Global Investors LP and Canyon Capital Advisors LLC each reported larger holdings in GE in the quarter ended Sept. 30 than in the prior quarter, according to filing data collected by Refinitiv and reviewed by Reuters.
GE shares have collapsed more than 50 percent this year, including 31 percent over the last month. In October, GE posted a quarterly loss of $22.8 billion, cut its annual dividend to just 4 cents a share and told investors it was facing a deepening federal accounting probe. Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp has promised to sell assets with ""urgency"" to reduce its high debt. 
It is not clear whether the fund investors kept their stakes during the selloff. None of the funds responded to requests for comment. 
Quarterly disclosures of hedge fund managers' stock holdings in 13F filings with the SEC are one of the few public ways of tracking what the managers are selling and buying.

But relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some risk because the disclosures are made 45 days after the end of each quarter and may not reflect current positions.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - European Union Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said on Wednesday that the EU has a list of potential retaliation targets ready in case U.S. President Donald Trump imposes auto tariffs on the bloc's member states.
Malmstrom told reporters after a meeting with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer that they did not speak specifically about auto tariffs, but focused instead on regulatory cooperation issues and ways to enable EU countries to import more American soybeans and liquefied natural gas.
Malmstrom did not specify the U.S. products on which the EU would levy retaliatory tariffs, as consultations with member states would need to take place, but she said the list could include ""all kinds"" of products.
""It could be cars, it could be agriculture, it could be industrial products - it could be everything. And we will do that, but hope we don't have to get to that situation,"" she said.
Malmstrom also said that the EU is willing to negotiate a limited trade deal on industrial goods, including autos, that seeks to bring tariff rates to zero for both the United States and Europe. 
But the scope of these talks cannot be defined until early 2019, when the USTR completes its consultation process with Congress and the EU receives a negotiating mandate from member states, she added.
Trump administration officials on Tuesday said the president's trade team made no decisions on how to proceed with new recommendations from the Commerce Department on whether to impose tariffs on autos and auto parts to protect the U.S. industry on national security grounds. The contents of the recommendations have not been disclosed.
An influential automotive trade group warned on Wednesday that increased U.S. autos tariffs will erode the benefits of tax cuts and the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement trade deal.
""If implemented, increased auto tariffs would not only undermine the potential success of the USMCA, they would also pose a material threat to the economy and may result in the loss of as many as 700,000 jobs across the U.S.,"" the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers said in prepared testimony for a hearing on Thursday before the U.S. International Trade Commission.
The group, which represents both Detroit-based and foreign automakers, said it ""strongly encourages"" the administration to drop its national security probe on autos.

It added that side-letters to the USMCA providing Canada and Mexico with tariff-free import quotas of 2.6 million vehicles each in the event Trump imposes car tariffs indicate that the administration intends to do so.

1254,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 14, 2018 07:20PM ET</span>","Amazon HQ Move Criticized by New York City Council, U.S. Senator","(Bloomberg) -- New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and Governor Andrew Cuomo were all smiles Tuesday when they announced that Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). will bring a new headquarters to the city with thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in investment. But a local backlash threatens to spur investigations into how the deal got done and whether it will benefit the city.
About 250 people huddled against the cold wind in Long Island City Wednesday, near the East River site where Amazon plans to move in. Instead of cheering, they were there to express outrage over the deal, which included a non-disclosure agreement that kept much of the details secret. Despite the influx of investment and jobs, some economists and policy makers have warned that the giant project will raise housing costs, displacing residents, and increase already snarled traffic. U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand later used a Twitter posting to join the chorus of critics.
The gathering in Queens included dozens of elected officials, including City Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer, who represents the district that includes Long Island City and who said he’d been shut out of any negotiations and only learned the deal had been consummated by reading about it in the newspaper. Part of the deal involves a state takeover of land involved so that the City Council would have no zoning oversight.
“What we’ve seen here is a process that no American city should have to endure,” Van Bramer said in an interview before the rally. “A governor and a mayor who claim to be progressive Democrats throwing nearly $3 billion at the richest man in the world and then promising a secretive grease-the-wheels process that avoids ‘messy’ public votes and hearings that might muck up the works.”
Now, a cadre of lawmakers is scrutinizing the transaction and the roles of the mayor and the governor in it, Van Bramer said. He vowed investigations at every level of government and said City Council lawyers are developing litigation strategies.
“We’re looking at any and all ways in which we can reassert the city’s and the people’s process here,” Van Bramer said. “It can not be that the mayor and governor and Jeff Bezos -- literally three men in a room -- can conspire to give him $3 billion and a helicopter pad, because who wants to struggle taking the subway? That can not be.”
Van Bramer and other public officials said they wanted the deal reopened to wrest commitments from Amazon to make specific pledges to help pay for improvements to mass transit, schools, parks, streets and new sewer lines. Amazon is opening a similar site in Arlington, Virginia.
Gillibrand, a Democrat who represents New York in the Senate, criticized the incentives used to lure Amazon and faulted what she called a “lack of community input” in the decision-making process.
In announcing Amazon’s intention to come to New York, Cuomo predicted the company would hire 40,000 workers within 25 years, instead of the 25,000 jobs Amazon has promised in the next 10 years. If that happened, Cuomo said, the city and state would have paid $3 billion in tax abatements and other incentives to reap as much as $27.5 billion in tax revenue from Amazon over the 25-year cycle.
“Complete malarkey,” countered state Senator Michael Gianaris, who represents the area and joined Van Bramer to host the Wednesday rally. He said Cuomo’s calculations of tax revenue were based on a comparison as if the site would remain an empty parcel, when in fact, the site had already been planned for development that would have been subjected to land-use review. The senator drew cheers from the crowd when he said he would boycott Amazon unless the deal is rescinded.
The mayor, who decried income inequality in winning control of City Hall in 2013, mused that the company’s location near Queensbridge Homes, the largest public housing complex in the U.S., would create a “synergy” of opportunity, without providing details as to how that might be accomplished.
Judging from the reaction of progressive activists, including U.S. Representative-Elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who have denounced the agreement, de Blasio’s lead role in bringing the company here may hurt the mayor with the base of progressive Democrats he has sought to lead.
When asked about the criticism, De Blasio’s office referred to comments he made Tuesday. The mayor said he measured success by “how many everyday people benefit.” Cuomo, in justifying the deal Tuesday, said New York’s incentive offer was lower than many cities and states, including Newark, which had promised benefits worth $7 billion.

1255,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2018 06:59PM ET</span>","Berkshire invests in JPMorgan, Oracle as Buffett puts cash to work","By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc deepened its commitment to the U.S. financial industry, announcing a $4.02 billion stake in JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and new investments in PNC Financial Services Group Inc (NYSE:PNC) and Travelers (NYSE:TRV) Companies Inc, plus a stake in  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL).
The investments were disclosed in a Wednesday regulatory filing detailing Berkshire's U.S.-listed stocks as of Sept. 30, following a quarter when the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate spent $17.7 billion on equities.
According to the filing, Berkshire owned $829 million of PNC stock, $460 million of the insurer Travelers, and $2.13 billion of Oracle, the database software company.
It also added to its sizable stakes in two earlier Buffett investments, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
“While nervous investors fear the end of the economic recovery, Mr. Buffett is buying economically sensitive bank stocks,"" said Bill Smead, who runs Smead Capital Management Inc in Seattle and owns Berkshire stock. ""It makes owners like us not mind sitting through a correction with them.""
Though the filing did not say which individual purchases Buffett or his investment managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler were responsible for, investors watch Berkshire's quarterly stock listings for signs about where the trio sees value.
Shares of JPMorgan, PNC and Travelers each rose at least 1 percent in after-hours trading following Berkshire's disclosure of its new stakes, while Oracle shares rose 2.4 percent.
JPMorgan and Travelers declined to comment. PNC, Oracle and Buffett's assistant did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The investment in JPMorgan, where Combs is a board member, closes a notable hole in Berkshire's portfolio.
Berkshire had already been the largest investor in several companies, including  American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP), Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) Corp, US Bancorp (NYSE:USB) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co, according to Refinitiv data.
Buffett has long praised the leadership of JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, and over the last year partnered with him and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Chief Executive Jeff Bezos to create a new company aiming to cut U.S. employee healthcare costs.
Atul Gawande, a surgeon and critic of medical industry practices, was named in June to lead the venture.
Buffett and Dimon also teamed up in June to call on companies to stop giving quarterly earnings forecasts, because they encourage an unhealthy focus on short-term profit at the expense of sustainable long-term growth.
Berkshire has more than 90 businesses in the insurance, energy, food and retail, industrial, railroad and other sectors.
Buffett, however, has not made a major acquisition since buying aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts in January 2016.
He often buys stocks such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), in which Berkshire previously disclosed a $57.6 billion stake, when buying whole companies appears too expensive.
Berkshire also spent $928 million repurchasing its own stock in the quarter.
Despite the stock purchases, Berkshire ended September with $103.6 billion of cash and equivalents.

Berkshire also reported other portfolio changes, including the shedding of holdings in Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and French drugmaker Sanofi (PA:SASY) SA and reduction in its stake in oil refiner Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX).

1256,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2018 06:12PM ET</span>","Exclusive: China Inc's mounting stress - funding woes, shrinking profit growth and a trade war","By Adam Jourdan and Gaurav Dogra
SHANGHAI/BENGALURU (Reuters) - China Inc's profit growth has fallen sharply while debt levels have recorded a rare drop, a Reuters analysis of earnings data shows - signs of strain brought on by Beijing's crackdown on leverage as well as a trade war with the United States.
Easy access to funds had long fueled growth for mainland Chinese firms but a concerted campaign by authorities to rid the financial system of excessive liquidity and rein in irrational corporate expansion is taking its toll.
A rapid bruising of consumer confidence amid trade tension with the United States has added pain, creating a major challenge for Beijing as it looks to keep the economy on track after it expanded at its weakest pace since 2009 in the third quarter.
Chinese firms managed a combined net profit rise of just 3.9 percent in the third quarter, compared with jumps of 20-55 percent seen in each quarter for the past two years, according to the Reuters analysis of earnings for 1,950 firms listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen.
Earnings for Hengkang Medical Group Co Ltd, which has made acquisitions of medical institutions central to its business strategy, highlight the strong connection between credit conditions and corporate health in China.
""Capital markets are tight and the cost of borrowing is pretty high,"" said Li Dan, a securities official at Hengkang's board of directors office and one of a dozen executives interviewed by Reuters for this article.
Fierce competition for M&A funds, plus the slowing economy pushed the company into the red for the third quarter, she said.
China Inc profits squeezed - https://tmsnrt.rs/2PnMKYA
Combined debt at Chinese firms dropped 1.6 percent to about 12 trillion yuan ($1.7 trillion) for the quarter from a year earlier - the first decline in the nine years of comparable data available for roughly 1,400 of the companies.
That was down 11.5 percent from the previous quarter, also the steepest quarter-on-quarter decline of the past nine years.
Metals firm Shenzhen Zhongjin Lingnan Nonfemet Co Ltd, which cited a drop in prices for its weaker profits, said it was a ""tricky"" time for financing.
""The market environment is really not good. When we did our issuance, we came under great pressure and almost didn't succeed with the fund-raising,"" an official at the company said.
""Lots of companies though aren't able now to raise money in private fund raising successfully at all,"" he said. Like many company officials Reuters spoke with he asked not to be identified by name.
China Inc debt in rare drop - https://tmsnrt.rs/2QAdcL9
CHEAP AND CHEERFUL
Revenue growth remained more robust at 13.4 percent, in line with growth earlier in the year, though down from a climb of 21.6 percent in the same quarter in 2017. 
But pressure on profits was coming from a number of fronts, according to the companies interviewed.
In addition to weaker demand and higher funding costs, they cited poor returns on financial investments, inventory build-up as well as downward pressure on product prices that was fuelling competition among firms.
""Our prices have dropped a lot this year,"" said a senior official at LONGi Green Energy Technology Co Ltd, adding that the margins on its products for the solar power industry had dropped to 20 percent from 30 percent last year. That contributed to a 62 percent slide in third-quarter profit.
""The demand side is weakening. One: it's because of credit availability. Two is weakening sentiment due to the trade issue escalation,"" said Christopher Lee, Hong Kong-based managing director for corporate ratings at S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI).
""A lot of these private companies are under stress in the last couple of months,"" he said, adding that he expected the government to roll out more measures that would make it easier for businesses to gain funding.
By sector, financial firms were the hardest hit with the industry seeing an average 52 percent decline in third-quarter net profit. Not only hurt by the crackdown on risky lending in the shadow banking sector, a sharp slide in China stocks has reduced the value of many of their holdings. 
Sudden slowdown in Q3 - https://tmsnrt.rs/2QAGBF2
Firms in the so-called consumer discretionary sector, saw net profits drop 1.8 percent from the same quarter a year earlier - a stark contrast to growth of 21.5 percent in the second quarter and the first decline in trackable data that goes back to mid-2016.
That represents a further ominous sign for consumer spending. Others include a slide in China car sales that has brought the world's biggest car market closer to a rare annual contraction as well as weak profit growth for premium liquor maker Kweichow Moutai Co Ltd, a bellwether for China's luxury sales.
Sales for e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd's annual shopping bonanza Singles' Day rose at their slowest-ever rate despite topping $30 billion - in part due to a stalling real estate market hitting sales of big ticket items.
Belt-tightening by consumers is also forcing companies to roll out discounts to keep up sales.
""Consumers are increasingly looking for better value and better - and bigger savings,"" Joey Wat, CEO of Yum China Holdings Inc, told analysts after the company announced its third-quarter sales last month.
The firm, which operates Pizza Hut and KFC in China, had seen ""very aggressive promotion"" from rivals that had increased competition to lure in diners.

""In the short term, KFC can do that. There's nothing wrong to offer something, it's a lovely term called cheap and cheerful, particularly during some slightly tougher times for customers,"" she said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT) has won a preliminary contract valued at up to $22.7 billion to build a batch of 255 F-35 jets for the U.S. military and its allies, the U.S. Defense Department said on Wednesday.
The department said the deal would allow Lockheed to receive $6 billion in funding immediately, a move aimed at preventing major delays in production of the new stealthy fighter jets.
This contract is the first to lock in multiyear commitments from U.S. allies as Lockheed anticipates that buying components in larger quantities will help move the price of the most common F-35 jet to below $80 million by 2020. The most common variation of the jet, the F-35 A, had a price of $89.2 million after the most recent round of contract negotiations announced in September.
Lockheed is developing and building three models of the new warplanes for the U.S. military and 10 other countries that have signed up to buy the jets: Britain, Australia, Italy, Turkey, Norway, the Netherlands, Israel, Japan, South Korea and Belgium.
The Pentagon's chief arms buyer, Ellen Lord, told Reuters on Tuesday that she expected to finalize the interim terms of the deal, known as an ""undefinitized contract action"" or UCA, with Lockheed, its No. 1 supplier, by the spring of next year.
A Lockheed representative said: ""This is a smart approach for the taxpayer, the warfighter and for industry.""
According to the Pentagon, Wednesday's agreement means that U.S. allies buy 149 jets over the three-year period. In the United States' one-year deal, it will buy the remaining 106 jets for delivery beginning in 2020.
The U.S. government will continue to buy jets in annual contracts, but is also purchasing components for future-year jets and will also benefit from the economies of scale allowed under the multiyear contract.
The three-year deal, known as the ""block buy"" among the United States and allies, has been said to be worth more than $37 billion and encompass a record 440 jets.
Wednesday's contract agrees to a high-water mark of $22.7 billion for all of the 255 jets, but that dollar figure is expected to come down during the negotiations while the jet count is considered a minimum commitment. 
The interim payment authorized on Wednesday will be deducted from the total contract when the two sides reach a final agreement.

The Pentagon is negotiating a separate contract with Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp (N:UTX), for engines to power the jets.

1261,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2018 05:45PM ET</span>",Prominent managers loaded up on Apple before recent tumble,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Several prominent investors put fresh money to work in Apple (O:AAPL) during the third quarter even as they sold out of other high-flying tech companies, betting the iPhone maker's stock would keep rising as strong growth overshadowed rising trade tensions between the United States and China.
The purchases, which were revealed in securities filings on Wednesday, may be leaving large investors with steep losses if Apple continues its more than 15 percent decline for the month so far. 
Mutual fund giant Fidelity added 7 million shares, bringing its total holdings to 110.9 million shares, regulatory filings and data from research firm Symmetric.io show. Janus Henderson Group added 3.3 million shares for a total of 20.8 million shares and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co boosted its holding to 42.7 million shares after adding 1.3 million.
Philippe Laffont's Coatue Management made a big bet by raising his exposure by 938 percent to 884,321 shares while Chase Coleman's Tiger Global Management put on a new position to own just over 1 million shares.
Despite the steep declines in Apple, some hedge fund managers said that they are continuing to add to shares in the company. 
""We know it is not a Facebook or a Google with eye-popping growth but we're not paying for that,” said Shawn Kravetz, founder of Esplanade Capital, at the Reuters Global Investment 2019 Outlook Summit in New York on Wednesday.
Kravetz, who added to his Apple position Wednesday morning, said investors like himself are attracted to the company's compelling valuation compared to other Silicon Valley giants. 
The declines in Apple may add to what is proving to be another difficult year for the hedge fund industry. 
Overall, the average hedge fund dropped nearly 3 percent in October, the worst monthly loss since 2011, in large part due to over-exposures to the technology industry, according to Hedge Fund Research.
Given the increased volatility in the U.S. stock market, defensive-minded funds will likely post the strongest returns through the end of the calendar year, said Kenneth Heinz, president of HFR. 
“Anticipating the market volatility which began in September and accelerated in October will continue into 2019, strategies positioned for this transitional market environment are likely to lead performance through year end,” he said. 
Quarterly disclosures of hedge fund managers' stock holdings in 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are one of the few public ways of tracking what the managers are selling and buying. But relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some risk because the disclosures are made 45 days after the end of each quarter and may not reflect current positions.
The moves into the shares of Apple came at a time when several prominent hedge funds were starting to shed their holdings of the FANG stocks -  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), Netflix Inc (O:NFLX), and Google's parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) - that had led the market higher over the last two years. 
Jana Partners, for instance, sold all of its approximately 651,000 shares of Facebook and all of its approximately 44,000 shares of Alphabet Inc in the third quarter, according to securities filings. Third Point LLC sold all of its approximately 3 million shares of Facebook, a position which had made up about 4 percent of its prior portfolio.

Los Angeles-based asset manager TCW Group Inc sold all of its approximately 127,000 shares of Netflix during the same time period.

The three ""and other co-conspirators rigged bids and fixed prices for fuel supply contracts issued by the U.S. military in this strategically critical region for over a decade,"" Delrahim said.
The conspiracy began around March 2005 and continued until 2016, with South Korean petroleum and refinery companies and their agents working to suppress competition during the bidding process for U.S. military fuel contracts, the department said.
""As a result of the anti-competitive agreement, the U.S. Department of Defense paid substantially more for fuel supply services than it would have absent the collusion,"" Delrahim said.
SK Energy and GS Caltex Corp could not immediately be reached for comment.
Chevron spokesman Braden Reddall said the company fully cooperated with authorities in the probe of Caltex. ""No Chevron employees were implicated in the case,"" he said.
Hanjin representative Seung Bae Lee said the company was ""committed to complying with the antitrust and competition laws and values its decades-long relationship with the U.S. military.""
Between criminal fines and other payments, SK Energy is to pay $124.5 million, GS Caltex will pay $104.2 million and Hanjin will pay $7.6 million, according to Justice Department data.

The payments made by the companies ""exceeds the amount of the individual overcharge,"" the department said.

1264,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2018 05:22PM ET</span>",Uber posts $1 billion loss in quarter as growth in bookings slows,"By Heather Somerville
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc said on Wednesday that growth in bookings for its ride-hailing and delivery services rose 6 percent in the latest quarter, the third quarter in a row that growth has remained in the single digits after double-digit growth for all of last year.
The San Francisco-based firm lost $1.07 billion for the three months ending Sept. 30, a 20 percent increase from the previous quarter but down 27 percent from a year ago, when the company posted its biggest publicly reported quarterly loss on the heels of the departure of Uber co-founder and former Chief Executive Travis Kalanick.
Uber is seeking to expand in freight hauling, food delivery and electric bikes and scooters as growth in its now decade-old ride-hailing business dwindles. The company, valued at $76 billion, faces pressure to show it can still grow enough to become profitable and satisfy investors in an initial public offering planned for some time next year.
Its adjusted loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization was $592 million, down from $614 million last quarter and $1.02 billion a year ago.
""We had another strong quarter for a business of our size and global scope,"" said Nelson Chai, Uber's chief financial officer, who joined in September after the job had been vacant for three years. He emphasized the ""high-potential markets in India and the Middle East where we continue to solidify our leadership position.""
But broader economic conditions and sustained losses could push Uber to merge with rivals in India and the Middle East, particularly as Uber and India-based Ola share an investor in SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984). 
Uber's gross bookings were $12.7 billion, up 6 percent from the previous quarter and up 41 percent from a year ago. In late 2016, Uber's quarterly bookings growth approached 30 percent, and in early 2017 it still sustained double-digit growth quarter-over-quarter. At the start of this year, however, bookings growth slid into the single digits.
Revenue for the quarter was $2.95 billion, a 5 percent boost from the previous quarter and up 38 percent from a year ago. That trailed the second-quarter year-over-year revenue increase of 63 percent.
As a private company, Uber is not required to publicly disclose financials, but last year started releasing selected figures. 
BET ON SCOOTERS, BIKES AND TRUCKS
Since CEO Dara Khosrowshahi took the helm more than a year ago, Uber has retreated from foreign markets where it had suffered heavy losses and shuttered certain pricey ventures including self-driving trucks. But Khosrowshahi has plowed the savings back into its freight-hauling, food-delivery, and electric scooter and bikes businesses.
An investment by SoftBank that closed in January, which gave the Japanese investor a 15 percent stake in Uber, included a provision that requires Uber to file for an IPO by Sept. 30 of next year, or the company risks allowing restrictions on shareholder stock transfers to expire. That could create a mess for Uber's ownership structure and equity value, and pose regulatory problems.
Uber is considering moving its public debut up from the second half of 2019 to the first half, given concerns about a market downturn and an expected IPO from its chief U.S. rival, Lyft Inc, according to sources familiar with the matter.
Khosrowshahi has focused on growing Uber Eats, which took in $2.1 billion in booking revenue, marking a 150 percent jump over last year and about 17 percent of total bookings. 
Uber has also pledged to double its investment over the next year in Freight, a brokerage service set up in May 2017 for truck drivers and fleet managers looking for cargo to haul. The business is doubling the number of loads it connects with truckers every quarter, Uber said. 

But it is not yet clear whether either business can sustain a profit. It is also unclear how Uber will fare in a shakeout of the crowded global food-delivery industry, and whether its freight business will be widely adopted by fleet managers.

1265,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2018 05:18PM ET</span>",California wildfire victims sue utility PG&E alleging negligence,"(Reuters) - Victims of California's deadliest wildfire have filed a lawsuit against PG&E Corp alleging negligence and health and safety code violations by the utility company in the blaze that has killed at least 48 people. 
The lawsuit seeking damages against California's largest public utility was filed on Tuesday in San Francisco County Superior Court by three law firms, which refer to themselves as Northern California Fire Lawyers. 
""It's important to remember that the cause (of the ""Camp Fire"") has yet to be determined,"" PG&E said in a statement. ""Right now, our primary focus is on the communities, supporting first responders and getting our crews positioned and ready to respond when we get access, so that we can safely restore gas and electricity to our customers.""
The Camp Fire, which began last Thursday, has all but wiped out the Sierra foothills town of Paradise in Butte County, about 175 miles (280 km) north of San Francisco, that was overrun by flames and largely incinerated.
But both PG&E and Southern (NYSE:SO) California Edison have reported to regulators that they experienced problems with transmission lines or substations in areas around the time the blazes were first reported.
The lawsuit alleged that PG&E failed to properly maintain, repair and replace its equipment and that ""its inexcusable behavior contributed to the cause of the 'Camp Fire.'""
The lawsuit alleges that prior to the Camp Fire, PG&E began warning customers it might turn off power because of the high risk of wildfires.
""Despite its own recognition of these impending hazardous conditions, on the day of the Camp Fire’s ignition, PG&E ultimately made the decision not to proceed with its plans for a power shutoff,"" the lawsuit stated.
Last month PG&E cut off electric power to about 60,000 customers to prevent wildfires as high winds threatened to topple trees and power lines.
Searchers looking for the remains of victims in the charred ruins of Paradise were set to expand their operation on Wednesday as firefighters stepped up efforts to contain the blaze.
The origins of the ""Camp Fire"" and the ""Woolsey Fire"" that has ravaged parts of southern California are still under investigation. 
Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey told KRCR television on Wednesday that attributing the fire to PG&E at this point was ""speculative.""
But he added that officials from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) arrived in the area immediately after the fire began to ensure that any equipment or other evidence would be preserved for an investigation.
PG&E stock slid 21.8 percent to close at $25.59.

PG&E's bonds have weakened broadly after the California electric utility said late Tuesday it had borrowed more than $3 billion from its credit facilities. It also warned it might face liabilities stemming from the Camp Fire that could exceed its insurance coverage.

1266,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 14, 2018 04:48PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.
1. Online Sales Crucial for Walmart’s Earnings
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) caps off the retail earnings this week, reporting quarterly results before the bell tomorrow.
On average, analysts expect that the retail giant earned $1.01 per share on sales of $125.4 billion.
The stock has been choppy, but is solidly higher from lows of the year seen around May.
The number that's key to the ongoing momentum in its share price is growth in Walmart's online sales, Investing.com’s Haris Anwar wrote. This measure is crucial to prove the success of the company’s continuing battle with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
“In our view, there is a clear evidence that Walmart’s massive investments to improve its digital platform are paying off,” Anwar said. “In the second quarter, U.S. online sales continued their upward trajectory, surging 40% from the same period a year ago, putting Walmart's full-year guidance for its online sales growth within reach.”
Also reporting will be JC Penney (NYSE:JCP), where investors will be looking for any kind of good news.
Shares are now around a 52-week low and look more likely to break below $1 than head north of $2.
Analysts are forecasting a loss of 56 cents a share on sales of $2.76 billion.
2. Retail Sales Lead Busy Day for Indicators
The economic calendar is very busy tomorrow, with retail sales leading the parade.
The Commerce Department will report the latest retail figures at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).
Economists expect that core retail sales, which exclude autos, rose 0.5% in October.
At the same time, weekly initial jobless claims are released, which are expected to stay close to the week before at 216,000.
Two measures of regional manufacturing activity are also on tap then, with the Philly Fed Manufacturing Index and New York’s Empire State Manufacturing Index both expected to post a decline for November.
At 10 AM ET, data on business inventories for September are posted, with economists expecting a 0.3% gain.
3. Will Inventories Result in a Resumed Oil Selloff?
Oil broke its record losing streak, edging up 1% today. But the decline could resume tomorrow as the Energy Information Administration releases its weekly inventory report.
Strong U.S. production, combined with a rise in oil stockpiles, has been a major reason for oil’s unprecedented selloff.
With prices sharply in bear market territory, an outsize build could spook the market again.
Analysts are expecting a rise in inventories of 3.182 million barrels."

WB XPress is one of several pipelines designed to connect growing output in the Marcellus and Utica shale basins in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio with customers in other parts of the United States and Canada.
The 1.3-billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) WB XPress project was designed to increase gas capacity in Virginia and West Virginia. The project includes construction of 2.9 miles (4.7 km) of new pipeline, two compressor stations and replacement of 26 miles of existing pipeline.
One billion cubic feet is enough gas to power about 5 million U.S. homes for a day.
New pipelines built to remove gas from the Marcellus and Utica basins have enabled shale drillers to boost output in the Appalachia region to a forecast record high of around 30.4 bcfd in December from 26.9 bcfd during the same month a year earlier.
That represents about 37 percent of the nation's total dry gas output of 83.2 bcfd expected on average in 2018. A decade ago, the Appalachia region produced just 1.6 bcfd, or 3 percent of the country's total production in 2008.
Separately, TransCanada has said it plans to complete its $3 billion Mountaineer and $600 million Gulf XPress projects by the end of the year.
Mountaineer is designed to increase gas capacity in West Virginia by 2-bcfd.

Gulf XPress is designed to move 0.88 bcfd of gas from Appalachia to the U.S. South.

The Dow fell 0.81%, The S&P 500 fell 0.76% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.90%.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), led the decline in the broader tech sector, falling 3% as concerns about its iPhone sales persisted in the wake of iPhone component suppliers warning on demand.
“Apple really has people questioning technology and the FAANGs. A lot of investors have their hopes pinned on Apple going up and that’s not happening,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.
Financial stocks also struggled after Democrat Maxine Waters, poised to become chair of the U.S. House banking committee, said regulations would not be eased any further on her watch, according to a CNBC report.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) were both in the red.
“When Waters came up that had a profound impact on the markets and right about the time the S&P went negative,” said Forrest.
Corporate earnings, meanwhile, offered little reason for optimism as Macy’s (NYSE:M) fell 7% on concerns over whether the retailer can continue the pace of same-store sales growth following blowout third-quarter results, which topped analysts' estimates on both the top and bottom lines.
Wall Street did, however, show some fight heading into the close on a report that the UK Prime Minister Theresa May's Cabinet had agreed to a Brexit deal, though some remained cautious as the deal is expected to face tougher opposition in the UK Parliament.
Elsewhere, battered energy names found their footing as oil prices snapped a 12-day losing streak, though some warned the rebound was fragile.
Investor sentiment on stocks was also hurt after Rep. Bill Pascrell, D-NJ, in an interview with Bloomberg News, said the revamped trade deal between the U.S., Canada and Mexico needs to be changed before it can pass through Congress.

1273,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2018 03:46PM ET</span>",Jury clears J&J of liability in California talc cancer case,"By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - A California jury on Wednesday cleared Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) of liability in a case involving a woman who alleged that the company's talc-based products, including its baby powder, contain asbestos and caused her cancer, the company said.
The jury in Humboldt County Superior Court in Eureka, California rejected claims by Carla Allen who said that her mesothelioma, a tissue cancer closely linked to asbestos exposure, was caused by the company's talc products, including Johnson's Baby Powder.
J&J denies the allegations, saying decades of scientific testing and regulatory approvals have shown its talc to be safe and asbestos-free.
Plaintiffs in the litigation allege that J&J knew of asbestos fibers in its cosmetic talc and concealed risks associated with the products.
The New Brunswick, New Jersey-based company faces some 11,700 U.S. talc lawsuits, according to an October regulatory filing. More than 9,700 of those cases involve claims over ovarian cancer, recent filings in New Jersey federal court, where most of the cases are consolidated, showed.
The remaining plaintiffs allege asbestos in J&J's talc caused them to develop mesothelioma.
J&J in a statement on Wednesday said it was pleased with the jury's decision in the case of Allen. 
""While we deeply sympathize with anyone suffering from any form of cancer, the science and facts show that her disease was not caused by her use of our talcum-based products,"" the company said.
The California jury reached its decision following a roughly seven-week long jury trial, court records showed, but further details were not immediately available.
Lawyers for Allen did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
J&J has been fighting talc cancer lawsuits for several years, but the litigation shifted in recent months to include allegations of asbestos contamination. 
Plaintiffs now claim asbestos fibers in the products are causing both ovarian cancer and mesothelioma.
J&J to date has been cleared of liability in three mesothelioma cases. It has lost two mesothelioma cases in New Jersey and California, with juries awarding a total of $142 million in damages. Both cases are under appeal.
Four additional mesothelioma cases resulted in a mistrial because jurors could not reach a verdict or because the plaintiff died.

In July, a Missouri jury hit J&J with a massive $4.69 billion verdict in the first trial alleging asbestos contamination has caused ovarian cancer in 22 women. That decision is also under appeal.

Separately, UBS also slashed its target on buy-rated Apple to $225 from $240, citing supply chain cuts.
Dialog Semiconductor (DE:DLGS), however, provided some optimism Wednesday, saying it had not seen demand weakness from its main customer Apple.
Worries over iPhone demand emerged earlier this week after Apple suppliers Lumentum Holdings (NASDAQ:LITE) and Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO) slashed guidance on growth.
Elsewhere, FAANG stocks traded mostly lower as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) traded higher, while Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) were in the red."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's major stock indexes fell on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 dropping for the fifth session in a row, as financials were hit by fears that regulations on the banking industry would tighten once the Democratic Party takes control of the U.S. House of Representatives.
Financial stocks fell after Democrat Maxine Waters, who is expected to become chair of the House banking committee, said banking regulations would not be eased any further on her watch, according to a CNBC report.
The financial sector (SPSY) dropped 1.2 percent and was the biggest drag on the S&P 500. The S&P 500 Banks index <.SPXBK> fell 1.6 percent.
Meanwhile, technology stocks added to their recent losses as shares of Apple Inc (O:AAPL) descended for a fifth consecutive day on mounting concerns that iPhone sales have hit a wall. At their session low, Apple shares were down more than 20 percent from their record high.
Apple's 2.1 percent drop helped drag the S&P 500 technology index (SPLRCT) down 0.5 percent.
The market had started on a buoyant note as oil prices rebounded and data showed consumer prices rose only as much as expected last month, easing fears of overheating inflation and faster interest rate hikes.
But sentiment turned lower as the session wore on, with investors citing ongoing concerns about a slowdown in global economic growth prospects as reason to remain cautious.
""A cocktail of uncertainty regarding global growth as well as trade-related issues has put market speculators on their heels,"" said Chad Morganlander, senior portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors in Florham Park, New Jersey.

PG&E Corp (N:PCG) slumped 22.7 percent after the utility warned it could face ""significant liability"" in excess of its insurance coverage if its equipment was found to have caused the blaze raging in Northern California.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.29-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.57-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 12 new 52-week highs and 17 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 16 new highs and 181 new lows.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire investor William Ackman has turned his back on snack maker Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ) International and put the money into potentially more lucrative bets, including global coffee company Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and hotel operator Hilton Worldwide Holdings.
Ackman's hedge fund, Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management, sold out of Mondelez International during the third quarter, some three years after spending $5.5 billion for a 7.5 percent stake, the investor told clients on a conference call on Wednesday.
""It was not a barn burner of an investment,"" Ackman said on the call, adding that he has found better investments and had a change of heart as chances for an acquisition of Mondelez grew more remote.
The two most recent additions to the $7.2 billion fund's portfolio are a 1.1 percent stake in Starbucks and a 3.7 percent stake in Hilton. Ackman took care to praise management at each company and said his team would soon be meeting with the Starbucks team.
He said Pershing Square bought the Starbucks stake for an average price of $51 a share. The stock on Wednesday was trading at $67.22 a share.
Ackman ranks among the year's best-performing activist investors, with his private hedge fund up 9.36 percent for the year through Nov. 6 while the average activist has lost 5 percent this year, according to Hedge Fund Research data.
Ackman said that much of the recent gains have been fueled by Starbucks and investments in Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG), which has is up 68 percent this year, and Automatic Data Processing, which has climbed 23.5 percent this year.
Ackman praised Starbuck's decision to buy back more shares more quickly and said again that he expects the company to grow in China while also taking the right steps to keep pace with current health and wellness trends. Starbucks' chief executive, Kevin Johnson, has made appropriate moves in selling its Tazo tea brand to  Unilever  (LON:ULVR), closing Teavana stores and reaching a licensing deal for Nestle to sell its packaged coffee around the world, Ackman said. 
Ackman also said that Hilton, whose shares he has owned previously, has a strong pipeline with more hotels scheduled to be opened over the next years and is benefiting from the U.S. corporate tax cuts.

Some 11 months after telling investors that he planned to keep a lower profile, Ackman has largely stuck by his plans and reassured investors that he is working hard behind the scenes. ""We will be active, engaged and supportive even if you don't see us on television or in the media,"" he said.

The company, which plans to raise about $600 million to $800 million, is likely to go public in the first quarter of 2019, sources told CNBC.
The maker of Levi's jeans is aiming to debut with a valuation of about $5 billion, the report said.
Levi Strauss said it does not comment on marketplace rumors or speculation.
This could be the company's return to the public markets, nearly five decades after going private.
The company first went public in 1971, but descendants of Levi Strauss, the creator of the blue jeans, took the company private shortly after.

In its latest quarterly report, the company said sales rose 10 percent to $1.39 billion and net income jumped 44 percent, mainly due to demand for its jeans at both retail stores and online.

NEW YORK/DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund PIF is exploring the acquisition of up to a $700 million stake in Legendary Entertainment, the U.S. movie studio behind films such as ""Jurassic World"" and ""Interstellar"", according to people familiar with the matter.
A PIF deal with Legendary would test Hollywood's appetite for Saudi investments following widespread condemnation of Riyadh last month for its role in the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. 
A critic of Saudi ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Khashoggi was killed in Saudi Arabia’s Istanbul consulate on Oct. 2. The Saudi regime has denied that the Crown Prince ordered Khashoggi's assassination.
The deal could face resistance from some Legendary executives concerned about the impact a PIF investment would have on the studio's brand and its ability to attract top talent, according to the sources 
Such pushback would be the latest illustration of how fallout from Khashoggi's death is weighing on the ability of Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter, to diversify its investments abroad. 
Hollywood talent agency Endeavor is close to terminating an agreed $400 million investment from PIF following Khashoggi's murder, over concerns about the reputational impact on its business, according to sources familiar with that matter.
PIF is eyeing a $500 million to $700 million investment in Legendary and is in talks to hire a financial adviser to assist it with its bid, the sources said.
Legendary has not had any formal discussions with PIF, according to sources familiar with Legendary's strategy.
Despite the hurdles presented by Khashoggi's killing, PIF believes Legendary's majority owner, China's Dalian Wanda Group, will be open to a deal, because it is under pressure from Beijing to divest overseas assets so it can trim its debt, according to the sources.
PIF's plans are in the early stages and there is no guarantee the fund will follow through with making a formal offer for Legendary, they said, asking not to be named because the matter is confidential.
PIF and Legendary declined to comment. Wanda and Endeavor did not respond to requests for comment.
Some Hollywood actors have already distanced themselves from Saudi Arabia. Gerard Butler, for example, canceled his appearance at a screening of his new film ""Hunter Killer"" in Riyadh last month after Khashoggi's death.
SAUDI CINEMA PLANS
PIF's overtures to Hollywood, the world's filmmaking capital, come as Saudi Arabia has been seeking to open up to foreign films, as part of ambitious economic and social reforms pushed by Mohammed bin Salman.
Following the lifting of a ban on movie theaters last year, PIF signed deals with cinema operators such as AMC Entertainment Holdings (N:AMC), in which Wanda is also an investor, to build theaters in Saudi Arabia. Several Hollywood stars paid promotional visits to the country, including John Travolta and Jason Momoa.
Saudi Arabia had some cinemas in the 1970s, but its powerful clerics closed them, reflecting rising Islamist influence throughout the Arab region at the time.
However, Saudi Arabians remained avid consumers of Western media and culture. Despite the cinema ban, Hollywood films and recent television series were widely watched in the country. 
To serve a population of more than 32 million, most of whom are under the age of 30, Saudi Arabia wants to set up around 350 movie theaters with over 2,500 screens by 2030, which it hopes will attract nearly $1 billion in annual ticket sales.
WANDA INVESTMENTS
Wanda paid $3.5 billion in early 2016 for Legendary Entertainment, which also produced the ""Pacific Rim"" and ""The Great Wall"" films and the upcoming live action Pokemon Detective Pikachu movie based on the video game characters.
Wanda, led by billionaire Wang Jianlin, once had dreams of developing a China-Hollywood film nexus, had a stake in Spanish football club Atletico Madrid and owned prime property developments in Sydney and London.

But Wanda is now focusing on core domestic businesses, notably its commercial property arm, financial unit, and Wanda Cinema  Line Corp  (NYSE:LN), China's largest cinema operator.

Macy’s (NYSE:M) fell 5% even as its third-quarter revenue and earnings topped analysts' expectations, as some market participants expressed concern over whether the retailer can continue the pace of same-store sales growth.
Sales at stores opened at least a year rose 3.3%, its fourth-straight quarter of gains after a three-year slump.
The retailer lifted guidance for full-year profit on expectations that shoppers will continue to splurge in the holiday season.
Macy's now expects annual profits to increase from $3.95 and $4.15 per share to between $4.10 and $4.30.
Apparel company Canada Goose (NYSE:GOOS) soared to all-highs before paring gains after reporting better-than-expected second-quarter results and full-year guidance. Its shares were up more than 7%.
The retailer posted earnings of CAD$0.46 a share and revenue of CAD$230.3 million, handily beating Wall Street estimates for CAD$0.26 and CAD$197.90 million.
Ahead of its quarterly report on Thursday, JC Penney (NYSE:JCP) fell more than 3% as market participants expect that large-scale store closures, falling footfall and weak comparable sales will continue to weigh on performance.
Analysts expect the retailer to post a loss of $0.56 a share, wider than the loss reported a year earlier, while sales are expected to remain flat around $2.8 billion."

Chief Executive Borje Ekholm also said his firm was investing in new technology for 5G networks to help boost its market share, particularly in China.
""There is a lot of speculation going on. There is a lot of discussion about geopolitics,"" he said at the  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Technology, Media and Telecom conference in Barcelona. ""We let the security agencies and politicians deal with that.""
Asked if there had been any impact on Ericsson sales from worries among operators about Chinese competitors after some governments had intervened citing national security concerns, he said: ""We haven't really seen that to any large extent yet."" 
Australia and the United States have decided to ban Chinese suppliers from next generation 5G networks, and German officials are planning a drive to convince the government to consider excluding Chinese firms such as Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] from building the country's 5G infrastructure.
Huawei, the world's largest telecoms equipment maker, has rejected any suggestion it might pose a threat to any country's national security, saying cyber security has always been its top priority.
Ekholm said telecoms customers had been concerned when the U.S. government temporarily stopped U.S. firms selling to China's ZTE (HK:0763) Corp (SZ:000063) but he said that this had not translated into more orders for Ericsson equipment.
The U.S. denial order was lifted in July. Ekholm said he did not think the trade tensions would make it harder for Ericsson to compete in China, adding that his company had struggled in China in the past because it lacked the product range Chinese customers wanted.
""This time around we are investing to make sure we have the features, we have the functionalities, we are doing well in tests, we are doing well in customer discussions, so I don't feel that in any way we are put at a disadvantage today,"" he said.

1286,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2018 12:58PM ET</span>",How to make the most of your college tax breaks,"By Gail MarksJarvis
CHICAGO (Reuters) - All that tuition you pay has one silver lining: tax breaks. 
If you want to make sure to be able to claim the most possible when your tax return is due in April, then you may want to make some moves now to prepay some bills or to max out your retirement accounts to lower your income. 
* If you have young kids
Federal tax law changes this year let families use up to $10,000 per year from a 529 college savings plan to pay private school tuition. But beware: Not all states mimic the new federal rules, and you could be hit with state tax penalties or have to pay back past state deductions or credits. Check your state (https:// If your state does copy the new federal law and rewards 529 contributions annually, there might be a new tax opportunity. People can spend some 529 savings for K-12 tuition each year and then replace the sum with new contributions, said Boca Raton, Florida, financial planner Sean Moore. Each year that you make a new contribution you may get a state deduction or credit, Moore said.  When you start using the 529 savings for college, you must follow a key rule, though. If you use the 529 to pay the full cost of tuition in a single year, and then claim the college tax credit for the same year, you could be taxed and penalized on your 529 withdrawals for “double dipping,” according to Joseph Hurley, a co-author of the book, “Savingforcollege.com’s Complete Guide to 529 Plans.” * If you have kids in college The American Opportunity Credit is worth as much as $2,500 per student each year – but only if you have spent enough.   You get 100 percent of the first $2,000 tuition and fees you pay a year; then 25 percent of the next $2,000. If you are under that amount, see if you can pay upcoming bills before 2018 ends.  For the full credit, your individual adjusted income – what is left after deductions like retirement savings and alimony - cannot exceed $80,000 and couples $160,000. Partial credit is possible up to $90,000 for singles and $180,000 for couples. If you are close to the cutoff, saving more for retirement in the next few weeks could bring your income down by thousands of dollars, said Andy Phillips, director of The Tax Institute at H&R Block (NYSE:HRB).  If you are not contributing the maximum amount to your retirement accounts, start there. Then go to health savings accounts (HSAs) or business plans such as SEP IRAs. Not everyone can live with less in their paychecks, but Moore said: “It could be worth living frugally and pulling money from a savings account if available. You get $2,500 of free money.” Moore recently advised a client to put all he could into his 401(k) this year because he turned 50. At that age, people can stash $24,500 a year; not the $18,500 for workers under 50. So Moore told the man to put almost all of his pay into his 401(k) during the last months of the year.  * If you are paying for grad school  If you or a child are in graduate school or taking a course to advance in your job, the Lifetime Learning Credit is worth $2,000, or 20 percent of the first $10,000 you spend. Make sure that you pay enough tuition in 2018 to get the maximum credit, and cut your income if possible below $56,000 if single and $112,000 if married.  You can get a partial credit up to $66,000 for singles and $132,000 if married.  * If you are paying off loans Interest payments may be worth a tax deduction up to $2,500. But keep in mind: Deductions are not as valuable as credits. So before trying to maximize the deduction by lowering income with extra retirement savings, consider the value of getting rid of student loans as quickly as possible. Said Moore: “If you have the extra money, pay down the loan.”

1288,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2018 12:38PM ET</span>",Global regulators hold off designating 'too big to fail' insurers,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Global insurance regulators will put off singling out insurers deemed so important to the financial system that they are required to hold extra capital, in a victory for companies such as American International Group (N:AIG) and  Prudential  (L:PRU).
The International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) said it wants to replace the list of ""too big to fail"" insurers, last published in 2016, with a broader framework from 2020.
In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, regulators identified nine systemically important insurers which then face onerous bank-like capital rules to cover potential losses, increasing costs and potentially reducing shareholder returns.
The industry has long argued it played no major role in the financial crisis and should not be treated in the same way as global banks, which must also hold extra capital.
Nine insurers featured on the list published in 2016:  Aegon  (AS:AEGN), Allianz (DE:ALVG), American International Group,  Aviva  (L:AV),  Axa  (PA:AXAF), MetLife (N:MET), Ping An Insurance Group Co of China (HK:2318) (SS:601318), Prudential Financial Inc (N:PRU), and Prudential in Britain.
The IAIS said it was moving away from a ""binary"" approach of imposing extra measures on a small group of insurers to a ""proportionate"" application of measures targeted at the activities of insurers that lead to systemic risk.
It has proposed a new framework to come into effect in 2020, after which a decision would be made in 2022 on whether to scrap the list altogether.
Insurers on the list had initially been expected to meet mandatory capital requirements known as ""higher loss absorbency"" or HLA from January next year.
But the IAIS said on Wednesday that HLA would not be implemented before the start of 2022, and within the new framework it would only be applied on case-by-case ""intervention"" by supervisors, meaning no automatic application.
The industry has lobbied for regulators to focus on activities rather than issuing extra capital requirements simply because of a company's size.
AIG had to be bailed out by taxpayers in the United States during the financial crisis, but the insurance industry has argued that AIG's problems stemmed from its involvement in complex products linked to home loans rather than mainstream insurance.
Wednesday's announcement follows a decision by regulators in the United States to remove Prudential Financial from their own list of systemically important financial institutions. Met Life won a court battle to remove itself from the U.S. list.
The Financial Stability Board (FSB), which coordinates financial regulation in the Group of 20 economies (G20), said the new framework would provide an enhanced basis for mitigating systemic risk, if implemented properly.
The FSB said it would review in November 2022 whether the list of insurers should be scrapped or, in light of initial implementation of the new framework, be re-established.

LONDON (Reuters) - Emerging market debt rose by $1 trillion to more than $71 trillion in the second quarter, with China accounting for more than 80 percent of that increase, the Institute of International Finance (IIF) said in a report on Wednesday.
The latest numbers from China pointed to a continued issuance boom in the world's second-largest economy, wrote IIF executive managing director Hung Tran.
GRAPHIC: Emerging Markets Redemptions - https://tmsnrt.rs/2PpStgu
""Data suggest that China's total debt surpassed 300 percent (of GDP) in Q3 2018: robust foreign demand for Chinese bonds and the authorities' efforts to support domestic activity have all contributed to this sharp debt buildup,"" Tran wrote.
Developing economies also face record redemptions in the years to come with over $4 trillion of bonds and syndicated loans maturing by end-2020, with as much as a third of that denominated in foreign currencies, the IIF report found.
In Chile, Colombia, Egypt and Nigeria nearly 75 percent of redemptions coming due in that period are for dollar-denominated debt. Mexico, South Africa, Brazil and Turkey also face high dollar financing needs, the IIF said.
GRAPHIC: IIF Global Debt Q2 2018 - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Pt2h9H
Meanwhile, mature markets painted a different picture. Overall global debt levels declined by $1.5 trillion to $247 trillion in the second quarter of 2018, mainly driven by a decline in the financial and government sectors in developed markets, the IIF found.

""Against the backdrop of strong global growth and higher inflation readings across EM and some mature markets, this decline brought the global debt-to-GDP ratio down to 317 percent in Q2,"" IIF wrote.

1297,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2018 12:25PM ET</span>","U.S. Postal Service loss triples, even as package deliveries rise","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Postal Service lost almost $4 billion in 2018 even as package deliveries rose, according to results released on Wednesday, giving U.S. President Donald Trump potential ammunition against Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), which he claims pays too little for the agency's services.
Trump, without presenting evidence, has attacked Amazon repeatedly over the past year, accusing the world's largest online retailer of taking advantage of USPS by not paying enough for deliveries to make the service profitable. 
USPS, an independent agency within the federal government, reported operating revenue of $70.6 billion for fiscal year 2018, which ended on Sept. 30, as sales at its shipping and packages business rose 10 percent. 
However, its net loss more than tripled to $3.9 billion from a loss of $1.2 billion in 2017, hurt by rising pay and benefits and higher transport costs, such as gas prices.
Package delivery, especially for major customer Amazon, has become a key part of USPS's business, but has not been enough to offset the sharp decline in first-class letters caused by the internet and email.
The president does not have the power to determine postal rates. They are set by the Postal Regulatory Commission, an independent government agency with commissioners from both political parties who are selected by the president. That panel raised prices on packages by almost 2 percent in November.
Amazon is run by founder Jeff Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post, a newspaper Trump has repeatedly railed against. It has shown interest in delivering its own packages, and has tested drones for doing so. 

In 2015, Amazon spent $11.5 billion on shipping, 46 percent of its total operating expenses that year. It has not commented publicly on Trump's criticisms.

1300,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2018 12:16PM ET</span>","Blue Apron warns on revenue growth, shares tumble","By Angela Moon and Uday Sampath Kumar
(Reuters) -  Blue Apron Holdings Inc  (N:APRN) on Wednesday said it plans to cut marketing spending, sacrificing possible revenue growth to focus on promoting its meal-kit delivery service to its highest-paying, most profitable customers.
Shares of Blue Apron slid more than 10 percent after the move was revealed in an early-morning conference call that followed disappointing third-quarter results released late on Tuesday, along with a layoff announcement. Shares bounced off session lows but remained down around 5 percent at midday.
Moving into 2019, Blue Apron will spend less on acquiring new customers ""while targeting customers that exhibit the attributes of our best customers,"" Chief Financial Officer Tim Bensley said on the conference call. He added that the company's focus will be on the top 30 percent of its customers.
Spending cuts will allow Blue April to focus on customers with ""proven affinity and retention"" and help it turn its first profit on an adjusted EBITDA basis in the first quarter of 2019, Bensley said.
Late on Tuesday, Blue Apron reported a steep third-quarter revenue decline and disclosed plans to lay off about 4 percent of its workforce.
The six-year-old New York-based company's sales have been declining as it faces intense competition from peers including  HelloFresh SE  (DE:HFGG) as well as grocers selling ready-to-eat meals. Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) entry into the grocery and meal kits businesses has added pressure.
Blue Apron said it expects revenue in the current quarter be similar to third-quarter revenue which fell 28.4 percent to $150.6 million, missing the average analyst forecast of $160.3 million, according to Refinitiv data.

Blue Apron shares were down 5.3 percent in midday trading at $1.15. They debuted at $10 in a June 2017 initial public offering.

1308,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2018 11:37AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Sears finalizing $350 million bankruptcy loan with Great American - sources,"By Mike Spector and Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - Sears Holdings Corp (PK:SHLDQ) is finalizing a deal with financial firm Great American Capital Partners and other lenders for $350 million in critical bankruptcy financing that would keep the U.S. retailer open through the holidays, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. 
The deal would increase an existing financing package from banks to give Sears a bankruptcy loan totaling $650 million, the sources said. Bank lenders already promised $300 million when Sears filed for bankruptcy last month.
The loan discussions come as the 125-year-old retailer has been facing calls to wind down its business from a key group of its creditors, including bondholders and landlords. The creditors believe they will collect more on what they are owed if Sears liquidates its assets, according to bankruptcy-court papers.
The loan from Great American Capital Partners, an affiliate of liquidation specialist Great American Group and financial services firm B. Riley Financial Inc (O:RILY), and its partners would give Sears extra breathing room to seek buyers for its assets. Sears picked Great American's proposal for a bankruptcy loan instead of an offer from hedge funds including Cyrus Capital Partners LP, the sources said.
Sears and the lenders are putting the finishing touches on the deal, and there remained a chance the negotiations could collapse or the terms could change, the sources said.
Representatives for Great American and Cyrus did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Sears spokesman declined to comment.
A U.S. bankruptcy judge is set to hear arguments for approving Sears' bankruptcy loan on Nov. 27. Sears on Thursday plans to ask the judge to approve plans for eventually selling assets.
In exchange for the $350 million loan, Great American and the firms lending with it are expected to receive some Sears collateral previously held by banks to back the new financing, one of the sources said.
Sears Chairman Eddie Lampert, a billionaire who runs hedge fund ESL Investments Inc, is working ""around the clock,"" with possible lenders to finance a bid to keep Sears in business, according to bankruptcy-court papers. 

Lampert, Sears' chief executive until it filed for bankruptcy, has loaned the company billions of dollars over the years, and plans to use some of the money he is owed to finance his offer for company assets, according to court papers.

1309,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2018 11:36AM ET</span>",U.S. annuities sales boom after fiduciary rule kicks the bucket,"By Suzanne Barlyn
(Reuters) - U.S. annuities sales are booming months after the demise of a regulation that targeted the product, which had required that brokers put customers' interests ahead of their own compensation.
Several U.S. insurers reported surging annuities sales when outlining third-quarter results in recent weeks. American International Group Inc's (N:AIG) individual retirement business posted $3.2 billion in annuities sales, a 65 percent jump from the year-ago period. Lincoln National Corp (N:LNC) and  Brighthouse Financial  Inc (O:BHF) detailed gains of 61 percent and 43 percent, respectively.
The companies can thank the end of a Department of Labor regulation known as the fiduciary rule. Announced during the Obama administration, the rule required brokers to act in clients' ""best interest"" when offering retirement advice, and inform them about commissions and other incentives they received for selling products like annuities.
""While the clarity that occurred because the DOL fiduciary rule was vacated did help, we believe the most influential were the economic factors, particularly interest rates,"" said Catherine Theroux, a spokeswoman for LIMRA, an industry group.
A series of interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve this year has allowed insurers to offer consumers higher interest rates for many annuity products, Theroux said.
Total annuity sales were $59.5 billion during the quarter ending June 30, according to Limra Secure Retirement Institute. Sales had not been as high since early 2015, just before the rule was being put in place. 
But the rule effectively died in June, when the Trump administration declined to pursue a U.S. Supreme Court appeal that might have kept it alive. While the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and state regulators are working on their own versions, consumer advocates say they do not expect investors to be as protected, particularly when high-fee annuities are involved.
""It still permits egregious products and egregious sales,"" said Barbara Roper, director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America, about the most recent draft of a National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) proposal.
In the most basic annuity, a customer gives a lump sum of cash to an insurer and receives a payment each month over a set number of years, sometimes for life.
Consumers can benefit from that kind of steady income during retirement, but problems often arise with complex products, like fixed-indexed or variable annuities, Roper said. Investors often do not understand the risks and costs, which can be hidden in the fine print, she said.
Fees for complicated annuities can be 4-9 percent of the principal, industry sources said.
The SEC is working on an investor protection rule it calls ""Regulation Best Interest,"" while the NAIC plans to meet on Thursday in San Francisco to smooth out differences among state regulators for a proposed model rule that other states could later choose to adopt.
The American Council of Life Insurers, an industry group, has said it supports a best-interest standard, but that a new rule should not restrict types of compensation that agents and other sellers may receive nor require them to recommend the least expensive product. 
New York moved ahead of other states in June by issuing a regulation that requires insurance agents and brokers to act in consumers' best interest when selling annuities and life insurance. Although the New York State Department of Financial Services wants others to adopt the rule, which becomes effective in August 2019, the NAIC opposed some of the language.
Iowa Insurance Commissioner Doug Ommen expressed concern about using the term ""best interest"" because it could trigger litigation against insurers and agents, according to minutes of an August meeting.
The NAIC's most recent draft of the rule would require insurers and agents to ""act in the interests of the consumer"" without placing their own financial interests first. It would not require them to recommend the best-priced products.
Birny Birnbaum, executive director of the Center of Economic Justice, said the draft does not go far enough. ""There is nothing in the proposal that forces the consumers' interest ahead of the insurers' interest,"" he said.

1311,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2018 11:20AM ET</span>",Denmark to consider curbs on convicted investors after tax fraud,"By Teis Jensen
COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Denmark will consider new rules to restrict ownership of the country's companies by investors involved in wrongdoing, a government minister said on Wednesday, responding to lawmakers' questions about a tax fraud involving international banks.
Business Minister Rasmus Jarlov made the remarks at a parliamentary hearing on the government's response to a stock trading scam which Danish authorities say tricked the state into paying $2 billion in unwarranted tax rebates.
As inquiries into so-called dividend stripping gather pace around Europe, Danish authorities have already subpoenaed more than 420 companies and people they suspect of involvement, freezing hundreds of millions of euros of assets around the globe.
""The government is completely outraged by the dividend tax case and wants to fight economic crime and the people behind it,"" Jarlov told reporters after the hearing.
The episode has prompted a national debate about ethics in business at a time when the country's biggest lender,  Danske Bank  (CO:DANSKE), has become embroiled in an unrelated money laundering scandal.
In parliament, lawmakers questioned Jarlov about the role of Australia's Macquarie bank (AX:MQG). 
Macquarie said in September that its incoming and outgoing chief executives were expected to be named as suspects by German prosecutors after the bank lent money to investment funds that engaged in dividend stripping.
Macquarie has said it had believed the practice to be legal, and that it was not involved in any such activity in Denmark.
Lawmaker Lisbeth Bech Poulsen asked if it was possible to ""deprive Macquarie of the possibility of working in Denmark"".
Jarlov responded by raising the possibility of ownership curbs on investors involved in wrongdoing.
""I will talk with the justice minister and the tax minister about how we possibly could regulate to what extent persons and companies that have been convicted of serious economic crimes can own companies registered in Denmark,"" he said. 
""I don't think it's ok that you can commit fraud of this magnitude and then continue to operate business in, among other places, Denmark,"" he told reporters later.
Jarlov said the government would need some time to look thoroughly at the area before it would launch any legislation.
Dividend stripping typically involved trading company shares rapidly around a syndicate of banks, investors and hedge funds to create the impression of numerous owners, each of whom was entitled to a tax rebate.
In a briefing to Denmark's tax and business ministers before the parliamentary hearing, extracts from which were seen by Reuters, Macquarie said it had not engaged in any ""multiple claims for withholding tax credits in Denmark"".
It also said it did ""not participate in these transactions today"".
In the dividend stripping scam, Danish tax authorities say they lost $2 billion, while Germany estimates it was tricked out of more than 5 billion euros by a similar ""cum-ex"" method. Other countries, such as Austria and Belgium, were also hit.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board opened an investigative hearing on Wednesday into the fatal engine explosion on a Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) Boeing 737 that killed one passenger.
Dallas-based Southwest has been under scrutiny since an engine on a flight headed from New York to Dallas blew apart in mid-air over Pennsylvania, shattering a plane window, flinging shrapnel and killing passenger Jennifer Riordan, one of 149 people aboard. 
The episode, which has raised concerns about the safety of similar engines, was the first fatality on a U.S. commercial passenger airline since 2009. 
The hearing in Washington turned to a detailed summary of the engine failure on flight 1380, including details of the fan blade design and development history of the engine type that failed, a CFM56-7B made by CFM International, a transatlantic joint-venture between  General Electric  Co (N:GE) and France's  Safran  SA (PA:SAF).
The hearing also focused on engine fan blade inspection methods.
A CFM representative told the NTSB panel that coating condition, lubrication and the length of operating time contributed to the fan blade separation.
The NTSB also released factual findings that disclosed the flight crew had difficulty reaching flight attendants after the engine failed and did not immediately learn that a passenger had been injured. 
The engine on the plane's left side spewed shrapnel when it blew apart, shattering a window and causing rapid cabin depressurization that nearly pulled a female passenger through the hole, the NTSB said.
The NTSB report said two passengers were eventually able to pull the woman, who was still in her seat belt, back inside the plane. 
Representatives from Chicago-based planemaker Boeing (N:BA), and Southwest Airlines were also at the hearing.
""We all have the same goals,"" Southwest said in a statement, ""to share facts, learn what happened, and ensure this type of event never happens again.""
Boeing spokesman Paul Bergman said safety was the planemaker's top priority and it will continue to support the NTSB and provide technical assistance.
A CFM spokeswoman declined comment while the hearing was in process. 

The hearing comes as Indonesian authorities investigate last month's deadly Lion Air crash involving a newer version of Boeing's best-selling single-aisle aircraft, the 737 MAX.

Macy's, which has closed more than 100 stores and cut thousands of jobs since 2015, also reported much better than expected profit for the third quarter ended Nov. 3 thanks to double-digit growth at its online shopping service.
Like other major U.S. retail names, Macy's has had to face plummeting mall traffic and a defection of customers to a new range of online and fast-fashion stores.
In response, the 160-year old company has invested heavily in its off-price Backstage stores, loyalty program, mobile app and website, while also improving brick-and-mortar stores by equipping them with mobile checkouts and new shop layouts.
Even with all of the upbeat numbers in Wednesday's release, shares in the company rose 1 percent at opening. They are up around 40 percent this year but still worth only half what they were at a peak in 2015.
""There is still a lot of work to do with physical stores,"" said Neil Saunders, an analyst at research firm GlobalData Retail. ""We are conscious that Macy's has a long tail of underinvested-in properties, many of which are underperforming and do not reflect the company's latest thinking."" 
Sales from Macy's stores and third-party licensees open for more than 12 months rose for the fourth straight quarter to 3.3 percent. That topped analysts' average estimate of a 2.82 percent increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Macy's now expects adjusted earnings of between $4.10 and $4.30 per share in fiscal year 2018, compared with an earlier forecast of $3.95 to $4.15 per share. 
""We have the right merchandise, the right marketing and the right customer experiences in place to deliver a strong fourth quarter,"" Chief Executive Officer Jeff Gennette said in a statement.
""Our strategic initiatives are gaining momentum and delivering results.""
The owner of the Macy's and Bloomingdale's chains said net income attributable to shareholders rose to $62 million in the third quarter from $30 million a year earlier.

Excluding one-time items, Macy's earned 27 cents per share, nearly two times analysts' average estimate of 14 cents. Net sales rose 2.3 percent to $5.40 billion, matching expectations.

The company said liabilities related to the wildfires could exceed its recently renewed insurance cover, adding to the severe financial pressure it is already facing.
The utility has already withdrawn $3 billion from its credit line in anticipation of fire-related liabilities, leaving it with no additional money available under its credit agreements, it said in a filing.
The Camp wildfire, which has killed nearly 48 people, is being investigated, and PG&E told regulators it experienced problems with transmission lines or substations in areas around the time the blazes were reported to have started.
NBC said in a report https://nbcnews.to/2K4tvNZ on Tuesday that a day before the fire started, PG&E emailed a local landowner about ""problems with sparks"" and the need for workers to enter her property and work on the high-power lines. The company, however, was unable to address the issue as the landowner was out of town, the report said.
The company said in the filing it had renewed liability insurance coverage for wildfire events of about $1.4 billion for the period from Aug. 1 through July 31, 2019.
PG&E did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The company already faces billions of dollars in potential payouts from lawsuits after California said PG&E's power lines were responsible for sparking last year's wildfires.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. corporate bonds are by far the most dangerous part of the bond market and more than half of triple-B-rated debt would have a below-investment-grade rating based on leverage alone, Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive officer of DoubleLine Capital, warned on an investor webcast on Tuesday. 
Gundlach said investment-grade corporates got to the most overvalued levels in the history of the U.S. bond market last September and have since been underperforming the broad bond market against the rising-rate environment. In recent weeks, corporate bond funds have been posting cash withdrawals with the four-week moving average at $341 million, Lipper said.
""A lot of sectors look rich but the one that looks by far the worst - and is the worst - are corporate bonds,"" said Gundlach, who oversees more than $123 billion in assets. ""Ultimately, should a recession ever arrive, junk bonds will be particularly dangerous.""
The U.S. corporate economy is weighed down by ""a lot of leverage"" as well as ongoing deterioration in the credit quality of the investment-grade market, he said. 
Gundlach said the U.S. corporate bond market is at its most vulnerable point to date and a wave of rating downgrades would be hard for the market to absorb. ""If rates rise, you aren't going to be very happy,"" he said about further total return losses. 
Gundlach said there are bear markets in homebuilders, autos and banks. ""We're starting to see a real decline in home prices from the major areas. That's going to be a growing narrative because of the lack of deductibility for property taxes and state taxes in many of the high-cost areas. In many areas, inventories of homes are piling up. It's really going up at a real rapid rate."" 

Gundlach again raised red flags on the ""suicide mission"" the Federal Reserve has taken on with exploding deficits. Gundlach, who voted for President Donald Trump, said the driver of U.S. economic growth is deficit spending and borrowing from the future. ""It is very bad that the deficit is rising"" late in this economic cycle, he said.

The Smiths Falls, Ontario-based pot producer said revenue jumped 33 percent to C$23.3 million ($17.6 million) in the fiscal second quarter ended Sept. 30, short of the average analyst estimate of C$59.1 million. Shares fell 9 percent in early trading in New York.
Canopy, the second-largest pot stock by market value, sold 2,197 kilograms at an average price of C$9.87 a gram in the quarter, up from 2,020 kilograms at C$7.99 a year earlier. That contrasted with Cronos Group Inc. and Tilray Inc., which both reported lower average selling prices on Tuesday.
Despite severe supply shortages across Canada since legalization, Canopy said it’s on track to meet its supply commitments to the provinces. The average number of kilograms shipped on a daily basis during the first 12 days of November more than doubled compared with the period from Oct. 17 to 31 and its products accounted for more than 30 percent of listings in physical store networks across the country, the company said.

EU confidential documents show countries had agreed a preliminary common stance on the reform proposed by the European Commission in September which would give more powers to the European Banking Authority (EBA) to counter financial crime.
But one EU source said states were still divided on this issue and it was unclear whether they could reach a deal by the next meeting of EU finance ministers scheduled on Dec. 4.
A second source said there was no preliminary deal and talks will be held on the issue at a meeting of EU envoys next week.
If the new rules are not adopted before EU elections in May, they risk being shelved. A deal among EU states must be followed by a compromise with the EU Parliament in a process that usually takes several weeks.
Under the Commission's proposal, the EBA would be given new powers to force national supervisors to investigate cases of suspected breaches of rules to prevent money laundering.
In exceptional cases, when national supervisors do not act within set deadlines, the EBA could take measures against a bank.
At a closed-door meeting in September, the minutes of which have been reviewed by Reuters, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Sweden and Finland were among EU states that urged not to act ""prematurely"" on the Commission's proposed overhaul.
The reform does not address loopholes that give states large discretion on imposing sanctions. Nor does it create a dedicated agency to counter money laundering at the EU or euro zone level, as proposed by the European Central Bank.
In addition to the supervision reform, EU states are discussing a plan expected to be finalised in December that lists non-legislative actions to be taken over the coming months to prevent and counter money laundering. 
The action plan, of which Reuters has seen a preliminary draft, mandates the European Central Bank and the Commission to review by mid-2019 recent money laundering cases at EU banks.

Some EU states that are more opposed to the reform are pushing for introducing legislative changes only after the review is completed, a third EU source said.

1329,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2018 08:31AM ET</span>",Special Report: How ZTE helps Venezuela create China-style social control,"By Angus Berwick
Caracas (Reuters) - In April 2008, former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez dispatched Justice Ministry officials to visit counterparts in the Chinese technology hub of Shenzhen. Their mission, according to a member of the Venezuela delegation, was to learn the workings of China's national identity card program. 
Chavez, a decade into his self-styled socialist revolution, wanted help to provide ID credentials to the millions of Venezuelans who still lacked basic documentation needed for tasks like voting or opening a bank account. Once in Shenzhen, though, the Venezuelans realized a card could do far more than just identify the recipient.
There, at the headquarters of Chinese telecom giant ZTE Corp (HK:0763), they learned how China, using smart cards, was developing a system that would help Beijing track social, political and economic behavior. Using vast databases to store information gathered with the card's use, a government could monitor everything from a citizen's personal finances to medical history and voting activity.
""What we saw in China changed everything,"" said the member of the Venezuelan delegation, technical advisor Anthony Daquin. His initial amazement, he said, gradually turned to fear that such a system could lead to abuses of privacy by Venezuela's government. ""They were looking to have citizen control.""
The following year, when he raised concerns with Venezuelan officials, Daquin told Reuters, he was detained, beaten and extorted by intelligence agents. They knocked several teeth out with a handgun and accused him of treasonous behavior, Daquin said, prompting him to flee the country.
Government spokespeople had no comment on Daquin's account.
The project languished. 
But 10 years after the Shenzhen trip, Venezuela is rolling out a new, smart-card ID known as the ""carnet de la patria,"" or ""fatherland card."" The ID transmits data about cardholders to computer servers. The card is increasingly linked by the government to subsidized food, health and other social programs most Venezuelans rely on to survive.
And ZTE, whose role in the fatherland project is detailed here for the first time, is at the heart of the program. 
As part of a $70 million government effort to bolster ""national security,"" Venezuela last year hired ZTE to build a fatherland database and create a mobile payment system for use with the card, according to contracts reviewed by Reuters.
A team of ZTE employees is now embedded in a special unit within Cantv, the Venezuelan state telecommunications company that manages the database, according to four current and former Cantv employees.
The fatherland card is troubling some citizens and human-rights groups who believe it is a tool for Chavez's successor, President Nicolas Maduro, to monitor the populace and allocate scarce resources to his loyalists. 
""It's blackmail,"" Hector Navarro, one of the founders of the ruling Socialist Party and a former minister under Chavez, said of the fatherland program. ""Venezuelans with the cards now have more rights than those without.""
In a phone interview, Su Qingfeng, the head of ZTE's Venezuela unit, confirmed ZTE sold Caracas servers for the database and is developing the mobile payment application. The company, he said, violated no Chinese or local laws and has no role in how Venezuela collects or uses cardholder data.
""We don't support the government,"" he said. ""We are just developing our market.""
An economic meltdown in Venezuela is causing hyperinflation, widespread shortages of food and medicines, and a growing exodus of desperate citizens. Maduro has been sanctioned by the United States and is criticized by governments from France to Canada as increasingly autocratic.
In that, critics say, Maduro has an ally. The fatherland card, they argue, illustrates how China, through state-linked companies like ZTE, exports technological know-how that can help like-minded governments track, reward and punish citizens. 
The database, according to employees of the card system and screenshots of user data reviewed by Reuters, stores such details as birthdays, family information, employment and income, property owned, medical history, state benefits received, presence on social media, membership of a political party and whether a person voted.
So far, the government's disclosure of ZTE's involvement in the fatherland project has been limited to a passing reference in a February 2017 press release that credited the company with helping to ""fortify"" the underlying database.
Venezuela's government didn't respond to requests for comment for this article. Nadia Perez, a spokeswoman for Cantv, the state-run telecoms firm, declined to comment and Manuel Fernandez, the company's president, didn't respond to emails or text messages from Reuters. China's Justice Ministry and its embassy in Caracas didn't respond to requests for comment.
Although ZTE is publicly traded, a Chinese state company is its largest shareholder and the government is a key client. ZTE has run afoul of Washington before for dealings with authoritarian governments. 
The company this year paid $1 billion to settle with the U.S. Commerce Department, one of various penalties after ZTE shipped telecommunications equipment to Iran and North Korea, violating U.S. sanctions and export laws. The Commerce action was sparked by a 2012 Reuters report that ZTE sold Iran a surveillance system, which included U.S. components, to spy on telecommunications by its citizens.
Legal experts in the United States said it is unclear whether ZTE and other companies that supply the fatherland system are violating U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan leaders by providing tools that critics believe strengthen the government's grip on power.
Fernandez, the Cantv president, is one of the targets of those sanctions because of the telecom company's censorship of the internet in Venezuela, according to a U.S. Treasury Department statement. But the prohibitions thus far are meant primarily to thwart business with Maduro and other top officials themselves, not regular commerce in Venezuela. 
Still, U.S. lawmakers and other critics of Maduro's rule are concerned about ZTE's role in Venezuela. ""China is in the business of exporting its authoritarianism,"" U.S. Senator Marco Rubio told Reuters in an email. ""The Maduro regime's increasing reliance on ZTE in Venezuela is just the latest example of the threat that Chinese state-directed firms pose to U.S. national security interests.""
To understand how the fatherland card works and how it came to be, Reuters reviewed confidential contracts and internal government documents related to its development. Reporters also interviewed dozens of current and former employees of ZTE, Venezuela's government and Cantv, or Compania Anonima Nacional Telefonos de Venezuela, as the company is formally known.
They confirmed details of the project and the outlines of Daquin's account of its origins.
""AN ATTEMPT TO CONTROL ME""
Maduro for the past year has urged citizens to sign up for the new card, calling it essential to ""build the new Venezuela."" As many as 18 million people, over half the population, already have, according to government figures.
""With this card, we are going to do everything from now on,"" Maduro said on state television last December.
To encourage its adoption, the government has granted cash prizes to cardholders for performing civic duties, like rallying voters. It has also given one-time payouts, such as awarding moms enrolled in the card a Mother's Day bonus of about $2. The payment, last May, was nearly a monthly minimum wage – enough to buy a carton of eggs, given the current pace of inflation.
Maduro is also taking steps to force the card's adoption. The government now says Venezuelans need it to receive public benefits including medicine, pensions, food baskets and subsidized fuel. In August, retirees protested outside social security offices and complained the fatherland rule limits access to hard-won pensions.
Benito Urrea, a 76-year-old diabetic, told Reuters a state doctor recently denied him an insulin prescription and called him ""right wing"" because he hasn't enrolled. Like some other Venezuelan citizens, especially those who oppose the Maduro administration, Urrea sees the card with suspicion.
""It was an attempt to control me via my needs,"" Urrea said in his Caracas apartment. Reuters was unable to contact the doctor.
Using the servers purchased from ZTE, the government is creating a database some citizens fear is identifying Venezuelans who support the government and those who don't.
Some of the information, such as health data, is gathered with card usage. Some is obtained when citizens enroll. Cardholders and local human rights groups told Reuters that administrators ask questions about income, political activities and social media profiles before issuing the card.
Civil servants are facing particular pressure to enroll, according to more than a dozen state workers.
When scanning their cards during a presidential election last May, employees at several government offices were told by bosses to message photos of themselves at polls back to managers, they said. A Justice Ministry document reviewed by Reuters featured a list of state employees who didn't vote. 
After Chavez became president in 1999, he sought to empower ""invisible"" Venezuelans who couldn't access basic services. In the following years, more citizens received documentation, but the cards were fragile and easily forged, according to a 2007 Justice Ministry report.
The report, reviewed by Reuters, recommended a new, microchip-enabled card that would be harder to counterfeit. No such effort got underway. 
That December, after nearly a decade of soaring popularity, Chavez suffered his first electoral defeat, losing a referendum to scrap term limits. Oil prices plummeted shortly thereafter, hammering the economy.
Chavez worked to appease his working-class base, including throngs still lacking identity credentials. He sent Daquin, the top information security advisor at the Justice Ministry, to China.
The technology Daquin and colleagues learned about in Shenzhen underpinned what would become China's ""Social Credit System.""
The still-evolving system, part of which uses ""smart citizen cards"" developed by ZTE, grades citizens based on behavior including financial solvency and political activity. Good behavior can earn citizens discounts on utilities or loans. Bad marks can get them banned from public transport or their kids blocked from top schools.
ZTE executives showed the Venezuelans smart cards embedded with radio-frequency identification, or RFID, a technology that enables monitors through radio waves to track location and data. Other cards used so-called Quick Response, or QR, codes, the matrix barcodes now commonly used to store and process information.
After the trip, Venezuela turned to Cuba, its closest ally, and asked for help creating its own version of RFID cards. ""The new goal was Big Data,"" Daquin said.
In June 2008, Venezuela agreed to pay a Cuban state company $172 million to develop six million of the cards, according to a copy of the contract. Cuban government officials didn't respond to questions about the agreement.
By 2009, Daquin grew uneasy about the potential for abuses of citizens' privacy.
He expressed those concerns to officials including Vladimir Padrino, a general at the time and now Venezuela's defense minister. The Defense Ministry didn't respond to phone calls, emails or a letter presented by Reuters for comment.
On the morning of Nov. 12, at his local Caracas bakery, six armed officials in uniforms of Venezuela's national intelligence agency awaited Daquin, he told Reuters.
They showed him photos of his daughter and forced him to drive east toward the town of Guatire. Off a back road, Daquin said, they beat him with pistols, forced a handgun into his mouth and dislodged several teeth, still missing.
""Why are you betraying the revolution?"" one asked.
They demanded $100,000 for his release, Daquin said.
Daquin, who says he had been saving for years to buy property, went home, pulled cash from a safe and delivered it to the men. That evening, he booked a flight for himself, his wife and their three children to the United States, where he has lived since, working as an information security consultant.
His brother, Guy, who also lives in the United States, confirmed Daquin's account. Documentation reviewed by Reuters corroborates his role at the ministry, and people familiar with Daquin's work confirmed his involvement in the card project.
After Daquin fled, the Cuban contract went nowhere, according to another former advisor. 
In March 2013, Chavez died. Maduro, his heir as Socialist Party candidate, was elected president the next month. The lingering oil crash dragged Venezuela into recession.
""WE'LL FIND OUT"" 
With hunger increasing, the government in 2016 launched a program to distribute subsidized food packages. It hired Soltein SA de CV, a company based in Mexico, to design an online platform to track them, according to documents reviewed by Reuters. The platform was the beginning of the database now used for the fatherland system.
Soltein's directors, according to LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profiles, are mostly former Cuban state employees. A person who answered a telephone listed for Soltein denied the firm worked on the fatherland system. A woman at the company's registered address in the resort city of Cancun told Reuters she had never heard of Soltein.
The system worked. Nearly 90 percent of the country's residents now receive the food packages, according to a study published in February by Andres Bello Catholic University and two other universities.
Now more satisfied with its ability to track handouts, the government sought to know more about the recipients, according to people involved in the project. So it turned back to ZTE.
The Chinese company, now in Venezuela for about a decade, has over 100 employees working in two floors of a Caracas skyscraper. It first worked with Cantv, the telecommunications company, to enable television programming online.
Like many state enterprises in Venezuela, Cantv has grown starved for investment. ZTE became a key partner, taking on many projects that once would have fallen to Cantv itself, people familiar with both companies said. 
ZTE is helping the government build six emergency response centers monitoring Venezuela's major cities, according to a 2015 press release. In 2016, ZTE began centralizing video surveillance for the government around the country, according to current and former employees.
In its final push for the fatherland cards, the government no longer considered RFID, according to people familiar with the effort. The location-tracking technology was too costly. 
Instead, it asked ZTE for help with QR codes, the black-and-white squares smartphone users can scan to get directed to web sites. ZTE developed the codes, at a cost of less than $3 per account, and the government printed the cards, linking them to the Soltein database, these people said. 
In a phone call with Reuters in September, Su, the head of ZTE's Venezuela business, confirmed the company's card deal with Cantv. He declined to answer follow-up questions.
Maduro introduced the cards in December 2016. In a televised address, he held one up, thanked China for lending unspecified support and said ""everybody must get one.""
The ID system, still running on the Soltein platform, hadn't yet migrated to ZTE servers. Disaster soon struck. In May 2017, hackers broke into the fatherland database.
The hack was carried out by anonymous anti-Maduro activists known as TeamHDP. The group's leader, Twitter handle @YoSoyJustincito, said the hack was ""extremely simple"" and motivated by TeamHDP's mission to expose Maduro secrets.
The hacker, who spoke to Reuters by text message, declined to be identified and said he is no longer in Venezuela. A Cantv manager who later helped migrate the database to ZTE servers confirmed details of the breach. 
During the hack, TeamHDP took screenshots of user data and deleted the accounts of government officials, including Maduro. The president later appeared on television scanning his card and receiving an error message: ""This person doesn't exist.""
Screenshots of the information embedded in various card accounts, shared by TeamHDP with Reuters, included phone numbers, emails, home addresses, participation at Socialist Party events and even whether a person owns a pet. People familiar with the database said the screenshots appear authentic.
Shortly after the hack, Maduro signed a $70 million contract with Cantv and a state bank for ""national security"" projects. These included development of a ""centralized fatherland database"" and a mobile app to process payments, such as the discounted cost of a subsidized food box, associated with the card.
""Imperialist and unpatriotic factions have tried to harm the nation's security,"" the contract reads. 
It says an undisclosed portion of the funding would come from the Venezuela China Joint Fund, a bilateral financing program. A related contract, also reviewed by Reuters, assigns the database and payment app projects to ZTE. The document doesn't disclose how much of the $70 million would go to the Chinese company.
ZTE declined to comment on financial details of its business in Venezuela. Neither the Venezuelan nor the Chinese government responded to Reuters queries about the contracts.
In July 2017, Soltein transferred ownership of fatherland data to Cantv, project documents show. A team of a dozen ZTE developers began bolstering the database's capacity and security, current and former Cantv employees said.
Among other measures, ZTE installed data storage units built by U.S.-based Dell Technologies Inc, according to one ZTE document. Dell spokeswoman Lauren Lee said ZTE is a client in China but that Dell doesn't sell equipment to ZTE in Venezuela. She said Dell reviewed its transactions in Venezuela and wasn't aware of any sale to Cantv, either.
""Dell is committed to compliance with all applicable laws where we do business,"" Lee said in an email. ""We expect our customers, partners and suppliers to follow these same laws.""
In May, Venezuela held elections that were widely discredited by foreign governments after Maduro banned several opposition parties. 
Ahead of the vote, ruling party officials urged voters to be ""grateful"" for government largesse dispensed via the fatherland cards. They set up ""red point"" kiosks near voting booths, where voters could scan their cards and register, Maduro himself promised, for a ""fatherland prize.""
Those who scanned their cards later received a text message thanking them for supporting Maduro, according to several cardholders and one text message reviewed by Reuters. The prizes for voting, however, were never issued, cardholders and people familiar with the system said.
Current and former Cantv employees say the database registers if, but not how, a person voted. Still, some voters were led to believe the government would know. The belief is having a chilling effect.
One organizer of a food handout committee in the west-central city of Barinas said government managers had instructed her and colleagues to tell recipients their votes could be tracked. ""We'll find out if you voted for or against,"" she said she told them.
State workers say they are a target. 
An internal Cantv presentation from last year said the system can feed information from the database to ministries to help ""generate statistics and take decisions."" After the vote, government offices including Banco Bicentenario del Pueblo, a state bank, sent Cantv lists with employees' names to determine whether they had voted, according to the manager who helped set up the servers.
Banco Bicentenario didn't respond to a request for comment. Officials at the Economy Ministry, which the bank reports to, didn't respond to requests, either.
With personal data now so available, some citizens fear they can lose more than just their jobs, said Mariela Magallanes, an opposition lawmaker who headed a commission that last year investigated how the fatherland card was being linked to the subsidized food program.

The government, the commission said in a report, is depriving some citizens of the food boxes because they don’t possess the card. ""The government knows exactly who is most vulnerable to pressure,"" she said.

LONDON (Reuters) - The draft Brexit deal agreed between Britain and the European Union won't stop banks in London pushing ahead with relocation plans because the agreement is far from being ratified, UK financial sector officials said on Wednesday.
The deal agreed between Britain and Brussels on Tuesday includes a ""business-as-usual"" transition period from March to the end of 2020.
But UK ministers and parliament - or the EU itself - have yet to ratify the deal, whose details are dividing the ruling Conservative Party of Prime Minister Theresa May.
""The announcement that a draft Brexit agreement has been reached between the UK and EU is a step forward, but there is still a long way to go before the deal is done,"" said Catherine McGuinness, chairman of the City of London financial district.
Banks, insurers and asset managers in Britain are opening new EU hubs to avoid disruption to cross-border services next March, regardless of whether there will be a transition period.
""Our clients are continuing with their planning and execution,"" said Joe Cassidy, financial services Brexit lead at consultants KPMG.
""Everybody knows we are just at the beginning and not at the end, and a lot could happen in the intervening period.""
Other industry source said only a legally binding divorce settlement and transition period would prompt banks to pause relocation plans.
""We are not there yet. Until we are, we would expect firms, regulators and governments to continue to prepare for all outcomes, including a no deal scenario,"" the source said.
McGuinness said EU regulators should in the meantime urgently mirror efforts by UK regulators to address potential no-deal ""cliff-edges in markets.
The European Commission published on Tuesday its no-Brexit contingency plans that include allowing EU customers to continue clearing derivatives contracts in London.
""It's reassuring to hear increasing acknowledgment that these issues need dealing with but we need firm action, not just words. Firms cannot tackle these issues alone in the time remaining,"" McGuinness said.
Cassidy said the plans from Brussels lack detail in some areas, a reflection of how negotiations between Britain and the EU continue.
""It's a good direction of travel,"" Cassidy said.
Swiss bank UBS told CNBC on Wednesday that the next few weeks will be very important for Britain's financial markets, whose biggest customer is the EU.

""We're prepared for the worst, and we hope for the best,"" said Axel Weber, chairman of UBS, which is spending 100 million Swiss francs on moving some of its 5,000 staff in London to Frankfurt.

MILAN (Reuters) - Oil prices bounced from multi-month lows on Wednesday but stocks fell as disappointing data heightened worries over slowing global growth, while the pound wavered as Prime Minister Theresa May faced the hard task of selling her Brexit deal.
European shares hit a two-week low after data showed the German economy contracted for the first time since 2015, tracking similar losses in Asia where data in Japan and China underscored worries about weaker growth.
They later pared some losses after Reuters reported that OPEC and its partners were discussing a proposal to cut output, helping oil prices reverse opening losses and putting an end to their longest losing streak in decades.
The MSCI's world equity index (MIWD00000PUS) remained on track for its fifth day of losses in a row, but reduced its decline to 0.1 percent by 1243 GMT. 
The pan-European STOXX (STOXX) benchmark index was down 0.2 percent, while U.S. stock index futures pointed to a flat open.
Sterling fell from the 7-month high versus the euro  and eased below $1.30  in volatile trading after being boosted from news that Britain and the European Union agreed on the text of a Brexit divorce deal.
""After 873 days of bickering, point scoring, intransigence on both sides, and seemingly irreconcilable differences, we finally have a deal,"" said  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategist Jim Reid.
""Now this easy part is out of the way along comes the hard part of selling it to a divided Parliament full of vested interests and factions,"" he added in a note.
Before seeking UK parliamentary approval before exiting the bloc on March 29, 2019, May will try to persuade senior ministers to accept the deal that opponents said would imperil her own government and threaten national unity.
The British cabinet is due to meet at 1400 GMT.
Although sterling softened from peaks hit in the previous session, investors were anticipating wild swings ahead for the British currency. Sterling/dollar  implied overnight volatility jumped to 23 percent, its highest since a general election in June 2017.
""We are cognizant that the recent provisional deal is only a step in the right direction and if it does not pass the meaningful vote the opposite scenario is likely to play out,"" said Richard Larner, Head of Research at Brooks Macdonald.
""In this event, investors will begin to price a no-deal situation into investment markets,"" he added. 
OIL BOUNCES AFTER LONG LOSING STREAK
Meanwhile, oil attempted to rebound after plunging around 7 percent the previous session, with surging supply and the specter of faltering demand scaring off investors. 
The growing prospect of OPEC and allied producers cutting output at a meeting next month however propped up the market, helping U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) trade 0.3 percent at $55.9 a barrel and reverse opening losses.
According to three sources familiar with the issue, OPEC and its partners are discussing a proposal to cut oil output by up to 1.4 million barrels per day for 2019, to avert an oversupply that would weaken prices.
In the previous session, U.S. crude futures suffered 12 straight sessions of losses. 
""We went through our archives yesterday and found a bit more daily data back to 1977, and we still can't find a losing run of this magnitude,"" said Deutsche Bank's Reid.
Brent crude oil futures (LCOc1) also bounced, up 0.9 percent, at $66.05 per barrel. In the previous session they hit an eight month low following a 25 percent slide from the four-year high reached early in October. 
Energy stocks (SXEP) in Europe also recovered ground but remained in negative territory, down 0.4 percent. 
The oil plunge underlined cracks in the global economy.
The German economy shrank 0.2 percent in the third quarter as global trade disputes and problems in the auto industry threw the traditional export growth engine into reverse. Earlier in the day, data from Japan confirmed the world's third-largest economy contracted in the third quarter. 
ITALIAN BUDGET WOES
Still in currency markets, the euro (EUR=) struggled below $1.13 as Italy re-submitted its draft budget for next year to the European Commission with the same growth and deficit assumptions that had been rejected by Brussels.
""While boosting its privatization plan and committing to mitigate spending overshoots, the Italian government did not change its deficit targets. This will likely lead the European Commission to recommend an infringement procedure,"" said  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts.
Concerns over the Italian budget also spread to debt markets with yields on Italian government bonds hitting three-week highs, widening the gap over top-rated German peers, while shares in Italian banks (FTIT8300) fell 1.3 percent. 

In commodities, base metals eased slightly as weak retail sales data from top consumer China took the shine off upbeat industrial output and investment figures in the country.

1335,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2018 08:10AM ET</span>",Factbox: Timeline and sanctions if EU starts disciplinary budget steps against Italy,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Italy's budget dispute with Brussels is set to escalate in coming weeks, after Rome decided not to revise its free-spending plans despite European Union warnings that its budget is in breach of EU fiscal rules.
The European Commission could begin disciplinary proceedings as early as next week. The process could eventually lead to fines, a freeze of EU funds and to EU monitoring of Italy's issuance of new sovereign bonds.
The opening of what is called an excessive deficit procedure would be the first step in a long legal dispute that is likely to increase market pressure on Italy until it is resolved.
In October the Commission, in an unprecedented move, asked Italy to revise its draft budget for next year, saying the plan violated EU rules as it was likely to fail to decrease the country's huge pile of public debt.
Rome has a debt of more than 130 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). Euro zone states have repeatedly supported the Commission's stance.
Despite the EU warnings and market turmoil that increased Rome's debt servicing costs, Italy's eurosceptic government stuck to its plan to increase its budget deficit to 2.4 percent of GDP next year and raise its structural deficit too. 
It confirmed this line in a letter sent to the Commission on Nov. 13, offering only a pledge to sell more public assets if the deficit went above the 2.4 percent target.
Rome said its debt would fall because Italy would grow faster thanks to more spending, and made no concessions on the structural deficit which is to rise 0.8 percent of GDP next year, instead of falling 0.6 percent as required by EU rules. 
Below the possible next steps:
Nov. 21: The Commission could decide to adopt a report saying Italy is in breach of EU fiscal rules because of its high debt. It is currently assessing whether relevant factors, including Italy's debt in the long term, can be taken into account to justify the fiscal deviation.
Nov. 26-30: If the Commission adopts its debt report on Italy on Nov. 21, euro zone envoys could decide this week to endorse it. They would have until Dec. 5 to do so.
After euro zone envoys back the debt report, the Commission could at any time recommend the formal opening of a disciplinary procedure. This could in principle happen already this week, but the Commission could also take more time to prepare its recommendation. 
Dec. 3: Euro zone finance ministers meet for a regular monthly meeting in which they are likely to step up their pressure on Rome. 
If the Commission has already made its recommendation to open disciplinary proceedings against Italy, euro zone ministers could decide whether to endorse the recommendation at this meeting. This would be the formal start of a disciplinary procedure.
Dec. 13-14: EU leaders meet for their regular end-of-the-year summit in Brussels and will probably express criticism against Italy's budget moves, but this would play no part in the formal disciplinary process.
Jan. 21: Euro zone finance ministers meet for their first regular monthly meeting of the year. If they have not already decided on a disciplinary procedure at their December meeting, they could take the decision at this meeting.
Italy could be required to correct its excessive deviation from fiscal targets within three months from the launch of a disciplinary procedure. A failure to act could trigger sanctions, which have so far never been imposed on any euro zone country.
The decision on possible sanctions is likely to take into account the political impact it could have ahead of a European parliamentary election in May.
May 23-26: European Parliament election. EU officials have said that if sanctions decisions are not made before the election, they could be shelved indefinitely. 
POSSIBLE SANCTIONS
As a precautionary measure, Brussels could ask Italy to set aside a non-interest bearing deposit of 0.2 percent of its GDP. This decision could be made within 20 days from the formal opening of a disciplinary procedure, which could happen as early as Dec. 3 if the Commission and euro zone states decided to move very quickly against Italy. 
Once the procedure is opened, the Commission could also set a deadline as early as March for Italy to take action to reduce its debt.
Missing that deadline could trigger harsher sanctions, including an actual fine of up to 0.2 percent of GDP, the suspension of billions of euros in EU funds and closer fiscal monitoring by the European Commission and the European Central Bank, involving missions in Italy similar to those in bailed-out countries like Greece.

If it continued to fail to cooperate, Rome could face even stricter penalties under EU rules. They might include a fine of up to 0.5 percent of GDP, a cut of multi-billion-euro loans from the European Investment Bank of which Italy was the EU's largest beneficiary last year, and EU precautionary monitoring over Italy's plans to issue new debt.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Bain Capital Ventures, the venture capital division of the eponymous Boston-based investment firm, said it has raised a new $1 billion fund to invest in startups, adding to a year of big-dollar fund-raising by tech investors.
Bain Capital Ventures, which has backed LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) and Jet.com, told Reuters that $650 million would go into a fund used mostly for early-stage investments, backing young startups with unproven business models, the firm's sweet spot.
""We've invested from PowerPoint slides,"" said Enrique Salem, a managing director at Bain Capital Ventures who invests in cyber security startups. ""You have to have conviction with very little data.""
Another $250 million will be used for larger investments in growth-stage companies. Separately, the firm's partners put in $100 million.
This is Bain's eighth fund. Recent successful initial public offerings by Bain-backed companies helped the venture firm attract more than enough interest from investors to round out the $1 billion fund, Salem said.
Those IPOs include DocuSign's $629 million debut in April and SendGrid's $131 million offering last year. DocuSign's stock price is up 47 percent from its IPO, and SendGrid, which has agreed to be acquired by Twilio for $2 billion, is up nearly three times from its IPO price. Bain first invested in DocuSign when it was valued at $1.6 billion; the company went public with a $4.4 billion valuation.
Bain joins a spate of venture fund raising this year, with $32 billion raised across 230 U.S.-based funds through the third quarter, putting 2018 on pace to beat last year, according to data firm PitchBook Inc. And firms are investing these funds at a faster pace -- VCs invested more than $83 billion in the first three quarters this year, more than any full year of investment going back a decade, according to PitchBook.
Venture funds are growing larger, too, as investors face stiff competition from SoftBank Group Corp's Vision Fund, a $93 billion investment vehicle that has rattled the venture world. 
Salem says Bain has rebuffed that strategy and the $650 million fund is consistent with previous fund sizes. However, Bain introduced its additional growth fund in 2014, just as competition grew for tech deals. That fund helped make Bain among the most active late-stage investors in the third quarter, according to PitchBook. 

Bain raises money from university endowments and large family offices in the United States and Europe. While it is an affiliate of Bain Capital, the private equity firm co-founded by one-time Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney is not an investor.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's top financial regulator said Samsung BioLogics Co Ltd (KS:207940) had intentionally breached accounting rules ahead of its 2016 listing, leading to a suspension in trading of the biotech firm's shares and a review of its listing status.
The Financial Services Commission (FSC), which has been reviewing the matter after a complaint by an activist group and politicians that the Samsung Group arm unfairly inflated its value, also called for Samsung BioLogics' CEO to be fired.
The disciplinary action is a blow to South Korea's biggest conglomerate, which is banking on biopharmaceuticals for growth and announced plans in August to invest 25 trillion won ($22 billion) in the business and in other areas such as artificial intelligence and 5G mobile technology. 
It also comes at an awkward time for the group, as heir Jay Y.Lee is awaiting a Supreme Court ruling on bribery charges and politicians are calling for transparency in its governance.
Critics have said Samsung BioLogics breached accounting standards by switching the valuation method of its stake in a joint venture in 2015 to inflate profits before listing a year later. 
BioLogics shares have slumped 30 percent since the regulators began a review into the allegations in May, leading to a loss of about $9 billion in market value.
BioLogics has denied wrongdoing, citing an agreement with its U.S. partner as the reason for valuing its stake in the joint venture at fair market value instead of at book value.
After FSC's decision on Wednesday, BioLogics repeated its denial, and said it would file an administrative lawsuit against the regulator. 
The Korea Exchange said in a statement the suspension in trading of BioLogics shares would continue for at least 15 business days while the bourse conducts a review which could lead to de-listing. 
The bourse, however, said there had been no case of de-listing so far in South Korea over violation of accounting standards.
The FSC also fined BioLogics 8 billion won ($7 million) for the breaches and sent the case to state prosecutors.
Kim Yong-beom, vice chairman of the FSC, said the company ""abnormally"" adopted different accounting rules to avoid depreciation of the company's value should a U.S. partner exercise a call option to boost its stake in the venture. 
He also said the company was wrong in not recognizing the call option earlier when it signed the joint venture deal in 2012.
Samsung BioLogics is 75 percent owned by tech giant Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) and Samsung C&T Corp (KS:028260), in which Lee is the top shareholder.
Foreigners hold about 9 percent of the shares, according to data from the Korea Exchange.
BioLogics Chief Executive Kim Tae-han, who is not a member of the controlling family, has been with Samsung Group since the beginning of his career in 1979. He became the CEO in 2011 after senior positions in the group-wide strategy office and the group's chemical unit.

LONDON (Reuters) -  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) lost the final round in a long-running patent battle in Britain on Wednesday after the country's highest court ruled against it in a case involving its $5 billion-a-year pain drug Lyrica.
The Supreme Court decision is a blow for the U.S. drugmaker -- which had sought to affirm a secondary medical use patent for the product -- and a win for generic drug companies  Actavis , now renamed Allergan (NYSE:AGN), and Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL).
Lyrica, known generically as pregabalin, was originally developed for epilepsy but further research showed it could also help patients suffering from neuropathic pain, which soon became its main market.
In a bid to protect this lucrative section of the market, Pfizer secured a secondary patent, valid beyond the life of the original one.
The Supreme Court, however, ruled that the secondary patent claims relevant to neuropathic pain were invalid.
For Pfizer, the legal fight had become a point of principle, following years of battles in lower courts, since its key secondary pain patent has now expired in Europe.
Pfizer said it was disappointed by the ruling and the decision would have a significant impact on incentives for innovation in public health.
""The period that a medicine is under patent is a critical phase in its lifecycle that fuels innovation -- as science evolves and knowledge grows, patients increasingly benefit from ongoing research into new uses for existing medicines,"" the company said.
""As situations such as these are expected to become more common, it's important for patients that pharmaceutical companies are able to protect patents, including second medical use patents.""
The expiry of the basic patent on Lyrica five years ago had allowed generic drugmakers to launch cut-price versions of Pfizer's medicine, which carried a ""skinny label"" limiting their use to epilepsy and general anxiety disorder.
Pfizer sued, arguing it was inevitable that the copycat versions would be dispensed for pain as well as other conditions. 
The U.S. group took the case to the Supreme Court after a appeal in the case was rejected in 2016. Since then Pfizer's secondary neuropathic pain patent in Britain has also expired, in July 2017.
In the United States, by contrast, Pfizer is only expecting generic competition to Lyrica in 2019. 

The Supreme Court is the final court of appeal in Britain for civil cases. Pfizer said it was ""too early"" for it to determine or comment on any possible next steps.

1344,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2018 06:00AM ET</span>",China's top pig farming firm to follow new lower protein feed standards,"GUANGZHOU, China (Reuters) - China's top pig farming company Wens Foodstuffs Group Co Ltd (SZ:300498) will comply with new government-backed guidelines on lower protein in animal feed, a company executive said, adding however that the impact on its operations would be minimal.
China's Feed Industry Association last month approved new standards for pig and chicken feeds, with lower protein levels as Beijing seeks to reduce its consumption of soymeal amid an ongoing trade spat with major soybean supplier the United States.
Wens has pledged to follow the guidelines, Yang Junpeng, deputy general manager of purchasing told an industry event on Wednesday. But he said it would have only a small impact on the company as its formulas are already very close to the new rules.
The rules have no impact on its poultry feed, and will only require a change to feed for pigs above 75 kilograms, said Yang.
""In recent years we've been continually optimizing our formulations,"" he said.
Wens Foodstuff is China's top producer of pigs, slaughtering more than 10 million pigs in the first half of the year, and 330 million chickens.
Outbreaks of African swine fever are currently restricting farmers' ability to replenish their herds.
The highly contagious disease has been reported in 17 provinces across China, including its major pig producing regions, forcing Beijing to roll out restrictions on the transport of live pigs across the country.

""Next year pig prices in the second half will be comparatively positive, though we still need to see how African swine fever evolves and the ongoing impact from environmental policies,"" he said.

1345,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2018 05:55AM ET</span>","Fund managers place bets in Asia's oversold assets, such as high-yield bonds","By Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) - As contagion from worries over global growth and trade friction pushes Asian equity, bond and currency markets deeper into bear territory, fund managers are hunting for bargains in Chinese and Indian equities and high-yielding Asian dollar bonds.
A cocktail of negative factors has driven MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) down 15.5 percent so far this year. Currencies from emerging markets whose economies are vulnerable on the current account have come under pressure.
Stephen Chang, a Hong Kong-based portfolio manager at global bond house PIMCO, reckons the region's high-yielding dollar bonds have become cheap, after higher U.S. interest rates pushed prices lower.
""They are weak for a reason, but valuations have adjusted to reflect the new risk that has emerged. We do think there are some gems that we can find from a bottom-up perspective,"" Chang said.
For a lot of fund managers, the sell-off has been excessive. Many of them are seeking alternatives to U.S. equities, which have been the lone outperformers globally, after U.S. mid-term elections resulted in a divided Congress and lowered the odds of further fiscal stimulus.
""The price action that we have seen has been so dramatic that it is pricing in a continued deterioration of fundamentals, almost pricing in a recession,"" said Graziano Creperio, a London-based investment specialist at M&G Investments.
Creperio points to healthy current accounts in some emerging markets, and their lower foreign debt levels compared with a decade ago during the global financial crisis as reasons to be optimistic. The M&G (Lux) Dynamic Allocation Strategy has increased exposure to shares of Chinese, South Korean and Taiwanese companies.

CHINESE REAL ESTATE BONDS
The Indian rupee is Asia's weakest performer this year, while a few months ago the Indonesian rupiah was at its weakest since the Asian financial crisis in 1997-98.
In seven Asian equity markets - India, Indonesia, the Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam - foreign investors sold a net $33.76 billion of Asian equities between January and October this year.
Foreign investors sold a net $14.55 of equities in these markets in October alone, when U.S. 10-year Treasury yields hit their highest since early 2011.
GRAPHIC: Asia's current account balances, FX reserves - https://tmsnrt.rs/2ys7W4b
Slowing growth and the U.S.-Sino trade war have dragged China's stocks down 20 percent this year, and foreign holdings of Chinese equities has dropped.
Creperio cites China's policy measures such as personal income tax cuts, fiscal support and monetary easing as catalysts for a recovery.
Ernest Yeung, a portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price in Hong Kong, says companies associated with China's ""old economy"" are among his favorite investments, including shares of financial and consumer firms.
""We are very comfortable about positioning into the next one to two years, because we believe that pocket is under-valued by mainstream investors,"" he said.
Yeung said the price-to-earnings ratio of equities on the China A-shares market is at 9.8, its lowest level since late 2014.
Tanuj Dutt, a senior portfolio manager at Nikko Asset Management in Singapore, said that onshore Chinese shares are ""flashing green"" to him in terms of valuations.

Foreign investors have also been gradually adding to their holdings of Chinese bonds, via the limited channels for offshore investment in the mainland.
PIMCO's Chang finds value in dollar-denominated bonds in Chinese real estate, adding that the top-five players in the space are deleveraging and have been able to gain market share.
China's largest developers by sales revenue are  Country Garden  (HK:2007) and  Evergrande  (HK:3333), according to property researcher CREIS.
PIMCO estimates China attracted $86 billion in foreign bond inflows and $30 billion in equity investments over the past 12 months.
T. Rowe's Yeung, who manages a global emerging market equity-focused value strategy, is thinking about adding to his strategy's equity holdings in Indonesia as the market has corrected a lot, focusing on mid-cap firms in financials, property and building materials.
He sees India as the region's most expensive market - with some consumer goods companies trading at a price-earnings ratio of 30 - though he's charmed by the country's non-state banks, which have been neglected since they underwent a bad credit cycle.
One such lender is ICICI Bank (NS:ICBK), whose share price has risen 18.3 percent on the year-to-date.

""We think they're coming to the tail end of cleaning up those bad debts,"" Yeung said. He adds that shares of financial firms in the MSCI Emerging Market index are currently trading near the lower end of their historical range since 2004.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares hit their lowest in two weeks on Wednesday as data showing the German and Japanese economies contracting in the third quarter fueled worries about global growth amid a plunge in oil prices.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) lost 0.5 percent by 0900 GMT as commodities sectors weighed and Italian stocks sold off.
The STOXX and leading euro zone stock indexes <.STOX50E> hit their lowest since Oct 31 in early deals, recovering some ground later.
Italy's decision to stick to its growth and deficit plans in its re-submitted draft budget set the stage for a showdown with the European Union over breaking structural deficit limits.
It drove government bond yields up and sent Italy's FTSE MIB (FTMIB) down 1.8 percent, set for its worst fall in a month, as bank stocks (FTIT8300) fell 1.5 percent.
The oil and gas sector (SXEP) sank 2.3 percent, causing it to cede its position as top-gaining sector year-to-date to healthcare.
Energy stocks have been one of the biggest contributors to the region's earnings growth this quarter, making the slide a significant concern for investors.
Crude prices were struggling to find a footing after a 7 percent plunge the previous day on surging supply.
In London, the FTSE 100 (FTSE) fell as Prime Minister Theresa May sought to convince her government to accept a draft European Union divorce deal that opponents say threatens the independence and unity of the United Kingdom.
Mining stocks (SXPP) fell 2.7 percent as copper prices slid after weak China retail sales data reignited fears of a slowdown in the world's biggest metals consumer.
Dutch payments firm Adyen's (AS:ADYEN) shares lost 9.5 percent as traders said the stock had been left out of an MSCI index re-weighting, and was also being dragged down by Wirecard (DE:WDIG) which fell after results.
"" Adyen  didn't get included into the MSCI re-weights, which a lot of people were thinking they might, so there's some technical selling driving it,"" said Mark Taylor, sales trader at the Mirabaud Securities Global Thematic Group.
Wirecard shares fell after the firm hiked its profit target and reported a jump in third-quarter net earnings. Traders said the market was honing in on details in its free cash flow, and signs of slowing inorganic growth.
 Iliad  (PA:ILD) shares were among top gainers, up 7.1 percent after results showed good performance in the company's Italian unit, though overall it lost subscribers. 
Overall European earnings have been underwhelming this season, revealing growing margin pressure and concerns about growth and a slowdown in China.
""For 2019, we forecast low-single-digit and below-consensus EPS growth in Europe,"" wrote  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts.
They see earnings per share growing at 4 percent in the euro zone and 2 percent in the UK next year - significantly lower than the aggregate IBES Refinitiv estimates for around 10 and 8 percent respectively.

 Mediaset  (MI:MS) shares fell 7.6 percent, the heaviest fallers on the Italian index, after third-quarter earnings delivered a small beat, but  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analysts said consensus estimates were more likely to fall than rise.

The AMF had first launched its probe in early 2016.
""It will likely be completed in 2019. It took us nearly three years, but because some parties operate abroad, it takes much more time,"" said Ophele.
In December 2015, Muddy Waters criticized Casino's accounting practices, saying the retailer was ""dangerously leveraged"" and managed for the short-term, prompting the worst slide in seven years in Casino's stock price.
Muddy Waters said at the time that it was ""short"" on Casino shares and credit, namely betting on a drop in Casino's stock and bond prices. Casino has rejected criticism by Muddy Waters, which no longer holds those short positions in Casino.
In the interview with Les Echos, Ophele also discussed the current row opposing Casino and its parent  Rallye  (PA:GENC) to some hedge funds represented by lawyer Sophie Vermeille.
These funds have that Rallye has flattered Casino's value in its accounts.
""A person cannot be portrayed as a 'whistle blower' if it is paid for that end. One cannot publicly say the accounts of a company are false or that it cannot pay a dividend without providing the proof applicable rules,"" said Ophele.
""Contrary to what has been said, Rallye has not changed its accounting method... French accounting rules do not require a valuation of holdings at market price,"" he added.
Casino is the main asset of Rallye, which has a 51 percent stake in the company.
Within the Casino group, dividends from Casino are used to maintain Rallye's debt interest payments. The shares of Casino that are held by Rallye are also pledged as collateral to banks in order for Rallye to obtain more financing.

1349,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2018 05:35AM ET</span>",Saudi's flyadeal to pick Airbus or Boeing jets by end of month,"By Alexander Cornwell
DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabian budget airline flyadeal aims to decide whether to order Airbus (PA:AIR) or Boeing (N:BA) narrow-body jets by the end of this month, its chief executive said on Wednesday.
Flyadeal, a subsidiary of state-owned Saudi Arabian Airlines, had been due to decide on the order for 30 Airbus A320neos or Boeing 737 MAXs in the second quarter but held off to further assess the performance of the revamped models.
""We want some evidence because we're committing a huge chunk of capital,"" Con Korfiatis told Reuters at a Dubai conference, adding that the planemakers had competed ""very vigorously"".
Flyadeal is a pure low cost airline, with passengers charged for meals and checked luggage, a model that has so far not had major success in the Middle East beyond United Arab Emirates-headquartered Air Arabia (DU:AIRA).
The order for the planes, which are the latest versions of world's most used jets and typically employed for short to medium haul flights, would be worth more than $3 billion at current list prices, although industry sources say discounts of around 50 percent are common on such large orders.
Although the world’s two largest planemakers say they are mostly sold out of the jets until 2024, the order will give flyadeal a pipeline allowing it to plan for long-term growth.
The airline, which plans to add around 10 aircraft a year to its fleet from 2020, will next year start leasing the model of jet it orders until it receives its first aircraft from the production line, Korfiatis said.
Flyadeal operates a fleet of eight leased Airbus A320ceos and will add another three by early January 2019, allowing it to expand from 10 to 14 domestic destinations.
The airline, which launched in September 2017, has carried more than 2 million passengers so far and expects to carry more than 3.5 million in 2019, Korfiatis said.
It is also planning to launch its first international flight next year which will likely be to Egypt, Turkey, or to other Gulf Arab countries.

1350,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 14, 2018 05:20AM ET</span>","A Market Guide to a Brexit Deal, If and When It Finally Happens","(Bloomberg) -- U.K. negotiators have secured a deal with the European Union to exit the bloc, and on Wednesday Prime Minister Theresa May will try to win over her Cabinet and later, Parliament. For investors, a done deal would remove one of the biggest overhangs in European markets since the 2016 vote.
Of course, we’re not exactly there yet. Some U.K. ministers have preferred quitting to backing May’s blueprint in the past, and the math for getting it through Parliament still looks challenging. But traders are turning a little more optimistic, with the pound gaining as much as 1.5 percent on Tuesday and domestic mid-caps jumping.
It’s too early to breathe a sigh of relief, but this is what an orderly Brexit could mean for U.K. markets:
Currency
It’s prime time for the pound. The pound-dollar rate is paring some of Tuesday’s gains, and a jump in implied volatility shows the success of May’s deal is nowhere near certain.
“If the deal is seen as favorable, I think sterling could quickly move to $1.40 and if negative it will re-test the recent lows around $1.20,” said Roger Jones, head of equities at London & Capital. “If the Conservatives splinter on the back of a ‘failed’ Brexit and the possibility of a Corbyn Labour government increases, then sterling will come under further pressure.”
Three-month risk-reversal rates in pound-dollar options, a bellwether for market sentiment, have recovered but remain negative, a sign traders are still bearish. Even a fudged deal might not be too uplifting, since it could kick the can down the road when it comes to the actual details.
Bonds
Gilts rallied following the Brexit referendum as investors sought the safety of sovereign debt. They have sold off since, after global yields rose and domestic economic growth remained solid, allowing the central bank to raise interest rates. Yields jumped on Tuesday, as a Brexit deal would increase the chance of more tightening.
Equities
Since the vote, smaller companies -- which are more sensitive to the local economy -- have trailed larger ones, whose overseas earnings tend to benefit from sterling weakness. That’s why the FTSE 250 is extending its outperformance over the FTSE 100 and Stoxx Europe 600 on Wednesday.
Brexit hasn’t exactly ruined U.K. equity returns when calculated in the local currency, but in dollar terms, it’s made British stocks underperformers. On such a basis, the U.K. is the only major developed market to have handed investors zero returns since that fateful day of the Brexit referendum in June 2016.
That’s one reason Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch’s surveys show a rising net percentage of global fund managers underweight on U.K. stocks since Brexit. A deal could help fuel more inflows into British as well as European shares.
“A soft and orderly Brexit could contribute to making both U.K. and European equities more ‘investable’ to global investors,”  Barclays  (LON:BARC) strategists led by Emmanuel Cau wrote in a Nov. 6 note.
A look at what sectors did during the week after the vote sheds some light on how they might respond to a deal. The worst stock performers were more exposed to the local economy -- real estate, general retailers, banks -- whereas the winners were exporters like energy or tobacco stocks.
Outside the U.K., automakers may benefit from a deal as the the country is Europe’s second-biggest premium car market,  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) strategists wrote in an Oct. 30 note. Overseas banks with a strong presence in Britain, such as Spain’s  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) SA, may also gain.
But, ultimately, many investors would rather not make political forecasts until the dust settles.
“Few global investors feel they have an edge in predicting the next few rounds of British politics,” Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer at UBS Wealth Management, wrote in an email. They “prefer to stay neutral on U.K. equities while looking for opportunities more amenable to financial analysis.”

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore Airlines Ltd (SI:SIAL) is facing no problem selling business class tickets on its ultra-long non-stop flights to the United States but is having to price premium economy seats very attractively, a senior executive said on Wednesday.
The carrier last month resumed after five years the world's longest commercial flight, a near-19 hour non-stop journey from Singapore to New York.
The airline ordered seven new ultra-long range twin-engine Airbus SE (PA:AIR) A350-900ULRs fitted with just 67 business class and 94 premium economy seats for those flights and for non-stop services to Los Angeles and San Francisco. These flights have no economy class seats. 
It represents a major expansion in the U.S. market for Singapore Airlines and a test of whether the carrier can charge the 20 percent price premium that travel industry data shows is typical for ultra-long non-stop services due to their popularity with time-sensitive business travelers.
Singapore Airlines Executive Vice President Commercial Mak Swee Wah said there was existing demand for business class which he expected would continue to pick up. 
For premium economy, however, he said some markets were not ""entirely familiar"" with the product, which offers more leg room and other amenities than economy class. 
""I think we need to continue to stimulate and encourage the market to consider this product, initially with very attractive pricing, but eventually I think people will see that even at prices which we offer it is a good product to purchase because it is a very long flight,"" he said at an analyst and media briefing.
His comments came after Singapore Airlines reported on Tuesday an 81 percent plunge in second-quarter net profit, hurt by higher fuel prices, lower airfares and non-cash losses at its part-owned  Virgin Australia  Holdings Ltd (AX:VAH).
Yields, a proxy for ticket prices, fell 2.2 percent in the second quarter compared with a year earlier, failing to help offset the impact of a 24 percent rise in fuel prices. 
Singapore Airlines is offering premium economy fares as low as S$1,698 ($1,230.17) return from Singapore to New York for weekday travel over part of the peak Christmas travel period, according to its website. 
That is in line with economy class fares from premium rivals like Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (HK:0293) and Dubai-based Emirates that require a stop and a longer travel time, according to a Reuters search on  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE).
Mak declined to comment on whether Singapore Airlines could consider changing the configuration of the plane to include more business class seats.

When it previously flew to New York and Los Angeles non-stop on four-engined A340-500 jets that used more fuel, it had initially offered both ""executive economy"" and business class but later switched to an all-business class configuration.

1360,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2018 12:50AM ET</span>","FAA, Boeing study need for 737 MAX software changes after crash","By David Shepardson and Eric M. Johnson
WASHINGTON/SEATTLE (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and  Boeing Co  (N:BA) are evaluating the need for software or design changes to 737 MAX jets in the wake of last month's deadly Lion Air crash in Indonesia, the regulator said on Tuesday.
Boeing shares fell 2.1 percent on Tuesday on concerns related to the first crash of the newest version of the planemaker's best-selling jet, in which all 189 people on board were killed when it dived into the sea.
Indonesian investigators said on Monday a system designed to deal with the accident scenario was not described in the flight manual. They called for more training for 737 MAX pilots.
U.S. pilot unions later said they were not aware of the new anti-stall system.
Operating procedures and training for the 737 MAX could also change as the FAA and Boeing learn more from the investigation, the regulator said in a statement. 
Investigators are preparing to publish their preliminary report on the crash on Nov. 28 or Nov. 29, one month after the Lion Air jet crashed at high speed into the Java Sea.
Until now, public attention has focused mainly on potential maintenance problems including a faulty sensor for the 'angle of attack,' a vital piece of data needed to help the aircraft fly at the right angle to the currents of air and prevent a stall.
The focus of the investigation appears to be expanding to the clarity of U.S.-approved procedures to help pilots prevent the 737 MAX from over-reacting to such a data loss, and methods for training them.
Information recovered from the jet's data recorder last week led the FAA to issue an emergency directive warning pilots that a computer on the 737 MAX could force the plane to descend sharply for up to 10 seconds even in manual flight, making it difficult for a pilot to control the aircraft.
Pilots can stop this automated response by pressing two buttons if the system behaves unexpectedly, the directive said.
But questions have been raised about how well pilots are prepared for such an automatic reaction and how much time they have to respond.
Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg told Fox Business Network on Tuesday that Boeing provides ""all of the information that's needed to safely fly our airplanes"" and that the 737 MAX was a ""very safe"" airplane.
""This comes out of thousands of hours of testing and evaluating and simulating and providing the information that our pilots need to operate our airplanes safely,"" Muilenburg said. 
""In certain failure modes, if there's an inaccurate angle of attack sensor feeding information to the airplane, there's a procedure to handle that,"" he added.
The FAA on Tuesday denied a report that it had launched a new probe into the safety analyses carried out by Boeing on the 737 MAX.
Boeing, the world's largest planemaker, said earlier on Tuesday it delivered 43 of its 737 aircraft last month, up from 37 a year ago, helped by a booming global market. 

The number of 737 deliveries was down slightly from the 61 delivered in September due to lingering supplier problems, flagged by a Boeing executive last week.

1361,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2018 12:17AM ET</span>",FAA denies report on new probe of Boeing's safety analyses on 737 MAX,"(Reuters) - The U.S. aviation regulator denied on Tuesday a report that it had launched a new probe of the safety analyses performed over the years by  Boeing Co  (N:BA) on its 737 MAX models, following the crash of a Lion Air jet in Indonesia last month.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was reviewing details surrounding the safety data and conclusions the company previously provided to it as part of certifying 737 MAX 8 and MAX 9 models.
""The FAA is not doing a safety probe separate from the ongoing Lion Air accident investigation of which we, the NTSB (National Transportation Safety Board) and Indonesian officials are a part,"" the agency said in an emailed statement.
""As we have previously said, we have issued an (airworthiness directive) and will continue to take appropriate action based on what we learn from the investigation. This has not changed,"" the FAA said.
The FAA and Boeing continue to evaluate the need for software and/or other design changes to the aircraft including operating procedures and training as we learn more from the ongoing investigation, the regulator added. 
Boeing did not respond to requests for comment outside regular business hours.

A Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX 8 crashed on Oct. 29 minutes after taking off from Jakarta, killing all 189 people aboard.

1362,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2018 11:50PM ET</span>",Cathay Pacific executives grilled over data breach 'crisis',"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Cathay Pacific Airways (HK:0293) said on Wednesday it is working with 27 regulators in 15 jurisdictions to investigate a data breach that affected millions of passengers, as Hong Kong lawmakers grilled executives over how it handled the incident.
The executives did not answer repeated questions about whether the airline would compensate all affected customers or if it might face a hefty fine under new European Union privacy regulations, saying it was ""too early"" to comment.
Cathay has come under mounting criticism after it said late last month that about 9.4 million passengers' personal data had been accessed without authorization, seven months after it became aware of the breach.
It was not immediately clear who was behind the breach or what the information might be used for, but Cathay said there was no evidence so far that personal information had been misused. 
""The incident is a crisis,"" company Chairman John Slosar told the committee. ""It is the most serious one the airline has faced.""
Slosar again apologized for failing to protect customers' data and said he regretted that the company could not investigate the attack more quickly. 
Shares of Cathay, which slid to a nine-year low after news of the data leak last month, were up more than 4 percent on Wednesday, beating a flat broader market (HSI). 
Cathay said in a document submitted to Hong Kong's Legislative Council that it first detected suspicious activity on its network in March and that the attack continued in the following months and expanded in scope.
The airline then took until mid-August to conclude which passenger data had been accessed, according to the document, and it completed the identification of the personal data that pertained to each individual passenger on Oct. 24. 
Slosar said that in future Cathay would instantly disclose any similar issues to the authorities. 
The company denied the data breach was a result of layoffs at its IT department last year. 
Cathay said an airline restructuring had been completed and it planned to hire 1,800 staff this year.

It also said it has spent over HK$1 billion ($127.7 million) on IT infrastructure and security over the past three years.

1363,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 13, 2018 11:30PM ET</span>",China's Economy Hints at Improvement Ahead Amid Consumer Gloom,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s economy showed tentative signs of stabilization in October with infrastructure investment and industrial production picking up, even as weak retail sales underscored strong downward pressure on output.
Industrial production gained a better-than-expected 5.9 percent from a year earlier, and fixed-asset investment rose 5.7 percent in the 10 months through October, exceeding an estimate of 5.5 percent. Those readings signal that government stimulus aimed at spurring infrastructure investment is finally passing through into the real economy.
At the same time, consumers are still in a downbeat mood, with a slowing property market worsening the outlook. October retail sales growth slowed to 8.6 percent, down from a 9.2 expansion a month earlier. New home sales rose at the slowest pace in six months.
On balance, the data provide some respite for policy makers grappling with how to arrest a slowdown that saw third-quarter growth fall to the weakest pace in almost a decade. The broadest measure of credit data reported Tuesday showed a slump last month amid slower government debt sales, suggesting more stimulus may be on the way.
""China’s economy continues to grapple with stiff headwinds,"" said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economics research at  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) in Hong Kong. ""More stimulus will be needed in coming months to prevent a sharper deceleration in overall growth and to prop up household spending and private investment in particular. Officials will likely deploy fiscal levers more aggressively, with monetary easing only providing a supporting role.""
Leading drivers of the rebound were investment in environmental protection and cleanup, and road transportation projects, which quickened noticeably in October, said Liu Aihua, spokeswoman for the National Bureau of Statistics, at a briefing in Beijing Wednesday. Some infrastructure projects resumed construction, and some major hydro power, transportation, and energy projects have sped up, which showed that support policies are starting to have an effect, she said.
The 3.7 percent expansion in infrastructure investment, up from 3.3 percent a month earlier, showed that the recovery is still at a low level and that there’s a need to beef up support via policy, funding and also implementation, said Liu.
The acceleration in industrial output expansion in October was driven by basic materials. Cement production jumped 13.1 percent from a year earlier, marking the fastest pace of growth since March 2016. Production of pig iron and steel products logged the biggest gains in five years, while growth of coal and coke output also saw a sharp acceleration.
Production of items more oriented towards manufacturing, on the other hand, did not fare so well. Output of metal-cutting machine tools plunged 9.8 percent from a year earlier, marking the worst decline in almost three years, while production of integrated circuits fell 7.3 percent, marking the worst reading on record in more than five years of data.
""Fiscal stimulus money is finally being spent on infrastructure, which pushed up fixed-asset investment growth,” said Iris Pang, Greater China economist with ING Bank NV in Hong Kong. “Front loading of exports supports manufacturing, which explains higher industrial production growth.”

Sri Lanka’s central bank raised the standing lending facility rate to 9 percent from 8.5 percent on Wednesday, and almost half of the analysts surveyed are calling for another increase in the Philippines on Thursday. Thailand and Indonesia are expected by most economists to hold their ground, following in the steps of Malaysia last week.
Click to read about Sri Lanka’s rate decision
After a brief lull that’s helped the region’s worst-hit currencies recover, the volatility in emerging markets has returned and some central banks are coming under pressure to raise interest rates. The Federal Reserve is set to continue on its aggressive tightening path when it next meets in December.
“The fundamental sources of pressure remain and there are still chances that regional central banks will act preemptively,” said Eugenia Victorino, head of Asia strategy at Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB in Singapore. “The Fed is still hiking and the dollar strength has yet to fade. Current-account deficits also make countries like Indonesia, Philippines and India vulnerable.”
Here’s what to watch for in the statements:
Thailand
While Bank of Thailand has indicated its intention to raise its key rate, which has been at 1.5 percent since 2015, most economists doubt they will start this week. Sixteen of 20 analysts predict officials will stand pat on Wednesday.
The economy is facing risks including a drop in exports and manufacturing, and a slowdown in tourism. Inflation was at a six-month low of 1.23 percent in October.
“There is no rush to raise the rate now when the downside bias of the economy seems to be rising and inflation remains benign,” said Thanomsri Fongarunrung, an economist at Phatra Securities Pcl in Bangkok, adding that the next meeting in December “will be a close call.”
Indonesia
Bank Indonesia’s efforts to stabilize the currency, including 150 basis points of rate hikes since May, are starting to pay off. The rupiah has gained 3 percent against the dollar in the past month, the best performer in Asia.
Of the 26 economists surveyed, 23 predict the key rate will be unchanged at 5.75 percent on Thursday. The rest expect a hike of 25 basis points.
Inflation remained subdued at 3.16 percent in October and well within the central bank’s 2.5-4.5 percent target range. Still, Indonesia is not out of the woods with a widening current-account deficit highlighting the economy’s vulnerability to outflows, and some economists predict more rate hikes ahead.
“It is indeed a temporary pause as we expect BI to hike alongside the U.S. Fed,” said Mohamed Faiz Nagutha, an economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) in Singapore, who predicts the rate will reach 6 percent by the end of this year.
Philippines
With inflation still a threat, economists are split with 11 of 19 predicting a hike in the Philippine benchmark rate to 4.75 percent on Thursday.
The central bank, which has boosted the rate 150 basis points since May, has left open the prospect of another round of policy tightening, while in the same breath flagging the chances for a hold.
“Despite the spate of hikes, real policy rates remain deeply in the red and further policy response is called for,” said SEB’s Victorino. “While headline inflation seems to have already peaked, it will take some time before it eases back into the target range.”

1365,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 13, 2018 10:20PM ET</span>",Tencent Traders Prepare for Wildest Day Since 2015,"(Bloomberg) -- For clues on what Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s shares will do tomorrow, look to the traders who got it spot-on in August.
The options market is pricing in a 5.6 percent move for the stock either way following the internet giant’s third-quarter update after Hong Kong trading closes Wednesday. That would mark the biggest post-results reaction for the largest component of the MSCI Emerging Market Index since August 2015, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Despite a $243 billion loss of shareholder value since January that’s already broken all kinds of records, the outlook for some of Tencent’s most profitable businesses is getting bleaker: China’s economic slowdown is putting a lid on advertiser spending, while regulators are unlikely to loosen their grip on the gaming industry. Another warning sign came just last week with Japanese rival Nexon Co., which said sales in China will slump. A string of earnings shockers also roiled Chinese tech shares.
The release will be the first since Tencent reshuffled its structure, reducing the total number of business groups to six from seven. The company is also said to be scaling back its marketing to improve its cash flow.
“We expect short-term pain to linger,” China International Capital Corp.’s Natalie Yue Wu wrote in a Nov. 9 note. “We appreciate that Tencent is trying to create synergy by restructuring, but we believe that it has to move faster, as growth of games has already slowed.”
Derivatives traders have sent the cost of hedging Tencent to a one-year high relative to the Hang Seng, after the stock became twice as volatile as the benchmark. Tencent’s depositary receipts traded in the U.S. have also been volatile, gaining 4.1 percent Tuesday after declines of more than 3 percent in each of the previous three sessions.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). is one of 11 brokers tracked by Bloomberg to have cut its price target for Tencent this month. In addition to challenges for gaming and ad sales, Goldman predicts weaker growth for Tencent’s payment unit as China’s consumer credit industry slows, according to a Nov. 11 note.
Bullish analysts have been behind the curve throughout 2018, missing the 32 percent slump that’s made it the worst year for investors since Tencent first started trading in 2004 -- by a wide margin. Despite recent cuts to earnings and targets, analysts on average still say the shares will rebound 50 percent in the next 12 months.
They expect revenue rose just 23 percent in the third quarter, the fourth consecutive period of slowing growth and the worst pace in more than three years. While Tencent has a low bar to beat this earnings season, tempered expectations didn’t stop the shares from dropping 3 percent after the last quarterly update in August.
A short squeeze just two weeks ago showed how painful it can be to bet against Tencent, even if an earnings-fueled rally lasts only a day.

1366,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2018 09:58PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Snap reveals U.S. subpoenas on IPO disclosures,"By Alison Frankel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission have subpoenaed  Snap Inc  (N:SNAP) for information about its March 2017 initial public offering, the social media app maker told Reuters on Tuesday.
Snap said in a statement it has responded to the government subpoenas and other requests for information.
The previously unreported federal inquiries follow an ongoing shareholder lawsuit in which investors allege that Snap misled the public about how competition from Facebook Inc's (O:FB) Instagram service had affected the company's growth.
Snap said it believes that the federal regulators ""are investigating issues related to the previously disclosed allegations asserted in the class action about our IPO disclosures."" 
""While we do not have complete visibility into these investigations, our understanding is that the DOJ is likely focused on IPO disclosures relating to competition from Instagram,"" the company said.
Snap's Snapchat messaging app has posted disappointing user growth since the company's $3.4 billion IPO, and despite above-expectations sales growth and narrowing losses, its shares have tumbled. They closed at $6.71 on Tuesday, down from their initial offering price of $17.
The company described the lawsuit as ""meritless"" and said its pre-IPO disclosures were ""accurate and complete."" It said it would continue to cooperate with the SEC and Justice Department.
Subpoenas can compel parties to provide materials that authorities want to review.
Snap acknowledged the probes after the U.S. government made a sealed filing in the shareholder lawsuit last Wednesday. 
The complaint, filed in May 2017 in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, also alleges that Snap did not disclose a sealed lawsuit brought before the IPO in which a former employee alleged the company had misrepresented some user metrics.
A federal court ordered that whistleblower case to arbitration in April.
The shareholder lawsuit further alleges that Snap misrepresented its use of smartphone notifications and other ""growth hacking"" tactics to spur Snapchat usage. 
Judge Stephen V. Wilson in June denied Snap's motion to dismiss the lawsuit. Plaintiffs later filed to certify it as a class action.
Snapchat, which reported 158 million daily users prior to the IPO, peaked at 191 million in this year's first quarter and fell to 186 million in the third quarter.
Snap's investor prospectus warned that Instagram's new ephemeral-posting feature, Stories, copied one of Snapchat's core elements and ""may be directly competitive.""

Investors allege that Snap underplayed the risk, contending that the company should have attributed slowing user growth in late 2016 to Instagram.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Tesla Inc co-founder Elon Musk and Mexico's tequila producers could be headed for a collision after the agave-based drink's industry group opposed the flamboyant billionaire's efforts to trademark an alcoholic drink dubbed ""Teslaquila.""
One of the world's richest people and chief executive of Tesla (O:TSLA), Musk is known for ambitious and cutting-edge projects ranging from auto electrification and rocket-building to high-speed transit tunnels.
Now it seems that Musk could be setting his sights on disrupting the multibillion-dollar tequila industry.
On Oct. 12, he tweeted ""Teslaquila coming soon"" and an accompanying ""visual approximation"" of a red and white label with the Tesla logo and a caption that stated ""100 percent Puro de Agave.""
Not so fast, said Mexico's Tequila Regulatory Council (CRT). It argued that the ""name 'Teslaquila' evokes the word Tequila ... (and) Tequila is a protected word.""
The CRT keeps tabs on producers to assure they adhere to strict denomination of origin rules, which dictate the spirit must be made in the Mexican states of Guanajuato, Jalisco, Michoacan, Nayarit or Tamaulipas, among other requirements.
According to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office website, Tesla has filed an application to trademark ""Teslaquila"" as a ""distilled agave liquor"" and ""distilled blue agave liquor."" Similar applications have been filed in Mexico, the European Union and Jamaica.
""If it wants to make Teslaquila viable as a tequila it would have to associate itself with an authorized tequila producer, comply with certain standards and request authorization from Mexico's Industrial Property Institute,"" said the CRT in a statement.
""Otherwise it would be making unauthorized use of the denomination of origin for tequila,"" it said, adding that the proposed name ""Teslaquila"" could make consumers confuse the drink with tequila.
Tesla did not respond to several requests for comment.
Other high-profile celebrities have cashed in on tequila's new-found international appeal, as the sprit moves into the ranks of top-shelf liquors and sheds its image as a fiery booze drunk by desperadoes and frat boys.
Last year,  Diageo  Plc (L:DGE) bought actor George Clooney's high-end tequila brand Casamigos for up to $1 billion.
Other recent deals in the industry include Bacardi Ltd's  January deal to buy fine tequila maker Patron Spirits International for $5.1 billion.

After years of speculation, Mexico's Beckmann family launched an initial public offering of Jose Cuervo (MX:CUERVO) in 2017, raising more than $900 million.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The gains of internet-related stocks in recent years have cast a shadow over what a dull but steady income stream from dividends can do for investors.
Fully understanding a company's ability to generate cash and sustain stock buybacks and payouts to shareholders over time is the bedrock philosophy at Epoch Investment Partners, which oversees about $20.7 billion using this investment strategy. 
""Boring is amazing, we take it as a compliment,"" Kera Van Valen, a portfolio manager of both the U.S. and global equity shareholder yield portfolios at Epoch, told the Reuters Global Investment 2019 Outlook Summit in New York on Tuesday.
""In our strategy we don't focus on multiples,"" Van Valen said, referring to price-to-earnings ratios that are an investing benchmark on Wall Street. ""From our perspective it's more about the dividend yields that the companies offer.""
The surge of the FANG stocks -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google's parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc - has captivated Wall Street in recent years, but they don't pay dividends so Van Valen has not rode that wave.
""You could understand the growth in some of the companies, some it's harder to understand,"" she said. 
But Van Valen is very interested in technology as long as she can understand how it is driving cash flows to return to shareholders or reinvested to spur a company's growth. 
""It's a great thing because we'll continue to see companies be able to sustain higher dividend payout ratios, be able to return excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases,"" she said.
About two-thirds of the 100 companies that each portfolio holds increased their dividends 7.1 percent so far this year, Van Valen said. 
That rate was higher than last year, partly due to U.S. tax reform, but Van Valen does not expect the rate to change dramatically for her holdings in the near future even as earnings growth likely slows to single digits. 
Van Valen looks for managements that have a well-articulated capital allocation policy so as the company grows, the cash distributions back to shareholders will grow. The average holding period for stocks in the two portfolios is about five years with low turnover.
The shareholder yield portfolios include utilities, staples, telecoms and increasingly financial stocks that profit from traditional loans and not harder-to-understand trading desks.
Van Valen added BB&T Corp (NYSE:BBT) to the portfolio earlier this year.

1370,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2018 07:33PM ET</span>","Amazon picks New York City, Washington D.C. area for new offices","By Jeffrey Dastin and David Shepardson
SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) picked America's financial and political capitals for massive new offices on Tuesday, branching out from its home base in Seattle with plans to create more than 25,000 jobs in both New York City and an area just outside Washington, D.C.
The world's largest online retailer plans to spend $5 billion on the two new developments in Long Island City and Arlington, Virginia, and expects to get more than $2 billion in tax credits and incentives with plans to apply for more. 
The prize, which Amazon called HQ2, attracted hundreds of proposals from across North America in a year-long bidding war that garnered widespread publicity for the company. Amazon ended the frenzy by dividing the spoils between the two most powerful East Coast U.S. cities and offering a consolation prize of a 5,000-person center in Nashville, Tennessee, focused on technology and management for retail operations.
Losers said they learned from the process, while winners said it was costly but worthwhile. 
""Either you are creating jobs or you are losing jobs,"" New York Governor Andrew Cuomo told a news conference on Tuesday.
With more than 610,000 workers worldwide, Amazon is already one of the biggest employers in the United States and the world's third-most valuable company, behind Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT).
Still, it faces fierce competition for talent from Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google and other companies working to build new technologies in the cloud. Those rivals routinely offer free food and perks in sunny California, seen by many as a better draw than Amazon's relative frugality in rain-plagued Seattle. Google also has a growing footprint in New York City.
Already marketing its forthcoming location in the New York City borough of Queens, Amazon talked up Long Island City's breweries, waterfront parks and easy transit access. Rents there are typically lower than in Midtown Manhattan, which is just across the East River. The former industrial area also has a clock counting down the hours until the end of U.S. President Donald Trump's first term in office.
The choice of Arlington, Virginia, just across the Potomac River from downtown Washington D.C., could hand Amazon greater political influence in the U.S. capital, where it has one of the largest lobbying shops in town. Locating close to the Pentagon may also help Amazon win a $10 billion cloud-computing contract from the U.S. Department of Defense, said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities.
Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive and the world's richest person, privately owns the Washington Post, which has written critical articles about Trump. In turn, Bezos's companies have been a frequent target of broadsides from the president. The newspaper maintains full editorial independence from its owner.
Amazon's choice largely bypassed the middle of the United States, where many cities had hoped for an economic boost and bid for the new jobs. The company already had large corporate workforces in greater Washington and New York.
""My heart is broken today,"" Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said.
TAX BREAKS
At the outset of its search last year, Amazon said it was looking for a business-friendly environment. The company said it will receive performance-based incentives of $1.525 billion from the state of New York, including an average $48,000 for each job it creates.
It can also apply for other tax incentives, such as New York City's Relocation and Employment Assistance Program that offers tax breaks potentially worth $900 million over 12 years. What benefit the company would actually get was unclear.
In Virginia, Amazon will receive performance-based incentives of $573 million, including an average $22,000 for each job it creates. 
These rewards come on top of $1.6 billion in subsidies Amazon has received across the United States since 2000, according to a database from the Washington-based watchdog Good Jobs First.
Amazon says it has invested $160 billion in the country since 2010 and that the new offices will generate more than $14 billion in extra tax revenue for New York, Virginia and Tennessee over the next two decades.
It expects an average wage of more than $150,000 for employees in each new office. 
HOUSING CRISIS
Amazon's emphasis on new, high-paying jobs earned publicity as it faced criticism for low wages in its sprawling warehouses. 
The company got $148 million worth of media attention across the English-language press in the two months following the launch of its search last September, according to media measurement and analytics firm mediaQuant Inc. 
Amazon received 238 proposals and New York and Virginia beat out 18 other finalists from a January short list, which included Los Angeles and Chicago. 
New Jersey made headlines early in the contest by proposing $7 billion in potential credits against state and city taxes if Amazon located in Newark and stuck to hiring commitments.
Others with less money to offer took a more creative approach: the mayor of the Atlanta suburb of Stonecrest, Jason Lary, said he would create a new city from industrial land called Amazon and name Bezos its mayor for life.
In evaluating its options, Amazon looked at the quality of schools, meeting with superintendents to discuss education in science and math. Amazon also wanted helicopter landing pads for the new sites, documents it released on Tuesday show.
The company has already had to navigate community issues at its more than 45,000-person urban campus in Seattle. An affordable housing crisis there prompted the city council to adopt a head tax on businesses in May, which Amazon helped overturn in a subsequent city council vote. 
Some critics had pushed for more transparency from cities and states in the bidding process, warning that the benefits of hosting a massive Amazon office may not offset the taxpayer-funded incentives and other costs.
""Our subways are crumbling, our children lack school seats, and too many of our neighbors lack adequate health care,"" New York State Senator Michael Gianaris and City Council Member Jimmy Van Bramer said in a joint statement. ""It is unfathomable that we would sign a $3 billion check to Amazon in the face of these challenges.""

Amazon shares closed down 0.3 percent at $1631.17, giving the company a market value of almost $800 billion.

1371,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2018 07:15PM ET</span>","Patients and industry fret over drug supplies, if no Brexit deal","By Ben Hirschler
LONDON (Reuters) - Consumers and the pharmaceuticals industry alike are anxious about medicine supplies, if there is no deal on Britain's departure from the European Union.
While the EU and Britain have agreed a draft text of a Brexit withdrawal agreement, it remains unclear if Prime Minister Theresa May can get it approved by parliament.
The highly regulated drugs sector is vulnerable to a no-deal Brexit due to uncertainty over how supply chains and regulatory oversight will function, and the UK government has told companies to build an additional six weeks of drug stockpiles.
But despite the government's instructions, issued in August, 70 percent of consumers still believe that leaving the EU without a deal will have an adverse impact on medicine supplies, according to results of a KPMG survey published on Wednesday.
The finding comes as pharmaceutical industry leaders are grappling with details of how to secure drug supplies in the event of a disorderly exit on March 29, 2019 -- both in Britain and continental Europe.
More than 2,600 drugs have some stage of manufacture in Britain and 45 million patient packs are supplied from the UK to other European countries each month, while another 37 million flow in the opposite direction, industry figures show.
Large pharmaceuticals companies already have stockpiling programs in place, in some cases building up many months of extra supply. Leading insulin maker  Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb), for example, will hold a 16-week stockpile from January, up from the usual seven weeks.
But the picture is less clear for smaller firms, some of which may struggle to finance extra stocks. It is also difficult to build big additional stockpiles of certain specialist drugs with short shelf lives.
The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry has already warned that some supply problems are inevitable in the event of Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal -- and the industry is continuing talks with government officials about contingency plans.
One specific concern voiced by two senior industry executives speaking to Reuters is the risk of a sharp drop in sterling, which would increase the financial incentive to export drugs from Britain via so-called parallel trade.

During its financial crisis, Greece also faced a problem with drugs being sucked out of the country through parallel trade, leading the government in Athens to temporarily ban the export of certain medicines.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  MSCI Inc  (N:MSCI) on Tuesday said it would add several onshore Chinese stocks to its closely watched and widely duplicated emerging-markets index.
The financial data company said it would add S.F. Holding Co Ltd (SZ:002352), 360 Security Technology Inc (SS:601360) and China Shipbuilding Industry Corp (SS:601989), among other names, to the benchmark. 
MSCI has been broadening exposure to stocks traded onshore in the world's second-largest economy in its indexes after announcing it would do so last year. That move has lent a hand to one of the poorer performing equity markets worldwide this year, the victim of concerns about slowing growth.
Trillions of dollars follow MSCI's indexes, including funds that mimic its benchmarks. Foreign investors previously focused primarily on Chinese stocks traded offshore, for instance in Hong Kong, but have made use of new programs granting access to onshore markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen.
As part of its semi-annual review, MSCI will also implement a previously announced move to broaden its prior telecom sector, now called ""Communication Services,"" to include market-leading names once grouped as consumer or technology stocks. The stocks now in the rebooted index include Netflix Inc (O:NFLX), Google parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) and  Facebook Inc  (O:FB).
MSCI also said it would add  Polymetal  International Plc (L:POLYP) and delete Rushydro (MM:HYDR) from its Russia index.

The changes will take effect at the end of November.

The elimination of the non-store employees is part of a restructuring plan that Johnson unveiled in September in an attempt to make the company nimble enough to tackle rivals in a fiercely competitive U.S. coffee market. 
""Every single decision was made after very careful consideration... And while incredibly difficult, they came as a result of work that has been eliminated, deprioritized or shifting ways of working within the company,"" Johnson wrote in the memo.

The New York-based company has been struggling to boost sales as it faces intense competition not only from peers like  HelloFresh SE  (DE:HFGG), but also from grocers selling their own ready-to-eat meals. The entry of Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) into grocery service and meal kits business has added to pressure.
The company reported another steep decline in net revenue for the third quarter, down 28.4 percent at $150.6 million.
Total number of individuals who signed up for its service fell nearly 25 percent to 64,6000, while number of orders dropped about 27 percent to 2.65 million, the company said.
Blue Apron said it expects to incur employee severance charges and other exit costs of about $1.6 million in the fourth quarter, while generating annual savings of about $16 million in 2019.
The company had 3,938 full‑time employees as of Jan. 31, according to its annual filing https:// 
Blue Apron's net loss narrowed to $33.9 million, or 18 cents per share, from $87.2 million, or 47 cents per share, a year earlier.
The company's shares fell about 5 percent to $1.16 after the bell. They have plunged about 70 percent since the start of the year.

Blue Apron is scheduled to hold a conference call with analysts on Wednesday.

1. Retail Inflation Due Up
Inflation data leads tomorrow’s economic calendar as the latest numbers on retail prices arrive.
The Labor Department will release the October consumer price index (CPI) at 8:30 AM ET (13:30 GMT).
On average, economists expect that the CPI rose 0.3% last month. The core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, is forecast to have risen 0.2%.
Following a hotter-than-expected producer price index for October, investors will be looking for further evidence that the Federal Reserve can maintain its plan of more rate hikes.
Core prices are viewed by the Fed as a better gauge of longer-term inflationary pressure precisely because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories.
The central bank usually tries to aim for 2% core inflation or less.
Recent solid U.S. economic reports and an upbeat assessment of the economy from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell have triggered expectations for a faster-than-expected pace of rate hikes from the Fed.
2. Macy’s Reports Earnings Before the Bell
Macy’s (NYSE:M) continues the retail earnings coming out this week, issuing numbers before the bell.
Analysts predict that the company earned 14 cents per share on sales of $5.4 billion.
The department store chain has topped profit forecasts in the last three quarters and the stock has nearly doubled in the past year.
The biggest worry, which briefly derailed the stock’s remarkable run over the past year, was rising costs, Investing.com’s Haris Anwar writes.
“During its second quarter earnings report in August, Macy’s warned investors that gross margins are expected to decline in the second half of the year compared with the first half, on higher costs associated with the company’s new loyalty program,” Anwar wrote.
3. Huge Crude Selloff Continues
Oil prices will be grabbing headlines as prices plunged today, pushing crude further into bear market territory.
WTI futures fell about 8%, its 12th consecutive day of losses. WTI is now about 30% off its recent highs, as there looks to be ample supply despite U.S. oil sanctions on Iran going into effect this month.
Strong U.S. production is another factor in the selling and there will be more numbers out tomorrow.
The American Petroleum Institute will report its measure of U.S. crude inventories tomorrow. It reported a build of 7.83 million barrels the week before."
1383,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 13, 2018 04:44PM ET</span>",Stocks - Dow Retreats as Bloodbath in Energy Weighs ,"Investing.com - The selloff on Wall Street continued for a second-straight day as a selloff in energy weighed on risk sentiment.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.40%. The S&P 500 fell 0.15%, while the Nasdaq Composite closed flat.
Wall Street gave up its early-session gains after energy stocks plunged on the back of a record losing streak in U.S. oil prices, which fell to a one-year low.
The latest plunge in oil prices emerged as President Donald Trump urged Saudi Arabia and OPEC to stay the course on production amid expectations that the cartel and its allies could announce output cuts at a meeting next month.
 Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM),  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) and  Marathon Oil  (NYSE:MRO) oil closed lower, dragging the S&P Energy Sector index down 2%.
The wreck in tech continued as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) struggled to pare losses from a day earlier, amid fresh signs of weaker demand for its latest slate of iPhones after another Apple supplier cut its outlook following Lumentum's warning on Monday.
Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO), which provides Radio Frequency (RF) solutions for Apple, slashed its third-quarter guidance, citing a drop in demand for smartphones.
Wall Street has turned bearish on Apple on concerns of weaker iPhone demand, as Goldman Sachs reduced its full-year 2019 iPhone sales outlook by 6% and revenue by 3.5% and cut its 12-month Apple price target to $209 a share.
The bearish day on Wall Street overshadowed an upbeat third-quarter print from  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD).
The home improvement retailer posted earnings and revenue that topped consensus. Its shares erased early gains to close flat.
Financials offered some respite, however, as a selloff from a day earlier attracted bargain-hunting investors. JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) closed higher for the day.
White House Chief Economic Advisor Larry Kudlow, meanwhile, also touted optimism on trade with China, confirming a report that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He had resumed trade talks.
In the wake of the recent selloff, U.S. stocks have more than pared their post-midterms gains, but analysts continue to suggest sentiment on risk will return as concerns about U.S. growth and policy are ""overdone.""
""We think these positive market themes can reassert themselves going forward, and concerns about U.S. growth and policy concerns appear overdone in the near term,"" Goldman Sachs said.
In corporate news, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) rallied 5% after Wall Street served up an upbeat assessment of the chipmaker ahead of its quarterly results due Thursday.

 Advance Auto Parts  (NYSE:AAP),  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) were among the top S&P 500 gainers for the session.

1387,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 13, 2018 04:20PM ET</span>",Rates on Hold in Asia as Central Banks Assess Return of Rout,"(Bloomberg) -- Interest rates are on hold in Asia this week as central banks give themselves more time to assess the return of market volatility in emerging markets.
Thailand and Indonesia are expected by most economists surveyed to hold their ground, following in the steps of Malaysia last week. Sri Lanka will also probably keep rates unchanged, while it’s a close call for the Philippines with almost half of the analysts calling for another increase.
After a brief lull that’s helped the region’s worst-hit currencies recover, the rout in emerging markets has returned and central banks may once again come under pressure to raise interest rates. The Federal Reserve is set to continue on its aggressive tightening path when it next meets in December, making it likely that the pause in rate hikes in Asia will be temporary.
“Given the recent improvement in sentiment, we expect central banks in the region to keep the powder dry at their respective policy meetings,” said Nicholas Mapa, senior economist at  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV in Manila.
Fears of a trade war “appear to be overblown” and the recovery in regional currencies gives policy makers “the leeway to pause and live to fight” another round of Fed rate hikes, he said.
Here’s what to watch for in the statements:
Thailand
While Bank of Thailand has indicated its intention to raise its key rate, which has been at 1.5 percent since 2015, most economists doubt they will start this week. Sixteen of 20 analysts predict officials will stand pat on Wednesday.
The economy is facing risks including a drop in exports and manufacturing, and a slowdown in tourism. Inflation was at a six-month low of 1.23 percent in October.
“There is no rush to raise the rate now when the downside bias of the economy seems to be rising and inflation remains benign,” said Thanomsri Fongarunrung, an economist at Phatra Securities Pcl in Bangkok, adding that the next meeting in December “will be a close call.”
Indonesia
Bank Indonesia’s efforts to stabilize the currency, including 150 basis points of rate hikes since May, are starting to pay off. The rupiah has gained more than 2 percent against the dollar in the past month, the best performer in Asia.
Of the 26 economists surveyed, 23 predict the key rate will be unchanged at 5.75 percent on Thursday. The rest expect a hike of 25 basis points.
Inflation remained subdued at 3.16 percent in October and well within the central bank’s 2.5-4.5 percent target range. Still, Indonesia is not out of the woods with a widening current-account deficit highlighting the economy’s vulnerability to outflows, and some economists predict more rate hikes ahead.
“It is indeed a temporary pause as we expect BI to hike alongside the U.S. Fed,” said Mohamed Faiz Nagutha, an economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) in Singapore, who predicts the rate will reach 6 percent by the end of this year.
Philippines
With inflation still a threat, economists are split with 11 of 19 predicting a hike in the Philippine benchmark rate to 4.75 percent on Thursday.
The central bank, which has boosted the rate 150 basis points since May, has left open the prospect of another round of policy tightening, while in the same breath flagging the chances for a hold.
“Despite the spate of hikes, real policy rates remain deeply in the red and further policy response is called for,” said Eugenia Victorino, head of Asia strategy at Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB in Singapore. “While headline inflation seems to have already peaked, it will take some time before it eases back into the target range.”"

1389,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2018 03:31PM ET</span>",Maryland goes to court to challenge Trump's attorney general pick,"By Sarah N. Lynch and Susan Heavey
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The state of Maryland launched a court challenge on Tuesday to the legality of President Donald Trump's appointment of Matthew Whitaker as acting U.S. attorney general, saying the president overstepped his constitutional authority and broke federal law.
Trump installed Whitaker as acting attorney general last week after ordering Jeff Sessions to resign from the post. Trump had repeatedly criticized Sessions for recusing himself in March 2017 from the federal investigation, now headed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, into Russia's role in the 2016 U.S. election, a probe Trump has called a ""witch hunt.""
Congressional Democrats have voiced concern that Whitaker, a Trump loyalist, could undermine or even fire Mueller.
Maryland asked U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander in Baltimore to bar Whitaker from appearing in an official capacity as acting attorney general in its ongoing lawsuit against the administration over the Affordable Care Act healthcare law. The state asked the judge to substitute Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in Whitaker's place.
The city of San Francisco, also involved in litigation against the Trump administration, on Monday told the Justice Department it may sue to challenge Whitaker's appointment.
Whitaker's elevation as the top U.S. law enforcement official gives him, rather than Rosenstein, authority over Mueller's investigation, which already has led to criminal charges against a series of former Trump aides and has cast a cloud over Trump's presidency. 
Whitaker, who had served as chief of staff for Sessions, previously questioned the scope of Mueller's investigation and spoke about the idea of reducing funding for the special counsel so the probe ""grinds to almost a halt.""
Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh, a Democrat, said the state plans to challenge Whitaker's appointment on two legal grounds.
Maryland argues that Rosenstein, the department's No. 2 official, should have succeeded Sessions under a federal succession law that vests full authority in the deputy attorney general should the office of attorney general become vacant. The state also argues that the Republican president violated the so-called Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution because the job of attorney general is a ""principal officer"" who must be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate.
Maryland's legal filing states that Trump ""might reasonably be seen as appointing a loyalist in a way that deliberately circumvents the Senate's constitutional advice-and-consent role.""
White House communications director Mercedes Schlapp told Fox News on Tuesday Trump had ""full and legal authority"" to appoint Whitaker.
'UNQUALIFIED AND UNCONFIRMED'
""The Attorney General's succession statute and the Constitution protect the country against exactly what President Trump has attempted to do here - pluck an unqualified and unconfirmed partisan to be the nation's chief law enforcement officer in order to protect himself rather than the rule of law,"" Frosh said in a statement.
Maryland's challenge came as part of its litigation filed against the administration in September after Sessions declined to defend the Affordable Care Act's protection of people with pre-existing medical conditions in a separate lawsuit led by Texas. The Affordable Care Act is often called Obamacare.
Frosh and the Democratic attorney general for the District of Columbia are pursuing separate litigation alleging that Trump's business dealings have violated a constitutional anti-corruption provision.
Senator Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, on Tuesday called on the panel's Republican chairman, Senator Chuck Grassley, to quickly hold hearings with Whitaker and Sessions, who was ousted by Trump a day after his party lost control of the House of Representatives in midterm congressional elections.
The circumstances surrounding the departure of Sessions ""raise serious questions"" about the legality of Whitaker's appointment and possible impact on Mueller's investigation, Feinstein wrote in a letter to Grassley.
Grassley last week said he looked forward to working with Whitaker, a former federal prosecutor in the senator's home state of Iowa who he has known for years.
Democrats and other critics urged Whitaker to step aside from overseeing Mueller's investigation. On Monday, the Justice Department said Whitaker would consult with ethics officials about any matters that could require recusal.
A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on the litigation. The department is expected in the near future to issue a legal opinion defending Whitaker's appointment.

With Sessions recused, Rosenstein appointed Mueller after Trump fired James Comey as FBI director in May 2017. The FBI had been in charge of the Russia probe.

Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) rose more than 4% after the Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland upgraded its rating on to positive from neutral and hiked its price target on the stock to $230 from $250, citing the odds of a chipmaker delivering weaker guidance are priced in.
Nvidia's near-term issues should pass in a quarter (or two), while valuation supports greatly reduced estimates and longer-term opportunities abound, Rolland said.
The rally in Nvidia helped offset mixed trading in FANG stocks, which weighed on the border tech sector.
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) erased earlier gains as investors mulled over reports that the company was set to test a lower price for its content streamed in some countries in an effort to boost sales. Its shares fell 0.65%.
The move comes as Netflix seeks to address slow growth in Asia, where it has yet to amass 2 million subscribers in any country, according to estimates by Media Partners Asia.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was flat and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) rose more than 1% on signs that both companies continued to suck in the bulk of advertising dollars in the first half of the year.
""We calculate that the digital advertising industry's two biggest players [Facebook and Google] were responsible for around 75% of all digital advertising growth in the quarter, both excluding and including search in the U.S.,"" Pivotal Research said in a note to clients, citing data released Tuesday by the Interactive Advertising Bureau."

LONDON (Reuters) - Danske Bank's (CO:DANSKE) 200 billion euro ($225 billion) money laundering scandal might be the ""tip of the iceberg"" and investigators should examine whether major Western banks played a role, a lawyer for the whistleblower said.
Stephen Kohn, a partner at U.S. law firm Kohn, Kohn and Colapinto who is representing Danske whistleblower Howard Wilkinson, told Reuters that Danske may be only a bit player in a scheme to move wealth from countries like Russia to the West.
""It looks like the tip of the iceberg,"" he told Reuters on the sidelines of a two-day London OffshoreAlert conference on financial intelligence and investigations. ""The problem is far bigger than has been reported... 
""If this is properly investigated, and the money followed all the way to the end - it all went to large, multinational Western financial institutions and either the U.S. government or other authorities have the ability to track down every transfer and any account,"" he said, without providing evidence for the allegation.
Wilkinson, a British former head of markets in Danske's Estonian branch until 2014, was outed by newspapers in September as the whistleblower who helped lift the lid on how billions of euros of non-resident money, much of it from Russia, had flowed through the tiny branch between 2007 and 2015.
After an internal investigation, published by Danske the same month, the bank said many transactions were probably suspicious. The scandal has sparked criminal investigations of Danske in Denmark, Estonia and the United States, forced out its chief executive and chairman and sent the bank's shares plunging.
Britain's National Crime Agency said in September it was investigating the use of UK-registered companies in connection with the  Danske Bank  case.
RISK OF RETALIATION
Whistleblowers who have been publicly named are at a greater risk of retaliation. Kohn said Wilkinson ""has interacted with law enforcement"" and is satisfied with their response. He declined to comment further.
The Briton is due to testify before the Danish and European Parliaments next week. But his testimony is likely to be limited because he remains potentially liable for anything he says.
""The threat of a lawsuit has a chilling effect,"" Kohn says.
Kohn believes whistleblowers need to be financial rewarded. He won a record $104 million individual reward in 2012 for whistleblower Bradley Birkenfeld, the man who exposed tax evasion facilitated by UBS (S:UBSG) - although Birkenfeld also served almost three years in jail.
The European approach, that effectively turns ""informants into martyrs"", is ""a joke"", he says.
British lawmakers continue to call for better protection for whistleblowers, who risk ending up blacklisted, bankrupt and damaged after lifting the lid on wrongdoing. But regulators have to date resisted calls for financial incentives, insisting this will not significantly increase integrity and transparency.
Kohn vehemently disagrees. He says whistleblowers might sometimes participate in wrongdoing, but that they are essential to uncovering the truth because white-collar crimes are hidden - and crime is more profitable than honesty.
Since February 1986, when U.S. whistleblowing laws were modernized, the U.S. government has paid whistleblowers $6.5 billion - and billions more have been recovered, he said.
""Europe is asleep. I am angry at what I see in Europe,"" he told the conference. 
Kohn describes Wilkinson, who he says told Danske everything he knew before resigning, as credible, with an unblemished employment history, who risked his career and livelihood to stop one of the biggest money laundering scandals in history.

""He's the real McCoy (the genuine article). He gives whistleblowing a good name,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to remove Department of Homeland Security chief Kirstjen Nielsen and is considering replacing chief of staff John Kelly in another shakeup of his administration, a source close to the White House said.
Trump has been mulling removing Nielsen, a Kelly protege who became the secretary at Homeland Security when he left the job to become Trump's chief of staff, for a number of weeks, the source said.
The source cautioned Trump could still change his mind on the matter, but said he has grown weary of her in his push to harden the U.S. border with Mexico.
Trump has not decided on a candidate to replace Nielsen, the Wall Street Journal reported.
""The Secretary is honored to lead the men and women of DHS and is committed to implementing the President's security-focused agenda to protect Americans from all threats and will continue to do so,"" said Tyler Houlton, a Department of Homeland Security spokesman, in response to an ABC News report about the possible staff changes. 
Trump is also considering replacing Kelly, an ardent defender of Nielsen, with Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff, Nick Ayers, the source said. 
Kelly, a retired Marine Corps general, has sought to bring more stability to the White House operation under the unpredictable Trump. 
During his time as chief of staff, he and the president have had a rocky relationship, according to various news reports and Bob Woodward's best-selling book ""Fear: Trump in the White House.""

If they leave, Kelly and Nielsen would join a long list of people who have been fired by Trump or resigned since he took office in January, 2017. That list includes former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was removed by the president last week.

Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON) reported a wider-than-expected loss in the third quarter, despite nearly tripling revenue, as ramp-up in investments compressed margins. Its shares fell more than 3%.
Cronos reported a third-quarter loss of $0.04 share on revenue of $3.8 million, compared with expectations for $0.02 a share on revenue of $2.72 million.
Like most of its rivals, Cronos is hoping its string of investments to boost production will turn a profit as the legalization of marijuana in Canada has sparked up demand, leading to a supply shortage, which some analysts expect could last for up to a year.
Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB), deepened its retreat from a day earlier, when its third-quarter results showed a 260% jump in revenue, but was overshadowed by a sharp uptick in sales and marketing expenses.
The company said, however, that going forward, marketing and sales costs would be ""quite a bit lower,"" as the bulk of the costs during the quarter was related to the Canadian legalization.
Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY), meanwhile, fell about 1% ahead of its third-quarter earnings report after market close Tuesday.
Wall Street expects the company to report a net loss of $0.14 a share on $10.12 million in revenue.
Tilray has been lauded by some on Wall Street as the pot stock to watch given its early mover advantage in the sector and its supply agreements with major Canadian pharmacies.
""We believe the company’s [Tilray's] supply agreements with major canadian pharmacies could offer greater awareness and easier patient access to Tilray’s cannabis products,"" Benchmark said last month.
""We expect Tilray to achieve meaningful share of the Canadian cannabis market based on initial supply agreements and an early mover advantage in creating national brands."""

The information involved how stations were performing, giving insight to rivals about whether they would raise, lower or maintain spot advertising prices, the agency said in a statement.
""Advertisers rely on competition among owners of broadcast television stations to obtain reasonable advertising rates, but this unlawful sharing of information lessened that competition and thereby harmed the local businesses and the consumers they serve,"" Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division said.

The information-sharing was uncovered during the department's review of Sinclair's planned purchase of Tribune Media, according to a person familiar with the probe who requested anonymity to speak to the media.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's top economic adviser said on Tuesday that the United States welcomed the resumption of talks with China on trade, while Vice President Mike Pence warned Beijing to change its behavior so as to avoid a new cold war with the United States.
National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow told reporters at the White House that the U.S. and Chinese governments were ""now communicating at all levels and that's a very good thing.""
Kudlow said ""it's pretty clear now"" that Trump will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 industrialized nations meeting in Argentina later this month.
""We are working on background materials in preparation and we're waiting for China to come back with some thoughts,"" he added.
When asked if he was looking for concessions before the meeting, Kudlow said, ""we would like to hear from them some responses to the things we've asked for in the last, I don't know, five or six or seven months.""
Trade negotiations between the two countries had been put on pause, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said last month. The United States has consistently sought concessions from China on intellectual property and technology, as well as tariffs on imports of U.S. goods.
Pence told the Washington Post in an interview that China should change its behavior to avoid a cold war with the United States, and Trump is looking for ""concrete proposals"" from Beijing.
""The president’s attitude is, we want to make sure they know where we stand, what we are prepared to do, so they can come to Argentina with concrete proposals that address not just the trade deficit that we face ... We’re convinced China knows where we stand,"" Pence said in the interview.
Pence also said China must offer concessions on intellectual property theft, forced technology transfer, restricted access to Chinese markets, respect for international rules and norms, and efforts to limit freedom of navigation in international waters, among other issues.
If Beijing does not produce proposals that satisfy Washington, the United States is prepared to increase economic, diplomatic and political pressure on China, Pence told the newspaper.

""We really believe we are in a strong position either way. We are at $250 billion [in tariffs] now; we can more than double that,"" Pence said. ""I don’t think it’s a matter of promises. We’re looking for results. We're looking for a change of posture.""

The call came after Hyundai Motor (KS:005380) posted a sharp drop in third-quarter earnings in late October, hitting its shares and dashing hopes of better shareholder returns. 
In May, Hyundai Motor Group, backed by founding family members, shelved an ownership restructuring plan that would have given the son of its aging chairman more control of the conglomerate, following opposition from Elliott.
In September, Elliott, run by billionaire Paul Singer, made a fresh proposal for Hyundai's ownership structure and suggested adding new independent directors to its respective boards.
In an open letter on Tuesday, Elliott called on Hyundai to return up to 8 trillion won ($7.1 billion), or 31 percent of its market value, and for its parts affiliate  Hyundai Mobis  (KS:012330) to return 4 trillion won, or 22 percent of its market capitalization, to shareholders, preferably by share buybacks.
Elliott said Hyundai Motor Group, despite having ""excess capital,"" lagged behind peers such as General Motors (N:GM) and Toyota Motor (T:7203) in shareholder returns, citing a report by consultancy Conway MacKenzie.
Elliott asked Hyundai to review its non-core assets, ""with an eye toward divesting assets that are either underutilized or contribute low returns."" 
It said the assets included land Hyundai bought in 2014 for 10.55 trillion won, more than triple the appraisal value, to build headquarters in the affluent district of Gangnam in Seoul. 
""Given the cost of delay and the lack of progress made thus far, Elliott also reserved the right to put forward the various recommendations as shareholder resolutions in the next general meetings,"" it said. 
Elliott, which challenged Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) in 2016, called on Hyundai to join the South Korean electronics giant in diversifying its board, improving shareholder returns and addressing a complex shareholding structure. 
""Hyundai Motor Group is now the only major corporate group in Korea with an unreformed legacy shareholder structure and no plan to address it,"" Elliott said in a statement on Tuesday, saying the group's ""reform efforts have stalled.""
Hyundai Motor could not immediately be reached for comment. 
In April, Elliott said it owned more than $1 billion worth of shares in three Hyundai group companies - Hyundai Motor Co, Kia Motors Corp (KS:000270) and auto-parts maker Hyundai Mobis Co Ltd. 
Elliott said on Tuesday it held more than 2.5 percent of common stock in Hyundai Mobis, 3 percent in Hyundai Motor and 2.1 percent in Kia Motors. Shares of Hyundai Motor have slumped more than 30 percent this year.

1413,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2018 12:40PM ET</span>","U.S. antitrust chief says evidence, not tweets, drives decision-making","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Department of Justice's antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, said on Tuesday that evidence drove the division's decision-making rather than pressure from the president, who recently tweeted that he supported an antitrust probe of Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA).
Speaking on CNBC, Delrahim, the assistant attorney general for antitrust, was asked about President Donald Trump's attacks on companies like Comcast and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), alleging that they break antitrust law.
""As far as what we do in our enforcement -- we need the evidence, we need the economics, (before) we go to court. Politics that goes on between various aspects of the government don't affect our decisions to make these cases,"" Delrahim said.
The DOJ's Antitrust Division cannot order the halting of a merger or breaking up of a company, but must convince a judge that such an action is needed. The department failed this year to convince a federal judge to stop AT&T's merger with Time Warner and is appealing that loss.
Delrahim said the division was ""vigilant"" in monitoring Comcast since a consent decree expired that governed its purchase with NBC Universal.
Trump tweeted support on Monday for the American Cable Association's call for an investigation into Comcast. ""They say that Comcast routinely violates Antitrust Laws,"" he wrote.
Delrahim said concern over Amazon was ""bipartisan,"" but added that the fact that a company was big and powerful did not mean that it broke antitrust law.
Trump had tweeted about his unhappiness with Amazon in July, saying: ""In my opinion the Washington Post is nothing more than an expensive lobbyist for Amazon."" Amazon chief Jeff Bezos also owns the Washington Post.
Delrahim seemed unfazed by the unusually high level of attention paid to the work of his division. 

""I think it's great that we have such a debate about free markets. And the antitrust laws (are) there to protect the free markets,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street stock prices rose on Tuesday as investors hoped U.S.-China trade tensions could ease, while the pound soared on rising prospects for a finalized agreement on the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union.
Oil prices fell more than 3 percent, but U.S. natural gas futures soared to their highest since November 2014 on forecasts for colder weather.
The U.S. benchmark S&P 500 stock index (SPX) rose on reports that U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had resumed discussions with China Vice Premier Liu He. Technology stocks bounced back a day after a rout that led the S&P 500's nearly 2 percent decline.
U.S. equities rose further after White House Economic Advisor Larry Kudlow said Washington had resumed trade talks with China and characterized the development as ""very positive.""
""It's potentially good news on the trade war front,"" said Edmund Tran, equity strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management in New York. ""Any incremental news point is going to drive market volatility, whether up or down.""
The U.S. dollar index (DXY), which has steadily climbed as the U.S.-China trade dispute has escalated, dipped 0.4 percent.
Conversely, the pound  rose 1.4 percent to $1.3033 after reports that the United Kingdom and the European Union had agreed upon the text of a Brexit agreement and that British Prime Minister Theresa May would hold a cabinet meeting on Wednesday.
The euro (EUR=EBS) also rose from a 16-month low, last up 0.6 to $1.1282, though its gains were capped by concerns over Italy's budget. The Italian government faces a Tuesday deadline to submit a revised budget to the EU.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 32.82 points, or 0.13 percent, to 25,420, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 14.02 points, or 0.51 percent, to 2,740.24 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 62.16 points, or 0.86 percent, to 7,263.03.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) added 0.67 percent to 364.44. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe (MIWD00000PUS) gained 0.36 percent.
Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes  last rose 8/32 in price to yield 3.1599 percent, from 3.189 percent late on Friday. The Treasury market was closed on Monday for the Veterans Day holiday.
Oil prices extended their fall from Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump put pressure on OPEC not to cut supply to prop up prices. 
U.S. crude (CLc1) fell 4.27 percent to $57.37 per barrel and Global benchmark Brent crude (LCOc1) was down $2.70 a barrel at $67.42.
Both crude benchmarks have fallen more than 20 percent since peaking at four-year highs in early October.

1423,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2018 12:29PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Dell taps banks to raise more cash for tracking stock offer - sources,"By Liana B. Baker and Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) - Dell Technologies Inc (N:DVMT) is working with investment banks to add more cash to a $21.7 billion offer to buy back a ""tracking stock"" tied to its software company VMware Inc (N:VMW) as it nears a deal with investors, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
The move comes after several investors in the tracking stock, including billionaire Carl Icahn, said they would not accept Dell's first offer, arguing it transfers too much value to Dell's owners, founder Michael Dell and private equity firm Silver Lake.
The acquisition of the publicly traded tracking stock would result in Dell becoming a publicly listed company without an initial public offering (IPO). Dell needs a majority of the holders of the tracking stock to approve the deal. A vote on the tracking stock offer has been scheduled for Dec. 11.
Dell issued the tracking stock in 2016 to buy data storage company EMC (NYSE:EMC) for $67 billion because it could not pay for the entire deal in cash and did not want to add to its debt burden. EMC owned a majority stake in VMware, which Dell inherited.
The security ""tracks,"" or depends on, the financial performance of VMware, and has been trading at a significant discount to VMware's stock. This has emboldened investors such as Icahn to argue that Dell's offer undervalues the tracking stock.
Dell has so far offered $109 in cash for each tracking share, up to $9 billion in total, with the remainder payable with 1.3665 shares of Dell's Class C common stock for each tracking share. That is equivalent to a 41/59 cash-stock split. Dell has said it plans to use a special dividend from VMware to fund the $9 billion portion of the deal.
Dell and tracking stock investors are now close to a deal, according to the sources. Dell is hoping to conclude negotiations with owners of the tracking stock and table a new offer as early as this week, the sources said. Negotiations have focused on a valuation of between $120 and $130 for each tracking share, though a final decision has not been made, some of the sources added. 
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Dell and Silver Lake declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal had reported last week that Dell was looking at improving on its tracking stock offer.
The tracking stock jumped 5 percent to $103.49 on the news, its highest level since it started trading in 2016.
The tracking stock battle has echoes of the $24.9 billion deal that Dell and Silver Lake clinched to take the company private in 2013, a transaction that Icahn also opposed. In that case, Icahn also managed to secure a slight improvement to the offer.
Michael Dell has turned to deal-making to transform his company from a PC manufacturer into a broader seller of information technology services, ranging from storage and servers to networking and cyber security.
As a public company, Dell could more easily use its stock as currency for acquisitions. While its debt has dropped from $57.3 billion following the EMC deal to $50.3 billion, it remains heavily indebted. The company continues to pay down debt and has told investors it aims for an investment-grade rating sometime next year.

Other investors that opposed the original tracking stock deal include P. Schoenfeld Asset Management LP, which earlier this month asked Dell to raise its offer by 20 percent. Hedge fund Elliott Management Corp is also not satisfied with Dell's offer, sources have said.

1424,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2018 12:24PM ET</span>","Brexit, trade progress drive European stocks up after tech rout","By Julien Ponthus and Helen Reid
LONDON (Reuters) - European shares recovered on Tuesday as hopes for an easing of the Sino-U.S. trade war and an imminent Brexit deal chased away the previous session's fears of a peak in tech stocks.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) rose 0.7 percent in a broad-based recovery with Germany's DAX (GDAXI) up 1.3 percent as investors turned to some strong results and tech stocks recovered.
A report that China's top trade negotiator was preparing to visit the United States ahead of a meeting between the leaders of the world's two largest economies buoyed sentiment on trade. 
Europe's tech sector (SX8P) jumped 1.7 percent, having tumbled sharply in the previous session when Wall Street's tech stocks sank on fears that sales of Apple's iPhone have peaked.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch's monthly fund manager survey found the leading U.S. and Asian tech stocks, known by their FAANG and BAT (LON:BATS) acronyms, are still considered the most crowded trade globally.
The fast-growing tech sector has seen strong returns and been overwhelmingly popular with investors over the last few years.
On Tuesday nerves about a messy Brexit were alleviated by signs a divorce agreement between Britain and the European Union was imminent, sending sterling to a seven-month high against the euro.
The currency weighed on the exporter-heavy FTSE 100 which ended flat on the day.
The telecoms sector (SXKP) was the main gainer, up 2.3 percent, as  Vodafone  (L:VOD) shares jumped 7.8 percent after the world's second largest mobile operator pledged to cut costs and seek to maximize the value of its masts and towers. 
Medical device development and healthcare service provider BTG (L:BTG) jumped 10.7 percent after announcing better-than-expected revenues and a positive outlook. 
Bayer (DE:BAYGn) shares opened higher but finished 2.9 percent lower at the bottom of the DAX as investors focused on the German pharmaceutical group's more cautious outlook. 
Bayer said forecasts for Consumer Health and Animal Health are now becoming increasingly ambitious,  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) analysts pointed out, and the two segments account for roughly 30 percent of revenues.
Some stocks suffered after earnings, though.
Ambu (CO:AMBUb), a Danish producer of single-use medical devices, was the biggest faller, down 14 percent after its results showed lower-than-expected sales of endoscopes.
Swedish snuff and cigar maker  Swedish Match  (ST:SWMA) fell 7.4 percent with traders citing reports that the FDA is planning regulation actions on flavoured cigars.
Overall third-quarter earnings are expected to increase 14.6 percent from the same period last year - or 10 percent excluding the energy sector. 

Companies have beaten revenue estimates more than average, while the rate of earnings beats has been lower than usual, one sign of building margin pressure.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Americans are losing their taste for chicken and eating more beef and pork as President Donald Trump's trade wars reduce U.S. pork exports to China and Mexico and leave cheaper bacon and ribs at home. 
An expansion in the number of U.S. hogs and cattle is contributing to the change in diets by boosting supplies of pork and beef. Restaurants are seizing on the increases to promote hamburgers instead of chicken, while grocery stores have featured pork.
The shift is hurting chicken producers, such as  Tyson Foods  Inc (N:TSN) and  Sanderson Farms  Inc (O:SAFM), said Bill Roenigk, an agricultural economist and consultant for the National Chicken Council trade group. He said the chicken sector would generally lose money or break even in the fourth quarter of 2018.
Tyson on Tuesday reported quarterly sales that missed Wall Street estimates, sending its shares lower even though the company posted an overall profit. Operating income from chicken fell nearly 34 percent from a year earlier, while beef operating income was up about 14 percent.
""The shift from chicken to beef and pork has been far more pronounced than anyone had imagined,"" said Heather Jones, managing director for investment firm Vertical Group. 
The pain for chicken producers and the increased appetite for pork are ripple effects of Trump's trade disputes, which have also reduced shipments of U.S. soybeans and sorghum to China.
""With all that pork on the market,"" Roenigk said, ""it has spilled over to affecting consumers' demand for chicken.""
Pork prices have fallen as retaliatory duties of 62 percent in China and up to 20 percent in Mexico have curtailed U.S. exports to those countries.
Kraft Heinz Co (O:KHC), which owns the Oscar Mayer brand, cut prices for bacon after pork belly prices declined. 
Ahold Delhaize's (AS:AD) Food Lion and Stop & Shop grocery stores have offered deals and launched marketing campaigns for pork, said Jarrod Sutton, a vice president for the National Pork Board trade group. 
Food Lion said it offers promotions based on product availability.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture projects per capita chicken consumption will rise only about 1.2 percent next year, compared to gains of 4.3 percent for pork and 2.6 percent for beef.

Promotions at restaurants such as Wendy's Co (O:WEN), which is featuring a ""S'Awesome"" hamburger with three strips of bacon, are helping fuel pork and beef demand, according to the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, an industry group.
Wendy's said it generally does not adjust marketing based on short-term changes in commodity prices.
Yet, quick-service restaurant chains released 54 new hamburgers through September this year, up about a third from last year, according to a survey of about 75 chains by Datassential, which analyzes menu trends. Releases of chicken products fell 14 percent, said Datassential, which also reported a decline in new pork dishes.
The slowdown in chicken consumption is a turnaround for meat companies. Tyson is building a $300 million plant to process 1.25 million more birds a week after struggling to keep up with chicken demand last year. In July, the company, which also sells beef and pork, cut its 2018 profit forecast, citing uncertainty in trade policies. 
Tyson's CEO, on a conference call on Tuesday to discuss quarterly results, said the company could benefit in 2019 if the food service industry more heavily promotes chicken. 
Mexico slapped tariffs on imports of U.S. pork after Washington implemented duties on imports of aluminum and steel. Both sides maintain their tariffs despite a recent trade deal by the United States, Mexico and Canada.
Implementation of those trade agreements should help boost pork exports and push Americans back to chicken, said Bill Lovette, chief executive of Pilgrim's Pride Corp (O:PPC). The chicken company, owned mostly by JBS SA (SA:JBSS3), reported third-quarter net sales fell 3.4 percent to $2.7 billion.
Sanderson Farms, the third-biggest U.S. poultry producer, reports earnings in December. 
Lower demand this month pushed prices for U.S. chicken breasts to their lowest weekly average on record, according to an index from food-service company ArrowStream.
Chicken supplies in cold storage facilities reached a record at more than 959 million pounds (435 million kg) at the end of September, according to USDA data. Beef and pork supplies in cold storage were about 2 percent and 10 percent below records set in 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Refrigerated storage company Lineage Logistics said meat was backing up near major U.S. ports due to tariffs, and it projected that rising meat supplies would create a shortage of storage space.
Kerry Wilson, a Florida mom, is taking advantage of the increase in beef and pork supplies. She said she grew tired of chicken after preparing it up to four nights a week and finds pork has more flavor.

""I can't gussy it up enough anymore,"" she said of chicken. ""It just seems to be the same taste.""

The S&P technology index (SPLRCT) gained 1.2 percent and shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) rose 0.4 percent following a 5 percent slump on Monday even as Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) cut its earnings estimates that came after several suppliers to the iPhone maker warned of an earnings hit.
Traders also pointed to a report, on China's top trade negotiator preparing to visit the United States before a meeting between the leaders of the world's two largest economies at the end of November, for easing some pressure on the markets.
The trade-sensitive industrial sector (SPLRCI) rose 1.3 percent, boosted by shares of  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT) and 3M Co (N:MMM).
China President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump plan to meet on the sidelines of a G20 summit held in Argentina, and investors are hoping that both the countries strike a deal on tariffs and trade that roiled financial markets since the start of the year.
""There's going to be quite a bit of volatility going into the G20 meeting this month as people try to take positions,"" said Christopher Larkin, senior vice president of trading at E-Trade Financial in New Jersey. 
""If there is more clarity on the tariff talks that are going on, that will help stabilize the market in a significant way.""
At 11:46 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was up 46.99 points, or 0.19 percent, at 25,434.17, the S&P 500 (SPX) was up 17.17 points, or 0.63 percent, at 2,743.39 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) was up 78.22 points, or 1.09 percent, at 7,279.09.
The Dow was weighed down by shares of Home Depot Inc (N:HD), which fell 1.9 percent after the company signaled a slowing U.S. housing market and said impending tariffs could raise prices and weigh on demand.
Boeing Co's (N:BA) shares fell 1.5 percent after Indonesian investigators discovered that the situation faced by the crew of the doomed Lion Air jet was not in the flight manual, raising concerns about the safety of its best selling 737 MAX aircraft.
Energy stocks (SPNY) fell as oil prices tumbled more than 4 percent, and the defensive sectors including real estate <.SPLRCR>, utilities (SPLRCU) and consumer staples (SPLRCS) also fell. 
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 1.95-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 2.40-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P index recorded seven new 52-week highs and seven new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 13 new highs and 89 new lows.

1442,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2018 11:45AM ET</span>",Pentagon expects next big F-35 contract in spring 2019,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The U.S. Defense Department expects to award  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT) an interim contract for a 12th batch of F-35 fighter jets ""very shortly"" and finalize the deal by next spring, the Pentagon's chief arms buyer Ellen Lord said.
When completed, the deal will mark another step forward for the world's biggest weapons program after years of turmoil, cost overruns and schedule delays. 
Belgium last month picked the aircraft over the Eurofighter Typhoon as replacement for its aging F-16s, agreeing a 4 billion euro ($4.5 billion) deal that made it the 12th country to select the F-35..
Negotiations on the U.S. contract are moving quickly on what is expected be the largest order to date for the F-35, Lord told Reuters at a NATO industry conference. She said she expected to wrap up the deal much faster than with the previous tranche, but gave no details on the number of jets or the value of the deal.
Sources familiar with the matter say the deal will cover more than 250 F-35 aircraft for the U.S. military and other allies. The initial placeholder agreement will set a not-to-exceed price that could be as high as $20 billion, but military officials aim to negotiate a price well below that during the coming months, the sources said.
The Pentagon in September wrapped up an $11.5 billion contract with Lockheed for 141 F-35s, lowering the price for the most common version of the stealth jet by 5.4 percent to $89.2 million. Lockheed has said it expects to cut the price of the F-35A to $80 million by 2020.
U.S. President Donald Trump and other U.S. officials have criticized the F-35 program for the delays and cost overruns, but the price per jet has declined as production has increased.
Negotiations about the 11th batch of jets dragged on much longer than expected because Trump-appointed Pentagon leadership drilled deep into the costs, people familiar with the talks have said, but Lord said she is determined to complete the current round of negotiations much more quickly.
The contract will also benefit  Northrop Grumman  Corp (N:NOC) and Britain's BAE Systems (L:BAES), which are key suppliers to Lockheed on the aircraft, as well as engine maker Pratt & Whitney, owned by United Technologies Corp (N:UTX).

1450,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2018 11:04AM ET</span>",GE seeks to raise $4 billion with sale of Baker Hughes stake,"By John Benny and Liz Hampton
HOUSTON (Reuters) -  General Electric  Co (N:GE) on Tuesday unveiled a plan to raise about $4 billion by accelerating a proposed sale of a stake in oilfield services provider Baker Hughes (N:BHGE), its latest move to simplify its businesses and reduce debt.
Under the deal, the Boston-based industrial conglomerate will sell up to 101.2 million shares on the market and Baker Hughes will repurchase another 65 million shares from its parent. Based on Tuesday's share price of $23.76, the sale would raise around $3.97 billion. 
Once a symbol of American business power, GE faltered during the 2008 financial crisis and since then has replaced two CEOs. Its stock price has shed more than 80 percent of its value from highs in early 2000. After the announcement, shares of GE rose 4.5 percent to $8.35, while Baker Hughes was up about half a percent. The two companies also struck a series of agreements covering digital technology, products and debt to pave way for the share sale. 
GE, which bought Houston-based Baker Hughes in July 2017 and agreed to maintain a 62.5 percent stake until the middle of next year, has made a series of changes to lower its debt and focus on its core businesses of jet engines, power plants and renewable energy. 
The two will continue to share certain oil and gas technologies, and has a six month lock up of GE's remaining stake in the oilfield company.
On Monday, recently appointed GE Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp said the company will sell assets with ""urgency"" to reduce debt, as GE shares tumbled as much as 10 percent and the cost of insuring its debt hit a six-year high.
""The agreements announced today accelerate that plan in a manner that mutually benefits both companies and their shareholders,"" Culp said in a statement. 
Baker Hughes CEO Lorenzo Simonelli on Tuesday said the deal provides ""clarity for our customers, employees and shareholders."" 
In June, GE said it would sell its stake in Baker Hughes over the next two to three years. As part of the new deal, the companies will dissolve a two-year lock-up that would have prevented GE from selling shares of Baker Hughes until July 2019. 
The sale comes as improving oil markets have helped Baker Hughes post a third-quarter adjusted net profit. The oil services firm also said it was optimistic about the near future with oil production in North America climbing to record levels. 
As part of the deal, GE will sell an undisclosed portion of its shares in the market and others will be acquired by Baker Hughes. GE will reduce its ownership to no more than 50.1 percent as part of the deal, the companies said.

The companies also will create a joint venture focused on rotating equipment technology, primarily used in Baker Hughes' liquefied natural gas, oil and gas production, and pipeline and industrial segments. Baker Hughes said it had entered into long-term supply and distribution agreements with GE for heavy-duty gas turbine technology.

TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Franklin Templeton Investments entered the $67 billion Israeli retail market on Tuesday after the government allowed foreign firms to offer offshore products directly to investors.
Previously, such investments had to be distributed in Israel through a local manager or bank, which increased fees and made them more expensive for Israeli investors.
""Over the years, we have been witnessing Israeli investors' increasing preference for foreign investments,"" Jenny Johnson, president and chief operating officer of Franklin Templeton, said at the opening of the group's new office in Tel Aviv.
Although assets under management of domestic funds investing in foreign securities have more than doubled in the past three years to $7.7 billion, a lack of choice means they still account for only 12 percent of total assets, she said. 
Franklin Templeton, which has $724 billion in assets under management, appointed Uzi Yitzhak to head its business in Israel, where the firm also registered two mutual funds.
INVESTMENTS
Franklin Templeton executives also gave prospective Israeli investors their views on a number of markets during the opening.
Manraj Sekhon, chief investment officer for emerging markets equity, said the firm would not be in a position to meaningfully increase its Turkish fund allocation while policies are in flux.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan last month named several advisers and a theology professor to a new economic policy committee, as Ankara seeks to reassure foreign investors spooked by a falling lira currency and high inflation.
Franklin Templeton has also not changed its position in Saudi Arabia following the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Turkey last month. The main question, he said, is how economic reforms are implemented.
Brazil, Mexico and Indonesia all offered attractive investment opportunities, Sekhon said.

John Beck, director of fixed income at Franklin Templeton, said Britain's gilt market was overvalued, while the pound ""is at the cheap end of expectations"".

""To account for this new information, we are reducing our iPhone XR/XS Max/XS units estimate, while increasing estimates of lower priced iPhone units,"" the Goldman analysts wrote in a note distributed on Tuesday. 
""We are concerned that end demand for new iPhone models is deteriorating,"" the analysts continued. ""We note this could easily right itself given the bulk of demand comes in late December but we feel more prudent sell through forecasts are warranted due to the timing and magnitude of this warning.""
The note comes days after several reports came to  similar conclusions.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts said iPhone unit sales could decline on an annual basis in both 2018 and 2019 due to weak demand in emerging markets. TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo cut his forecast for iPhone XR shipments from 100 million to 70 million. Nikkei, a Japanese business newspaper, wrote that Foxconn, which assembles the iPhone XR, had cut as many as 15 production lines for the device.
Apple's stock has slid over 10% since November 1, which is when the company said it would stop disclosing iPhone unit sales. Goldman's report is the latest evidence that analysts are now worried iPhone unit sales are going to start shrinking in the short-term, which is believed to be the reason why Apple decided to stop reporting the key metric. Apple said it preferred to focus on its transition to a services company, with regular recurring revenue.
Goldman gave Apple a neutral rating and downgraded its price target to $209 from $222. "

1461,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2018 09:34AM ET</span>","Walmart, Home Depot adopt health insurer tactic in drug copay battle","By Caroline Humer and Michael Erman
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walmart (N:WMT) and  Home Depot  (N:HD), two of the top 10 U.S. employers, have embraced a health insurance strategy that punishes drugmakers for using discount cards to keep patients from switching or stopping their medications.
Large U.S. companies have started tightly managing how employees and their family members use these popular discount, or copay, cards for everything from multiple sclerosis treatments to widely-used rheumatoid arthritis medications sold through a specialty pharmacy.
The move reflects their frustration that the coupons, which lower patient out-of-pocket spending, can be a disincentive to seeking less expensive treatments and drive up health plan costs.
For certain therapies, the insurance programs extract more money from the drugmaker or redirect the employee to a cheaper medicine, according to benefits experts.
Home Depot's program, run by CVS Health (N:CVS), has a particular focus on therapies for cystic fibrosis, hepatitis C, cancer, HIV, psoriasis, pulmonary arterial hypertension and hyperlipidemia, or extremely high cholesterol, according to health plan documents provided to Reuters.
The company, which has 400,000 employees, said the program affects fewer than 1 percent of its plan members. 
Yet those participants can have an outsized impact on spending because of how costly it is to treat their conditions.
Specialty drugs can account for more than half of a corporate health plan's spending on medicines, according to benefits consultant Mercer. 
Employers who use the most comprehensive program at CVS can save up to 7 percent on their total specialty medication costs, CVS told Reuters.
Express Scripts Holding Co (O:ESRX), the largest U.S. manager of pharmacy benefits and the manager of Walmart's program, has a similar broad-reaching program across specialty medications. But it also offers a more aggressive focus on hepatitis C, oral oncology drugs and hereditary angioedema treatments. 
CONCERNED DRUGMAKERS
The programs, known as copay ""accumulators"" and copay ""maximizers,"" are expected to expand in the next two years, from about 25 percent of U.S. employers to as much as 50 percent, according to the National Business Group on Health.
Drugmakers ""are concerned about it because the bottom line is that it will cost them more money,” said Brian Marcotte, the group's chief executive.
Drugmakers are worried about the hit to profits if many more employers sign on. They are also concerned because they cannot easily track when the programs are being used. 
Eli Lilly & Co (N:LLY) executives said last week that copay accumulator programs were having an impact on its Taltz psoriasis drug and Forteo for osteoporosis, but that it did not feel there was ""significant exposure."" 
 Pfizer  (N:PFE) and AstraZeneca (L:AZN) executives said in recent interviews with Reuters that they are monitoring the effect of these programs.
""The impact on our business is relatively limited, but it is a concern,"" said Ruud Dobber, who heads Britain-based AstraZeneca's U.S. commercial operations.
AbbVie (N:ABBV), maker of top-selling arthritis treatment Humira, said in April it expects moderately higher spending on copay assistance this year.
BYPASSING THE COPAY
More than 170 million Americans have health coverage through their employers and pay some portion of their prescription drug costs, amounting to up to thousands of dollars a year in copayments. Employers say that keeps workers aware of the rising cost of medicines and more likely to accept cheaper alternatives, where possible. 
Drugmakers have tried to bypass that requirement to keep patients using their medicines. They offer discount cards that keep the patient's payment low, say at $25, when they fill a prescription. The drugmaker pays the remainder required by the health plan, thwarting employers' intentions. 
Pharmaceutical industry spending on copay cards has more than doubled to $7 billion over the past five years, mostly due to coupons offered on higher-cost specialty drugs, according to consultancy ZS Associates.
The programs at Express Scripts and CVS, which manage prescription drug benefits for employers, change how this works.
A copay ""accumulator"" recognizes when an employee uses a drugmaker discount card and makes sure that money does not apply toward their annual out-of-pocket spending requirement. 
When the copay card runs out of money, a patient must either cover the full copay cost, get a new discount card, or stop filling the prescription. The program can apply to almost any drug coupon used at a pharmacy working with the pharmacy benefit manager.
A copay ""maximizer"" is more limited in scope, but potentially as costly to the drugmaker. They apply only to a short list of drugs that employees purchase from specialty pharmacies run by Express Scripts and CVS. 
In maximizer programs some benefit managers, including Express Scripts, make sure patients sign up to receive copay cards from the manufacturers. They then raise the patient's required copayment to tap the discount cards for the maximum amount set by a drugmaker, which can be more than $10,000 annually for pricey drugs.

New Jersey-based pharma and managed care consultancy Zitter Health Insights estimates that there are more than 41 million Americans in plans that use an accumulator and 9 million in plans with the maximizer approach. It is not clear how much overlap there is between the two as some employers use both.

(Reuters) -  Johnson Controls  International Plc (N:JCI) said on Tuesday it would sell its power solutions business, which makes car batteries, to investment firm Brookfield Business Partners L.P., in a cash deal valued at $13.2 billion.
Shares of Johnson Controls were up 3.5 percent at $35.40 before the bell.
The deal will allow Johnson Controls to focus on its building technologies and solutions business, which makes heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, as well as building access control and fire detection systems.
Reuters had reported, late last month, that Brookfield and Johnson Controls were close to finalizing terms for the sale of the unit, whose batteries are used in about a third of cars globally.
The deal represents the biggest shake-up at Johnson Controls since its merger in 2016 with Tyco International.
Johnson Controls' power solutions business, which makes and distributes about 154 million lead-acid batteries for passenger cars and light trucks annually, carries higher margins but has been capital intensive for Johnson Controls, analysts have said.
The company expects to deploy $3.0 to $3.5 billion of proceeds toward debt paydown and retain an investment grade credit rating, the company said in a statement.
More deals in the sector are likely, as industrial conglomerates continue to separate businesses that are too disparate in terms of financial performance. 
The company expects the transaction to close by June 30, 2019.

Centerview Partners and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) were financial advisers to Johnson Controls, and Simpson Thacher served as legal advisers.

1488,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 13, 2018 08:40AM ET</span>","Small-Cap Stocks Should Be Doing Better, So Why Aren’t They?","(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Small, on Wall Street, has not been beautiful lately. And that could be bad news not just for investors but the economy in general.
Shares of small-capitalization companies, generally considered those with a market value of less than $1 billion as measured by the S&P Small Cap 600 index, have fallen just more than 9 percent in the past three months, or about triple the drop of the S&P 500 Index, which tracks the market’s largest companies, in the same period. That’s a little bit of a reversal and most likely a surprise to many strategists on Wall Street who thought that 2018 would finally be the year that small caps, after years of underperformance, would leave large caps in the dust.
And they did for a while. In the first half of the year, it was a near mirror image of what is happening now. Small-cap stocks had returned 9.5 percent, including dividends, while the S&P 500 had returned a lowly 2.6 percent.
Jim Paulsen, a market strategist at investment research firm the Leuthold Group, expressed surprise in a note on Monday that the small-cap stock rally hasn’t continued. Going back to the mid-1920s, Paulsen found that the average small-cap surge lasted much longer — just more than six years. And it’s particularly odd given that the case for small-cap outperformance, for this year at the very least, was pretty compelling.
First, President Donald Trump started a wide-ranging trade war that has recently narrowed to China. That was relatively less bad news for small-cap stocks because they generally have less business overseas. This year’s corporate tax cut also seemed to play into the favor of smaller companies, which generally pay higher tax rates than multinational ones and therefore would obtain more of the savings. And with global growth flagging, particularly in China, small-cap stocks seemed poised to benefit in an outsized way from the resilient U.S. economy. Finally, as Paulsen pointed out in his note, small caps have generally done better than large ones when inflation is on the rise. Paulsen’s logic is that smaller companies often sell products or services that are more specialized, making the companies less vulnerable to a price war. And rising inflation has been one of the biggest fears out there.
Much of the above appears to still be true and yet small caps have fallen anyway, which some would suggest just underscores the market’s irrationality and a bubble in large company shares (looking at you, FANG stocks) and the logic of shifting money into smaller companies.
That might prove doubly wrong. On Monday, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) released a report on third-quarter earnings that said while results were generally good for corporate America, small companies did relatively worse in the third three months of the year than larger ones. Earnings for the companies in the S&P 600 were, on average, 2 percent better than expected, but revenue missed expectations by 1 percent. The bottom line of big companies were 5 percent better than expected, and revenue exceeded expectations by 1 percent.
It’s not clear exactly why the trends that investors were betting on when it comes to small caps haven’t played out. One surprise could be that the impact of Trump’s trade efforts has reverberated more widely than expected. According to Bank of America, 29 percent of the companies in the S&P Small Cap 600 that have reported earnings talked about the effect of tariffs on their business in their conference calls with analysts and investors. That compares with a similar 31 percent for companies in the S&P 500. Another problem could be that more of the debt of smaller companies is variable. That’s not a great thing when interest rates are rising. Last, the withering earnings from domestic-focused small companies could indicate that the U.S. economy is not as strong as many people think.
So while the recent drop in small-cap stocks could be viewed as a buying opportunity, it could also be seen as a subtle warning about weakness and potential trouble ahead."

Genish was appointed last year to run the underperforming former monopoly by TIM's then controlling shareholder, French media group  Vivendi  (PA:VIV), but since then directors backed by activist fund Elliott have wrested control of the board. Telecom Italia said in a statement that it would meet on Sunday to appoint a new chief executive. It gave no explanation for the abrupt departure which Genish condemned as a Soviet-style putsch.
Speaking a few hours after the board stripped him of his executive powers, Genish told Reuters that the environment inside TIM was dysfunctional and that several directors had been campaigning against him for months.
Genish, who was born in Israel, said he was concerned about the future of the company and wanted to remain on the board.
""I personally will and am committed to do anything to fight and defend the rights of all shareholders from my position as a board member.
""I don't know why people always refer to me as a Vivendi guy because I want what's best for all shareholders,"" he added.
BOARD TENSIONS
Former FiatChrysler executive Alfredo Altavilla is seen as a leading candidate to replace Genish and is currently on the board as an independent director.
Luigi Gubitosi, who previously ran the Wind telecoms business in Italy and is also on the Telecom board is seen as another candidate, along with Stefano De Angelis the former head of the company's Brazilian business.
Genish had been pursuing a three-year turnaround plan, focusing on a digital transformation and fixing TIM's finances, but sources say some Elliott directors wanted him to put higher priority on a possible spin-off of its fixed-line networks. 
Elliott pulled off a boardroom coup in May when it secured two thirds of the seats on the Telecom Italia board after a shareholder vote.
Vivendi reacted angrily to what it called a mean and cynical maneuver by some board members who moved secretly against Genish, convening the board while he was overseas on business.
""We decry, we condemn the destabilization behind this decision and the disgraceful methods. We reserve all our rights to defend all shareholders interests,"" a Vivendi spokesman said.
Elliott responded by saying that Vivendi had rebuffed previous attempts at dialogue.
""We are open, and remain open, to a dialogue between us as shareholders of TIM,"" an Elliott spokeswoman said.
On Monday, Genish said in a statement he supported the idea of merging TIM's fixed-line assets with the broadband network being developed by smaller rival Open Fiber, provided TIM was in control of the combined network. 
Italy is preparing legislation that could lead to such a merger, sources close to the matter have said. 

Chairman Fulvio Conti will hold the chief executive's powers until the board meets again on Sunday to appoint a new CEO. 
Tuesday's meeting was convened while Genish was visiting South Korea. He joined the meeting by phone, said a source familiar with the matter. 
TIM shares fell around 1 percent after the company statement but quickly recovered ground.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Europe's top court dealt the food industry a blow on Tuesday as it dismissed an attempt by a Dutch cheese maker to copyright its cream cheese, saying that the taste of a food product does not qualify for copyright protection.
Dutch company Levola Hengelo, maker of a cheese spread called Heksenkaas (witches' cheese), took rival Smilde to court for making what it said was a copy of its product and hence infringed its copyright in the taste of the cheese.
The Dutch court subsequently sought guidance from the Luxembourg-based European Court of Justice (ECJ).
ECJ judges backed the July recommendation of the court adviser.
""The taste of a food product is not eligible for copyright protection,"" the ECJ said.
Unlike a literary, pictorial, cinematographic or musical work, the taste of a food product cannot be identified with precision and objectivity, judges said.
Furthermore, taste depends on the person tasting the product, age, food preferences and the environment and context in which the food is consumed, the court said.
Heksenkaas, now a subsidiary of Dutch food maker Salad Signature which bought it from Levola Hengelo early this year, said it was disappointed with the court ruling.

""We find it a pity and incorrect that the creative expression in food and perfumes do not have copyright protection and that everyone can make a copy of it,"" said Heksenkaas director Michel Wildenborg.

1511,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2018 07:40AM ET</span>",EU states back stronger money laundering monitoring of banks,"By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union governments have reached a preliminary deal to clamp down on money-laundering by strengthening bank supervision, but do not address key loopholes, documents show.
A series of money-laundering cases at banks in several EU states have forced regulators to act after public outcry.
The preliminary deal, which could be finalised before EU finance ministers are due to meet in December, confirms proposals made by the European Commission in September to give more powers to the European Banking Authority (EBA).
However, it does not address loopholes that give states large discretion on imposing sanctions or the creation of a dedicated agency to counter money laundering at EU or euro zone level, as proposed by the European Central Bank.
EU states have agreed to give the EBA new powers to force national supervisors to investigate cases of suspected breaches of anti money laundering rules, the documents prepared by the Austrian presidency of the EU and dated Nov. 12 show.
The plans were broadly supported by EU governments, diplomats said on Tuesday. The supervision reform is expected to be coupled with a plan in December that lists actions to be taken over the coming months by EU states.
In exceptional cases, when national supervisors do not act within set deadlines, EBA could take measures against a bank ""requiring it to take all necessary action to comply with its obligations"", one of the documents says.
LOOPHOLES
But decisions on penalties would remain in the hands of member states, some of whom have shown little interest in imposing or trumpeting sanctions, fearing reputational damage.
International guidelines say publicizing sanctions is one of the most effective tool to prevent money laundering.
The EBA has already the power to investigate breaches of money-laundering rules and did so against Malta over its supervision of Pilatus Bank, which was shut down last week over financial crime allegations.
Under the plans, the EBA would get more powers and staff, but it will continue to depend on vague laws that have prevented it from acting in the past. 
The EBA admitted that it could not pursue its probe into Malta's financial supervisor because of a lack of clarity in EU rules, which will not change.
Under the reforms, the EBA would get ten new employees from two now to monitor risks of money laundering at hundreds of EU banks.

The ECB has called for a new agency with more resources dedicated to this task, but these calls have so far been opposed by member states who prefer maintaining national control.

1512,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 13, 2018 07:40AM ET</span>","Canada Gets It Right on Cannabis, Wrong on Oil, GMP CEO Says","(Bloomberg) -- The roll-out of legal cannabis is a prime example of how Canada can get things right. Energy shows how the country sometimes gets it wrong.
That’s the view of GMP Capital Inc.’s Harris Fricker, who is seeing deal-making in marijuana and blockchain eclipsing the traditional industries of energy and mining that were once bread-and-butter businesses for the Toronto-based financial services firm.
Canada has become a world leader in cannabis, with initial support from Canadian investors giving way to capital inflows from the U.S., Europe and Asia thanks to a welcoming regulatory environment, according to Fricker. That’s a stark contrast to Canada’s oil-and-gas sector, where major pipeline projects have failed to get off the ground, leading to a record price discount for the nation’s oil sands crude.
“Cannabis is a poster child for how to do it,"" GMP’s chief executive officer said Monday in an interview at Bloomberg’s Toronto office. “Oil-and-gas is a poster child of how not to do it.""
GMP is benefiting from interest in blockchain and cannabis, with two-thirds of its investment banking business coming from outside natural resources, Fricker said Friday after releasing third-quarter results. GMP had a 72 percent surge in revenue in the quarter from a year earlier, led by strong investment-banking activity. Fricker said cannabis and blockchain ""admirably"" filled the void of a beleaguered commodities division.
Staggering Run
The cannabis sector provides the greatest immediate potential, with what Fricker describes as a “staggering"" five-year run ahead of it. Canadian investment banks like GMP and Canaccord Genuity Group Inc. are benefiting from a surge in listings in Canada by domestic and U.S. pot companies while cannabis remains illegal at the federal level south of the border.
Opportunities in blockchain -- the distributed digital ledger technology that underpins Bitcoin -- will start to materialize in five to seven years, he said. Fricker predicted a year ago that as many as 50 blockchain-related companies would go public in Canada. The plunge in bitcoin prices this year has cooled that market for now, he said.
""Blockchain has more potential because you’re talking about changing the way value is transmitted,"" Fricker said, calling that shift from a 200-year-old traditional accounting system the “Holy Grail.” “As it takes root, its ability to profoundly change society is greater.""
GMP, which is hosting a blockchain technology conference in Toronto Tuesday, is better positioned to provide investment-banking services to these emerging industries than the bank-owned investment banks and U.S. firms because his company is more agile and nimble, Fricker said.
No Salad
“If they’re a cruise ship, we’re a Viking ship,"" Fricker said. ""I tell my guys never, never get the two confused because there’s no salad bar on a Viking ship.""
As a part of the strategic shift, GMP now has 15 bankers working in the cannabis space, and another 10 on blockchain. Staffing in the energy sector, traditionally the bank’s focus along with mining, has been cut in half, he said.
Still, Fricker said Canada shouldn’t turn its back on resources, and efforts to move away entirely from oil-and-gas are misguided.
“We have been blessed with one of the great caches of resource wealth in the world and harvesting that responsibly -- including the gold standard and environmental -- should absolutely be the rule that governs,"" Fricker said. “But harvest it we must.""
Advance Energy
Fricker expressed frustration at Canada’s inability to advance energy infrastructure, including pipelines to deliver oil and gas out of land-locked Alberta. The impasse has led to record discounts of more than $50 a barrel for some Canadian crude relative to global benchmarks. The federal government was forced to take over the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion in May after  Kinder Morgan  Inc (NYSE:KMI). halted work amid rising opposition from environmental groups and the British Columbia government.
“We are at an historic high in the differential and we can’t pipe oil product -- which is our single largest revenue source in this country -- to either coast.""
Canada’s energy woes haven’t helped GMP’s stock, as many investors link the company to that sector. GMP has dropped 40 percent this year, more than six times the decline in Canada’s benchmark stock index, cutting its market value to about C$150 million ($113 million).
Beyond investment banking, Fricker said he wants to expand the Richardson GMP wealth-management division by attracting more advisers to its platform. He has a five-year goal of lifting assets under management to C$50 billion from its current level of C$30 billion.
“Given the changes the banks are making in their wealth-management businesses, we’re optimally positioned to attract large book investment advisers who want to be in the advice delivery game,” he said. “That’s where we’re seeing our growth come from.""

(Reuters) -  Home Depot  Inc (N:HD) exceeded analyst estimates for quarterly comparable-store sales on Tuesday, as consumers spent money on remodeling their homes amid a shaky U.S. housing market.
Shares of the retailer climbed 3.4 percent to $185.45 in premarket trading, after the retailer also raised its forecast for annual sales and profit ahead of the holiday shopping season.
Uncertainty over future home prices and a shortage of properties for sale have spurred homeowners and contractors to remodel homes instead of buying or building houses, spurring demand for Home Depot products.
""We believe (the results are) a testament to the overall strength of demand in the home improvement market,"" said Chief Executive Officer Craig Menear.
In August, Menear said homeowners were spending more as they viewed their homes as an investment rather than an expense. 
Home price gains slowed further in August, a new sign that higher mortgage rates were weighing on housing demand.
Sales at U.S. Home Depot stores open for more than a year surged 5.4 percent during the third quarter ended Oct. 28, above analysts' expectations of a 4.38 percent increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The number of customer transactions at Home Depot stores rose 1.4 percent, while the average check increased 3.6 percent.
The Atlanta-based retailer now expects sales to rise 7.2 percent in the year ending January, compared with an earlier forecast of 7 percent growth. It raised its earnings forecast to $9.75 per share from $9.42 previously.
Home Depot's third-quarter net earnings rose to $2.87 billion, or $2.51 per share, from $2.17 billion, or $1.84 per share, a year earlier. That beat analysts' average estimate of $2.26 per share.

Net sales overall climbed 5.1 percent to $26.30 billion, edging past analysts' expectations for $26.26 billion.

(Reuters) - Despite market wobbles, the United States is the most favored equity region for global fund managers, who broadly expect the S&P500 index to rise another 12 percent before peaking, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch's latest investor survey showed on Tuesday. 
The November survey, canvassing investors managing $641 billion, was conducted from Nov 2-8 as funds, relieved over the outcome of U.S. midterm elections, rushed to buy more equities. 
The survey found investors gloomy on world economic growth prospects, with a net 44 percent expecting a deceleration in the coming year, the worst outlook since the 2008 financial crisis. A net 54 percent expect a Chinese slowdown, the most bearish in over two years.
A trade war was named as the top risk for the sixth month in a row, followed by central bank policy tightening.
GRAPHIC: Evolution of biggest 'tail risk' on BAML survey - https://tmsnrt.rs/2PnuJcW
Yet only 11 percent expected a global recession in 2019, and in a sign of confidence, poll participants cut their cash balances to an average 4.7 percent, versus last month's 5.1 percent.
They also upped allocation to U.S. shares by 10 percentage points from October to a net 14 percent overweight, the poll showed, while tech shares - known collectively as FAANG and BAT (LON:BATS) - remained the ""most crowded"" trade for the tenth straight month, named by 29 percent of respondents.
GRAPHIC: The FAANGs - https://tmsnrt.rs/2PoTeXk
Another 22 percent saw a ""long"" position on the dollar as the most crowded trade, while ""short"" U.S. Treasury bonds was cited by 25 percent. 
In response to a question on where the S&P 500 (SPX) would peak in the current bull run, investors pointed to 3,056, up 12 percent from today's level. But a third of respondents said the market had already peaked.
While FAANGs - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) - remain popular, alongside China's BATs - Baidu,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent -, there are signs investors' tech-mania could be turning.
BAML said its poll showed allocation to the global tech sector collapsed to the lowest level since February 2009, with just a net 18 percent of investors now overweight the sector.
Tech, in particular iPhone-maker Apple, has led the latest sell-off on Wall Street, which saw the S&P500 slump 2 percent and the Nasdaq lose 3 percent. 
""We remain bearish, as investor positioning does not yet signal 'The Big Low' in asset markets,"" Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at BAML, told clients. 
A poll of European funds, however, revealed a higher degree of gloom, with one in six investors seeing a recession as ""fairly likely"", though they were less pessimistic than in October. 
Sentiment was poor on European assets as a whole, with just a net one percent of global investors overweight euro zone equities - down from a net five percent last month - and the lowest level since December 2016. 

Britain was the most ""disliked"" region for equity investors, with a net 27 percent of respondents underweight, versus 19 percent underweight in October.

Asked if Donald Trump could take further measures to thwart a project which the president has said would leave EU countries even more beholden to Moscow for their energy, Gordon Sondland said: ""We have not deployed the full set of tools yet that could significantly undermine if not outright stop the project.""
Addressing an audience at the European Policy Centre think-tank in Brussels, Sondland added: ""We're hoping that the opposition to the project works organically, because the EU and its member countries agree that dependence on Russian energy is not a good long-term geopolitical decision.
""If that philosophy is not adopted and Nord Stream continues, then the president has many, many other tools at his disposal -- I'm not going to go through the litany -- to try and curb and stop the project.""
In August, Trump signed new sanctions on Russia into law that the pipeline's promoter, Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), said could hold up some of its projects. For now, construction is continuing with the participation of some major EU companies, despite opposition from many EU states and from the EU executive.
Germany, the pipeline's destination, refuses to join EU opposition, describing it as a private enterprise.
Last week, on a visit to Poland which is a vocal critic of Nord Stream 2, U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry said Trump was maintaining the option of imposing sanctions.
Washington has not detailed potential actions but one way in which the United States could undermine the project would be by penalizing big multinational firms working on it.
Sondland stressed that U.S. opposition was not based on hopes of exporting more U.S. gas to Europe but on concern that Russia could increase its leverage on key allies in the U.S.-led NATO alliance through its control of their energy supplies.
""We don't want to see someone's gas turned off in the middle of the winter when there is a political crisis,"" he said. 
""When Europe is vulnerable, the United States is vulnerable and we don't want to put ourselves in that position.""
Gazprom is the sole shareholder in Nord Stream 2, shouldering half of the 9.5 billion euro ($10.7 billion) construction cost. Gazprom's Western partners are Germany's Uniper and Wintershall, Anglo-Dutch group Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), France's Engie and Austria's OMV.

1517,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2018 07:15AM ET</span>",Trump's steel tariffs create big profits but few new jobs,"By Timothy Aeppel
SEDALIA, Missouri (Reuters) -  Nucor  Corp (NYSE:NUE), America’s largest steelmaker, planned a new plant in Sedalia, Missouri, long before U.S. President Donald Trump imposed tariffs to protect the industry – and it does not need them to make money.
Although the firm helped lead the lobbying push for tariffs on imports, executives say they invested in Sedalia and two other sites to capitalize on an already profitable strategy that doesn't depend on government help.
While Trump has played up the narrative of downtrodden steel workers losing jobs to unscrupulous foreign competitors, most of the benefit from his 25 percent tariffs are flowing to the already strong bottom lines of Nucor and other modernized and globally competitive U.S. steel firms, according to interviews with industry executives, experts and a Reuters review of company earnings.
Even if tariffs prompt such firms to expand, they are not likely to add large numbers of factory jobs because they have stayed competitive by slashing the amount of labor required to make steel.
(For a graphic on steel industry efficiency and job loss, see: https://tmsnrt.rs/2PLloLb )
The Commerce Department said in a statement to Reuters that tariffs will help the Sedalia plant and 12 other steel projects create about 3,405 jobs. That's a 2.4 percent gain industrywide, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute.
About 1,400 of those jobs at six projects, including the three Nucor sites, were planned before tariffs or do not rely on them, according to some of the firms and a Reuters review of company documents. In addition, two other projects by Republic Steel, which would create 690 jobs by restarting previously idled operations, are not certain to go forward, the company said.
A Commerce Department spokesman did not comment on whether all the projects on the administration's list depended on tariffs but pointed out that steel imports have declined recently and domestic production has increased. The department said broad tariffs on imports were needed because of rampant “chicanery” by foreign producers who evaded existing countervailing and anti-dumping duties, which are applied narrowly to specific products.
Nucor has led the sector’s transformation to labor-saving plants since the 1970s, replacing older blast furnaces with more efficient modern electric arc furnaces.
Trump’s tariffs may prove pivotal in extending the life of older, less efficient plants such as U.S. Steel’s Granite City plant near St. Louis, where the president held an event in July to tout tariffs. The company credits tariffs for its decision to add 800 jobs by restarting two blast furnaces it had idled in 2015. A total of 1,500 workers will now work in a factory where sparks fly and molten steel is still poured from giant ladles in a labor-intensive, multi-step process.
At Nucor's plant in Sedalia, by contrast, 225 people will make steel with a high-tech furnace that shoots electricity through scrap metal to melt it into new products. That technology is now used to produce nearly 70 percent of U.S. steel - with a third less labor and energy, according to Charles Bradford, president of Bradford Research Inc.
Nucor CEO John Ferriola testified in Washington last year that tariffs would encourage steel-sector investment, but he emphasized in a statement to Reuters that the company's own capital projects are ""designed to be competitive even without tariffs.""
Although Nucor's expansions don't depend on protectionist policy, a company spokesperson said, tariffs make such investments easier by limiting the dumping of artificially low-priced steel on the U.S. market.
Nucor announced last month that it had nearly tripled its third-quarter profits, to $676.66 million, compared to a year ago. Earnings for steel companies in the S&P's steel index soared more than 75 percent in the first half of 2018 and are expected to jump 166 percent in the second half, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
'TRANSFORMATIVE' JOBS
Nucor has led the way in slashing labor costs with modern factories, a trend driving industry job loss as the hours of labor needed to produce a ton of steel has been cut from nearly 10 to two since 1980, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute.
Nucor selected Sedalia because of its location on a main rail line, near ample scrap metal sources and major construction markets needing the plant’s steel rebar. 
Although the plant will create few jobs compared to steel factories of the past, the positions – with salaries averaging $65,000 - are highly coveted in Sedalia, where home values average $86,000 and 15 percent of adults have a college degree, according to U.S. census data.
The desirability of the jobs underscores a political dynamic often lost in the debate over Trump’s trade policy. In places like Sedalia, where 70 percent of residents of the surrounding county voted for Trump, steel jobs are prized over other blue-collar work.
Sedalia assigned a team of 10 people to court Nucor for a year, and the state provided tax incentives that could total nearly $27.3 million over 15 years. Local economic development director Jessica Craig called the jobs ""transformative.""
'DEATH BY CHINA'
Nucor gets a warm reception in Washington, too, where it's the biggest spender on lobbying among steel firms, laying out $1.25 million so far this year, down from a peak of $2.71 million in 2015, according to Nucor disclosures compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics.
Nucor's political spending, which also includes millions of dollars in donations to political candidates, started under former CEO Dan DiMicco, who started in 2000 and stepped down in 2012. DiMicco went on to advise Trump on manufacturing during the presidential transition and is now a member of his Advisory Committee for Trade Policy Negotiations, a key venue for business leaders to influence U.S. trade negotiators.
Nucor also gave $1 million to a San Diego nonprofit in 2011, which was used by Peter Navarro - now a top Trump trade adviser - to make a film called ""Death by China."" At one point, the film depicts a knife emblazoned with ""made in China"" plunging into an American flag as a voice-over intones: ""China is the only major nation in the world that is preparing to kill Americans."" 
DiMicco said his experience running Nucor shaped his views.
""My customers came to me and said, 'China is killing us',"" he said in an interview, ""so this turned into something much larger than the steel industry … You may have to put tariffs on every product from China to change their behavior.""
As they raise alarms about unfair competition, however, Nucor executives take pride in the company's performance despite such headwinds. Nucor has been profitable since 1968 in every year but one – 2009, amid a global financial crisis.
Nucor has also sought to block other companies' efforts to win exemptions from the tariffs through a Commerce Department process that awards them in cases where, for instance, a company can't find the type of steel it needs domestically. Nucor said it filed objections to about 10 percent of the more than 42,000 steel exemption requests received as of October 22. 
They included those from companies such as NLMK Pennsylvania LLC, which sought exemptions for imported slabs it uses to make steel coils.
""They don't even make the kind of slabs we use,"" CEO Bob Miller said of Nucor, who he believes wants to compete with him in selling coils. ""It's totally anti-competitive.""
The tariffs are boosting capacity of the slabs NLMK needs, Nucor said in a statement, so there should be ""plenty of slabs available domestically.""
LOST PROFITS, JOBS
Tariff critics argue that rising profits for the steel industry come at the expense of its customers and their workers. Higher prices mean steel users - companies making everything from tractors to skyscrapers - could cut 16 jobs for every one added in steel manufacturing, according to the Trade Partnership Worldwide LLC, a pro-trade economic forecasting and consulting firm in Washington.
Tariff advocates call such worries overblown.
""What you see six months into the steel tariffs is that the manufacturing economy is strong,"" says Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing.
Steel consumers say their cutbacks will come over time, as higher steel prices erode their competitiveness.
Major automakers including Ford, Honda, Fiat Chrysler and General Motors (NYSE:GM) have said the steel tariffs will mean billions of dollars in new costs for the industry, and GM recently announced cuts to North American white collar staff.
The impact reaches far beyond auto factories to anyone who uses steel. Joe Pecoraro, a project executive at Skender Construction, a Chicago builder, said the tariffs caused him to delay two projects that would have produced at least 130 construction jobs.
""The cost of everything made of steel,"" he said, ""has gone through the roof this year.""

1518,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 13, 2018 07:10AM ET</span>",World's Most Active IPO Market Starts to Show Signs of Stress,"(Bloomberg) -- Amid a banner year for Hong Kong listings, cracks are starting to appear in the world’s biggest market for initial public offerings.
A parenting website part-owned by  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. on Tuesday delayed the launch of its Hong Kong IPO, while one of China’s top travel-booking sites started taking orders for an offering in the city that’s a fraction of its earlier fundraising target.
Backing from some of China’s biggest firms may not be enough to get investors excited in a market like this. Babytree Group, which abruptly canceled a press conference to kick off its listing, counts Alibaba and billionaire Guo Guangchang’s Fosun International Ltd. as investors. It hasn’t announced a new timetable for the deal.
Meanwhile, travel website Tongcheng-Elong Holdings Ltd. started a roadshow Tuesday for an IPO of as much as $232 million. The company was earlier considering a fundraising target of $800 million to $1 billion, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Unlike most listings in Hong Kong, the deal launched without any cornerstone investors.
Such investors typically commit to hold their stock for six months. That’s become a risky proposition in Hong Kong, where the benchmark index has fallen 23 percent from its January high. It doesn’t help that roughly three-quarters of Hong Kong IPOs this year are trading below their offer prices. A representative for Tongcheng-Elong declined to comment.
This all adds up to bad news for a market that has hosted three of the world’s five biggest IPOs in 2018. Hong Kong first-time share sales have raised $37.2 billion this year, more than double the same period last year.

The shares rose as much as 2.7 percent in early Frankfurt trading after the company reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of 2.2 billion euros ($2.47 billion), which beat analysts’ estimates.
Bayer repeated that profit and sales will grow this year, even as its consumer health and animal businesses struggle. Chief Executive Officer Werner Baumann defended Roundup’s key ingredient glyphosate after a judge last month upheld a jury’s verdict that it contributed to a dying groundskeeper’s cancer, saying its safety is backed by more than 800 scientific studies.
“We’ve decided to defend ourselves by every means available, because glyphosate is a fully safe and good product when properly used,"" Baumann said on a conference call with reporters.
The number of Roundup plaintiffs has increased to about 9,300, according to the Leverkusen, Germany-based company. Uncertainty over the liability has hurt the stock price.
Sales at Bayer’s crop science division increased 84 percent last quarter, boosted by the addition of Monsanto. The new lines of business picked up in the takeover performed much better than other parts of Bayer’s agriculture unit, Gunther Zechmann, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., wrote in a note to clients.
While Bayer expects to meet its full-year earnings forecasts overall, the consumer health and animal health units may fall short of their own targets, the company said. The singling out of those divisions doesn’t indicate anything about the company’s future plans for them, Baumann said.

1520,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2018 06:46AM ET</span>",Goldman Sachs bankers 'cheated' Malaysia over 1MDB: PM Mahathir,"KUALA LUMPUR/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said bankers at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) ""cheated"" the country in dealings with state fund 1MDB and that U.S. authorities have promised to help return the fees the Wall Street bank earned from the fund.
The U.S. investment bank has been under scrutiny for its role in helping raise funds through bond offerings for 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB), which is the subject of corruption and money-laundering investigations in at least six countries.
Goldman's stock fell to a near two-year low on Monday after Malaysia's Minister of Finance Lim Guan Eng said his country would seek a ""full refund"" of the around $600 million in fees the bank earned from raising $6.5 billion for the fund. 
A spokesman for Goldman Sachs on Monday said in an email to Reuters that the bank denied any wrongdoing. 
The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has said about $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB, including some money that Goldman Sachs helped raise, by high-level officials of the fund and their associates from 2009 through 2014.
U.S. prosecutors filed criminal charges against two former Goldman Sachs bankers earlier this month. One of them, Tim Leissner, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to launder money and conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
""There is evidence that Goldman Sachs has done things that are wrong,"" Mahathir said in an interview with U.S. news channel CNBC aired on Tuesday.
""Obviously we have been cheated through the compliance by Goldman Sachs people,"" he said, without specifying details.
The bank's compliance controls ""don't work very well"", he added.
A second Goldman Sachs spokesman in Hong Kong declined to comment on Mahathir's comments in the interview.
Asked by reporters later in Singapore if he had officially requested the DOJ to help return money that Goldman earned from 1MDB, Mahathir said:
""It takes a little bit of time but they (DOJ) have promised that they will give back the money."" He was speaking on the sidelines of a summit in Singapore.
The DOJ was not immediately available for comment outside of regular U.S. business hours. 
Anwar Ibrahim, appointed successor to 93-year-old Mahathir, told parliament on Tuesday that the country needs to take ""more aggressive measures"" to reclaim the fees and losses ""due to the effects on Malaysia's image"".
Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Finance Minister Lim repeated his stance that Malaysia wants to reclaim fees paid to Goldman Sachs, and added that the country will also seek consequential losses.
""The Malaysian government will want to reclaim all the fees paid, as well as all the losses including the interest rate differential,"" Lim told reporters. He said the rate Malaysia paid was about 100 basis points higher than the market rate.
Critics have said the fees earned by Goldman Sachs were far in excess of the normal 1-2 percent a bank could expect for helping sell bonds.
Goldman has said the outsized fees related to additional risks: it bought the unrated bonds while it sought investors and, in the case of a 2013 bond deal which raised $2.7 billion, 1MDB wanted the funds quickly for planned investment.
Lim did not say how Malaysia would seek to recoup any money beyond that he will leave the matter to Malaysia's attorney general.
Citing sources, Reuters reported in June that Malaysia was considering asking the U.S. Justice Department to get Goldman Sachs to return the fees it had earned from the 1MDB deals.
Malaysia's government, elected to power only in May, is scrambling to bring back funds that were allegedly siphoned off from 1MDB - a fund founded by former premier Najib Razak.
The 1MDB scandal was a major reason for Najib's shock election loss. Najib has since been charged with corruption as part of Malaysia's investigation into 1MDB. He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing.

Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho, described by U.S. and Malaysian authorities as central to the 1MDB scandal, was charged by U.S. prosecutors this month. He remains at large.

LONDON (Reuters) - Vodafone's new chief executive (L:VOD) said he would cut costs and seek to maximize the value of its masts and towers to drive higher returns at the world's second largest mobile operator after taking charge last month.
Replacing Vittorio Colao at the top of the British company after the Italian ran the group for 10 years, former finance director Nick Read also said he would freeze the dividend until its large debt pile fell.
""My new strategic priorities focus on ... radically simplifying our operating model and generating better returns from our infrastructure assets,"" Read said on Tuesday.
The market reaction was positive, with Vodafone's battered shares trading 9 percent higher at 1055 GMT.
Read outlined his strategy as  Vodafone  reported a slowdown in second-quarter organic revenue growth to 0.5 percent from 1.1 percent in the previous three months, laying bare the struggle it faces to turn ever increasing demands for data into a stronger top line.
The group managed to wring out cost cuts, however, to grow organic adjusted core earnings by 2.9 percent to 7.08 billion euros ($7.96 billion) for the six months to the end of September, in line with market forecasts.
Vodafone narrowed its full-year profit growth target to 3 percent from 1-5 percent. That enabled it to lift its free cashflow before spectrum forecast to around 5.4 billion euros from 5.2 billion euros, calming investor fears that it would have to cut its dividend.
The stock has fallen 39 percent since the beginning of the year as investors fret about the cost of acquiring Liberty Global's cable assets in Germany and some other eastern European markets, the outlay on new spectrum for 5G services and tougher conditions in some European markets.
Analysts at Bernstein said the results were ""expectedly wretched"", but the full-year earnings guidance, the upgrade to free cashflow and the commitment to the dividend were ""all positive and good news for investors in this beleaguered name"".
VIRTUAL TOWERS
Read said he had taken decisive action to respond to challenging conditions in Italy and Spain, and would reduce Vodafone's costs for the third year running.
As part of a move to drive better returns from investments and to share capital assets where possible, it would create a ""virtual tower"" company to manage the 58,000 towers it controls across Europe, with a dedicated management team.
The group is also conducting due diligence on how best to take ownership of all its towers, including those held in joint ventures. 
Analysts have suggested the group could partner with a tower group operator to bring extra cash into the business.
Read told reporters, however, that Vodafone recognized the importance of keeping strategic control of its towers.
""The towers is the first example of us taking a different approach of how we can drive better utilization of our assets to drive better returns to shareholders,"" he said.
Read's predecessor announced his departure in May a week after Vodafone agreed to buy Liberty Global's (O:LBTYA) assets in Germany and eastern Europe for $21.8 billion, enabling it to offer more superfast fixed-line broadband and cable-TV.

Colao also agreed to merge Vodafone's operations in India with Idea Cellular, a deal that closed in August, leaving it largely focused on Europe and emerging markets in the Middle East and Africa. ($1 = 0.8899 euros)

1527,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 13, 2018 04:30AM ET</span>","JPMorgan Says Don't Play the Downturn, the S&P Will Bounce Back","(Bloomberg) -- While many investors are getting anxious about the lateness of the economic and market cycle, it’s not yet time to abandon U.S. equities, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).
“An increasing chunk of the investor base is of the view that one has to be already positioned for the next downturn,” strategists Mislav Matejka, Prabhav Bhadani and Nitya Saidanha wrote in a note Monday. “We continue to believe that S&P 500 will recoup the October correction, similar to what it achieved post- the February one.”
A panoply of negatives has hit the U.S., and global, stocks since the start of October, starting with a rebound in benchmark Treasury yields, which has enhanced the appeal of risk-free investments. Worries over a peak in corporate earnings growth, a continuing escalation of trade tariffs, a slowdown in China’s domestic demand and a cooling in the outlook for technology products -- the iPhone prime among them -- have also dented sentiment.
Against that, there’s no sign that the economy is rolling over just yet. And the JPMorgan team cited a series of other reasons not to throw in the towel on American equities:
The strategists also took heart from the recent surge in volatility, saying the VIX, or the Cboe Volatility Index, has reached levels where stocks typically did well in subsequent months.
Bottom line is the JPMorgan team calls for an “overweight” position in U.S. equities, where “positioning appears relatively light.” It has neutral positions on Europe, where politics remain challenging, and Japan, where a stronger yen could pose a headwind.

In the three-year-old case, two independent asset managers who used Credit Suisse accounts to deposit money from wealthy Turkish clients are suspected of covering up losses linked to the Turkish lira's collapse in 2013.
Prosecutors recently began probing whether Credit Suisse should have done more to halt transactions that led to losses, the Tages-Anzeiger reported. 
Credit Suisse said it did nothing wrong. 
""The bank rejects all legal responsibility and will use all its resources to fight these accusations,"" it said in a statement to Reuters.
Prosecutors in Geneva did not immediately return a phone call and an email seeking comment.
The bank, which notified Swiss authorities in March 2015 about potential problems after learning of millions of losses through one of the alleged Turkish victims, earned about 80 million Swiss francs ($79.10 million) in commissions from the transactions, according to past media reports. [https://reut.rs/2qHi4Tc]
The firm that managed money for the wealthy Turkish clients was founded by former Credit Suisse employees who said that they sought only to cover losses linked to the Turkish lira's collapse, not to enrich themselves. 
Actual damages in the case, which in 2016 were reported to be around 300 million francs, could actually be much lower, the newspaper said, citing a person familiar with the case, who said assets from the rich Turks are largely intact but currently in blocked accounts.

1530,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 13, 2018 04:00AM ET</span>",Apple Swoon Hits a Nerve: Are Estimates for Everything Too High?,"(Bloomberg) -- The case for pessimism is getting stronger.
The latest example is Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., whose shares tumbled Monday on signs demand for its best-selling device is less than analysts had hoped. The iPhone maker slid 5 percent, capping its worst seven-day stretch in two years and sending the Nasdaq 100 Index hurtling.
As far as bellwethers go, few companies mean more than Apple -- when the stock lurches, investors everywhere gasp. But it was clear Monday its stock swoon was landing with extra force, stoking Wall Street’s worsening anxiety about earnings for the entire market.
“I think we saw peak earnings and sales growth in 2018,” said James Ragan, director of wealth management research at D.A. Davidson. While still bullish on stocks, Ragan says that “volatility is back, and we are seeing fears going into October re-emerge.”
Everyone knows S&P 500 profits are gangbusters now. Third-quarter earnings rose 26 percent in the S&P 500 and the full year’s results will almost match that. But for all the cheer about the present, companies are notably dour on the future. Guidance is deteriorating.
Over the past three months, firms saying sales will miss analyst estimates outnumbered those saying they will exceed them by the most since 2009, data compiled by Evercore ISI showed. The trend also worsened for the bottom line.
Guidance Impact
When guidance weakens, it dims many of the cases for owning equities, particularly valuation, which bulls usually frame against next year’s estimates. While the S&P 500 looks cheap at 16 times forecast profits, it would prove less so should those forecasts turn out wrong.
From a strengthening dollar to rising costs of wages and raw materials, and higher interest rates to trade tensions, the list of headwinds is building for corporate America.
“As long as the dollar is headed higher and rest-of-world growth remains weak, the outlook for revenue and earnings growth is likely to remain under pressure,” Dennis Debusschere, head of portfolio strategy at Evercore, wrote in a note to clients. Last month, he lowered his 2019 estimate for S&P 500 earnings and said if historical valuations prevail, the S&P 500 may not bottom till 2,550.
Spreading Gloom
The equity benchmark fell 2 percent to 2,726 on Monday for a third straight day of declines as Apple led the retreat in tech stocks. The drop came after Lumentum Holdings Inc. cut its second-quarter outlook after one of its largest customers asked to “meaningfully reduce shipments” for previous orders. Lumentum didn’t name the customer, but Apple is its biggest, according to Bloomberg supply-chain data.
Selling spread in Asia, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 losing more than 3 percent at one point and the MSCI Asia Pacific Index down more than 2 percent.
Concern over Apple’s sales comes after high-profile warnings from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) prompted investors to look past solid results from previous quarters. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) have warned about heightened market volatility as expectations came down.
October was the U.S. equity market’s worst month in seven years and coincided with a flurry of earnings downgrades. The expected rate of growth for S&P 500 income in the current quarter has fallen to 15 percent from 18 percent at the start of October, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Expectations for next year are also weakening. For two weeks in a row, analysts trimmed their predictions. At $175.8 a share, the estimated profits have declined 0.7 percent from the peak in September, the biggest downward revision for the year.
Going by history, more downgrades may be on the way. Thanks to tax cuts, 2018 stands as an outlier, a year in which profits estimates have kept rising as it went on. That’s not what usually happens. Over the last 30 years, analysts have generally started way too optimistic and then cut annual forecasts as time went on -- by an average of 8 percent, data compiled by Goldman showed. Should 2019 track that pattern, EPS would erode to $161.70 -- not the $175.80 forecast now.
Goldman strategists led by David Kostin predicted $173 for next year. Tobias Levkovich at Citigroup called for $172.50, or 6 percent growth.
“The previously assumed growth of 12 percent next year was simply too high, and a reset was needed for companies to have a chance to meet or beat Street projections,” Levkovich wrote in a note. “A number of high-profile corporations trimmed their outlooks and the Street was forced to take notice.”
Not everyone is worried about the risk of further downgrades, and indeed, bears incorrectly predicted throughout the early part of this year that profit growth had peaked. Diane Jaffee, senior portfolio manager and group managing director of relative value strategies at The TCW Group, attributes the lack of corporate optimism to the trade tensions between the U.S. and China and sees bargains emerging after the sell-off.
“We saw double-digit earnings growth in 2017 and 2018. We should continue to see that in 2019,"" she said. “Confidence is now lacking by businesses saying we can’t predict demand that we have seen so far will continue” because of the uncertainty over import tariffs, she added. “Once we get any clarity on that, markets should stabilize.”

1534,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2018 01:49AM ET</span>",Fears of peak iPhone rattle Asian Apple suppliers,"By Jess Macy Yu and Heekyong Yang
TAIPEI/SEOUL (Reuters) - Shares in Asian suppliers and assemblers for Apple Inc (O:AAPL) fell on Tuesday after several component makers warned of weaker than expected results, leading some market watchers to call the peak for iPhones in several key markets.
Following a poor forecast earlier this month, analysts and investors voiced concern over the state of Apple's business, contributing to growing worries that iPhone sales were stagnating and could hurt suppliers.
Fresh warnings on Monday from screen maker  Japan Display Inc  (T:6740), British chipmaker IQE Plc (L:IQE) and  Lumentum Holdings Inc  (O:LITE), the main supplier of the Face ID technology in the latest generation of iPhones, hurt technology stocks in Asia on Tuesday.
Taiwan-based assembler  Hon Hai  Precision Industry Co Ltd (Foxconn) (TW:2317) dropped more than 3 percent. Rival  Pegatron  Corp (TW:4938) fell more than 5 percent but later recouped losses. Both companies count Apple as a major customer. 
The world's largest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TW:2330), fell 2.6 percent, while  Flexium  Interconnect Inc (TW:6269) was down 1.5 percent. The Taiwan Weighted Index (TWII) was down around 1.6 percent.
""Apple's iPhone weakness has been a long-term issue for the Asia supply chain,"" said Arthur Liao, an analyst at Fubon Research in Taipei. 
""For Apple, the iPhone shipment has reached its peak. For tech suppliers facing the future, they have no other big client like Apple."" 
The Cupertino, California-based tech giant's shares fell to their lowest level in more than three months on Monday. 
Last week a media report saying the iPhone maker had told its smartphone assemblers to halt plans for additional production lines dedicated to its new lower-priced iPhone XR had pressured supplier stocks.
Analysts said the lack of technological breakthroughs had put a cap on demand, which would persist in the coming quarters.
""With no new technology in sight next year for the supply chain, this is not ideal for the companies involved,"" said Nicole Tu, a Taipei-based analyst at Yuanta Investment Consulting.
""Up through the first half of 2019 we likely won't see any breakthrough."" 
Lumentum on Monday slashed its profit and revenue forecast for the current quarter, while IQE warned that current-year results would be lower. Japan Display lowered both sales and margin outlook for the year as well.
NO CONFIDENCE
Apple warned earlier this month that holiday sales would miss Wall Street expectations due to weakness in emerging markets including India and foreign-exchange costs.
Among other Apple suppliers in Asia, Hong Kong-based acoustic components maker AAC Technologies Holdings Inc (HK:2018) slumped more than 6 percent. 
South Korean electronic parts suppliers  Samsung Electro-Mechanics  Co Ltd (KS:009150), Apple's supplier of multi-layer ceramic capacitors, dropped more than 5 percent, while  LG Innotek Co Ltd  (KS:011070) plunged 9.5 percent.
Apple said earlier this month it would stop giving the number of iPhones, iPads and Mac computers it sold in a quarter, a closely watched metric and a key indicator of the company's success.
The move led analysts to question the company's business and its share price has since dropped 12.6 percent.
""(This) indicates that the company itself is not confident about its performance at the moment,"" said Park Jung-hoon, a fund manager at HDC Asset Management, which owns Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) shares.
""Although Apple has positioned itself as a super-expensive handset maker providing high-end products, its strategy has not been working in emerging markets including China and India as Chinese vendors have been making iPhone-like products,"" he said.

1536,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2018 01:16AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Juul sounds out Indonesia for expansion, other Asian countries in its sights","By Fanny Potkin and Chris Kirkham
JAKARTA/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Juul Labs Inc is exploring selling its compact vaping devices in Asia and has sounded out government officials in Indonesia, one of the world's most smoker-friendly countries, although gaining approval there could face significant hurdles.
Expansion into Asia would provide the fast-growing firm with new markets at a time when it faces increased regulatory scrutiny in the United States and Israel over the potential health risks of its products' high nicotine content.
Juul representatives held discussions with the Indonesian government last month about introducing its vaping devices, the country's finance ministry officials told Reuters.
Indonesia has one of the world's highest rates of smoking among adults and teenage boys and imposes no penalties for selling cigarettes to minors. It also has a population of 260 million, making it a highly attractive market for tobacco and vaping firms.
A person familiar with Juul's plans said executives for the San Francisco-based company are concerned authorities may be reluctant to grant approval due to likely opposition from the traditional tobacco industry, which provides much of Indonesia's tax revenue.
Tobacco taxes accounted for nearly 150 trillion rupiah ($10.2 billion) or about 11 percent of national tax revenue in 2017, government data showed. Each province also imposes taxes on cigarettes.
Juul is also worried its argument that vaping is healthier than smoking will not hold much sway in Indonesia, which is not as concerned as other countries about health issues, said the person, declining to be identified as the discussions were not public.
Juul representatives reached out to the finance ministry to discuss how it would be taxed on any sales of devices there, the Indonesian officials said.
The government needs to examine the domestic e-cigarette market to determine how a foreign player such as Juul could hurt local small and labour-intensive e-cigarette firms, said Sunaryo, a senior official in Indonesia's customs and excise office, who like many Indonesians uses only one name.
""We will need it to study it,"" he said, adding he wasn't sure Juul would comply with a regulation that requires e-cigarette devices and liquids to be sold separately.
Juul also would need approval from Indonesia's Food and Drug Agency. Officials at the agency said Juul had yet to be in touch.
Other Asian countries the three-year old firm is actively considering for expansion include India, South Korea and the Philippines, the person familiar with Juul's plans said.
In addition to Indonesia, Juul filed trademark applications for those countries between April and October 2018, as well as in Malaysia and Singapore, according to a Reuters review of government filings. It opened its first Asia office in Singapore in July.
So far Juul, currently valued at $16 billion, is available only in the United States, Canada, the UK and Israel. It has plans to enter Russia later this year.
Juul said in a statement to Reuters it is ""proactively learning more"" and engaging with local officials in Asia ""to understand and hear their views."" It does not have immediate plans to launch in any Asian country, it said. Juul spokeswoman Victoria Davis declined to elaborate.
A TAXING QUESTION
Indonesia is one of only a handful of United Nations member states that has not signed on to the World Health Organization's global treaty that sets standards for tobacco control.
Roughly two-thirds of Indonesian men smoke tobacco daily, and more than 21 percent of boys aged 13-15 smoked cigarettes regularly, according to a WHO report last year.
E-cigarettes, available in Indonesia since at least 2013, are a small but growing market. The customs office estimated there are about 300 unsupervised liquid makers known as brewers in Indonesia, producing various liquid products to more than 4,000 vape stores and 900,000 smokers.
Philip Morris International Inc (N:PM), maker of Marlboro cigarettes, which now controls about a third of Indonesia's market through its stake in Sampoerna, does not offer any of its non-combustible cigarette products in Indonesia.
That includes its IQOS device, a heat-not-burn tobacco product, according to a company spokesman, who declined to comment on why it has not introduced the product.
In October, the government imposed a 57 percent tax on electronic-cigarette liquids, on par with taxes on traditional cigarettes. But tax collection, particularly from smaller companies, is difficult in Indonesia and new rules are often ignored.
Juul now commands nearly 75 percent of U.S. e-cigarette market share, up from 13.6 percent in early 2017, according to a  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analysis of Nielsen retail data. 
Its products, like most electronic cigarettes, vaporize a liquid containing nicotine. One Juul pod contains as much nicotine as a traditional pack of 20 cigarettes, according to the company's U.S. marketing.
Juul liquid in the U.S. has a nicotine concentration of 59 milligrams per milliliter, much higher than the liquids typically sold in earlier versions of e-cigarettes and nearly three times the allowable limit in the European Union.
In August, Israel banned Juul devices with nicotine concentration of more than 20 mg/mL, citing ""a grave risk to public health."" Juul is appealing that decision and currently offers a lower nicotine-strength electronic cigarette in Israel.
In September, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration opened an investigation into Juul and other electronic cigarette companies, citing the rising number of teens who appear to be using Juul and other vaping devices. This week it is expected to issue a ban on fruit and candy-flavoured e-cigarettes sold in convenience stores and gas stations.
In its statement to Reuters, Juul said its products are intended for adult use only, and that it aims to ""improve the lives of the world's one billion adult smokers"" by providing an alternative to cigarettes.

1539,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 12, 2018 11:20PM ET</span>","Emerging-Market ‘Blue Sky Scenario’ Possible in 2019, BofA Says","(Bloomberg) -- As emerging markets wrap up a tough 2018, it’s worth noting the positives, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC).
The silver lining of a selloff in major developing-nation currencies is that current account deficits in some of the most vulnerable countries are disappearing, said David Hauner, a London-based cross-asset strategist at BofAML. He expects Argentina’s deficit to shrink to 2 percent next year from 6 percent this year and Turkey’s to narrow to 2 percent from 4 percent. Those improvements should help spur investor inflows, according to Hauner.
Other factors boosting emerging markets include investor sentiment, oil and U.S. yields. BofAML’s EM carry sentiment gauge is the most bearish since just after Donald Trump’s 2016 election victory -- which proved a good time to buy the dip. Meanwhile, Hauner said he’s constructive on oil prices after they slid into bear territory. And if the last economic cycle is any guide, it may be another six months before the yield curve inverts. In the interim, developing-nation sovereign debt should beat U.S. high-yield debt, he said.
While 2019 may be the first year since 2012 when EM and DM slow in tandem, that didn’t turn out as badly for the asset class. In that year, emerging-market equities rallied 15 percent to top the S&P 500 Index’s 13 percent rally. Developing-nation currencies climbed 5.5 percent against the dollar and sovereign debt posted its third-best annual return since the millennium.
Despite these favorable signs, BofAML cautioned that the outlook for global risk next year is generally poor amid the backdrop of U.S. interest rate hikes and trade tensions.

 Lumentum Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:LITE), one of iPhone’s face-recognition suppliers, cut its outlook for fiscal second quarter 2019 as one of its largest customers asked the company to “materially reduce shipments” for its products.
“We recently received a request from one of our largest Industrial and Consumer customers for laser diodes for 3D sensing to materially reduce shipments to them during our fiscal second quarter for previously placed orders that were originally scheduled for delivery during the quarter,” said Lumentum President and CEO Alan Lowe in a statement.
The report built speculation around the success of Apple's latest iPhones. Although Lumentum did not mention Apple by name in the statement, the company listed the technology giant as its largest customer in the annual filing for the fiscal year 2018.
Overnight, the Dow fell by more than 600 points, while the NASDAQ Composite slumped 2.8%.
In Asia, China’s Shanghai Composite inched up 0.1%, while the Shenzhen Component was down 0.7%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.2%.
Citing sources, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had resumed talks with China Vice Premier Liu He.
He and Mnuchin spoke by telephone last week, the WSJ said, adding that the discussion did not lead to any breakthrough regarding the trade dispute between the U.S. and China.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 declined 2.3%, while South Korea’s KOSPI traded 0.9% lower as index heavyweight Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) and  SK Hynix Inc  (KS:000660) dropped 2.9% and 5.5% respectively.

1541,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 12, 2018 09:20PM ET</span>",Apple Suppliers Tumble on New Signs of Weak iPhone Demand,"(Bloomberg) -- Major suppliers to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).’s iPhone fell Tuesday as investors fretted that one of the most important product lines in the technology sector was seeing weak demand.
In Asia, Japan Display Inc. slashed its forecasts for sales growth and operating margins, citing volatile customer demand. JDI, which makes LCD screens used in the iPhone XR, plunged as much as 11 percent to its lowest since debuting in 2014. Lumentum Holdings Inc. plummeted a record 33 percent after cutting its second-quarter outlook when one of its largest customers asked to “meaningfully reduce shipments” for previously placed orders.
Lumentum, a maker of parts used for facial recognition, didn’t name the customer but Apple is its biggest, according to Bloomberg supply-chain data. Apple fell 5 percent. Oclaro Inc., which is being bought by Lumentum, lost 12 percent, its biggest drop since April.
“Investors should consider Lumentum’s updated guide as reflecting as much as a 30% cut in Apple orders,”  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Aaron Rakers said in a note to clients.
“Concerns of JDI’s survival are likely to persist,” Jefferies analyst Atul Goyal wrote in a note to clients. “With uncertainty/volatility in the demand for its major customer’s new models” and more phone makers switching to new technologies, the sustainability risk to its fundamentals still remains, he added.
Lumentum executives told investors at a UBS Group AG conference in San Francisco that the customer asked to cut 3-D component shipments just days ago after having requested expedited orders in recent weeks.
The development “is not entirely surprising” but “it seems very likely to us that the market for 3D sensing-related light sources and other components is going to be smaller next year than previously anticipated,” James Kisner, an analyst with Loop Capital Markets, said in a research note.
Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment late Monday.
Among other Apple suppliers, South Korea’s LG Innotek Co., which gets about half its revenue from Apple, slid as much as 9.5 percent. Japan’s Minebea Mitsumi Inc. slid 7.2 percent and Alps Electric Co. dipped 8.9 percent. Taiwan’s Catcher Technology Co. fell 5.1 percent and Visual Photonics Epitaxy Co. slumped 8.9 percent. In China, Lens Technology Co. dropped 2.5 percent.
U.S. chipmakers Cirrus Logic Inc. sank 14 percent, and Qorvo Inc. and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc. each slid 6.4 percent. ON Semiconductor Corp. fell 5.9 percent, Skyworks Solutions Inc. slid 5 percent, and Finisar Corp. dropped 4 percent. Semiconductor stocks were broadly lower with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index losing 4.4 percent.
Lumentum’s outlook comes a week after Nikkei reported that Apple was canceling a production boost for its iPhone XR line, and less than two weeks after Apple’s fourth-quarter results showed tepid unit sales growth. The company also said it would stop providing unit sales for iPhones, iPads, and Macs in fiscal 2019, a step Nomura Instinet said raised “the specter of a sustained iPhone downturn.”
Adding to Monday’s negative news, Longbow Research cautioned that Apple is facing weak iPhone demand in China. And Citi downgraded Skyworks to neutral and slashed its price target to $85 from $116, citing both “disappointing iPhone XR unit sales” and “broad smartphone weakness.” Last week, Skyworks gave a first-quarter outlook that missed expectations because of smartphone weakness, prompting at least two other downgrades.
Citi also cut its target on Qorvo on Monday due to iPhone XR weakness.

1543,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2018 07:20PM ET</span>",White House to consider Commerce Department auto tariff recommendations: officials,"By David Lawder and David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department has submitted draft recommendations to the White House on its investigation into whether to impose tariffs of up to 25 percent on imported cars and parts on national security grounds, two administration officials said.
The ""Section 232"" recommendations on ensuring a healthy U.S. auto industry are undergoing an interagency review process and will be discussed on Tuesday at a regularly scheduled weekly meeting of the Trump administration's top trade officials, the officials said.
The White House has pledged not to move forward with imposing tariffs on the European Union or Japan as long as it is making constructive progress in trade talks.
The EU's trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmstrom, is due to meet with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in Washington on Wednesday for more preliminary talks to launch trade negotiations. 
One of the officials, who was briefed on the matter, said the administration was sending a message that it is growing frustrated with the lack of progress on auto issues but did not expect immediate action on the recommendations on Tuesday.
The substance of the recommendations, such as which vehicles or parts could be subject to tariffs, and possible tariff rates, were not immediately known. 
But having the Commerce report ready for action would underscore a consistent threat from President Donald Trump - that he would impose tariffs on autos and auto parts unless the EU and Japan make trade concessions including lowering the EU's 10 percent tariff on imported vehicles and cutting non-tariff barriers. 
Trump has repeatedly suggested he would move quickly to impose tariffs, even before the Commerce Department launched its investigation in May into whether imported autos and parts pose a national security risk. The study followed closely on the heels of the imposition of similar national security tariffs on steel and aluminum.
""We said if we don’t negotiate something fair, then we have tremendous retribution, which we don’t want to use, but we have tremendous powers,"" Trump said on Wednesday. ""We have to - including cars. Cars is the big one. And you know what we’re talking about with respect to cars and tariffs on cars.""
Last month, the administration said it would open formal trade talks with the EU and Japan in early 2019 after the 90-day required congressional notification period ends.
The prospect of tariffs of 25 percent on imported autos and parts has sent shockwaves through the auto industry, with both U.S. and foreign-brand producers lobbying against it. 
A group representing major automakers told Commerce in July that imposing tariffs of 25 percent on imported cars and parts would raise the cumulative prices for U.S. vehicles by $83 billion annually and cost hundreds of thousands of jobs.
Automakers argue there is no evidence that auto imports pose a national security risk, and the tariffs could actually harm U.S. economic security.
The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, whose members include General Motors Co (N:GM), Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), warned the price of an imported car would increase nearly $6,000, while the price of a U.S.-built car would increase by $2,000.

A study released by a U.S. auto dealer group warned the tariffs could cut U.S. auto sales by 2 million vehicles annually and cost more than 117,000 auto dealer jobs, or about 10 percent of the workforce.

Joachim Wuermeling, a member of the Bundesbank board, told the Handelsblatt newspaper that German dependence on exports meant that financial institutions with large foreign trade exposure were also more vulnerable to trade-related downturns.
""If you look at the core capital ratios that resulted after the simulated downturn, German banks were in the middle range,"" Wuermeling told the newspaper, adding that the stress test scenarios differed from country to country and the latest one had forecast a more significant recession for Germany.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) on Nov. 2 scored among the 10 worst banks in the latest round of European stress tests with a core capital ratio of 8.1 percent for 2020. German public sector bank NordLB was also on the list of the 10 worst banks.
In general, Wuermeling said, German banks had become more resilient in the wake of reforms implemented after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. ""That means we can be more relaxed about the prospect of a potential economic downturn,"" he said.
At the same time, Wuermeling said banks should not take currently favorable economic parameters for granted, lest they be caught by surprise if economic growth prospects dimmed.
He said many banks were taking steps to increase profitability through cost-cutting measures, digitalization and higher fees. If monetary policy also normalized, that could lead to rapid improvements in their results, he said.
Wuermeling said banking authorities were keeping a close eye on NordLB's efforts to find an investor and welcomed discussion about a possible merger with other institutions in the public banking sector.
""From the viewpoint of the banking supervisory body, it is always positive when institutions look at how they can become more resilient and profitable,"" he said.

1545,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2018 06:12PM ET</span>",Trade war and censors blow chill wind through China's giant tech scene,"By Cate Cadell
BEIJING (Reuters) - Wang Miaoyi's small one-bedroom apartment, which doubles as her design studio, is overflowing with game magazines, figurines and boxes of sci-fi novels.
The 30-year old game developer is a child of the county's tech boom: she studied at one of China's top universities and her company hit it big with an award-winning game that was published on Nintendo's Switch console and the PC gaming platform Steam, with plans for roll-out on other game platforms. 
Now her ambitions - and those of many others across China's giant tech industry - are facing a reckoning, amid rising state control over the sector, tightening regulation and a biting trade war with the United States stymieing growth.
""(In 2015) doing a start-up was popular. So many young people set up small businesses, like developing games, and dreamed of making big money as well as being free,"" she said. ""But they found out now it's really unrealistic.""
Wang says she has had to abandon for now hopes of releasing the game on new platforms in China, closing the original studio that developed it and working instead on updates with a skeleton crew of freelancers. She has moved from the Beijing tech hub of Zhongguancun to the city's cheaper far-west outskirts to cut costs.
She is not alone. Reuters interviewed a dozen tech industry insiders, from gig economy workers to investors, who said that the boom days of easy returns looked to be over.
Until last year, China's tech industry had enjoyed years of breakneck growth. Firms including  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd and Tencent Holdings Ltd almost doubled in value in 2017 alone, making big-ticket investments as part of a multi-billion dollar expansion into cloud, offline retail and finance.
But now the market is feeling the pinch. Hiring numbers are down, company margins are thinner and tumbling technology stocks have wiped nearly half a trillion dollars this year from the value of China's top listed tech firms.
The biggest names in tech have flagged concerns, including Alibaba and Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU), who revised down their full-year sales forecasts in recent weeks on the weaker outlook.
""Investments into the tech space have definitely cooled down, measured by almost every metric: number of deals, deal size or fund raising,"" said Zhang Chenhao, Shanghai-based Managing Partner at technology-focused Prometheus Fund.
""I think this year is the first time over the last 30 years when greed yields to the fear.""
HAND OF THE STATE
The technology sector is facing challenges on all sides.
A broader economic slowdown saw China's third quarter GDP slow to its weakest pace since the global financial crisis. The currency has slid against the dollar and domestic markets are down sharply. 
Alongside a series of tit-for-tat trade tariffs, the United States has accused China of stealing technology, barring tech acquisitions by Chinese firms and blacklisting others.
At home, tech companies from social media to gaming and fintech have seen tightening regulation and a heavier hand from the ruling Communist Party.
Gaming and social media giant Tencent has seen its stock price dive by more than 25 percent this year amid a temporary ban on licenses for games, its top revenue driver.
At the country's top internet forum in Wuzhen this week, officials signaled they would look to rein in the country's tech giants. 
""They can be big but we should also be well-regulated,"" said Gao Xiang, vice minister of China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology on Thursday.
China's regulators have already cracked down on everything from rude joke apps to livestream bloggers disrespecting national anthem - sending a chill through the free-wheeling and innovative online arena. 
""The people who worry about technology is first older people, second government and third successful people, they hate it and worry about it,"" Alibaba's billionaire executive chairman Jack Ma said at an event in Shanghai last week.
""Normally businesses do innovation and governments talk innovation. In order to protect yesterday's interests... they will say please don't do it.""
This year Alibaba has lowered its revenue forecast for the first time since listing in 2014.
Meanwhile, local ride-sharing giant Didi Chuxing, backed by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp, has cut the subsidies it pays to drivers after being forced to shutter its car-pooling services under a plan agreed with regulators following criticism over the murders of two young female passengers in separate incidents.
""(In 2015) I bought my first vehicle because you could earn almost 800 yuan a day with the subsidies,"" says Huang Sun, who used to drive full-time for the company but now says he only takes rides when he is bored. ""Now maybe you can't even earn 200 yuan if you drive all day.""
HIRING FREEZE
The chill across the tech industry is reflected in hiring data.
According to statistics released by leading local job website Zhaopin.com, job demand in the IT and internet sector has dropped by 51 percent as of September compared with a year earlier.
Companies have slowed hiring in certain fields, including sales and software development, recruiters and human resources staff at Alibaba and Tencent said, asking not to be named because they were not authorized to speak to press.
Tencent did not respond to a request for comment. Alibaba had no immediate comment.
""In general, they are all reducing headcount, or they're not preparing a very big budget for headhunting,"" said Mocca Wang, who is the director of the IT industry unit at international recruitment firm Spring Professional, which works with companies like Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu. 
Smaller start-ups, a key driver of growth in the sector, are also being squeezed by tighter access to credit.
""These companies can't get capital and can't invest,"" said Wang. ""They're going bankrupt.""
China's tech firms are, to be sure, still posting sales growth rates above overseas peers.
Tencent chief Pony Ma told state television in a recent interview that there was still ""tremendous potential"" in the market, though admitted ""there are challenges of various kinds right now"".
But the numbers suggest tougher times lie ahead - a worry for China's steeply-valued private tech start-ups and newly-listed firms such as smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp and Tencent-backed food deliver giant Meituan Dianping.
""Before the feeling was that anyone can get funding, that if you throw out words like blockchain, AI, big data and machine learning that would get you funding,"" said Benjamin Speyer, managing director at Hangzhou-based consultancy Serica.
""Now everyone is a bit more nervous about potentially making a mistake with their money.""
Alibaba, whose China commerce sales growth dropped to its lowest rate since 2015 in the last quarter, said it would take less income from its platforms for the near future, effectively subsidizing merchants, in an effort to retain brands on its platform. 
Competitor JD.com Inc, which posted a loss last quarter, is seeking to revive profits by outsourcing some of its 2.5 million square meters of warehouse space.
The country's upstart technology workforce are even more keenly aware of the slowdown.
Even as property and living costs continue to rise sharply in major cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, tech workers say salaries can't keep up. 
Beijing-based Liu Wangwei works as a software engineer at one of the country's highest-valued start-ups and rents a two-bedroom apartment because his partially-disabled mother often stays with him.
He said his rent has risen by almost 50 percent since they moved to the area in 2014 and says he is considering moving to another of the company's offices in a smaller city where the government subsidizes housing for technology workers.

""I always thought I could join the well-known tech companies and never worry about money,"" said Liu. ""When I was in university our teachers gave us encouragement to be like (Steve) Jobs and Jack Ma. It's not the same as we were promised.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's major indexes tumbled on Monday as shares of Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) dragged down the technology and financial sectors.
With Monday's losses, all three indexes erased the gains from their brief rally after the U.S. congressional elections on Nov. 6.
Apple shares fell 5.0 percent after several suppliers to the company, including  Lumentum Holdings Inc  (O:LITE), whose components power the iPhone's Face ID technology, cut their forecasts. Apple's decline impeded the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which fell more than 2 percent.
Lumentum shares plunged 33.0 percent. Shares of several chipmakers that sell to Apple, such as Cirrus Logic Inc (O:CRUS),  Qorvo Inc  (O:QRVO) and  Skyworks Solutions Inc  (O:SWKS), dropped as well. The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index (SOX) dropped 4.4 percent.
""The concerns are all about global economic growth, specifically demands for the products of companies like Apple,"" said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis. ""Investors are becoming more concerned about faster-growing companies and whether they will continue to grow at that pace.""
Goldman Sachs shares dropped 7.5 percent after Bloomberg reported that Malaysian Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng said the country was seeking a full refund of all the fees it paid to the Wall Street bank for arranging billions of dollars of deals for troubled state fund 1MDB. Goldman Sachs was the biggest drag on the Dow, which fell more than 2 percent.
Among the S&P 500's 11 major sectors, technology and financial stocks weighed most heavily. The S&P 500 technology sector index (SPLRCT) fell 3.5 percent, and the financial sector index (SPSY) fell 2.0 percent.
Energy stocks (SPNY) also accelerated their decline toward the end of the session as oil prices fell.
""At the moment it seems the path of least resistance is down,"" said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 602.12 points, or 2.32 percent, to 25,387.18, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 54.79 points, or 1.97 percent, to 2,726.22 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 206.03 points, or 2.78 percent, to 7,200.87.
A holiday in the U.S. bond markets for Veterans Day kept trading volume muted. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.30 billion shares, compared with the 8.41 billion average over the last 20 trading days. 
 General Electric  Co (N:GE) shares fell 6.9 percent after Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp said the company was saddled with too much debt and would urgently sell assets to reduce leverage. The shares dropped below $8 for the first time since March 2009.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.80-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.64-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

1. Home Depot Leads Earnings
The early-morning action will be dominated by Dow component  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD).
On average, analysts expect that the home improvement company earned $2.27 per share, on revenue of $26.25 billion.
Home Depot will be yet another data point for how the housing market is performing.
Last week, DR Horton (NYSE:DHI) tumbled 9% after posting fiscal-fourth revenue that fell short of estimates and issued a warning of slowing orders growth.
Shares of Home Depot fell 3.5% today.
2. Fed Heads on Display
There are no major data releases on the economic calendar, but for those still a concerned about interest rate moves, there’s a bevy of Fed speakers.
At 10 AM ET (15:00 GMT), Federal Reserve board member Lael Brainard will be speaking. At the same time, Minnesota Fed President Neel Kashkari will also be talking.
At 5:00 PM ET, Fed governor Mary Daly will speak.
And at 2:20 PM ET, Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Patrick Harker will speak at the Fintech and the New Financial Landscape conference.
3. Oil Downtrend Continuing?
Oil prices will be in focus as they continue to decline.
Crude had all the right reasons to rise today, but still ended down for the 11th day in a row.
Prices of WTI and Brent crude both jumped as much as 2% at the start of Monday's trade in Asia after Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said at the weekend that the kingdom planned to reduce by half-million barrels its daily supply to world markets.
But as trading progressed to the European and New York sessions, the gains began fizzling on the notion that the cuts were inadequate to compensate for ramping oil production, standing at a weekly record of 11.6 million barrels per day.
Energy investors will be looking to see if the bearish move continues."

The all-cash deal values Athenahealth at $135 per share, representing a premium of 12.2 percent to the stock's closing price on Friday.
Reuters reported on Sunday that Athenahealth had agreed to a takeover.
Athenahealth had been under pressure from Elliott to sell itself since the hedge fund acquired a stake in the company last year. In May Elliott made an unsolicited offer of $160 per share to buy Athenahealth.
The Watertown, Massachusetts-based company, whose cloud-based software is used to track revenue from patients, physicians and hospitals, has cut jobs and overhauled its management over the past year as part of a restructuring effort.
Former  General Electric  (N:GE) Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt currently serves as its chairman.
Once the deal is complete, Athenahealth will merge with Virence Health, the former GE Healthcare unit that Veritas acquired earlier this year, the companies said in a joint statement.
A deal for Athenahealth represents the largest deal to date for Elliott's private equity arm, Evergreen.

In June Athenahealth's founder and CEO Jonathan Bush, a nephew of former U.S. President George H.W. Bush, stepped down following a newspaper report alleging he had assaulted his former wife 14 years earlier.

In July Bulgaria, who joined the EU in 2007, applied to join the banking union, a step toward the Black Sea state's aim to enter the ""waiting room"" for euro zone membership.
The ECB, however, has resisted granting Bulgaria a fast track to euro membership, saying its banks require tougher supervision.
""The comprehensive assessment is required as part of the process of establishing close cooperation between the ECB and the national competent authority of an EU Member State whose currency is not the euro,"" the ECB said in a statement.
The assessment of the three largest banks in terms of assets, UniCredit Bulbank (MI:CRDI), DSK Bank, controlled by Hungary's OTP  and United Bulgarian Bank, as well as the largest three locally-owned First Investment Bank (BB:5F4), Central Cooperative Bank (BB:4CF) and Investbank will start in November 2018 and results are expected in July 2019.
The cut-off date for the exercise, comprising an asset quality review and a stress test, will be Dec. 31 2018, the ECB said. 
The ECB said the assessment will be based on the methodologies applied by its banking supervision in its regular comprehensive assessments of banks. 
Bulgaria had hoped to join the ERM-2 much earlier but under pressure from its European Union peers accepted a series of wide-ranging commitments that may prolong its waiting period.

These include strengthening its banking sector and its anti-money laundering systems.

1559,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2018 02:23PM ET</span>","Cosmetics giant Coty replaces CEO, chairman","By Nivedita Balu and Jaslein Mahil
(Reuters) -  Coty Inc  (N:COTY) replaced its chief executive officer and chairman on Monday, days after the cosmetics giant rattled investors by warning that fiscal-year performance could be hurt by supply chain issues.
The company said retail industry veteran Pierre Laubies would replace Camillo Pane as its chief executive officer, its fourth CEO in as many years.
Coty Chairman Bart Becht is also ceding the role to fellow director Peter Harf, but will stay on the board.
The new executives are associated with JAB Holding Co, a consumer goods to coffee conglomerate that is the private investment vehicle of Germany's billionaire Reimann family. 
Both Harf and Becht run JAB, which has a 39 percent stake in Coty and is also a majority shareholder of Dutch beverage company Jacobs Douwe Egberts, where Laubies was the CEO until December 2017.
The management shakeup comes as Coty struggles to integrate the 41 beauty brands it acquired from Procter & Gamble (N:PG) in 2016. 
Last week, the company said supply chain problems from a trucker strike in Brazil, hurricanes in the United States and a warehousing issue in Germany were making it difficult to integrate the brands quickly. It also issued a profit warning that wiped out more than a fifth of its market value. 
""(The changes are) not that surprising given the poor performance of the company and the additional supply chain issues that have come about,"" said D.A. Davidson analyst Linda Bolton Weiser.
Becht had handpicked Pane as Coty's CEO in 2016, but shares have fallen 64 percent since his appointment. Both executives previously worked at  Reckitt Benckiser  (L:RB), where Becht once served as CEO.
Jefferies analyst Stephanie Wissink said the degree of senior level leadership changes at Coty over the last two years has been overwhelming. 
Coty's new CEO Laubies is likely to face challenges that were similar to those at JDE, which he led for more than four years and was responsible for overhauling a mass coffee brand in a highly competitive market, said Jonathan Feeney, managing partner at research firm Consumer Edge.
""Certainly some of the challenges of the COTY Consumer Beauty business rhyme with those of JDE,"" Feeney said.

Laubies has also worked at confectionary company Mars Inc and soup maker  Campbell Soup  (N:CPB). Coty shares were up nearly 4 percent on Monday afternoon.

1560,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2018 02:23PM ET</span>",Apple shares drop on iPhone suppliers' warnings,"By Vibhuti Sharma
(Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) shares fell to their lowest in more than three months on Monday as three suppliers issued warnings on results that pointed to weakness in iPhone sales.
The Cupertino, California company's signature product has become pricier with every new launch and analysts say that consumers, especially in emerging markets such as India, are ditching them for cheaper alternatives like those offered by China's OnePlus.
Apple warned earlier this month that holiday sales would miss Wall Street expectations, blaming the fall on weakness in emerging markets and foreign exchange costs.
 Lumentum Holdings Inc  (O:LITE), the main supplier of the Face ID technology in the latest generation of iPhones, cut $70 million off its forecasts for revenue on Monday, knocking another 5 percent, or around $50 billion, off Apple's value in morning trade on Wall Street.
""Many suppliers have lowered numbers because of their unnamed 'largest customer,' which is Apple. Apple got cautious in their guidance and it's hitting their suppliers,"" Elazar Capital analyst Chaim Siegel said. 
Lumentum blamed the cut in numbers it gave originally just 12 days ago on a client that was ""one of our largest... for laser diodes for 3D sensing"", which analysts said could only be Apple. 
Screen maker  Japan Display Inc  (T:6740) cited lower smartphone demand in cutting its own outlook, while British chipmaker IQE Plc (L:IQE) also said it expects a material reduction in its financial performance in the current year. 
Shares in Lumentum fell nearly 31 percent, dragging down shares of other suppliers and chipmakers.
JP Morgan analysts weighed in by cutting their price target for Apple by $4 to $270 pointing to poor orders for the new iPhone XR. 
Three analysts said that Lumentum's forecast pointed to a reduction of 18 million to 20 million iPhones on earlier estimates, based on average selling prices for 3D sensing parts.
""Apple could have accumulated too much Lumentum inventory, and needs to work it off, in which case the unit shortfall is less, although it is still indicative of weak iPhone sales."" D.A. Davidson analyst Mark Kelleher said.
In the fourth quarter, Apple sold 46.9 million iPhones, missing analyst expectations of 47.5 million iPhones, according to FactSet.
Japan's Nikkei reported earlier this month that Apple had told its smartphone assemblers Foxconn and  Pegatron  (TW:4938) to halt plans for additional production lines dedicated to the iPhone XR, the cheapest of this year's new launches.
Longbow Research analysts said spot checks with Apple's Taiwanese suppliers late last week highlighted 20 percent to 30 percent iPhone order cuts related mainly to iPhone XR and XS Max, and 20 percent to 25 percent order increases for older iPhone models.

Apple started selling iPhone XS and XS Max in September and XR model last month. Lumentum's chips are not used in phones older than last year's iPhone X.

1561,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2018 02:00PM ET</span>","Rabobank explores sale of U.S. retail, wealth operations: sources","By David French, Michelle Price and Arno Schuetze
(Reuters) - Dutch cooperative lender Rabobank is exploring the sale of its retail and wealth management operations in the United States in a deal that could top $1 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Monday. 
The move shows how Rabobank is pressing on with efforts to restructure itself. It announced two years ago it would shed 9,000 jobs, a fifth of its workforce, and said it would reduce its balance sheet by 150 billion euros ($170 billion) by 2020 as part of a five-year strategic plan. 
The sources said that the business up for sale is part of Rabobank N.A., the California-based unit of the bank, which provides retail and wealth management services, as well as commercial financing, through a network of more than 100 branches.
Rabobank N.A. held total assets worth $13.5 billion as of June 30, according to the Federal Reserve. No breakdown exists for the assets of the retail and wealth operations that are up for sale. 
The sources asked not to be identified because the sale process is confidential. Rabobank declined to comment. 
Rabobank also considered a sale of the U.S. retail and wealth operations in 2014 but it was never pursued. It was later revealed the U.S. Department of Justice had been conducting an investigation at that time into the bank handling illicit payments.
The probe ended this year, with Rabobank agreeing to pay over $368 million for processing funds likely tied to drug trafficking and other illicit activity, and pleaded guilty in federal court to conspiring to obstruct regulatory oversight.
Rabobank N.A.'s franchise is likely to be attractive to large regional banks from the Western United States, according to the sources. Rural banks are seen as valuable targets for urban-centric lenders, as they provide significant deposits which can be used to fuel loan growth in cities.

Rabobank reported a 12 percent rise in first-half net profit to 1.7 billion euros ($1.94 billion) in August, helped by cost-cutting and strong economic growth in the Netherlands.

The deal will be the largest-ever overseas acquisition by a Japanese company and will lead to big payments to advisers working on both sides of the transaction. 
The Japanese company expects spend about $733.4 million in fees and expenses in total, while London-listed Shire's costs will range between $216.5 million and $229.5 million, the companies disclosed in the documents.
Takeda’s team of advisers includes investment banks Evercore (N:EVR), JP Morgan (N:JPM) and Nomura while Shire’s line-up includes  Citigroup  (N:C), Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS).
Takeda's single biggest expense will be its financing arrangements for the takeover which will cost it $386.6 million. That financing package includes a bridge loan of almost $31 billion from lenders including Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp and MUFG. 
Takeda is also spending $111.7 million on financial and corporate broking advice and $44.2 million on lawyers, the documents show. Its other costs include $24.3 million for accounting advice and $6.3 million to public relations consultants.
Meanwhile, Shire estimates that it will pay banks as much as $150 million for their advice during the takeover, and up to $70 million to its lawyers. 

Takeda still needs approval from European regulators and its investors for the deal to go ahead and said on Monday that it had scheduled a shareholder meeting for Dec. 5 for investors to vote on the takeover.

Investors added $367 million to U.S. listed exchange-traded funds that track Brazilian stocks and bonds last week, the biggest inflow since May 2017, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The only emerging-market country to see outflows over that period was Mexico, with $214 million being pulled from ETFs dedicated to the country’s assets.
Emerging Market ETF Inflows Reach $2.29 Bln, Most in 10 Months
Mexican assets have underperformed peers since incoming President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador scrapped a partially built $13 billion airport project, while his party later announced proposals to cut bank fees. Lopez Obrador may not be the only factor depressing Mexican assets though. Brazil’s incoming President Jair Bolsonaro is growing on investors amid plans to sell state-owned companies, reform the pension system and narrow the fiscal deficit, potentially attracting funds out of other emerging markets.
“Our overweight in Mexico was naturally reduced to make room in the portfolio for countries like Brazil,” said Raphael Marechal an emerging-market debt portfolio manager at Nikko Asset Management in London.
The Mexican peso and its benchmark stock index are the worst performers among emerging markets over the past month. Assets extended the decline Monday as Lopez Obrador’s party reported it intends to push ahead with proposals to reduce bank commissions, despite a statement by the incoming president that there would be no banking law changes in the near future.
Brazil’s incoming President, on the other hand, has triggered a huge rally in financial markets, with enthusiasm spreading to bank executives who see a bonanza ahead if the president-elect does what’s needed to fix the economy.
“AMLO and his technical team need to be more proactive and send the right and consistent message to reduce policy uncertainty,” said Bertrand Delgado, a strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) in New York. “Otherwise, his first year in government could unnecessarily be a difficult one.”"

1573,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2018 12:30PM ET</span>",VW could build up to 50 million electric cars: Automotive News,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) could build up to 50 million electric cars on its new electric vehicle platform and is looking at expanding its manufacturing footprint in the United States, Chief Executive Herbert Diess told Automotive News.
""We set up the plant in Chattanooga always with the idea to be able to grow it, to mirror it,"" Diess was quoted as saying.
""The plant is still too small, and we are considering different options - it might be electric cars, it might be a different derivative of the Atlas (SUV) - it's still open.""
Volkswagen (VW) and Ford are looking at expanding cooperation, mainly in commercial vehicles, Diess added.
""What we're talking about is sharing a few platforms and manufacturing sites there, which makes sense. And within the dialogue, we are also touching other options, but this will be the main focus if we come to a conclusion.""
Ford could help VW develop a global successor to the Amarok pickup, or a unibody pickup, Diess said.
VW is open to licensing its MEB electric car platform to third party manufacturers, he reiterated, explaining that was a way to ramp up economies of scale.
""Today, we have hundreds of different drivetrains in our industry, and there's a lot of differentiation in the drivetrain. I think this will become less, because the battery cells will become very similar on the basis of the same chemistry inside,"" Diess said.
He said VW could build 50 million electric vehicles globally across its brands, beginning in 2020, and had battery sourcing agreements for them. He said licensing MEB to other automakers would lead to further efficiency gains.
""It will be more about the economies of scale. Still, the battery pack, for the foreseeable future, will be more expensive than a combustion powertrain, so I think it makes a lot of sense to make more volume,"" Diess said.
A VW spokesman said the number mentioned by Diess was a theoretical long-term goal for the MEB electric car platform. The Volkswagen Group's current vehicle platform, MQB, has spawned around 50 million mainly combustion engine vehicles over several brands and many years, he said. 
Volkswagen Group sold 10.7 million vehicles in 2017.

The German company is investing heavily in electric vehicles as it tries to rebuild its reputation following a scandal over rigged emissions tests of diesel engines in the United States that has cost it billions in fines and refits.

1574,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2018 12:22PM ET</span>","Tech, tobacco push European stocks into red, ending fragile rebound","By Helen Reid and Josephine Mason
LONDON (Reuters) - European shares were lower on Monday led by a sell-off in technology stocks after earnings and M&A news from German heavyweights Infineon and SAP, and tobacco was hit by new signs of U.S. regulators tightening the screws on menthol cigarettes. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) benchmark index fell 1 percent, reversing earlier gains. 
The swift slide into the red, ending a tentative recovery from Friday's losses, highlights the fragility of market sentiment amid lingering worries about Italy's budget crisis, a Brexit deal and expectations for a U.S. interest rate hike.
News that Banca Carige (MI:CRGI) has around 400 million euros to plug a hole in its capital base also underscored concerns about the health of the banking sector in the 3rd largest euro zone economy. 
Trading in the lender's shares were suspended pending an announcement. Just before the market close, Carige approved measures totaling 400 million euros, including the issue of a subordinated bond which is convertible into shares.
The main Italian stocks index (FTMIB) fell 1 percent, ahead of Tuesday's EU deadline for Rome to present a revised version of the budget.
Technology stocks (SX8P), among the worst hit by sell-offs in past weeks, were the biggest sectoral fallers, down 3.7 percent. 
Chipmaker Infineon (DE:IFXGn) and SAP (DE:SAPG) sank to the bottom of the DAX, down 7.8 percent and 5.6 percent respectively.
The sell-off in Infineon came even after delivering better-than-expected full-year results amid renewed worries about slowing demand following disappointing sales forecasts from Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). 
European companies are delivering their most disappointing earnings in nearly three years as a sluggish economy and rising costs take their toll on bottom lines, data shows, dealing another blow to investor confidence.
M&A was the driver behind SAP after the software company announced its acquisition of consumer sentiment tracker Qualtrics International for $8 billion, a price considered expensive by traders and analysts.
Financial software provider  Simcorp  (CO:SIM) was one of the top STOXX fallers, down 14.4 percent after its results after the close on Friday showed a decline in profits.
Flughafen Zuerich (S:FHZN) shares fell 15 percent after the company said aviation revenues could be affected if proposals from the Federal Office of Civil Aviation to cut transfer payments were enacted.
Tobacco shares were rocked by a Wall Street Journal report that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration plans to pursue a ban on menthol cigarettes.
 British American Tobacco  (L:BATS), which traders said has the greatest exposure to menthol cigarettes, fell as much as 11 percent to its lowest since February 2014 in early deals, while Imperial Brands (L:IMB) shares fell 2.2 percent. 
Menthol, which accounts for 36 percent of the U.S. market, accounts for about a quarter of BAT's total EBIT and 11 percent of Imperial's tobacco EBIT, according to Barclays' analysts.
Among the risers, oil stocks (SXEP) edged up 0.1 percent after a jump in crude prices following top exporter Saudi Arabia's announcement of a supply cut in December with other producers also considering reductions into 2019.

 Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) rose 2.8 percent as investors welcomed reports that the company's network business will be merged with smaller rival Open Fiber.

1583,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2018 11:50AM ET</span>",Bank of France partners with JPMorgan to boost gold bullion services: sources,"By Peter Hobson
LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of France has partnered with U.S. banking group JPMorgan (N:JPM) to expand its range of gold bullion services for central banks, sources familiar with the matter said on Monday. 
The French central bank's second deputy governor Sylvie Goulard wrote in the Alchemist, the magazine of the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA), that it had partnered with ""a large commercial bank"" to offer swaps, leases and gold deposits from Paris. 
Sources said the bank was JPMorgan, one of the world's largest bullion trading banks and a member of a group that settles trades in London's $25 billion a day gold market.
The Bank of England acts as a gold custodian and service provider for many other central banks and has the advantage of operating within the London market, by far the world's largest commercial bullion trading pool. 
Until now central banks holding gold at the Bank of France had to go through London if they wanted to perform market transactions. 
JPMorgan said it had ""opened an account with Bank of France"" and declined to comment further. The Bank of France declined to comment.
One source said the Bank of France was positioning itself to take advantage of uncertainty over Britain's withdrawal from the EU, thinking that some central banks may seek alternatives to London. 
""They are convinced that Brexit is going to change things and they want to be there,"" the source said. ""They are pitching to European potential customers."" 
Such a move would fit into a wider push by Paris to become a European financial markets hub after Brexit. The head of the Bank of France said in May it aimed to be ""the markets' central bank in Europe"".

The Bank of France began to expand gold services in 2012, Goulard said in the Alchemist article. It is also renovating its vaults to allow operations by heavy forklift trucks, and upgrading the quality of its gold reserves so they can trade on the international market, she said.

1584,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2018 11:41AM ET</span>",Germany's Scholz sees Italy taking steps to resolve budget row,"By Paul Carrel and Thomas Escritt
BERLIN (Reuters) - German Finance Minster Olaf Scholz said on Monday he expected Italy to take steps to resolve a row with EU authorities over its 2019 budget and he was a ""quite optimistic"" about a solution to the dispute.
The European Commission rejected the draft fiscal plan last month and has threatened to impose penalties if it is not revised to conform with EU regulations - something Rome has indicated it is unwilling to do.
The Commission has given Rome until Tuesday to present a new budget and could start disciplinary steps against Rome later this month.
Scholz said nobody would demand the Italian government pursue a policy of austerity.
""(But) whoever has 130 percent of their GDP in debt must act more cautiously than someone who is in a different position,"" told the foreign press association in Berlin.
""I expect the Italian government will take the necessary decisions that make it possible to avoid getting into difficulties...We are quite optimistic that in the end there will be a good solution.""
Scholz said that with positive economic data in many regions ""it would be wrong to say one can't look positively into the future"", but that the economic outlook was also marked by geopolitical risks.
Turning to Brexit, he said no country in Europe would escape unharmed from a no-deal British exit from the European Union but that Britain would suffer most. 
""A hard Brexit would cause large economic upheaval, above all of course in the United Kingdom but no one would escape free,"" Scholz said.
""Most European countries could withstand this well but there would be consequences and for Britain that would definitely be the worst option,"" he added.
British Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit strategy came under attack from all sides on Monday, increasing the risk that her plan for leaving the EU will be voted down by parliament and thrust the United Kingdom toward a potentially chaotic ""no-deal"" Brexit.
In a sign that Brexit talks could go down to the wire, EU sources said they want clarity from London by the end of Wednesday at the latest if there is to be a summit this month to approve a Brexit deal.
May's compromise plan, which seeks to maintain close trade ties with the EU in the future, is facing opposition from Brexiteers, pro-Europeans, the Northern Irish party that props up her government, and even some of her own ministers.
She must first seal a deal with the remaining 27 members of the EU before British lawmakers can approve - or reject - it.
""We are doing everything to achieve an agreement,"" Scholz said. ""We regard that as right and necessary.""

1589,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2018 11:23AM ET</span>",Hedge funds caught short when Brexit talks surprise,"By Tommy Wilkes and Tom Finn
LONDON (Reuters) - British Brexit minister Dominic Raab's ""thumbs up"" after a cabinet meeting on talks with the European Union was all sterling needed to jump nearly half a percent last Tuesday.
A story buried on the 14th page of the Times newspaper at the start of November about Britain and the EU sealing a deal on financial services sent the pound to its biggest one-day rise since mid-2017, despite repeated denials from both sides.
With negotiations between London and Brussels for a divorce agreement entering the final stretch, hedge funds have such large bearish bets on sterling that sudden positive news - no matter how incremental - is having a dramatic impact on the currency.
That means that big jumps in sterling may reflect investor positions rather than outright confidence of a deal. It also means that the pound has the potential to rally hard if an agreement is confirmed.
""A little glimmer of good news and the pound shoots up. You get some pretty substantial bad news and cable (the pound versus the U.S. dollar) doesn't really move,"" said Neil Jones, head of hedge fund sales at Mizuho bank.
Since its dramatic drop after the Brexit referendum in June 2016, sterling has become the principal gauge of sentiment in financial markets toward Brexit ahead of the departure date in March. 
In the week ending Nov. 9, hedge funds hiked their bets against the pound by more than $800 million, bringing the outstanding net short position in sterling against the dollar to $4.65 billion, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data shows. 
That is down from a 2018 peak of $6.5 billion hit in late September - the highest since May 2017 - but still a sizeable amount, according to the data, which captures a small part of overall investor positions in an opaque market.
For the many traders positioned against the pound, that means any good news can leave them scrambling to cover against more losses, exacerbating the move higher.
GRAPHIC: Sterling implied volatility - https://tmsnrt.rs/2QxXLDk
As Brexit brinkmanship builds, there is also the small but growing chance of a second referendum - an outcome analysts say should boost the pound because it increases the possibility of Britain remaining in the EU.
Investors began to ramp up short positions versus the British currency in April when the Bank of England skewered expectations for an imminent interest rate rise.
They piled on those negative bets from July onwards as fears rose that Britain and the EU would not agree divorce terms - leading to a disorderly Brexit and serious damage to the UK economy.
Investors have struggled to make money trading the pound in 2018, and many funds have sat on the sidelines - cutting their holdings and shying away from betting on the ins and outs of negotiations that conclude with a binary, hard-to-predict outcome.
Highlighting the uncertainty, a Reuters poll published earlier this month found sterling would rise to $1.35 if Britain and the EU clinched a divorce deal, but sink to $1.20 without an agreement.
MORE SHARP SWINGS
Investors' overall position, though, is heavily short, according to the CFTC data and bank currency traders.
Sterling's trade-weighted index, which measures the value of the pound against its trading partners, is trading 16 percent below its 40-year average.
That means should the Brexit negotiations turn positive, sterling could look cheap on one measure of its long-term value.
Currency traders are expecting sharper swings in the price of the pound over the next month than at any time since January 2017 as the crunch date for hammering out a deal - and then getting it through British parliament - nears, derivatives markets show. 
Since Aug 1, the average daily move in the pound has been large - around 0.4 percent - with slightly more negative days than positive ones, underlining investor nerves.
The market's view on sterling over three to six months is near its most negative since shortly after the 2016 Brexit vote, options markets indicate.

""The history of these negotiations suggests caution against trading headline risk as we believe confirmation of a deal and subsequent Parliamentary approval will provide the opportunity to participate in significant sterling upside,"" said Kamal Sharma, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch's FX strategist.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Noble Group Ltd is set to appoint Ian Potter, a former senior banker at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), as its next chairman in a few weeks, just as the commodities trader seeks to complete its $3.5 billion debt restructuring, sources with knowledge of the matter said on Monday.
Singapore-based Potter has been working with Noble in an advisory capacity for the past few months, said one of the sources, who declined to be named as Singapore-listed Noble has not made any official announcement about its next chairman.
Reuters was not able to contact Potter and an external spokeswoman at Noble had no immediate comment on the subject.
Potter is a managing partner at Lion City Capital, a private investment company. He previously had a nearly two decade stint at Morgan Stanley, where he was the head of its Asia commodities, among other roles, according to his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile.
Paul Brough, a restructuring veteran and Noble's current chairman, brought the firm back from one of the biggest near-death corporate experiences in Asia and had said he would step down once the restructuring was completed.
Noble's next chairman will be tasked with steering the company into profitability as it transforms itself into an Asian-centric trader mainly dealing with coal, freight and liquefied natural gas.
Noble is seeking approval from a UK court and a Bermuda court for its restructuring and payment to creditors, in what would mark its final hurdle to completing the debt-for-equity swap. Faced with the prospect of insolvency, Noble's shareholders reluctantly backed its restructuring.

The Financial Times reported on Monday that Potter had emerged as the frontrunner to be the next chairman of Noble.

The firm listed a number of challenges, including geopolitical and business challenges, falling fees, and technology disruptions, that could have a major impact on compensation and headcount.
""While financial sector businesses are still inherently healthy, the business challenges are expected to catch-up with them,"" Johnson Associates Managing Director Alan Johnson said in a statement.
Top Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs (N:GS) is already looking to cut costs to boost profit and recently promoted the smallest group as partners since the bank went public in 1999, according to an IFR News report.
For the current year, Johnson expects modest increases in incentives across all financial services, with the exception of investment banking advisory, which is expected to see a drop in bonuses.
Investment banking advisory was comparatively lower from a year earlier, which is why the business is not expected to pay out as much as it did (in bonuses) last year, the compensation firm told Reuters. 
Bonuses of equity traders are expected to see a bump of as much as 20 percent, a big improvement from a flat to 5 percent fall that was estimated for 2017.
The boost in compensation has been backed by robust results from equity trading at major Wall Street banks, especially in the third quarter, as U.S.-China trade spat spurred volatility in the markets.

Although bond trading remained relatively sluggish, fixed income traders are still expected to get up to 5 percent more in incentives, compared with an estimated 5 to 10 percent drop in 2017.

1604,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2018 08:36AM ET</span>",U.S. equity markets not taking their cues from high-yield junk bonds,"By Kate Duguid
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A long-reliable warning signal for stock investors that the tide is about to turn against them briefly flashed caution amid last month's sell-off but does not appear to be calling an end to the bull market just yet.
Like stocks, junk bonds - the high-yielding debt issued by the riskiest corporate borrowers - had a rough October, but nothing close to the magnitude of bloodletting over in equities.
Merrill Lynch's benchmark index for junk bonds fell 1.6 percent last month, its biggest drop since 2016, while the S&P 500 (SPX) sank nearly 7 percent and the Russell 2000 index (RUT) of small stocks plunged 11 percent to mark the poorest monthly performance for both since 2011.
In this cycle, ""far from leading the stock market in this downturn, high yield has lagged,"" said Martin Fridson, chief investment officer at Lehmann, Livian, Fridson Advisors LLC.
Moreover, junk bond yield spreads, or the measure of additional compensation investors demand for owning these risky securities rather than safer bonds like U.S. Treasuries, have not blown out to the degree they have ahead of market downturns in the past.
In 2007, junk spreads began persistently widening nearly five months before stocks began to tumble. By the time it was apparent stocks were headed for their deepest bear market since the Great Depression, junk yields had already mushroomed from around 2.50 percentage points over Treasury yields to 8.60 points. They recorded a similar move in early 2000 before the dot-com bubble burst.
By contrast, junk spreads only widened by less than three-quarters of a percentage point in the recent sell-off, and have tightened again since.
Jeffrey Gundlach, the chief executive of DoubleLine Capital, said one of the reasons not to believe a downturn was imminent is that high-yield spreads have been contained. ""I do in fact believe there will be a mass exodus from junk and investment grade, once the next recession hits, and it will be in evidence in a less obvious way before that.""
GRAPHIC - U.S. bond sector returns : https://tmsnrt.rs/2CUr9PX
PAIN POINTS
Within junk debt, bonds in sectors particularly vulnerable to recession have been hit hardest.
Home builders and real estate <.MERH0HB>, for example, has recorded its worst performance since September 2014, when the blowout in oil prices began.
The riskiest junk bonds, triple-C rated <.MERH0A3> issues, recorded their worst performance since January 2016, with yields rising more than twice as much as the broader junk index.
""There is some definitive pain in some sectors, which is why this is different from February when we saw a more broad-based sell-off. There are some bonds in energy, auto parts, home builders down 5 to 20 percent, and some of those stocks are down 30 to 40 percent,"" said William Smith, high yield portfolio manager at AllianceBernstein.
All told, ""this is the first time we're starting to see tightening credit conditions,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors. With a record number of bonds just barely qualified as investment grade, tighter credit could mean a wave of downgrades into the junk sector. And it's not currently clear whether the junk market is big enough to absorb that much supply.
""Previous downdrafts were simple price corrections,"" said Ablin. ""This could be different if liquidity dries up.""
It is possible that some of the credit weakness in the high-yield market has been cushioned by expectations that defaults will be lower or slower than during past downturns because protections for high-yield bond investors - called covenants - are so poor they could stall bankruptcies.
""The speedbumps that are usually in a document that require companies to go back to creditors aren't there,"" said Evan Friedman, senior vice president at Moody's Investors Service.
""That can delay a default.""
The default rate, by comparison, has been improving and that is expected to continue. Moody's Default and Ratings Analytics team forecasts that the United States' trailing 12-month high-yield default rate will sink from 3.06 percent in September 2018 to 2.0 percent in September 2019.
Indeed, for most investors, high yield trailing equities is an indication that a downturn is not yet around the corner.
""It seems that while high yield investors are concerned with the deteriorating credit cycle, they're not ready to call an end yet,"" said Michael DePalma, chief executive of PhaseCapital LP.

1606,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2018 08:23AM ET</span>","'King dollar' reigns supreme in world of slowing growth, European risks","By Sujata Rao
LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar surged to nearly 17-month highs on Monday against a basket of major currencies as investors sought out the liquid and high-yielding asset against a backdrop of global growth worries and rising political risk in Italy and Britain.
World stocks fell 0.3 percent for a third straight day in the red, receiving no respite from a rise in oil prices, while initial European equity gains fizzled amid growing fears for Italian lender Carige whose shares were suspended after reports of a capital hole. 
While Shanghai was lifted one percent by regulators' promise to simplify share buybacks, Asian markets broadly weakened following Friday's weak Wall Street close. New York trade will likely be thinned by the Veterans Day holiday and futures indicated the S&P500 and Dow Jones flat to lower but Nasdaq futures are marginally.
Investors are fretting about signs of slowing growth worldwide but especially in China where e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) was the latest to raise alarm bells, with the slowest ever annual sales growth during its Singles Day shopping event.
Many also reckon that U.S. President Donald Trump could turn up the heat over trade, further damaging China's economy.
All that, coupled with European political risks, conspired to push the dollar 0.5 percent higher against a basket of currencies by 1230 GMT. 
""King dollar has staged a return,"" Valentin Marinov, head of G10 FX strategy at  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR), said, adding that investors had piled back into the dollar after last week's U.S. Federal Reserve meeting confirmed a rate-tightening path.
""Euro and pound are both hurt by political risk and that is aggravating underperformance versus the dollar,"" Marinov said.
Sterling lost more than one percent at one point, holding near a 10-day low hit earlier, while the euro, comprising more than 50 percent of the dollar index, fell 0.7 percent to its lowest since July 2017.
British Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit strategy came under attack from all sides, increasing the risk that her plan for leaving the European Union will be voted down by parliament, thrusting the United Kingdom toward a potentially chaotic ""no-deal"" Brexit.
The opposition Labour Party said that if May's Brexit deal was voted down in parliament, it would push for a national election and possibly also another referendum.
Latest futures data showed net short sterling positions registered their biggest weekly rise in 1-1/2 months
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analysts, however, predicted more pain, telling clients: ""not enough risk is priced into sterling given the parliamentary problems ahead"".
In the euro zone, Italy faces a Tuesday deadline to submit a revised budget to the EU, but its refusal so far to cut the draft deficit sets the stage for a collision with Brussels.
Markets were also spooked by reports that Banca Carige would need around 400 million euros ($451 million) to plug a hole in its capital base and Italy's deposit protection fund could fill only part of it.
That raises the specter of a banking crisis in the euro zone's third-biggest economy, lifting Italy's bond yield spread over Germany - the risk premium attached to Italian assets - back above the psychologically key 300 basis-point mark. Italian bank shares fell 1.2 percent. 
Bernd Berg, global macro strategist at Woodman Asset Management, predicted the euro would tumble below $1.10 from the current $1.126 ""as renewed eurozone and Brexit angst and a diverging economic outlook with a strong U.S. economy versus a weakening eurozone economy will trigger further euro selling pressure.""
All of this has been good news for dollar bulls, who have benefited from safe-haven flows. Speculators' net long dollar positions rose last week to the highest since January 2016, calculations by Reuters and Commodity Futures Trading Commission, show.
The other big move was in commodities, where Saudi Arabia's energy minister jolted Brent crude futures around 2 percent higher with comments that Riyadh could reduce supply to world markets by 500,000 barrels per day in December, a global reduction of about 0.5 percent.
Brent is trading around $71.4 per dollar, off seven-month lows touched last week. 

But slowing world growth could make supply cuts a temporary solution to falling oil prices. Two of the world's biggest economies - Germany and Japan - are expected to report a contraction in output in coming days.

1607,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 12, 2018 08:20AM ET</span>",Seven Things You Need to Know About SoftBank's $21 Billion IPO,"(Bloomberg) -- Masayoshi Son spent years building Softbank Group (T:9984) into a telecommunications giant. Now he’s selling off a chunk of the business that made his fortune so he can move on to the next act.
Son, 61, is looking to raise about $21 billion through an initial public offering of his Japan telecom operations in what could be the country’s largest IPO ever. Here’s what you need to know about the IPO, the shares coming up for sale and the enigmatic billionaire behind the deal.
What is on offer?
SoftBank’s domestic telecommunications business spans wireless, broadband and fixed-line services and its brand is widely recognized with storefronts throughout the country. It’s the third-largest wireless operator behind NTT Docomo Inc. and KDDI Corp., but SoftBank has a reputation for innovation and low prices. Son, for example, got exclusive rights to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).’s iPhone in Japan for three years, letting him swipe customers from his rivals almost at will.
SoftBank is selling off about one third of the business in the IPO, offering at least 1.6 billion shares at 1,500 yen each. At that price, it would surpass the offering of former national carrier Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. in 1987. The IPO price range will be set on Nov. 30, followed by the final price Dec. 10. The new entity called SoftBank Corp. will start trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Dec. 19.
So are the shares a good buy?
Son is betting they will be. SoftBank says it’s targeting a dividend payout ratio of about 85 percent of net income for the new company. That is much higher than the dividends at Docomo and KDDI. Based on SoftBank’s net income in the last fiscal year, investors who buy at the preliminary IPO price would get a dividend yield of almost 5 percent. That’s healthy anywhere. In Japan, the land of negative interest rates, it’s dazzling.
And the risks?
Oh yeah, plenty of those. The whole of Japan’s wireless industry may be headed for serious pricing pressure. If that happens, then SoftBank’s profit could tumble and those rich yields will start to look paltry.
Japan’s government has been pounding carriers to lower their rates, which are among the highest in the developed world. Just two weeks ago, Docomo said it may cut rates 40 percent and return billions to customers. That wiped $34 billion off the market values of the top three carriers. But it’s not clear Docomo will follow through. The company, partly owned by the government, has spent years side-stepping pressure. Indeed, Docomo’s announcement may very well have been timed to hurt Son just as he was trying to raise money.
There’s also the prospect of new competition, with Rakuten Inc., the Japanese web giant, planning to become the nation’s fourth mobile network operator.
So who gets to buy shares?
Almost all the action will be in Japan. SoftBank’s underwriters, led by Nomura Holdings Inc. and Daiwa Securities Group Inc., are primarily targeting retail investors in the country. They are planning to sell the vast majority of the shares to individuals, with the remainder split between domestic and foreign institutions, people familiar with the matter said this month. About 90 percent of the shares will be sold in Japan.
There is likely to be plenty of demand from mom-and-pop investors. SoftBank, with 34 million mobile service subscribers in Japan, is perceived as a safe investment by retail investors, despite Son’s penchant for risky bets. It also owns Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks, a professional baseball team that this month won the championship.
What is the money for?
Son wants more cash to bet big on technology. He has said that he sees unprecedented opportunity in technologies from artificial intelligence to the Internet of Things. Last year, he formed the $100 billion Vision Fund with money from Saudi Arabia, Apple Inc. and others , and he’s quickly become the biggest investor in technology.
Son has said he plans to raise a new $100 billion fund every two or three years and the IPO would give him capital to put into future funds. SoftBank contributed $28 billion to the first Vision Fund so it would likely need to chip in about the same amount in future deals.
What does this mean for SoftBank’s investors?
The IPO might help boost the share price, which for years has suffered from a considerable conglomerate discount. While the Tokyo-based company has a market value of about 9.7 trillion yen, its publicly-traded holdings including  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. and Yahoo Japan Corp. alone are worth more than 15 trillion yen.
One way to narrow the valuation gap is to purchase the company’s own stock and the IPO could provide the needed funds. SoftBank’s last buyback was in February 2016, when it announced plans to spend as much as 500 billion yen to acquire about 14 percent of its shares. The stock touched its highest level since 2000 in September, but it’s erased the gains this year amid a general decline in technology shares.
What does this mean for Son?
Son is embarking on yet another transformation in his long career as an entrepreneur. As a college student in the U.S., he invented a translation machine and imported Space Invaders arcade games to the U.S. He founded SoftBank in 1981 as a distributor of software for personal computers. Then he backed the computer trade publisher Ziff Davis and took control of Comdex, the now-defunct trade show. He made tech investments along the way, including early bets on Yahoo! (NASDAQ:AABA) and Alibaba.
He got into the wireless business just over a decade ago by acquiring the Japan operations of  Vodafone  Group (LON:VOD) Plc. Now he’s determined to refocus his attention on technology investments as he heads into the last decade of his career.
“From the beginning, I’ve been saying that SoftBank is an information revolution company,” Son said at an earnings briefing in August. “We have been focusing on information revolution from the very first day of our foundation of the business.”"

1612,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2018 06:21AM ET</span>",Diageo to sell 19 brands to U.S.-based Sazerac for $550 million,"By Muvija M and Martinne Geller
(Reuters) -  Diageo  Plc (L:DGE) is selling 19 lower-end spirits brands including Seagrams VO Canadian whisky and Goldschlager cinnamon schnapps to U.S.-based Sazerac for $550 million, as it focuses on its premium labels such as Johnnie Walker in the United States.
The divestiture is the latest move from the world's largest spirits company to trim its portfolio and concentrate more closely on its core business. In recent years, it has sold interests in wine, Red Stripe beer and the Gleneagles hotel and golf resort. 
Diageo, also known for Smirnoff vodka and Guinness stout, said on Monday it would return the net proceeds of about 340 million pounds ($438 million) to shareholders through a share repurchase.
The sale, which also includes whisky brands such as Seagram's 83, Seagram's Five Star and Jamaican rum Myers's, will reduce Diageo's pre-exceptional earnings per share by 1.9 pence per share in the first full financial year after closing.
Yet it will improve growth in Diageo's U.S. spirits business by 40 to 50 basis points, its chief financial officer told Reuters, by shifting the business away from the low end of the market, where sales are falling as more drinkers choose premium labels. 
""The value space has been in secular decline for a number of years, so we see the bigger growth opportunity and focus for our business in premium and above,"" CFO Kathryn Mikells said. 
Berenberg analyst Javier Gonzalez Lastra said the brands Diageo is selling were seeing sales decline by as much as 10 percent a year. 
Sky News reported https://news.sky.com/story/diageo-calls-time-on-goldschlager-in-1bn-sell-off-11383825 in May that the company was in talks to sell some U.S.-focused brands for an overall price tag of between $500 million and $1 billion.
But the deal struck with Sazerac does not include the large Seagram's 7 Crown American whiskey brand, Mikells noted. The company is keeping that brand, while selling the Canadian Seagram's whisky. 
The North American region is the biggest market for premium drinks in the world, and accounts for a third of the British company's sales and nearly half its operating profit.
Aside from pruning its portfolio, Diageo has been expanding the reach and improving the marketing of premium, global brands like Johnnie Walker. It has also done a number of acquisitions, including last year's purchase of George Clooney's tequila Casamigos and this year's purchase of Belsazar vermouth.
Mikells said Diageo was ""very happy"" with its current portfolio, but noted that the company would look at it periodically over the long term. 
Regarding the beer business, which has sometimes been touted by outsiders as a potential divestiture, Mikells said Diageo considered it ""a core business,"" and its key brand Guinness a high-end name consistent with its focus on premium labels. 
Asked if Diageo was interested in entering the cannabis market, Mikells said Diageo was watching it closely, but so far had not seen any impact to its business from legalization of marijuana in Canada or parts of the United States.
""It's very early days and I think there isn't really enough clear data to be certain exactly what, if any, impact it may have,"" she said. 
HIGH END BOOM 
U.S. liquor sales hit a record $26.2 billion in 2017, fueled by high-end brown spirits like bourbon, and a big thirst for tequila and vodka, the Distilled Spirits Council, an industry group, said in February.
Diageo, part of the UK's blue-chip index, said it expects the sale to close in early 2019 and to bring in a one-time gain of roughly 110 million pounds.
The company has also agreed to long-term supply contracts with Louisiana, U.S.-based Sazerac.
Sazerac, which traces its roots to the early 19th century, is an independent, family owned company in the United States, home to brands such as Buffalo Trace and Pappy Van Winkle bourbon. 
Shares of Diageo were down about 0.7 percent at 2,726.5 pence at 1037 GMT, after trading in positive territory initially.

1613,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2018 05:47AM ET</span>",SAP snatches sentiment tracker Qualtrics from verge of IPO for $8 billion,"By Douglas Busvine
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German business software company SAP (DE:SAPG) has agreed to buy Qualtrics International for $8 billion in cash, pre-empting a planned stock market listing by the U.S.-based company which specializes in tracking online sentiment.
The deal will help Europe's most valuable tech firm strengthen its customer relationship management (CRM) software offering, a focus of Chief Executive Bill McDermott in a race with CRM specialist Salesforce (N:CRM) and arch-rival Oracle (N:ORCL).
Announced late on Sunday, the deal is SAP's largest acquisition since it bought travel and expense-management firm Concur for $8.3 billion in 2014. 
One person involved in the deal said it was the largest-ever takeover of a technology company on the verge of a market debut.
Qualtrics captures and analyses data on brands and products from real-time sources including social media and email, and should give SAP's clients better insights into their own customers' experience. 
SAP's core strength lies in helping some of the world's biggest firms run their finance, logistics and human resources operations.
""Experience data plus operational data are a powerful combination,"" McDermott told reporters on a call. ""This is the most pristine asset in the business software industry.""
Shares in SAP fell 4.2 percent by 0910 GMT as traders and analysts believed SAP was overpaying.
""Might be a valid strategic rationale and top-line growth is impressive, but it's still expensive,"" said one trader.
McDermott said that once the deal closed SAP would achieve the fastest revenue growth of any company in the enterprise application software industry.
Revenue would grow by double digits, while non-IFRS operating income would outpace revenue, he said. SAP will update its guidance after the deal closes, which is expected in the first half of 2019.
Baader Helvea analyst Knut Woller said that at 21.5 times trailing annual revenue, the price SAP was paying is nearly double the multiples in comparable recent deals of 11.2 times. Woller has a ""buy"" recommendation on SAP shares.
Qualtrics expects revenue to exceed $400 million this year, and projects a growth rate above 40 percent, not including potential synergies that might arise from being part of SAP. It has 9,000 customers, mostly in the United States.
SAP expects its own revenue to grow this year by 7.5 to 8.5 percent to more than 25 billion euros.
TRACK RECORD
Bernstein analyst Mark Moerdler, who rates SAP ""outperform"", said the acquisition would fill a void in SAP's portfolio.
""While SAP has paid premium prices for their acquisitions they have acquired quality assets and have been overall successful acquirers. We see this acquisition as incrementally positive for our thesis,"" he wrote in a note.
Moerdler also noted that the acquisition would make SAP more of a competitor to Adobe (O:ADBE), with whom it recently announced a customer data-sharing initiative along with Microsoft (O:MSFT), in experience management and e-commerce.
SAP will acquire all of the outstanding shares in Qualtrics and has secured 7 billion euros in financing to cover the purchase price and acquisition-related costs for the deal, which has been approved by both companies' boards. 
Qualtrics CEO Ryan Smith, who owns about 40 percent of the 16-year-old company with his brother and father, will stay on and the company will retain its dual headquarters in Provo, Utah, and Seattle.
Smith told Reuters that the IPO would have valued the company at least at $6 billion.
""We were going to be one day worth $20 billion or $30 billion, like a ServiceNow Inc (N:NOW) or a  Workday Inc  (O:WDAY),"" Smith said. ""We were under no financial pressure to do anything.""
Smith said the business had been consistently cash-flow positive since it was founded in his parents' basement.
McDermott said he and Smith met a few months back and quickly struck up a friendship: he said he arrived for lunch one day at Smith's home in a suit and dress shoes, and the two ended up playing basketball in the yard.
""We hit it off right off the bat,"" said McDermott, a 57-year-old New Yorker who has headed SAP since 2010.
The SAP boss had previously said he was only looking at ""tuck-in"" acquisitions. He described the Qualtrics deal as transformational in terms of growth potential, comparing it with Facebook Inc's (O:FB) takeover of photo-sharing site Instagram.
Qualtrics was advised on the transaction by Qatalyst Partners and Goodwin Proctor, LLP. JPMorgan (N:JPM) acted as financial adviser and Jones Day as legal adviser to SAP.

1615,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2018 05:21AM ET</span>","Democrats to probe Trump actions on AT&T, Amazon: aide","By David Shepardson and Sarah N. Lynch
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When Democrats take control of the U.S. House they plan to investigate the Trump administration's attempt to block AT&T Inc (N:T) from acquiring Time Warner, and whether officials sought to punish Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) by prodding the U.S. Post Office to hike shipping prices for the world's largest e-commerce company, a senior Democrat and a congressional aide said on Sunday.
Speaking to online publication Axios, Representative Adam Schiff, who is expected to be the incoming chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said Democrats will review if Trump used the powers of the federal government to punish the companies. 
Representative Elijah Cummings, the likely incoming chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said the committee ""may want to look into"" if the White House retaliated against Amazon and AT&T.
A House Oversight and Government Reform Committee aide said on Sunday that the committee has ""already been investigating these matters, but the Trump Administration to date has not complied with our requests. We fully expect that to change now that we are in the majority.""
Cummings also said on ABC's ""This Week"" that he intends to investigate if Trump killed plans to relocate the new headquarters of the FBI because moving it could harm his business interests in the Trump Hotel across the street.
Cummings in September asked the White House and the Trump Organization for documents about Trump's ""failure to accurately report debts and payments"" to his personal attorney Michael Cohen ""for silencing women who alleged extramarital affairs before the election."" 
Another committee aide said on Sunday ""the requested information was not provided because we were in the minority, and this should change now that we are in the majority."" Cohen pleaded guilty in August to eight felony counts.
Since winning control of the House of Representatives in the midterm elections last week, Democrats have vowed to launch investigations on a wide range of topics involving the Trump administration.
Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos privately owns the Washington Post, while Time Warner's holdings include CNN. Trump has lambasted both outlets frequently for their critical coverage of him.
""It is very squarely within our responsibility to find out,"" Schiff told Axios in an interview that will air Sunday on HBO.
Schiff said Trump ""was secretly meeting with the postmaster (general) in an effort to browbeat the postmaster into raising postal rates on Amazon... This appears to be an effort by the president to use the instruments of state power to punish Jeff Bezos and the Washington Post,"" Schiff said.
It is not clear what committees may probe the corporate issues, since Schiff's Intelligence Committee would not have oversight. A Schiff spokesman declined further comment.
AT&T and Amazon.com both declined to comment on Sunday. The White House did not immediately comment.
Trump has repeatedly complained Amazon does not pay the U.S. Postal Service a fair rate for package delivery. Trump has said, without citing evidence, that this costs U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars, and he has threatened to raise the company's postal rates.
Trump opposed the AT&T-Time Warner merger as a candidate and has repeatedly attacked CNN and last week a CNN reporter's White House press pass was suspended. 
The Justice Department is appealing a federal judge's approval of the $85.4 billion AT&T acquisition of Time Warner.
With a split decision in last week's congressional elections, Democrats plan a cautious approach. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi told CBS's ""Face the Nation"" that Democrats will not conduct ""any investigation for a political purpose, but to seek the truth."" 

Cummings vowed a ""methodical"" approach in approaching investigations. ""I'm not going to be handing out subpoenas like somebody’s handing out candy on Halloween,"" Cummings said.

1616,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 12, 2018 05:20AM ET</span>",Malaysia Seeking ‘Full Refund’ From Goldman for 1MDB Deals,"(Bloomberg) -- Malaysia is seeking a full refund of all the fees it paid to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). for arranging billions of dollars of deals for troubled state fund 1MDB, said Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng.
Goldman has “admitted culpability” after former banker Tim Leissner entered a guilty plea for his role in the scandal, Lim said in a Monday interview with radio station BFM. Lim is banking on the firm’s “indirect” admission of wrongdoing and U.S. law against kleptocracy, to help Malaysia recoup fees that include nearly $600 million that it paid Goldman for three bond deals.
“I would be happy if we can get around 30 percent net after all the expenses incurred” from the entire 1MDB scandal, he said, referring to the overall amount of funds thought to be lost through the troubled state fund. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has set a goal of bringing back $4.5 billion.
Goldman has consistently said that it believed proceeds of the $6.5 billion of 1MDB debt sales it underwrote were for development projects and that Leissner, its former Southeast Asia chairman, withheld information from the firm. Leissner said in his guilty plea unveiled on Friday that others at the bank helped him conceal bribes used to retain business in Malaysia.
Recouping the 1MDB funds would require tracing assets bought using the money, with Malaysian authorities focused on locating Low Taek Jho, or Jho Low, who has been described by investigators as a central figure in the 1MDB transactions.
Records show that Low, who remains at large, isn’t in China on a Malaysian passport as previously thought, Lim told the BFM radio station. It is unclear if Low entered the country using different travel documents, he said. Chinese authorities have been cooperative, with Lim adding that he hoped they would help if Low had managed to slip into the country.
“It is a matter of trying to determine where he is first before we can ask other countries to help us to detain him and extradite him back to Malaysia if there’s an extradition agreement,” Lim said. “But so far, as I said, we are still relying on Interpol to locate this rather slippery character.”"

HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - China's acquisitive apparel firm Shandong Ruyi is targeting more global deals involving ""affordable luxury"" brands, under a push to establish the first high-end Chinese fashion empire to eventually challenge behemoth LVMH (PA:LVMH).
Its chairman, Qiu Yafu, who has led a spate of deals buying tailors Gieves & Hawkes to Swiss luxury brand Bally, told Reuters on Monday the company would focus on affordable luxury, where he sees growth even amid broader economic slowdown.
Qiu, a little-known billionaire with a low-profile even in China, has big ambitions in the world of fashion, where his growing empire is leading the race in China to rival established fashion houses in the traditionally European dominated industry.
The magnate, who started as an apprentice at the age of 17 at one of Ruyi's textile mills, has built up control of a range of European luxury brands through aggressive acquisitions worth billions of dollars, including French fashion house SMCP and Britain's Aquascutum.
Qiu, tall and wearing a dark fitted suit and red tie, said the broader Ruyi group wanted to become as big as LVMH, though added that wouldn't happen overnight.
""LV is a world renowned god-like enterprise. It is our role model. We are still a far cry from it but that's our vision,"" Qiu, who was born in 1958, told Reuters during an interview in Hong Kong on the sidelines of a luxury industry conference.
""Would it take five years, 10 years, even longer, or for the next generation or a better team to achieve? It is a very important project and challenge. It may even be impossible. But it doesn't mean we shouldn't learn, imitate or borrow ideas.""
Qiu added the firm would ""pursue"" deals for quality ""trend-setter"" brands with sustainable development prospects, though he was less interested in brands he likened to ""pop music, only catering to people's tastes for a short while but not lasting"".
""Ruyi has firm and specific requirements and strategic positioning for fashion brands. We are always studying and watching brands that fit the positioning of high quality, high growth and high pricing,"" he said.
Ruyi and Qiu are looking to help brands target China's huge but slowing domestic apparel market, which research firm Euromonitor expects will hit 2.2 trillion yuan ($316.05 billion) by 2022, up around 10 percent from its current size. To that end, he said the firm would look to leverage big data and online stores to reach more shoppers.
The firm's pivot into fashion is part of a wider drive by Chinese firms that also includes conglomerates Fosun (HK:0656), which could lead to an increase in fashion sector deal-making.
Once a state-owned textiles firm, Ruyi was privatized two decades ago as part of a government reform. Its deal-making spree started in 2010 and has stretched from Japanese brand Renown to Hong Kong-based Trinity Group and textile brands such as Lycra.

With presence in 84 countries, Ruyi's annual sales revenue has exceeded 20 billion yuan, Qiu said.

1619,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2018 04:38AM ET</span>",Japan's SoftBank steps closer to transformation with mammoth mobile IPO,"By Taiga Uranaka
TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) has won approval to conduct a 2.4 trillion yen ($21.04 billion) initial public offering (IPO) of its domestic telecoms business, in a deal that will seal the group's transformation into a top global technology investor.
The IPO will be one of the biggest ever worldwide, and will provide the group with funds to pay down debt and continue placing big bets on innovations that Chief Executive Masayoshi Son predicts will drive future tech trends.
SoftBank's bets so far have been as varied as small gaming startups, ride-hailing firms such as Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL], and e-commerce behemoth  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA).
SoftBank Group aims to raise 2.4 trillion yen through the sale of 1.6 billion SoftBank Corp shares at an tentative price of 1,500 yen each, showed a filing with the Ministry of Finance on Monday.
The amount could rise by 240.6 billion yen if demand triggers an overallotment, taking the total closer to the $25 billion that Alibaba raised in 2014 in the biggest-ever IPO.
The final IPO price will be determined on Dec. 10, and SoftBank Corp will list on the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Dec. 19 with an initial market value of 7.18 trillion yen - about 1 trillion yen above that of rival KDDI Corp (T:9433), which has about 10 million more subscribers.
The parent will retain a stake of around two-thirds, depending on the overallotment.
GROWTH IN QUESTION 
The mammoth offering comes at a time when investors have begun questioning the outlook for Japan's telecoms companies.
The IPO was initially expected to appeal to investors seeking stability, but the government has recently called on carriers to lower fees while backing more wireless competition, sending shockwaves through the industry.
Yet SoftBank's brand name is still likely to draw retail investors long accustomed to using SoftBank's phone and internet services. Many still see CEO Son as a tech visionary who challenged entrenched rivals NTT DoCoMo Inc (T:9437) and KDDI, and brought Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) iPhone to Japan.
Japanese households are commonly seen as an attractive target in IPOs with their 1,829 trillion yen in financial assets, even if they are traditionally risk-averse with over 50 percent of assets in cash and deposits. 
More than 80 percent of the shares will be offered to domestic retail investors, a person with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
""I think a reasonable amount of money will be attracted to this one,"" said Tetsutaro Abe, an equity research analyst at Aizawa Securities. ""It's a mobile company so the cash flow is steady. If you think about future yield and shareholder returns, it's a far more attractive investment than government bonds.""
SoftBank Group hopes that putting a value on the telecoms business will help bolster its own share price, which it sees as undervalued. 
Son in June argued that even without the domestic telecoms business, SoftBank Group shares should be worth over 14,000 yen - almost 40 percent over their current price - considering the value of its investments in Alibaba, Arm Holdings, Sprint Corp (N:S) and Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) Japan Corp (T:4689), as well as Vision Fund.
Investors have grown nervous about the lack of clarity in some of the investments by the $90 billion Vision Fund. They have also been worried about the fund's dependence on Saudi Arabia, its biggest backer, following the murder of a journalist by Saudi security officials.
Its shares closed mostly flat on Monday at 8,777 yen, down more than 20 percent since the killing in early October. 
U.S. credit-rating firm S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings said the IPO was credit positive for the parent, saying it expects a bulk of the proceeds to be used to repay debt. The group's interest-bearing debt was nearly 18 trillion yen at end-September.

Nomura, Mizuho,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JP Morgan and SMBC Nikko are joint global coordinators for the IPO.

Data from regional stock exchanges showed foreigners sold a net total of $14.54 billion in Taiwan, South Korea, India, Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia, and Vietnam equities in the last month.
The total was the highest in at least 7 years, the data showed.
The outflows were led by Taiwan, South Korea and Indian equities, with each market seeing net sales of about $4 billion or more in the last month. 
(Foreign selling in Asian equities in October: https://tmsnrt.rs/2PkUEC1) 
""It is a run for the doors as risk sentiment was heightened on the backdrop of aggravated concerns over both trade tensions and tightening monetary conditions,"" said Jingyi Pan, a Singapore-based market strategist at trading and investments provider IG. 
The region's growth worries were highlighted by the International Monetary Fund in the last month, which cut its projection for next year, citing trade wars and monetary tightening in some economies.
At the start of this month, the U.S. President Donald Trump said that he will likely make a deal with China on trade, but warned that he still may impose more tariffs on Chinese goods.
Refinitiv data showed 54 percent of Asian companies have missed consensus earning forecasts for the third quarter so far, underscoring a lackluster earnings performance and worries about the impact from the U.S.-China trade war.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan shed more than 10 percent in October to extend its 2018 losses to 17 percent. However, the index is up 2.6 percent so far this month. 

""The sell-off had rendered Asian equities cheaper and certainly boosted the attractiveness of the region, but the outlook remain overcast with the uncertainties of US-China trade ties among others that could continue curbing the return of foreign flows"" Pan added.

1621,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2018 04:10AM ET</span>","Takeda sets vote date, aims to close $62 billion Shire deal Jan. 8","By Ben Hirschler
LONDON (Reuters) - Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical (T:4502) will hold an investor vote on its $62 billion acquisition of  Shire  (L:SHP) next month and aims to close the deal on Jan. 8, signaling its confidence in securing the required support.
Shares in London-listed Shire rose 3 percent on the news, hitting their highest level since Takeda first disclosed its interest in buying the rare diseases specialist in March. 
The deal would be the biggest-ever overseas acquisition by a Japanese company - but it needs two-thirds support from shareholders, some of whom are worried about the enlarged company's resulting debt burden.
Takeda said on Monday it would hold an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) of shareholders to vote on the transaction on Dec. 5.
Previously, Takeda had said it hoped to hold the EGM early in 2019, leaving uncertain the level of backing for the deal, which has been opposed by some members of the founding Takeda family.
""With the date of our extraordinary general meeting of shareholders now set, we are looking forward to continue our dialogue with shareholders regarding the compelling strategic and financial benefits of this transaction,"" Chief Executive Christophe Weber said.
Weber -- a Frenchman and the first non-Japanese CEO of the company -- believes that buying Shire will accelerate Takeda's growth and increase its international reach, boosting earnings.
The transaction is still awaiting approval from European regulators, although two people familiar with the matter told Reuters last week that Takeda was set to win conditional EU antitrust approval.
Takeda has offered to divest Shire's experimental drug SHP647 to address concerns about overlap in inflammatory bowel disease treatments. 
The takeover has already secured clearance from regulators in the United States, Japan, China and Brazil.
Weber said last week he was confident of securing investor backing for the purchase of Shire, but until now it has not been clear when exactly Takeda would call its EGM.
Takeda, which has a market value of around $32 billion, has secured a $30.9 billion bridge loan to help finance the Shire acquisition and some investors are concerned as to how well it will cope with debt repayments.
The Japanese company struck its agreement to take over Shire in May, in a deal that will propel it into the top 10 rankings of global drugmakers by sales.

However, the enlarged group faces significant challenges, particularly in hemophilia, where a new drug from Roche (S:ROG) and the prospect of new gene therapies now in development threaten a key part of Shire's existing business.

1629,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2018 02:10AM ET</span>",Disappointing third-quarter earnings another blow to battered European market,"By Helen Reid
LONDON (Reuters) - European companies are delivering their most disappointing earnings in nearly three years as a sluggish economy and rising costs take their toll on bottom lines, dealing another blow to investor confidence shaken by Italy's budget crisis and Brexit.
Stocks have seen sharp swings on results days as firms reveal the damage wrought by higher trade tariffs and weaker global demand against a backdrop of sliding equity markets and rising volatility.
Some of Europe's biggest companies, from cement makers and car manufacturers to engineering firms and airlines, warned of weaker margins.
""Macro momentum did roll over more than people had anticipated and I think that is coming through in the (earnings) numbers,"" said Caroline Simmons, deputy head of the UK investment office at UBS Wealth Management. 
The rate of earnings beats so far this earnings season is its weakest since the fourth quarter 2015 results, I/B/E/S Refinitiv data shows.
Many investors had hoped a solid corporate earnings season would help offset a slew of political and macro economic challenges across the region from Rome's budget crisis to London's struggle to clinch a Brexit deal. The STOXX 600 is on track for its worst year since 2011. 
But analysts have slashed their earnings estimates for the STOXX 600 at their fastest pace since July 2016. Downgrades started well before the earnings season even started three weeks ago, suggesting that confidence was already low. 
""The biggest reason why the Q3 earnings season has felt weaker than usual is the absence of very good results rather than significantly more big misses than usual,"" said  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts.
Earnings on the STOXX 600 are expected to grow 15.8 percent in the third quarter year-on-year, and are on track for 8.4 percent earnings growth for the full year 2018. That compares to earnings growth of 12.2 percent for 2017. 
But this season companies have also struggled with higher costs: raw materials, fuel prices and wages have all climbed while trade tariffs piled extra inflationary pressure onto some firms.
Examples abound.
The world's largest cement maker LafargeHolcim (S:LHN) cut its profit expectations due to rising fuel and transport costs.
Slowing growth and higher costs hurt autos in particular, with European companies reliant on growth in China, the world's top car market.
Carmakers including  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and BMW (DE:BMWG) had cut profit outlooks ahead of results due to trade tariffs and slowing Chinese demand.
But negative surprises during this season then came from their suppliers, the auto parts manufacturers including  Michelin  (PA:MICP), Nokian , and  Valeo  (PA:VLOF), also suffering from weaker sales growth.
SHARP SHARE REACTIONS
Volatility in equity markets globally is shifting up a gear and a sharp worldwide sell-off right at the start of the earnings season certainly didn't help sentiment.
Outsized share moves continued into this quarter, with a distinct negative skew to investors' reactions to companies delivering disappointing earnings while in-line or modestly positive results have not been rewarded in kind.
On Thursday, shares in ProSiebensat (DE:PSMGn) sank 15 percent to its lowest in more than six years after the German broadcaster said it would pay out less of its earnings to shareholders
Meanwhile  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) shares the same day rose just 0.7 percent even after the German engineering company's results beat expectations.
Stocks that missed consensus EPS estimates have seen the worst performance of the last four quarters, according to UBS. 
Earnings-day moves in Europe are averaging +/- 4 percent, against the typical average of +/- 3.1 percent since 2003, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) strategists said.
LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL?
Despite underwhelming earnings this season, some investors see the seeds of a recovery for Europe into the year-end and next year - partly off the back of a pullback in U.S. stocks which investors piled into this year.
Quarterly earnings growth is expected to be stronger in Europe than the United States next year, putting the region back on the radar for investors hungry for growth.
""When one looks at long-term charts and relative outperformance of the U.S. versus Europe and profit margins, you would say on a five-year view you would expect these to begin to converge,"" said Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments.
""The necessary triggers you'd have to see are PMI figures picking back up and signs the Italy-Brussels negotiations are at least in a steady state as opposed to going haywire,"" he added.
If trade war concerns have peaked and the United States and China arrive at a compromise, the euro area economy highly geared to global trade may get a boost, and inflows could follow.
""Expectations are so low on European growth that it could just surprise next year,"" said Chris Bailey, European strategist at Raymond James.

""The outlook for next year in terms of fund flows is much more exciting in world ex-US than it is in US,"" he added, saying he favors emerging markets and Europe.

(Reuters) - Software company  Apptio Inc  (O:APTI) said on Sunday it agreed to be bought by private equity firm Vista Equity Partners for $1.94 billion in cash, two years after going public.
Vista will take the company private for $38 per share, a premium of about 53 percent to Apptio stock's last close.
The deal would help the company bring its products to the market faster, Apptio co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Sunny Gupta told Reuters.
""In the private construct, we look at leveraging Vista's playbook,"" Gupta said. ""They seem to be very committed to accelerating our product innovation cycle to customers.""
Apptio, whose products include cloud-based and hybrid business management software, was founded in 2007 and went public in September of 2016 at $16 per share.
Vista, whose private-equity portfolio comprises of mostly software companies, sold marketing software firm Marketo to Adobe Inc (O:ADBE) for $4.75 billion in September.
The Apptio deal includes a 30-day ""go-shop"" period, which allows Apptio board and advisers to consider alternative offers, the company said.
Apptio had multiple offers from strategic and private investors before it agreed to go with Vista's, Gupta said. He will remain Apptio's CEO post the deal. It will remain headquartered in Bellevue, Washington.
The company's board has approved the deal, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2019, it said.
Apptio posted a surprise adjusted quarterly profit in August, a month before the stock touched a life high of $41.23. 
Qatalyst Partners served as Apptio's financial adviser, while Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati was its legal adviser. Kirkland & Ellis LLP was the legal adviser to Vista.

The Wall Street Journal earlier reported on the deal.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Shares in Samsung BioLogics Co Ltd (KS:207940) plunged on Monday amid concerns about its accounting practices ahead of a meeting of regulators this week to review whether it has violated rules which could lead to its delisting.
The biotech drug arm of Samsung Group, South Korea's biggest family-run conglomerate, fell 16 percent by 0425 GMT, wiping 3.9 trillion won ($3.5 billion) off its market value after South Korean media reported that regulators were expected to reach a conclusion about the case at a meeting on Wednesday.
An official at South Korea's top corporate watchdog, the Financial Services Commission (FSC), could not confirm the reports.
A Korea Exchange official told Reuters the firm could be delisted if it is found to have violated listing rules.
Samsung BioLogics is owned by tech giant Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) and Samsung C&T Corp (KS:028260), in which Samsung Group heir Jay Y.Lee is the top shareholder.
Some lawmakers and an activist group have claimed BioLogics violated accounting rules to inflate net profit before its 2016 listing.
The firm's valuation of unlisted joint venture Samsung Bioepis jumped 18 times to about $4.5 billion in 2015 as a result of accounting changes the company says were necessary to reflect different standards in the event its partner exercised its call option. It has denied any wrongdoing.
""Everything is still unclear about how the BioLogics case will end up. I wouldn't expect it will be delisted since changing the evaluation method doesn't appear to be meant to deceive its shareholders,"" said Park Ju-gun, head of corporate analysis firm CEO Score.
""But someone at the company's top level will take legal responsibility if it is found to be negligent or purposeful.""
In July, the FSC delayed a decision on whether BioLogics had intentionally breached accounting rules by switching the company's value.

The railway project comes at a time when a surge in tourist arrivals - more than half the population - has already strained the Thai infrastructure.
In March, the government approved the 225 billion baht ($6.80 billion) rail project that will connect two airports in Bangkok areas - Don Mueang International and Suvarnabhumi International - with U-Tapao, which was built during the Vietnam War in the eastern province of Rayong.
The consortium comprises Charoen Pokphand Holding and China Railway Construction Corp Ltd, Adiruth Thothaveesansuk, vice chairman, CP Group's Special Projects Development Office, said in a statement on Sunday.
According to the statement, the global consortium also includes China's CITIC Group Corp [CITIC.UL], Germany's  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn), South Korea's Hyundai,  Bangkok Expressway and Metro  Pcl (BK:BEM),  Italian-Thai  Development PCL (BK:ITD), Thailand's CH Karnchang PCL (BK:CH), Japan Overseas Infrastructure Investment Corp for Transport & Urban Development, China Resources (Holdings) Co Ltd, Italy's Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane, China's CRRC-Sifang, and Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC). 
Thai conglomerate CP Group is controlled by billionaire Dhanin Chearavanont.
The project is part of the government's larger transport infrastructure investment action plan covering rail, roads, airports and sea-ports.

The government started the bidding for the rail project earlier in the day and will announce the winner on Tuesday.

The apparent attempt to calm market jitters came after investors worried that comments made by the head of the banking and insurance regulator last week might see the financial sector take on more riskier loans.
Guo Shuqing, chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC), said on Thursday at least a third of big banks' new loans to companies should be to private firms, while at least two-thirds of small and medium-sized banks' new loans to companies should be to private businesses.
Chinese stocks, which were dragged lower by financials on Friday, advanced in early trade on Monday. 
""The targets are not 'hard' indicators for each bank,"" the China Securities Journal said, citing unnamed sources. ""The regulatory authorities will not propose specific targets for a single bank.""
Guo also said on Friday on the regulator's website that the financial institutions cannot apply 'one-size-fits-all' approach, adding that they have to treat the difficulties facing private firms objectively.

China's economic growth cooled to its weakest quarterly pace since the global financial crisis as a years-long campaign to tackle debt risks and the trade war with the United States have begun to bite.

1642,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2018 06:10PM ET</span>","Veritas Capital, Elliott clinch $5.5 billion acquisition of Athenahealth: sources","By Carl O'Donnell and Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) - Private equity firm Veritas Capital and hedge fund Elliott Management have agreed to acquire U.S. healthcare software maker Athenahealth Inc (O:ATHN) for $5.5 billion in cash, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday.
Athenahealth, whose cloud-based service is used to track revenue from patients, physicians and hospitals, had been under pressure to sell itself from Elliott, which has about a 9 percent stake in the company. As part of a restructuring effort this year, it has cut jobs and hired former  General Electric  Co (N:GE) Chief Executive Jeff Immelt as chairman.
The acquisition, which values Athenahealth at around $135 per share, will be announced on Monday, the sources said, asking not to be identified ahead of any official statement. Athnahealth shares ended trading on Friday at $120.35. 
Athenahealth, Elliott and Veritas Capital did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The deal comes just a few months after the departure of CEO Jonathan Bush last June. Bush, a nephew of former U.S. President George H.W. Bush, founded Athenahealth in 1997. He stepped down after issuing an apology following a newspaper report alleging he had assaulted his former wife 14 years earlier.
Elliott first made an unsolicited bid for Athenahealth in May of $160 per share. Since then, it has been in talks with various private equity firms about trying to buy the company, sources have said.
While activist investors such as Carl Icahn have acquired companies before, New York-based Elliott, with assets of more than $35 billion, is one of the few hedge funds with a dedicated team chasing buyouts.
A deal for Watertown, Massachusetts-based Athenahealth represents the largest deal to date for Elliott's private equity arm, which is called Evergreen. It is based in Menlo Park, California, and it is spearheaded by partner Jesse Cohn. 

In its third-quarter results reported last Friday, Athenahealth said its revenue under its previous accounting standards was $331.4 million, an increase of 9 percent compared to the same period last year. Its net income over the three months that ended Sept. 30, 2018 was $44.5 million, or $1.08 per diluted share.

1645,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 11, 2018 05:30PM ET</span>",Falling Oil Prices Are Becoming an Emerging-Markets Catalyst,"(Bloomberg) -- Falling oil prices are fast becoming a catalyst for emerging markets.
Last week’s slide in crude was partly behind the weakness in the Russian ruble, Mexican peso and Malaysian ringgit, according to  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA. With oil wallowing in a bear market, OPEC and its allies gathered in Abu Dhabi on Sunday to weigh production cuts.
“Oil-importing emerging economies’ currencies would likely react negatively to a cut in OPEC output given Iranian oil exports are already likely to wane over time under the impact of U.S. sanctions,” said Mansoor Mohi-uddin, the Singapore-based head of foreign-exchange strategy at NatWest Markets. “In contrast, if oil prices fall it will benefit the currencies of major oil-importing emerging markets including the Indian rupee and Turkish lira.”
The outlook for oil, a key source of revenue for Russia and Saudi Arabia, is adding a fresh twist for a market already obsessed with Federal Reserve tightening and the U.S.-China trade dispute. The prospect of any breakthrough on trade took a knock Friday when White House trade adviser Peter Navarro warned Wall Street not to pressure President Donald Trump into a quick deal.

On the domestic front, there’s a chance Mexico’s central bank will increase interest rates Thursday after the peso clocked up its sixth weekly loss. Policy makers in Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines will likely leave their benchmark rates unchanged, thanks to gains in the rupiah and the peso, according to  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV.
The ruble led a retreat in emerging-market currencies last week after the Fed signaled it will keep raising rates, making Wednesday’s release of U.S. consumer-price data the next pointer for monetary policy.

The U.S. financial newspaper said that Dollar Tree is trading at near a five-year low but could bounce back. The company has been punished for its purchase of rival Family Dollar, but has begun renovating and rebranding the struggling Family Dollar stores, it said.
Barron's said that analysts have been speculating on an activist investor may be interested. Carl Icahn and Nelson Peltz were Family Dollar shareholders who had encouraged a sale before the Dollar Tree acquisition, the newspaper reported.

The New York Post reported in October that Icahn was accumulating shares in the company.

1654,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2018 06:01AM ET</span>",Apple finds quality problems in some iPhone X and MacBook models,"(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) said on Friday it had found some issues affecting some of its iPhone X and 13-inch MacBook Pro products and said the company would fix them free of charge.
The repair offers are the latest in a string of product quality problems over the past year even as Apple has raised prices for most of its laptops, tablets and phones to new heights. Its top-end iPhones now sell for as much as $1,449 and its best iPad goes for as much as $1,899.
Apple said displays on iPhone X, which came out in 2017 with a starting price of $999, may experience touch issues due to a component failure, adding it would replace those parts for free. The company said it only affects the original iPhone X, which has been superseded by the iPhone XS and XR released this autumn.
The screens on affected phones may not respond correctly to touch or it could react even without being touched, the Cupertino, California-based company said.
For the 13-inch MacBook Pro computers, it said an issue may result in data loss and failure of the storage drive. Apple said it would service those affected drives.
Only a limited number of 128GB and 256GB solid-state drives in 13-inch MacBook Pro units sold between June 2017 and June 2018 were affected, Apple said https://apple.co/2AXkeEw on its website.
Last year, Apple began a massive battery replacement program after it conceded that a software update intended to help some iPhone models deal with aging batteries slowed down the performance of the phones. The battery imbroglio resulted in inquires from U.S. lawmakers.

In June, Apple said it would offer free replacements for the keyboards in some MacBook and MacBook Pro models. The keyboards, which Apple introduced in laptops starting in 2015, had generated complaints on social media for how much noise they made while typing and for malfunctioning unexpectedly. Apple changed the design of the keyboard this year, adding a layer of silicone underneath the keys.

1656,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2018 10:20PM ET</span>",Alibaba Singles' Day sales hit $10 billion in first hour,"By Cate Cadell
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd settled roughly 69 billion yuan ($9.92 billion) in the first hour of its annual Singles' Day on Sunday, up roughly 21 percent from last year's early haul of 57 billion yuan. Singles' Day is the world's biggest online sales event and last year netted Alibaba 168 billion yuan ($24.15 billion) in total sales. 
A disproportionately large number of sales are recorded in the first minutes of the 24-hour spending spree, when transactions are recorded for items that have been put on hold.
Alibaba kicks off the annual event with a gala, which this year featured U.S. singer Mariah Carey, a Japanese Beyonce impersonator and a shoe-shopping-themed Cirque du Soleil performance. 
It's expected to be the company's final November sale event with founder and chairman Jack Ma at the helm. Current chief executive Daniel Zhang will take over as chairman next year, the company said in September. 
While sales growth remains steady, Alibaba's stock has dropped 16 percent this year amid economic uncertainties linked to brewing trade tensions between China and the United States. 
Earlier this month, Alibaba revised down its full-year revenue forecast, sending a chill through investors, as it said sales of big-ticket items would be impacted. To compensate, the company will take in less income from its platforms in the near term in order to retain brands and new buyers, it said. 

This year, Alibaba said there were around 180,000 brands participating in Singles' Day, and as of 10 a.m. on Sunday sales were close to $20 billion.

IndiGo now has 150 of Airbus SE's (PA:AIR) A321neo jets on order, the source said. The orders showed in the official October review on Airbus' website. 
InterGlobe Aviation Ltd's (NS:INGL) IndiGo is one of Airbus' biggest global customers with 430 jets on order. It has almost triple the market share of nearest rival Jet Airways (NS:JET), which recently grounded some planes as it struggles to conserve cash and turn its business around. 
IndiGo had previously said it plans to add to its fleet of Airbus A320neos and ATR 72 turboprops at a rate of around 6 planes a month.

It will add 30 percent capacity this financial year to maintain dominance of the world's fastest growing aviation market, although its parent company has just recorded its first quarterly loss since listing.

Britain is set to leave the bloc on March 29, but with less than five months to go, Prime Minister Theresa May has yet to secure a withdrawal deal. 
A no-deal scenario could jeopardise operating rights for airline carriers that don't meet EU ownership rules, which require European operators to be majority owned and operated in the bloc. 
IAG, which is also the parent company of Spain's Iberia, has been in contact with the Spanish government since at least last month in an effort to ensure it will meet the ownership rules, El Pais reported, citing Spanish government and EU sources.
IAG is registered in Spain but has diverse global shareholders. After Brexit, UK shareholders will no longer count towards the required 50 percent minimum EU ownership.
IAG did not comment directly on the report but a spokesperson told Reuters the airline group remained confident the UK and EU would reach a comprehensive air transport agreement.

""Even if there is no Brexit deal, both the EU and UK have said they will put an agreement in place that allows flights to continue,"" the spokesperson said.

The U.S. Treasury Department had given Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska until Dec. 12 to reduce his holdings in the three companies but said in a statement that the deadline had been moved to Jan. 7, 2019.
“EN+, RUSAL, and GAZ are proposing substantial corporate governance changes that could potentially result in significant changes in control of these sanctioned entities,"" Treasury said in a statement explaining why the deadline was postponed.
Rusal, En+ and GAZ declined to comment. 
The U.S. Treasury imposed the sanctions in April on Deripaska and several companies in which he is a large shareholder, citing ""malign activities"" by Russia, as well as allegations of past crimes by Deripaska himself.
The sanctions, the toughest since Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea, have been postponed several times as the U.S. considers plans by Deripaska to divest shares in the companies so that he no longer controls them, among other moves.
Rusal and its parent En+ Group have recruited directors and management not linked to Deripaska in recent months as part of talks with Washington over easing U.S. sanctions. 
Rusal named Evgenii Nikitin, who has been acting chief executive since May and previously headed its aluminum division, as its CEO last Friday. En+ also appointed a new CEO. 
Friday's move extends licenses relating to the sanctioned firms to authorize activities needed to wind down operations or contracts, according to a statement on the U.S. Treasury Department's website. It also extends licenses to authorize transactions needed to divest debt, equity and other holdings.

Concerns over the impact of sanctions on Rusal have roiled aluminum markets. Rusal is the world’s second-biggest producer after China’s Hongqiao. Japan’s top aluminum rolling company, UACJ Corp, said on Nov. 1 that it was removing Rusal from its 2019 suppliers list due to uncertainty over the sanctions.

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) on Friday said it would carry more Apple Inc (O:AAPL) products globally in time for the holiday shopping season, as the technology rivals put aside past differences to boost sales.
In coming weeks, the world's biggest online retailer will sell the latest editions of Apple's iPhone, iPad and other devices in the United States, Europe, Japan and India. Amazon sold a limited assortment from Apple previously that included Mac computers and Beats headphones.
The deal underscores how top brands such as Apple and  Nike  Inc (N:NKE), which long resisted distributing products via Amazon, are increasingly turning to the e-commerce site because it has become a critical channel for reaching customers. Amazon has taken a harder line on counterfeit goods as well.
As of Jan. 4, Amazon will rid its site of Apple products from third-party merchants not authorized by the Cupertino, California-based technology company. Still, shoppers will be able to find non-branded accessories - like headphones - that are compatible with Apple devices.
Third-party merchants will be allowed to sell as they have been through the holiday season, while Amazon will add Apple products to its official Apple at Amazon page. 
The lineup will include the Apple Watch but not the Apple HomePod, a high-end alternative to Amazon's voice-controlled Echo device. Such competition in Silicon Valley has often come at the expense of customers.
Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google pulled its video streaming app YouTube from two Amazon devices last year because of several complaints against the online retailer, including its decision not to sell some of Google's products. Amazon now carries the Apple TV, but only after it became compatible with Amazon's Prime Video.
""We’re working with Amazon to improve the experience for Apple customers on their site and we look forward to those customers having another great way to buy iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Mac and more,"" Apple said in a statement. 
About 71 percent of Apple's sales in fiscal 2018, ended in September, were through indirect distribution channels like Amazon.

1684,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2018 04:20PM ET</span>",U.S. ethanol producers feeling the pinch from Trump trade war,"By Jarrett Renshaw and Michael Hirtzer
NEW YORK/CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. ethanol producers drew a bleak picture of their industry in quarterly filings and analyst calls this week, detailing how the critical farm belt business has been devastated by President Donald Trump's trade war with China and biofuels management policies that they say have tilted toward oil refiners. 
The ethanol business had grown for years at breakneck speed but its outlook has dimmed due to Washington's aggressive protectionist stance and the administration's unpredictable management of its renewable fuel program. 
No. 4 U.S. ethanol producer Green Plains Inc reported a net loss of $12.5 million in the third quarter. The company has idled plants to trim soaring inventories and boost margins, it said Thursday. The company recently sold three plants and a vinegar business to help pay down debt. CEO Todd Becker and others noted that China had been expected to import 200 million gallons of ethanol this year but has instead been out of the market for months due to Trump's trade war. Becker said Chinese buying would wipe out the U.S. supply glut, which he estimated at about 120 million gallons.
Archer Daniels Midland Co and Pacific Ethanol Inc, other big producers, also reported problems related to the trade fight.
As recently as February, China was the No. 2 global market for U.S. ethanol, which consumes about a third of the domestic corn crop. Then Beijing boosted import tariffs on several high-value American agricultural goods including ethanol, soybeans and pork, pressuring prices for each. 
U.S. ethanol futures of $1.26 per gallon are near the lowest in more than a decade. Current stockpiles of 23.150 million barrels (972.3 million gallons) are just below a record from earlier this year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. 
The ethanol industry ""is in a negative margin position. I wouldn't say there are many plants that would be positive, even our best plants,"" Becker said. 
Pacific Ethanol, the No. 6 U.S. ethanol producer, told investors last week that it idled 10 percent of its production capacity to battle high inventories and slumping margins. Its shares have sunk to less than $2 each.
The economic run cuts will likely last into next year and may be expanded, Pacific Ethanol CEO Neil Koehler warned.
""With China in the mix, it would be a very different market and margin environment today,"" Koehler said in an earnings call.
The Sacramento-based company recorded a loss of $7.5 million in the third quarter. It slashed its 2018 capital budget, deferred portions of debt payments and restructured loan terms to help preserve cash, according to its recent quarterly financial filing. 
ADM CEO Juan Luciano, the No. 2 ethanol producer, said its carbohydrate division did well, with one exception: ""The issue continues to be ethanol. And recently, we have seen people (taking) some capacity down, but probably still not enough,"" Luciano told analysts.
Other major ethanol producers, like Flint Hills Resources [FHR.UL] and top producer POET LLC, are privately held and do not release financial details.
The ethanol industry's view of Trump's biofuels policy is a mixed bag. It has generally praised his recent decision to lift a summer ban of gasoline blended with 15 percent ethanol, or E15. That move could expand the domestic market for the corn-based fuel. 
Still, ethanol producers have blasted the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under Trump for granting waivers exempting a record number of refineries from federal ethanol blending requirements. Biofuel companies have complained that the move is an expensive political gift to the oil industry. ""The truth is that the waivers capped domestic demand growth for ethanol and really hurt the industry,"" said Geoff Cooper, head of the Renewable Fuels Associations.
The ethanol industry and corn state lawmakers have urged the EPA to stop issuing the waivers and to compensate for lost ethanol blending volumes by requiring non-exempted refineries to blend even more.
The EPA is in the process of finalizing its 2019 biofuels blending volumes requirements under the Renewable Fuel Standard, and is expected to unveil them by the end of the month.

1685,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2018 04:03PM ET</span>",Investors focus on retailers as wages rise,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. companies are warning about rising wages eating into profit margins, increasing investor worries that next year's expected drop in profit growth may be sharper than feared.
Amidst overall strong quarterly results, climbing labor costs are a growing concern, with more than a dozen companies in the S&P 500 (SPX) mentioning them in conference calls so far this earnings season.
That is up from just a handful of companies that noted these concerns over a similar period in the year-ago quarter, an analysis of earnings calls by Thomson Reuters showed.
Next week, several retailers including Walmart (N:WMT) and Macy's (N:M) are due to report results and investors will be keen to hear what they say about labor.
Retailers and restaurants tend to have large employee bases and are expected to be among companies most likely to feel the biggest impacts of higher wages.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategists wrote in a note this week that hotels, restaurants, retailers, energy equipment and services, and IT services may be among industries most exposed to rising wages.
""Wage pressures have been building for some time, but we finally saw them really pop ... in the October jobs report, so I think that's going to continue to be an issue,"" said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco in New York.
Worries about the potential for wage inflation have been picking up as economic data has shown that U.S. labor market conditions are tightening.
Wage pressures could increasingly be an issue as earnings-per-share growth for S&P 500 companies is expected to slow to about 9 percent next year following 2018's tax-fueled earnings gains, estimated at 24 percent, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
In the recent U.S. jobs report for October, wages recorded their largest annual gain in 9-1/2 years. 
A separate report showed the Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, increased 0.8 percent in the third quarter after a 0.6 percent rise in the second quarter, putting the year-on-year rate of increase at 2.8 percent.
A record 7.14 million open jobs are unfilled, and employers have been forced to boost wages to attract employees.
Online retailer Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) said last month it would raise its minimum wage to $15 per hour for U.S. employees starting in November.
Moreover, chances for a higher federal minimum wage increased this week as Democrats won control of the House of Representatives in congressional elections.
Among companies that have talked about the impact of higher wages, McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) Chief Financial Officer Kevin Ozan said on the company's Oct. 23 call with analysts that labor costs were among pressures on margins in the latest quarter.
Chipotle Mexican Grill (N:CMG) Chief Financial Officer John Hartung told analysts the company expects labor costs to keep rising in the fourth quarter, and  Clorox Co  (N:CLX) executives said wage inflation has been higher than anticipated.
In addition, Clay Williams (NYSE:WMB), president and chief executive of National Oilwell Varco (N:NOV), which reported quarterly revenue that missed expectations, said ""steel and labor costs are continuing to rise, eroding margin gains from price increases across many of our businesses.""
To be sure, the tax overhaul passed by Congress in late 2017 has helped companies offset a lot of extra expenses, and third-quarter S&P 500 profit growth is on track to be the highest since 2010.
Lower tax rates should enable higher wages and maintainable margins without the need to raise prices, according to Russell Price, senior economist at Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) Services in Troy, Michigan.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) strategists in a recent note said wage inflation is among key risks to S&P 500 profit margins, along with higher tariffs and rising debt costs.
""Managements expressed confidence in their ability to offset tariff costs through price increases or supply chain reorganization. However, executives noted increased competition for labor and intensifying wage pressures,"" they wrote.
Some businesses, especially retailers, may need to pass along higher labor costs to maintain slim profit margins. 

""When salaries do jump to levels that would cause inflation, then that could negatively impact earnings growth,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.77%, the S&P 500 fell 0.94%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.65%.
Tech wreaked havoc on Wall Street as investors continued to bail on FAANG stocks in favor of defensive corners of the market on concerns slowing Chinese economic growth, partly driven by the U.S.-China trade war, could hurt economic growth.
Comments on trade from White House trade advisor Peter Navarro poured cold water on optimism a resolution could be sought at the month-end G-20 meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.
""If there is a deal -- if and when there is a deal, it will be on President Donald J. Trump's terms. Not Wall Street's terms,"" Navarro said
Among the FAANG stocks, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) were the hardest hit, with the latter closing more than 4% lower.
Weakness in Apple comes despite an upbeat note from Morgan Stanley earlier this week, in which the Wall Street bank waxed lyrical about the company's growing services business and upgraded its price target on the iPhone maker's shares to $253 from $226.
Apple's services business it set to exceed past expectations, partly because its iCloud business is already bigger than previously estimated, Morgan Stanley said.
The slump in tech was exacerbated by wave of selling across chip stocks on the heels of bearish quarterly results from key apple supplier Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS). Micron (NASDAQ:MU), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) closed in the red.
In signs of skittish sentiment about risk, defensive corners of the market like consumer staples, which includes makers of household needs like food, beverages and personal care products, were in favor, posting gains for the day.
 Monster Beverage  (NASDAQ:MNST),  Campbell Soup  (NYSE:CPB) and Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) led the charg higher for consumer staples.
Energy, meanwhile, accentuated the rout on Wall Street as plummeting U.S. oil prices added to fears about a global economic slowdown.
In corporate news,  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) was met with heavy selling pressure after JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) cut its price on target on the company's stock to $6, citing concerns about profit growth.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 fell steadily on Friday and deepened its losses as the day wore on with shares of large technology, industrial and material companies taking a hit after weak Chinese data and a slide in oil prices raised concerns about global growth.
Investors appeared unwilling to take on risk, sending the S&P technology index (SPLRCT) down 2.2 percent as Apple Inc (O:AAPL) dropped 2.9 percent and semiconductor stocks (SOX) tumbled 2.7 percent.
Crude oil looked set for its longest losing streak since 1998 as futures fell 1 percent as global supply increased and investors worried that fuel demand could slow.
""Oil is spooking the market. If oil prices are going to go lower that's another sign that the global economy is going to slow its growth,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""It looks like a slow (stocks) sell off. All day long its been drifting lower.""
At 2:21 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 301.31 points, or 1.15 percent, to 25,889.91, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 41.79 points, or 1.49 percent, to 2,765.04 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 178.54 points, or 2.37 percent, to 7,352.35.

Ten of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with the sole gain being a 0.3 percent rise in the defensive consumer staples index (SPLRCS).
Against the backdrop of a bitter trade dispute between the Washington and Beijing, Chinese data showed producer inflation fell for the fourth straight month in October on cooling domestic demand and manufacturing activity, while car sales fell for a fourth consecutive month.
The report sent global stocks into a tailspin and put pressure on trade and commodity sensitive sectors. The industrials sector (SPLRCI) fell 1.4 percent and materials (SPLRCM) dropped more than 1.8 percent. U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers left interest rates unchanged on Thursday, as expected, and its policy statement continued to signal more rate hikes ahead even as it noted that business investment had moderated.
The latest data on U.S. producer prices did little to ease worries about rising interest rates, which have hampered gains in stocks this year.
 General Electric  Co (N:GE) fell below $9 for the first time since March 2009 after J.P. Morgan cut price target on the stock to $6 from $10. It last traded down 8.1 percent at $8.37
Activision Blizzard Inc (O:ATVI) was down 13.2 percent after the video game publisher gave a dismal fourth-quarter forecast.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.22-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 3.83-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 27 new 52-week highs and eight new lows. The Nasdaq Composite recorded 39 new highs and 95 new lows.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - CI Investments Inc [CIXCI.UL] slightly boosted its holdings in the world's biggest gold-backed exchange-traded fund during the third quarter, a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 13F filing showed on Friday.
The investment arm of Toronto-based CI Financial Corp increased its holdings in SPDR Gold Trust (P:GLD) to 2.85 million shares though the value of those shares declined to $321.7 million in the third quarter from 2.81 million shares worth $333.2 million in the second quarter.
During the third quarter, spot gold prices declined more than 5 percent as investors continued to favor the U.S. dollar and riskier assets against the backdrop of a global trade war. [GOL/] [FRX/]
In the third quarter of 2018, CI Investments remained unexposed to gold shares in Barrick Gold Corp for the second consecutive quarter, but kept its call options at 213,537. The value of those call options from the second quarter's $4.28 million dropped by nearly half to $2.32 million in the third quarter.
CI Investments decreased its holdings in  Randgold Resources  (LON:RRS) Ltd to 14,600 shares valued at $1.03 million, down from 21,500 shares worth roughly $1.7 million during the second quarter of 2018.
Quarterly disclosures of hedge fund managers’ stock holdings, in what are known as 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are one of the few public ways of tracking what the managers are selling and buying.
But relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some risk because the disclosures come 45 days after the end of each quarter and may not reflect current positions. Still, the filings offer a glimpse into what hedge fund managers saw as opportunities to make money on the long side.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Japanese drugmaker Takeda Pharmaceutical (T:4502) is set to win conditional EU antitrust approval for its $62-billion bid for London's Shire, the biggest ever overseas acquisition by a Japanese company, two people familiar with the matter said on Friday. 
Last month, Takeda offered to divest Shire Plc's pipeline compound SHP647 along with some associated rights after the European Commission voiced concerns about the overlap with its own drug for inflammatory bowel disease called Entyvio.
Entyvio, a treatment for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is Takeda's biggest-selling drug.
Shire's shares moved into positive territory in London following the Reuters story, closing up 0.28 percent. Its U.S. listed shares (O:SHPG) recovered some earlier losses after the story.
Takeda is looking to the acquisition to boost its late-stage pipeline. Rare disease specialist Shire has seven drug candidates in Phase 3 clinical trials compared to its three. The deal would also make it a global top 10 drugmaker.
The EU competition enforcer, which is scheduled to rule on the deal by Nov. 20, and Takeda declined to comment. Shire did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Takeda has already secured unconditional clearance from regulators in the United States, Japan, China and Brazil.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of  General Electric  Co (N:GE) tumbled on Friday after a JP Morgan analyst slashed his target price on the stock to a lowly $6, dealing a fresh blow to the U.S. industrial conglomerate's flagging share price.
GE shares sank 7.3 percent to $8.44 in afternoon trading, and dropped to as low as $8.15. The stock price fell below $9 for the first time since March 2009, during the throes of the financial crisis.
Friday's research note from JP Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa followed GE's third-quarter results late last month, in which the company posted a staggering loss of $22.8 billion and said it faced a deepening federal accounting probe.
Tusa, who has long been bearish on the stock, said out of GE's eight reported segments, ""all of which were profitable even 2 years ago, 6 are now likely either at or below zero in 2020.""
""While liquidity is certainly debatable, we believe this is not really about liquidity, it’s about a deterioration in run rate fundamentals,"" Tusa said.
Noting the steep drop for GE shares from $30 in early 2017, Tusa said ""this move still does not sufficiently reflect the fundamental facts, in our view.""
Tusa kept his ""underweight"" rating on the stock as he cut his price target to $6 from $10.
Following Tusa's note, GE spokeswoman Jennifer Erickson said in a statement: ""GE is a fundamentally strong company with a sound liquidity position. We are taking aggressive action to strengthen our balance sheet through accelerated deleveraging and position our businesses for success.""
GE shares, which were booted from the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) earlier this year, have now slumped some 50 percent in 2018 alone. 

Some on Wall Street are optimistic that new Chief Executive Larry Culp, former head of Danaher Corp (N:DHR) who took over on Oct. 1, will be able to spark a turnaround for the company.
