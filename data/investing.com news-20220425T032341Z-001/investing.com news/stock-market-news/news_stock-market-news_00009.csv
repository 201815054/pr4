0,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2021 12:52PM ET</span>",Norwegian Cruise eyes return to profitability in second half of 2022,"(Reuters) -Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd on Wednesday forecast a return to profitability in the second half of 2022, as the U.S. travel and tourism industry claws back from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Cruise operators recorded billion-dollar losses last year as many ships anchored offshore without passengers, but pent-up demand for leisure travel and roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines have helped cruise lines pull thousands of guests again.
U.S. health officials earlier this year allowed them to resume sailings albeit at reduced occupancy.
Guests with strong household savings have also been splurging on pricey tickets and high-end products and services while on board the ships, helping cruise operators make up for some lost ticket sales due to occupancy restrictions.
For Norwegian Cruise, occupancy was 57.4% in the third quarter ended Sept. 30. It forecast occupancy to be at normalized levels in the back half of next year, when it would also have its full fleet in operation.
The parent of Oceania Cruises also said overall cumulative booked position for 2022 is in line with pre-pandemic record levels and at higher prices, even as the COVID-19 Delta variant hurt bookings for the fourth quarter and early 2022.
Norwegian Cruise also expects monthly average cash burn for the fourth quarter to be at around $350 million, up from about $275 million in the third quarter.
Bigger rival  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) Group last week also forecast a return to profitability in 2022.
In the third quarter, Norwegian Cruise struggled as some customers were apprehensive about going on cruises and it spent heavily to prepare ships for voyages again.

Norwegian Cruise's total revenue of $153.1 million missed estimates of $198.4 million, according to Refinitiv IBES. Adjusted per-share loss of $2.17 was also above estimates of $2.09.
Shares in Norwegian Cruise fell 2% in premarket trading.

Thus, we think Silicon Motion Technology (NASDAQ:SIMO) and Ryerson Holding (RYI), companies that possess exceptional growth features, could be ideal bets now. Read on.The Federal Reserve is expected to announce its plans to begin tapering its monthly bond purchases today. Though the Fed's decision to cut bond purchases by $120 billion per month was widely anticipated, how it plans to execute the policy is vital to the market. In addition, Wall Street banks are ramping up their preparations for potentially heightened market volatility with the withdrawal of monetary stimulus.
Consequently, investors are expected to now shift their focus to quality growth stocks to dodge short-term market volatility and benefit from their long-term growth prospects. Moreover, with the economy in the expansionary phase, growth stocks should perform well.
Therefore, we think it could be wise to bet on quality stocks, Silicon Motion Technology Corporation (SIMO) and Ryerson Holding Corporation (RYI). Both the stocks possess solid growth attributes.

The president of Yardeni Research Inc. says a profit boom will power the S&P 500 to 4,800 by the end of the year -- an upside of 3.6% versus the Tuesday close -- and to 5,200 by the end of 2022. 
With the U.S central bank all-but-certain to announce a $15 billion reduction in the monthly pace of asset purchases Wednesday, Yardeni is taking to task bull-market doubters who see record stock prices as nothing other than the result of valuations surging on policy stimulus.
He cites the S&P 500’s forward earnings, which bottomed in May 2020 and has soared 54.2% by the end of this October. Tellingly, operating earnings per share jumped to $52.38 last week, an increase of 6.7% since the start of the season.
“An earnings-led bull market is much better than a P/E-led bull market,” strategists led by Yardeni wrote in the Wednesday note. “The former is less prone to selloffs and corrections because it is supported by fundamentally strong earnings.”
The Nasdaq 100, S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Russell 2000 all closed at record highs on Tuesday, shrugging off turbulent bond markets signaling rate hikes will be faster than initially anticipated and potentially damaging to economic growth. 
Wall Street bulls argue the stock rally looks perfectly justified thanks to the canny propensity of American firms to deliver upside surprises on profit growth, defying all manner of economic disruptions. 
“Despite lots of reasons to worry about rising costs as well as parts and labor shortages, forward guidance, on balance, boosted consensus earnings expectations for Q4 and for the four quarters of next year,” according to the Yardeni note. “That’s clearly remarkable under the circumstances!”

(Reuters) - A company backed by Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) and led by former Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co executives Kevin Mayer and Tom Staggs is nearing a deal to buy Moonbug Entertainment for roughly $3 billion, three people familiar with the matter said.
The deal for the media house behind children's entertainment show ""CoComelon"" could be announced as soon as this week, the sources said on Wednesday, requesting anonymity as the talks are confidential.
Under the terms of the proposed deal, the Blackstone-led group will pay Moonbug $2.75 billion upfront. The remaining $300 million will be paid based on the company's performance, the sources said.
They, however, cautioned that the deal terms and the timing of the announcement could change.
Moonbug did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment. Blackstone declined to comment. The Information first reported about the talks between Blackstone and Moonbug.
The Blackstone-backed group had in August struck a deal to buy Academy award-winning actress Reese Witherspoon's media company, Hello Sunshine, for an undisclosed sum.
Founded in 2018, Moonbug has created content for children including ""Little Baby Bum"" and ""Blippi"", while its hit show ""CoComelon"" has more than 100 million YouTube subscribers. 

As the chief strategy officer at Disney, Mayer oversaw acquisitions of companies like 21st Century Fox, Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm at Disney and spearheaded the launch of Walt Disney Co's streaming service Disney+. He was also the former chief executive at TikTok.
The deal, should it close, fits with the model Staggs and Mayer have laid out for their new media company. Moonbug's children's shows are popular on YouTube and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and its well-known characters could help licensing and merchandising.

HAMBURG (Reuters) -A specially convened Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) committee will discuss the future of CEO Herbert Diess, three people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, a week after a longstanding conflict with labour representatives flared up again.
The planned meeting of the rarely-summoned mediation committee of VW's supervisory board comes in response to tensions between management and its works council, after sources said Diess told a recent meeting of the board that 30,000 jobs were at risk as part of the group's electric vehicles push.
The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, could not confirm when the meeting would take place.
""Constructive and confidential discussions are currently being held. Possible results will be communicated in due time,"" said a source close to the supervisory board.
The mediation committee consists of Hans Dieter Poetsch, supervisory board chairman and CEO of Volkswagen's largest shareholder Porsche SE; Stephan Weil, state premier of the German state of Lower Saxony, which owns a fifth of the voting rights of Volkswagen; works council leader Daniela Cavallo; and Joerg Hofmann, head of Germany's largest trade union IG Metall.
Spokespeople for Diess, Volkswagen's supervisory board and Porsche SE all declined to comment.
Shares in Volkswagen extended losses and fell as much as 4.7% following the news.
The escalation of the tussle over Diess's future underscores the fragile balance of power at the world's second-largest carmaker, pitting Diess' ambition to make Volkswagen more competitive with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) against Germany's influential trade unions.
Diess, who took the helm at the carmaker in 2018 as the third CEO since the Dieselgate emissions scandal broke in 2015, has been repeatedly criticised for his demanding management style as he seeks to overhaul the company.
His current contract, extended early during the summer, runs until October 2025.
Diess, 63, has been singling out Tesla's success as a benchmark for Volkswagen, hailing the efficiency and lean management of entrepreneur Elon Musk's company, which has drawn the ire of labour representatives who fear this will lead to major job cuts.

Underscoring his admiration for Musk's achievements, Diess even invited him to address 200 VW executives via a video call during a recent company meeting.
When Volkswagen released lower-than-expected third-quarter results last week, Diess said that headcount reduction was needed to make Volkswagen competitive with regard to fast growing EV rivals.

(Reuters) -Marriott International Inc on Wednesday topped estimates for third-quarter revenue and profit as a strong rebound in leisure travel helped counter a hit from fresh restrictions in Asia caused by the Delta variant.
The company's shares rose 4% to hit a record high in morning trade as the hotel operator also projected that leisure demand could continue to grow into 2022.
Occupancy rates in most major markets improved from pandemic lows with vaccinations and the reopening of economies encouraging more people to travel, but China's zero COVID-19 policy had an impact.
The recovery in Greater China has been choppier, but globally leisure travel remained very strong throughout the quarter, Chief Executive Anthony Capuano said.
Demand in Mainland China fell significantly in August after the government imposed strict lockdowns in response to small regional COVID-19 outbreaks, Marriott said.
The company does not disclose country wide revenue but the Asia-Pacific region is its third-largest contributor.
Brokerage Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said it expects demand in Mainland China to trend upward in the near term, as COVID-19 tensions ease and business and group bookings accelerate. 
Meanwhile, occupancy in the JW Marriott and Ritz-Carlton owner's key U.S. & Canada region stood at 63.5% in the third quarter, compared to 37% a year earlier. Europe occupancy was at 46.7%, up 26.3% from the same period in 2020.

Excluding items, the company earned 99 cents per share in the third quarter, beating expectations of 98 cents.
Revenue rose 75% to $3.95 billion, topping estimates of $3.81 billion.

(Reuters) - As millions of gamers peel themselves away from TVs at home, analysts say  Electronic Arts Inc  (NASDAQ:EA) should look to build a metaverse around its popular titles that can help the ""FIFA 22"" creator produce interactive experiences to keep players engaged.
Metaverse, a buzzword in the tech industry after Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) renamed the company Meta, is a shared virtual world where people in the form of avatars can interact with others, enjoy concerts by Ariana Grande, digitally purchase custom Vans sneakers and snack on Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) burritos.
Wall Street analysts said video game publishers should start the shift to this nascent area now rather than later as it would drive further monetization and keep them relevant over the long haul.
""Any video game company seriously considering the future of their offerings, and how users will play their games, is thinking about the metaverse,"" said John Patrick Lee, ETF Product Manager at VanEck.
The global metaverse market is expected to reach $6.16 billion in 2021 and $41.62 billion by 2026, according to research firm Strategy Analytics. 
THE CONTEXT
EA is reviewing a naming rights agreement with FIFA. If EA was to lose the FIFA branding, it would make acquiring new gamers more difficult.
EA released ""FIFA 22"" in October and is set for new releases like ""Battlefield 2042"" in November and ""GRID Legends"" next year.
However, EA is playing catch up to rivals like Roblox Corp and Epic Games Inc's ""Fortnite"" that let users create a metaverse within the games.
""As audiences move from one platform to the next, legacy publishers need to formulate strategies to evolve with their audience's preferences,"" said Joost Van Dreunen, a lecturer on the business of games at New York University Stern School of Business.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - The owner of the IKEA furniture brand said on Wednesday it would raise prices due to supply chain challenges far into 2022, after it reported a drop in full-year profit due to higher transport and raw material costs. 
Despite record demand as people spend more time at home due to the pandemic, pretax profit at Inter IKEA Group - franchisor to store owners and in charge of supply - fell 16% in the 12 months through August to 1.71 billion euros ($1.98 billion). Compared with the pre-pandemic fiscal 2019, profit was down 4%.
""The global pandemic affected our operating income in FY21. The biggest cause was the steep increase in transport and raw material prices in the second half of the financial year,"" privately-held Inter IKEA said in its annual summary. 
The company, which makes money mainly from sales of goods to its franchisees, said in October retailers' sales totalled a record 41.9 billion euros, up 6% on the year and up 1% from fiscal 2019 as locked-down consumers spent more than ever on their homes, and despite product shortages.
""Keeping IKEA stores and warehouses stocked has been a challenge. Supply chain disruptions led to a substantial drop in the availability of products that we have yet to recover from. We expect this will continue far into FY22,"" it said on Wednesday. 
Chief Financial Officer Martin van Dam told Reuters ripple effects of the global supply chain crisis and high energy prices could last for quite some time. 
""FY22 for us will be a more difficult year with more challenges,"" he said in an interview. 
""The scarcity and pricing of raw materials, and then the logistical problems - that means it will be difficult to grow in FY22. Of course we plan for growth, we will go for it, but it's going to be very, very hard work in our supply chain, and with our retailers as well.""
Van Dam said he expected supply related costs to rise further in the current fiscal year. 
Inter IKEA kept its product prices to retailers stable in the year but flagged it would pass on some of the higher raw material and transport costs to store owners this fiscal year. 
""Though we can’t continue to secure fixed prices to the retailers under these challenging conditions, we also plan to absorb part of the increased costs during FY22,"" it said. 

Van Dam said store owners would then have some liberty to decide whether, or to what extent, they should pass on higher prices to shoppers.

Investing.com – Wingstop stock (NASDAQ:WING) slumped more than 11% Wednesday after the company warned of high chicken prices, stretched supplies and labor shortages while reporting third-quarter numbers that disappointed.
According to the company, as a percentage of company-owned restaurant sales, total cost of sales could rise by 300 basis points to 83% for the year from 80% forecasted earlier. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percent.
Sales were costlier in the third quarter as the cost of bone-in chicken wings soared 49%. Wages and training costs were higher, too.
The chain serving classic wings, boneless wings and tenders expects domestic same-store sales to grow 7% to 8%.
Domestic same-store sales rose around 4% while digital accounted for around 62% of sales, comparable to the third quarter in the last financial year.
Total revenue rose 2.8%, to $65.8 million, as there were more store openings, and royalty revenue rose as did franchise fees. This was offset by a rebate of $6.9 million of advertising surplus that was returned to franchisees in the third quarter to partially account for the impact of record high wing inflation.
Net profit was 12% higher at $11.29 million, aided by lower advertising expenses.
The company closed the quarter ended September 25 with 1,673 restaurants system-wide, 49 more than at the end of the same quarter last year.

(Reuters) -Capri Holdings Ltd on Wednesday lifted its annual revenue and profit forecast ahead of the all-important holiday season as the Michael Kors owner expects to counter higher costs arising from global supply chain snags with raised prices. 
Shares of the company, which posted better-than-expected second-quarter results and announced a $1 billion share buyback program, soared over 15%.
The forecast raise comes at a time when Capri, like its peers Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL), is battling surging transportation and freight costs, but said the impact was cushioned by strong demand, more full-priced sales and higher prices for its brands such as Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo.
""The success of these (strategic) initiatives is currently offsetting the COVID-19 related industry headwinds including supply chain delays and increased transportation costs"" Capri Chief Executive Officer John Idol said.
In the second quarter, sales of the Versace owner's luxury apparel, handbags and heels rose due to pent-up demand from shoppers looking to glam up as they head out to social events and parties as restrictions ease. 
Several celebrities including rapper Lil Nas X, actor Channing Tatum and Lupita Nyong'o wore Versace to the high-profile Met Gala event in September, which helped boost the image of the brand that posted a 45% jump in revenue in the quarter.

The strong results helped Capri to forecast annual revenue of about $5.4 billion, up from a prior estimate of about $5.3 billion, and profit at $5.30 per share up from $4.50.
And while, extended factory closures in Vietnam and port logjams stemming from the pandemic-induced lockdowns, and loss of workers have led to merchandise delays, especially at Michael Kors, chief executive Idol said Capri will meet consumer demand heading into the upcoming holiday season.

Investing.com — Blink Charging Co (NASDAQ:BLNK)announced Wednesday that it has been awarded a grant from Michigan Consumers Energy and further funding from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) to install DC fast-charging stations across the state of Michigan.
Blink shares are up around 1%, trading near the $33.24 mark in morning trading. The shares initially hit a high of $34.32 in the first hour of the session.
The six DC fast chargers were installed at two separate locations in Traverse City and Clare, Michigan, Blink said.
The grants were part of a plan by the state of Michigan to create a more accessible network of EV chargers for its residents and visitors. The EGLE grant is financed through the Volkswagen mitigation trust fund as part of the emission settlement.
There was no mention of the amount granted to Blink.
“We are thrilled to have been awarded these grant funds from Michigan Consumers Energy and EGLE and to continue to grow our footprint of EV chargers in the state,” said Brendan Jones, president of Blink Charging. 
“Minimizing barriers to EV charging is critical to increasing consumer adoption of EVs, and these new fast-charging locations provide residents and visitors the confidence in Michigan’s charging infrastructure needed to help drive the electric mobility transformation.” 
Last week, Needham analyst Vikram Bagri lowered Blink's price target to $32 from $37 but kept a buy rating on the shares. The analyst said the company's capital-intensive business requires a high level of discipline and charger utilization will remain low while expenses remain high due to the required expansion."

Many are reaching consumers directly through digital sales. This also allows manufacturers to build closer relationships with consumers, understand their behavior and needs and accordingly tailor their offerings.

We think Sundial Growers (NASDAQ:SNDL) lacks the fundamental strength to survive the competition and attract investors’ attention. Conversely, it could be worth betting on OrganiGram (OGI), Village Farms (VFF), Akerna (NASDAQ:KERN), and Greenlane (GNLN), which we believe possess much higher upside potential than SNDL. So, let’s examine these names. Read on.Solid progress on the legalization front, increasing demand for therapeutic cannabis from an aging population, and changes in consumer preferences toward innovative recreational cannabis products have been driving the cannabis industry’s growth. The global market for legal marijuana is expected to reach $100 billion by 2027, registering a 19% CAGR. Also, the U.S. cannabis market is projected to reach $115 billion by 2030.
Although the shares of Calgary, Canada, cannabis producer  Sundial Growers Inc . (SNDL) are up 38.8% in price year-to-date, the company’s unstable financials and bleak growth prospects could mean the stock may attract only limited investor attention in the near term. For its last reported quarter, SNDL’s gross revenue decreased 47.7% year-over-year to CAD12.74 million ($10.28 million), and its net loss amounted to CAD52.3 million ($42.18 million). Also, analysts expect its revenue to decline 9.9% from its year-ago value in the current year. The stock has declined 45.7% in price over the past nine months.
Therefore, we think fundamentally sound cannabis stocks OrganiGram Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:OGI), Village Farms International, Inc. (NASDAQ:VFF), Akerna Corp. (KERN), and Greenlane Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:GNLN), which have much higher upside potential compared to SNDL, could be better bets now.

But with solid progress on the vaccination front and the easing of social distancing norms, most of these industries are reopening this year, significantly increasing the demand for energy.
While the demand is rising, major oil-producing countries’ curbed supply has driven crude oil prices to new highs. And since the demand for energy is expected to continue inching up, energy companies should thrive. Strong investor interest in the industry is evident in the 89.1% and 103.5% respective returns of iShares Global Energy ETF (IXC) and Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSE:XLE) over the past year.
So, we think International energy stocks PJSC Lukoil (LUKOY), Vermilion Energy Inc. (VET), GeoPark Limited (GPRK), and Transportadora de Gas del Sur S.A. (TGS) could be solid bets to cash in on the industry tailwinds.

LONDON (Reuters) -""Greenwashing"" by companies eager to massage their environmental credentials and increase their appeal to ethical investors came under scrutiny on Wednesday with the launch of a standards body that aims to weed out unjustified climate claims.
The International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) seeks to build on and replace a patchwork of voluntary disclosure practices that have had mixed success, with ""baseline"" global standards that companies could use to tell investors about the impact of climate change on their business.
The aim is to bear down on companies giving a flattering picture of their climate policies and business practices, designed to meet concerns of investors in what has become a multitrillion-dollar global market for environment, social and governance (ESG) targeted funds.
""We are really focused on greenwashing,"" said Ashley Alder, chair of IOSCO, the global umbrella body for securities regulators, which helped set up the ISSB. ""It's super important, and if you don't have basic information on a globally comparable basis, then you increase the risks of greenwashing enormously.""
""They (the new standards) are a baseline but they are not basic,"" said Alder, who also heads Hong Kong's securities watchdog, adding that the new board is a 'pathway' to mandatory reporting of climate risks.
The ISSB, unveiled at the UN's COP26 global climate summit https://www.reuters.com/business/cop in Glasgow and whose board and chair will be based in Frankfurt, will publish its first batch of global norms for climate-related company disclosures next year.
""The current debate about greenwashing is a symptom and it will not go away until we have a clear, enforceable global set of standards,” Gerald Podobnik, finance chief of Deutsche Bank’s corporate division, told an event at the Glasgow summit.
FIRST STANDARDS IN 2022
The new body's parent, the IFRS Foundation, published prototype climate disclosure standards for the ISSB to discuss and put out to public consultation ahead of adoption in the second half of 2022.
It will be up to each country to decide if it will apply and enforce the ISSB standards, but Klaas Knot, president of the Dutch central bank, told the climate summit that a voluntary approach to disclosures was reaching its limit.
""This is a major step forward for reporting around sustainability and towards the development of a truly international corporate reporting system,"" said Michael Izza, chief executive of the ICAEW, a professional accounting body in Britain.
Alder said IOSCO was considering a possible assurance framework to ensure rigorous checks on whether the ISSB standards are properly applied by companies, as is already the case for financial reporting where outside auditors check accounting rules are followed.
""We do see that assurance is one of the legs of the stool that is necessary to ensure there is maximum confidence around reporting under these standards,"" Alder said.
IOSCO could also formally endorse the new standards, meaning its members, who account for 95% of the world's securities markets, would then be obliged to implement and enforce them.

The success of ISSB will hinge on backing from major countries, but the European Union has already moved ahead with its own disclosures, which are more ambitious as they require companies to also explain how their operations affect climate change.
""To be effective, the standards will need to be brought into regulation around the world, together with associated enforcement, monitoring, governance and controls, assurance, and training,"" said Veronica Poole, global IFRS leader at accountants Deloitte.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mostly lower on Wednesday after a strong report on private-sector hiring in October strengthened fears that the Federal Reserve may accelerate its timetable for raising interest rates. 
ADP reported that 571,000 people found work in the private sector in the month through mid-October, far more than the 400,000 expected and a number only partly mitigated by a downward revision of 45,000 to its report for September. The report suggests that the labor market has shaken off the bout of weakness caused by the wave of Delta-variant Covid-19 in the summer and that people are being sucked back into work as companies raise wages to cover labor shortages.
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 84 points, or 0.2%, at 35,969 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite was down a little less than 0.1%. All three had closed at record highs on Tuesday, bolstered by a broadly positive earnings season and signs that the bond market had already priced in some modest monetary policy tightening from the Federal Reserve.
The Fed is expected to announce at 2:00 PM ET that it will phase out its monthly asset purchases - currently running at $120 billion - by the middle of next year. having seen gross domestic product to its pre-Covid trend and the labor market reclaim most of the jobs that were lost due to the pandemic. Chairman Jerome Powell will almost certainly be asked at his 2:30 PM press conference whether he still believes that the surge in consumer prices seen this year is ""transitory."" Price data for personal consumer expenditures released earlier this week showed that price increases had broadened across a much larger part of the economy, after being isolated in a few pockets of activity earlier in the year.
While the market in general was happy to wait for the Fed, there were still big movements in certain stocks, with Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) stock returning to favor among short-squeezing retail investors. The stock rose 32% after the troubled retailer said strong sales in the second half of this year will allow it to accelerate its stock buyback program, completing it two years ahead of plan. 
That emboldened fresh squeezes in two of the original 'meme' stocks: GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock rose 21% and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) stock - already lifted by the cinema chain's best weekend since the pandemic - rose 11.5%
Another stock boosted by retail traders on Tuesday,  Avis Budget  (NASDAQ:CAR), held on to most of its gains despite falling 13%. Avis's solid third-quarter performance triggered a buying frenzy on Tuesday that saw the stock price more than double. 
It was a different story for  Zillow  (NASDAQ:Z) stock. The online realtor fell another 17.5%, taking its losses for the week so far to over 32%, after it revealed the shocking scale of its miscalculated bet on the housing market. Zillow faces write-downs of nearly $570 million in the second half of 2021, due to losses on its attempts to flip houses. Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) stock also fell over 14% after it delayed the launch of two key games. Jen Oneal, who had taken over as co-CEO in the wake of the sexual harassment scandal that shook the company earlier this year, also said she will stand down to focus on a role more broadly supporting gender equality in the gaming industry.
Elsewhere,  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) stock rose 12% after the ride-hailing company reported a big improvement in its operating performance as the U.S. economy reopened. Its numbers also pushed the stock of its rival Uber (NYSE:UBER) up by over 6%.

(Reuters) -Discovery Inc beat Wall Street expectations for third-quarter revenue on Wednesday, driven by higher advertising and distribution revenue as the company looks ahead to its proposed merger with AT&T Inc (NYSE:T)'s WarnerMedia unit. 
Revenue rose about 23% to $3.15 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30, slightly above an estimate of $3.14 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
Total paid streaming subscribers globally stood at 20 million at the end of the third quarter, up from 17 million in the previous quarter and 18 million that the company had announced in early August. That figure includes subscribers to the Discovery+ streaming service launched in January, the company said.
Advertising revenue rebounded after a pullback due to the pandemic, and was up 28% internationally from the same period last year. Both domestic and international distribution revenue were also up from a year ago, driven by Discovery+.
The owner of Animal Planet and TLC is gearing up to combine with AT&T's WarnerMedia unit to create a new media business, seeking scale to take on streaming rivals such as Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co. The deal is expected to close in the middle of next year.
In a call with investors on Wednesday, Chief Executive Officer David Zaslav said Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) sees free cash flow on track to exceed $2.1 billion for the full year, and expects net leverage at the close of the WarnerMedia deal to be at or below 4.5 times, versus 5 times it estimated in its guidance in May. 

Zaslav will lead the proposed new company, named Warner Brothers Discovery. On Wednesday he said that Kevin Mayer, Disney’s former head of direct-to-consumer and international, is joining the company as a consultant. Mayer will advise on windowing strategy, ""about how different pieces of content, whether it’s movies, perform,” Zaslav said.
Excluding onetime items, Discovery earned 24 cents per share, below estimates of 41 cents.

In the process, it beefed up the business by pumping its digital products with a rich lineup of news, crosswords, podcasts - including ""The Daily"" - and cooking recipes, while making them stand out with multimedia and interactive elements using pictures, graphics and videos.
The Times said it added 455,000 digital-only subscribers during the quarter, its highest this year as the news cycle gathered pace.
""While COVID remained the dominant story as it has for the last 20 months, a wide range of topics also captured the public's attention, including the Afghanistan withdrawal and the tragic events in Haiti, the resignation of New York's Governor and our ongoing climate reporting,"" Chief Executive Officer Meredith (NYSE:MDP) Kopit Levien said.
The Times allows readers to track the coverage of some important new items outside of its paywall, boosting traffic to its apps and websites, and leading to paid user conversions. It also launched paid subscriptions to its tech products review website, Wirecutter, in the third quarter.

The company posted an adjusted profit of 23 cents per share in the third quarter on revenue of $509.1 million. Analysts had expected a profit of 20 cents per share on revenue of $499.1 million, according to Refinitiv data.
Shares of the company were up 4% in trading before the bell.

Total revenue nudged up 2.8% to $65.8 million, the company said Wednesday in a statement. That fell short of the $74.8 million average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Adjusted earnings of 29 cents a share were also below expectations.
The performance underscores the wide-ranging challenges facing the restaurant industry, including rising food costs, worker turnover and restrictions related to Covid-19. As Wingstop Chief Executive Officer Charlie Morrison noted in the statement, “chicken prices remain high due to macro inflationary factors including a labor shortage.”
Wingstop shares plunged 9.7% as of 8:10 a.m. before regular trading in New York. The stock had climbed 27% this year through Tuesday’s close.

Investing.com – Match Group stock (NASDAQ:MTCH) fell 3% in Wednesday’s premarket trading as lingering effects of Covid-19 brought out a quarterly forecast that was below estimates.
The owner of the popular dating app Tinder said it continues to feel some lingering Covid effects across Asia, particularly in Japan, its second largest market by revenue. At the same time, it said it expects “improvement as mobility restrictions lift, vaccine levels continue to rise, and case counts fall.""
The company sees fourth-quarter total revenue of $815 million at the midpoint, a 25% year-over-year jump and similar to July through September growth but lower than second quarter’s 27%.
Issues at Hyperconnect, an acquisition Match made to get the South Korean firm’s app Azar, also weighed on the outlook. The app has faced a drop in usage and product development issues.
Match said it is incorporating a variety of new interactions and live experiences into its apps. This includes adding videos to Tinder profiles and ‘Plus One’-like features to help single people find dates to take to a wedding.
Third-quarter revenue was $801.8 million and fell below estimates. Adjusted profit per share of 43 cents also fell short of expectations. The company added 16.3 million payers, up 16%. Revenue per payer rose 8%.

HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finnish insurer Sampo on Wednesday beat expectations with a 30% jump in quarterly core earnings, aided by a strong performance from its main subsidiary If and gains from selling a stake in Finnish Nordea bank.
The group's third-quarter combined ratio decreased 2.3 percentage points to 80.8%, beating analysts' consensus estimate of 81.5% in a company-provided poll. A ratio below 100 means an insurer earns more in premiums than it pays out in claims.
Sampo's result was a bit stronger on the insurance side than in investments, Inderes analyst Sauli Vilen said, adding investors usually value that over performance on the volatile stock market. 
""Insurance companies have benefited from the pandemic as people were stuck at home and drove fewer kilometers. That is clearly visible in the insurance business results,"" Vilen said.
Sampo's Chief Financial Officer Knut Arne Alsaker told Reuters the company expected the fourth quarter to be the first that would not benefit from the pandemic, but that the impact on the combined ratio would be minor. 
Ever since Sampo a year ago said it would focus on insurance, shareholders have waited to see when it would take the final step in selling its stake at Nordea.
Sampo's third-quarter result was boosted by a 144 million euro gain from selling Nordea shares in September. In October, the insurer sold more stock, reducing its stake in the bank to 6.1%.
Alsaker would not set a deadline for the final exit but said Sampo had a financial incentive to exit Nordea within the next 12 months to avoid paying taxes on capital gains after its holding went below 10%.
""It is now evident that Sampo will exit Nordea completely in the beginning of next year. The shares sell so well that the only question is will they sell it in one or two instalments,"" Vilen said.

CMA CGM currently has a 10% stake in FMS and it is to buy the remaining 90% from investment fund EQT (NYSE:EQT) Infrastructure III on the basis of an enterprise value of $2.3 billion, CMA CGM and EQT said on Wednesday.
France-based CMA CGM, one of the world's largest container shipping lines, expects to pay out around $1.8 billion for the 90% stake and will finance the deal from its own funds, it added.
Los Angeles port handles massive freight volumes between China and the United States and has been caught up in mounting shipping congestion as the coronavirus pandemic has disrupted global supply and demand for goods.
FMS is the third-largest container terminal at Los Angeles and its takeover will add to 49 terminals in which CMA CGM already has investments worldwide, it said.
""The swift recovery of the global economy has demonstrated the importance of ports and logistics infrastructure,"" Rodolphe Saadé, chairman and CEO of CMA CGM, said in a statement.
""It (FMS) is a key industrial facility which will significantly strengthen our position and support our rapid growth in this market.""
CMA CGM will act as terminal operator for FMS and plans to invest in expanding the capacity of the site, notably by building a new ship berth, extending the container yard and increasing rail capacity for onward transport.
Like its shipping rivals, CMA CGM has extended its presence along the logistics chain in port infrastructure and non-maritime transport services. 
Its earnings have jumped this year as the pandemic has led to high freight rates and saturated vessel capacity.
The acquisition of FMS, which is subject to regulatory approval, marks a return to CMA CGM ownership of the terminal that it had sold to EQT in 2017. 

CMA CGM divested then a 90% stake for an enterprise value of $875 million as it looked to boost its finances following its acquisition of Singapore-based shipping line NOL.
The enterprise value of $2.3 billion in the new deal represents 13.7 times FMS' expected earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) in 2022, according to CMA CGM.

The ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK) bought 288,813 shares of the property firm on Tuesday, according to the daily trading update from Wood’s Ark Investment Management. Zillow plunged over 10% on the day after pulling the plug on its tech-powered home-flipping operation.
Ark’s purchases were worth around $25 million, based on the closing price. 
Zillow was down again in early trading on Wednesday. The Seattle-based company plans to take writedowns of as much as $569 million and reduce its workforce by 25% as it ditches the algorithm-driven business in the coming months, it said. 
Wood is well known for buying the dip in her high-conviction bets. She and her firm frequently emphasize they have at least a five-year investment horizon, and acknowledge that the disruptive companies they target are often volatile. 
After delivering a 153% return last year, ARKK has lost about 1% in 2021. While its largest holding Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. has soared, the fund has been dragged down by other top picks including Zillow,  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) Inc. and  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) Inc.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's Lufthansa expects high demand for its booming cargo business and the recovery of passenger flights to continue next year, it said on Wednesday, after reporting its first underlying operating profit since the coronavirus crisis.
The group reported adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of 17 million euros ($20 million) in the third quarter, versus a loss of 1.262 billion euros a year earlier, supported by strong freight business and rising demand during the summer season with the easing of travel restrictions.
""We have mastered another milestone on our way out of the crisis: We are back to black,"" Chief Executive Officer Carsten Spohr said.
Analysts in a company-provided poll had expected an adjusted EBIT loss of 33 million euros.
Lufthansa's air cargo business reported a record adjusted EBIT of 301 million euros, as demand and air freight rates rose due to ocean freight bottlenecks and global supply chains disruptions.
""The favourable supply-demand gap will last at least until 2022, but with a high degree of probability beyond that,"" Spohr said.
The company's third-quarter revenue almost doubled to 5.2 billion euros, compared with analysts' forecast for 5.5 billion.
Lufthansa, which also owns Eurowings, Swiss, Brussels and Austrian Airlines, said it expected demand to develop positively, resulting in positive earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) in the fourth quarter.
It said third-quarter capacity, measured in available seat-kilometres, was 50% of the pre-crisis level. It expects 2022 capacity to rise to more than 70% of the 2019 level.
""The positive development will continue up to 80% in the second half of the year,"" Spohr added. 
New bookings are currently at 80% of 2019 levels, the airline said, prompted by recovering business bookings and rising demand for long-haul flights, especially to the United States, Lufthansa's most important and profitable market.
With the U.S. opening for travellers from Europe next week, Spohr said transatlantic bookings were already around 80% of pre-crisis levels, adding he expected mainland China to open up in the middle of 2022 rather than early next year.
Shares in Lufthansa were up 6.1% at 1101 GMT, the second best performer on Germany's mid-cap MDAX index.

The group, which last year received a 9 billion euro lifeline in public funding to stay afloat, said it expected capital expenditure of around 2 billion euros next year and that it was aiming for 2.5 billion a year in the long term.

(Reuters) -Coca Cola HBC will step up investment in marketing next year, Chief Executive Zoran Bogdanovic said on Wednesday, after the bottler posted higher third-quarter sales as people returned to visiting restaurants and pubs. 
With input cost pressures high, the Switzerland-based company will also implement further ""slight"" price increases in the fourth quarter and 2022, it said. 
The company, one of Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co's many franchisees worldwide, suffered a setback during the peak of the pandemic as hospitality venues closed and hit its wholesale business, while retail sales to customers also slipped.
However, overall volume growth remained strong with a 13.1% rise in the three months to September as HBC invested in sales via e-commerce channels. Product price increases in most of its markets also helped revenues. 
HBC's out-of-home channel accounts for nearly 40% of its total revenue. 
""We've been ramping up (investments) already this year in marketing because that was the key thing that we decreased last year ... we plan to further step up next year,"" Bogdanovic told Reuters, without quantifying the investments. 
A rebound in the number of COVID-19 cases being reported has forced economies to re-impose some curbs, but HBC is hoping increased marketing spend will further boost demand regardless, and that higher prices will help it navigate any ""aftershocks"". 
Bogdanovic said price rises so far have not hurt demand for its products. 
An array of factors, including global supply chain disruption, labour shortages and increasing demand, have forced companies like PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and Coca Cola to pass on some higher costs to customers. 
HBC posted third-quarter sales of 2.12 billion euros ($2.46 billion), well above analysts' average expectation of 2.04 billion euros and the 1.83 billion euros it reported last year.

U.S. beverage giant Coca-Cola holds a roughly 23% stake in the company.

BERLIN (Reuters) -BMW beat analysts' forecasts on Wednesday with a 42.4% increase in third quarter net profits to 2.58 billion euros ($2.99 billion) as higher prices and strong electric vehicle (EV) sales offset lower deliveries due to scarce chips.
In an earnings call, finance chief Nicolas Peter said the company was confident of topping its target for a 10% margin on pre-tax earnings this year, though the fourth quarter could be slightly dampened by higher tax payments and investment costs.
Looking ahead, the company expects strong EV sales to carry into 2022, Peter said.
While rising raw material prices impacted earnings this year, the company's strong relationship with suppliers has cushioned the blow, CEO Oliver Zipse said.
""We have always had good oversight over our supply chain. That is paying off now - right down to the raw materials,"" Zipse said.
NO CHIPS, NO PROBLEM?
Automakers from Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) to Stellantis to  Renault  (PA:RENA) saw dampened third quarter sales due to scarce chip supply, with consultancy BCG reporting in September it expected a total of 10 million to 11 million fewer cars to be produced worldwide this year because of the shortage.
But luxury producers like BMW and rival Daimler (OTC:DDAIF), which were able to raise prices to offset losses, fared better than others, with both companies reporting an EBIT margin of 7.8% in the third quarter, outstripping Volkswagen's 4.9%. 
BMW's deliveries fell 12.2% in the third quarter but revenues were still up by 4.5%. EVs in particular saw a significant boost, with sales in the nine months to September almost double last year's levels at just under 232,000 vehicles.
""A better product mix and good price setting of new vehicles alongside a stable pricing trend of used vehicles strengthened the financial performance of the business,"" a company statement said.
Still, Peter said the lack of chips was ""by no means a blessing"" due to the tens of thousands of cars the company could have sold but could not produce.
The finance chief said earlier this year the company expected to deliver up to 90,000 fewer cars in 2021 because of a lack of chips. 
BMW maintained its full-year EBIT margin forecast of 9.5% to 10.5% for its automotive division, adding this goal would be achieved through slightly reducing the number of employees.

""We are on track for our full-year forecast and are looking forward,"" Peter said. ""We expect that semiconductor supply will be in an issue for us beyond 2021.""

Sales at the company's Automation Solutions' unit, its biggest business, were impacted by about $125 million in the quarter, due to supply and logistical woes, Emerson said, joining other U.S. companies who have flagged a hit from similar issues.

More than 10 fund managers have applied to set up China’s first batch of exchange-traded funds (ETF) tracking the wind power industry since last Friday, according to the country’s securities regulator.
China confirmed to the United Nations last week that it would bring its emissions to a peak before 2030 and cut them to ""net zero"" by 2060 - a pledge President Xi Jinping first made in 2020. 
China also promised to raise total wind and solar power generation capacity to 1,200 gigawatts by 2030 in order to reach its goals. 
The mutual fund houses which have submitted applications include China Asset Management, GF Fund Management, Harvest Fund, the China Securities Regulatory Commission’s (CSRC) website showed.
If permitted, the funds will bring more money into an already red-hot sector. The new energy index has almost doubled in one year as China steps up efforts to become more green.
There are already many ETF products tracking sub-sectors in the new energy industry, such as new energy vehicles and the photovoltaic industry, but the wind power industry ETFs would be the first ones tracking this sub-sector.
The ETFs will be based on the CSI Wind Power Industry Index, which tracks companies from upstream suppliers to downstream constructors and operators. 
That index has surged around 80% since it was launched in April this year, fuelling fears of a bubble. Analysts also said the competition will be fierce if too many homogeneous funds are set up at the same time.

Novo had a breakthrough with its Wegovy drug that helps to achieve weight loss of 17% on average over almost two years.
""The obesity market is now opening up,"" Novo's chief executive Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen told journalists on Wednesday. 
But he said more competition would make more doctors recognise obesity as a disease that can be treated with drugs.
""We would welcome more competitors to actually help establish that market,"" Jorgensen said. 
Novo was the first to introduce on the obesity market GLP-1, a class of drugs, including Wegovy, that imitate an intestinal hormone to stimulate insulin production and lower appetite.
Three pharmacy benefit managers, which serve as intermediaries between drug manufacturers, health insurance plans and pharmacies, have included Wegovy in their reimbursement plans this year, making up roughly 60% of the commercial market, Novo said.
Strong demand after Wegovy's release in June on the U.S. market, with nearly three out of four U.S. adults either overweight or obese, meant patients experienced delays in getting the drug because of production bottlenecks.
The bottlenecks persist, but Novo is gradually ramping up supply, and expects to be able to meet demand in early 2022. 
After last week raising its forecast for sales and operating profit for the full year, Novo on Wednesday reported a net profit of 12.1 billion Danish crowns ($1.88 billion) in the third quarter, an 18% increase compared with a year ago. 
It also said it would expand its share buy-back programme by 2 billion Danish crowns ($311.40 million) to 20 billion crowns.

The filing comes amid a chill in the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) market, due to tightening accounting guidance and regulatory scrutiny from the U.S. Securities And Exchange Commission.
Besides Durant, SPACs have attracted the attention of other celebrities, including rapper Jay-Z, tennis star Serena Williams and National Basketball Association Hall of Famer Shaquille O'Neal.
SPACs are shell firms that use the pool of capital raised through an initial public offering to merge with a private company and take it public.
Infinite Acquisition said it would focus on buying companies in sectors such as sports, health, e-commerce, food and cryptocurrency.
Durant will co-lead the SPAC alongside entrepreneur Rich Kleiman. The duo earlier co-founded venture firm Thirty Five Ventures. Investment and merchant bank LionTree is also a sponsor of the SPAC.
Last month, Durant and Kleiman also backed online ticketing firm SeatGeek's $1.35 billion merger with a blank-check firm.
Infinite Acquisition said it would redeem 100% of the shares for cash if it does not close a merger within 18 months after the offering closes. Typically, such acquisition vehicles have up to 24 months to hunt for a company to take public.

Infinite Acquisition is offering 20 million units at $10 each.  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) is the sole underwriter for the offering.
The units will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""NFNT.U"", the company said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Total U.S. corporate stock buybacks are on track to hit a record for the third quarter as the U.S. economy bounced back from the global pandemic and chief executives became less fearful of spending cash.
S&P 500 companies in recent weeks have disclosed buybacks totaling $145 billion for the third quarter, and the total is likely to surpass $224 billion by the time all reports are in, Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said on Tuesday.
That would be above the $223 billion in buybacks recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018, which was a record, he said.
Share repurchases are seen as supportive for stocks in general. They decrease the number of a company's shares outstanding, boosting per share earnings and driving down the price-to-earnings ratio, a key valuation benchmark.
Still, stock prices have gone up, and that's impacting the number of shares companies can buy back, Silverblatt said. 
The S&P 500, which hit a record high on Tuesday, is up about 23% for the year to date.
Strategists expect companies will continue to spend high levels of cash in 2022, a trend that should help to support stocks.

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) strategists wrote in a recent note that cash balances have surged in the last 12 months, and they are projecting S&P 500 buybacks to grow by 8% in 2022 after 50% growth in 2021.

49,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 03, 2021 07:01AM ET</span>",U.S. Futures Largely Flat; Federal Reserve Meeting Looms Large,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening largely unchanged Wednesday, remaining near record levels ahead of the conclusion of a much-anticipated Federal Reserve meeting.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 40 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 3 points, or 0.1%, lower, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 8 points, or 0.1%.
The three major indices all closed at record levels for the third session in a row on Tuesday, boosted by solid corporate earnings. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average gained almost 140 points, ending 0.4% higher, while the broad-based S&P 500 closed up 0.4% and the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite gained 0.3%.
The U.S. central bank is widely expected to announce the withdrawal of pandemic-era stimulus when it concludes the latest two-day meeting later Wednesday.
Investors will also be listening to what the Fed policy makers say about recent price rises, with inflation at 30-year highs, given that for months they have insisted such increases would be transitory. As such, the 'dot-plot' of policymakers' expectations for future rates will receive particularly scrutiny.
Economic data due for release later Wednesday include the October ADP payrolls number, September factory orders and the October ISM non-manufacturing PMI index.
Corporate earnings continue to flow, with CVS (NYSE:CVS) and Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) having reported before the bell, while MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM), Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) and Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) are due after the close. 
Zillow (NASDAQ:ZG) will also be in focus after the real estate company announced late Tuesday that it was closing its struggling home-flipping business, while Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) announced it was putting off the release of two of its most awaited video games, ‘Overwatch 2’ and ‘Diablo IV’.
Other companies in the spotlight include  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT), after the ride-sharing firm reporting better-than-expected third-quarter results, T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY), with the former meme favorite announcing several strategic changes to help growth.
Crude prices fell Wednesday after an industry report pointed to a sharp rise in oil inventories in the U.S., the largest consumer in the world, and as pressure grows on OPEC+ to increase supply.
Data from the American Petroleum Institute showed U.S. crude stocks rose by 3.6 million barrels for the week ended Oct. 29, turning the attention on to the official numbers from the U.S. Energy Information Administration at 10:30 AM ET.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies including Russia, a group called OPEC+, meets on Thursday to discuss overall production levels. 
OPEC+ is expected to confirm plans for small monthly increases even after U.S. President Joe Biden, speaking at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, put the blame for the recent surge in oil and gas prices on the group’s refusal to produce more crude.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 2.4% lower at $81.92 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 2.1% to $82.94. 
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,784.55/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1583.

""The demand is there,"" the source said, adding that the industry cannot keep up with supply due to delays in the production of car parts that require semiconductors.

In the past few months, carmakers had to stop production lines due to lagging chip supplies and mostly installed the scarce parts in high-margin larger vehicles, which pushed many customers to buy used cars instead of waiting for a new one. 
New registrations had already shrunk by double-digit percentages in the past few months, but not as sharply as in October.

Investing.com – Activision Blizzard stock (NASDAQ:ATVI) plunged more than 12% in Wednesday’s premarket trading as the video games publisher put off the release of two of its most awaited titles.
The company did not give a timeline for the release of ‘Overwatch 2’ and ‘Diablo IV’, which investors had hoped would revive the fortunes of a company that has been rocked by cases of sexual misconduct.
Also weighing on the stock was the departure of co-leader Jen Oneal and a quarterly outlook that fell short of expectations.
Oneal’s exit, which leaves Mike Ybarra as the studio’s sole chief, follows the firing of more than 20 employees over the last few months, according to a company statement. The two had jointly taken over after former President J. Allen Brack was forced out in the wake of a lawsuit in California alleging discrimination against women.
The company behind the ‘Candy Crush’ and 'Call of Duty' franchises has created an $18 million fund to compensate victims of inappropriate behavior, it said in a statement.
It expects adjusted revenue of $2.78 billion in the current quarter, short of analysts’ estimates.
Activision's total monthly active users fell to 390 million by the end of the quarter from 408 million at end-June and was unchanged from same time last year, a sign the pandemic-driven binge may be cooling off.
Adjusted sales in the third quarter were $1.88 billion and matched estimates while adjusted profit per share of 89 cents surpassed forecasts.

(Reuters) - Agricultural seeds and chemicals supplier  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) is expanding its carbon farming program to members of U.S. farm cooperative CHS Inc, boosting incentives for members to participate in the program, the companies said on Wednesday.
The agreement will make it easier for CHS's 75,000 farmer-members to enroll in Bayer (OTC:BAYRY)'s Carbon Program, an early leader in the drive to encourage farmers to capture carbon by planting off-season crops, tilling the ground less and use fertilizer more efficiently. 
It also expands the program from 17 states to 21, the companies said.
The Bayer Carbon Program pays growers up to $9 an acre for planting cover crops and reducing soil tillage. Farmers in the program log their practices on digital platforms to generate a carbon credit. 
Agricultural companies use the credits to offset the climate impact of other parts of their businesses or sell them to companies looking to reduce their own carbon footprints.
It is the latest collaboration between large agricultural firms racing to sign up acres for carbon sequestration, or trapping atmosphere warming carbon underground, and environmental credit trading programs.

Some farmers have embraced the carbon programs as a welcome new stream of revenue and a potentially powerful tool to combat climate change. Others have voiced suspicion that companies will collect farming data that will be used to sell them more products.
CHS will pay its members an additional $3 an acre for enrolling in Bayer's program and purchasing certain products such as ""enhanced-efficiency fertilizers."" Payments will be distributed in the fourth quarter of 2022, CHS said.

LONDON (Reuters) -  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) Plc named insider Duncan Wanblad as its new chief executive officer on Wednesday, in a widely expected move that will see current boss Mark Cutifani, who led the miner for nearly a decade, leave in April.
Wanblad, a 54 year old South African, emerged as one of the leading internal candidates to succeed Cutifani in 2019, when he was named as group director of strategy and business development after having held the dual role of base metals business leader and business development director since 2013. 
Analysts at J.P.Morgan said they do not expect any significant strategic shifts under Wanblad, who will likely evolve the roadmap set up by Cutifani or similar.
Wanblad will have to deliver on his predecessor's promise to make Anglo American carbon neutral by 2040.
The mining sector has come under pressure from environmental activists and shareholders demanding that it cut emissions while producing metals that are vital to a lower-carbon economy.
Other major London-listed miners including Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) and Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) have recently undergone a leadership change that will see the pay of new bosses linked to tightening environmental, social and governance standards.
Cutifani will retire at the company's annual general meeting, scheduled for April 19, 2022, and Wanblad will take over the reins from the 63-year old on the same date, Anglo American said. 
Cutifani has won plaudits for his stewardship since taking the helm in 2013. He resisted investor calls to sell nearly half of its assets to reduce a heavy debtload after the 2015-16 commodity price slump weighed heavily on the stock, which paid off for him when metal prices started to rise again.
Shares in the FTSE 100-listed miner have gained more than 66% in value since Cutifani took over in April 2013. They were up nearly 3% on Wednesday, in line with the wider mining index.
The company has spent more than two years searching for Cutifani's successor.
""Having started my career underground as a junior engineer, I have never lost sight of what it takes to produce the metals and minerals that are ever more vital to support our life on this planet,"" Wanblad said in a statement.
Anglo, owner of diamond producer De Beers, mines millions of tonnes of copper, platinum, nickel and iron ore each year.
Analysts are expecting to hear more about strategy at an investor day in December.
Wanblad's basic salary will be 1.3 million pounds ($1.77 million) per annum plus variable incentives including a bonus of up to 210%, Anglo said.

56,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2021 06:02AM ET</span>",Online fashion retailer Zalando braced for supply squeeze,"By Emma Thomasson
BERLIN (Reuters) -German online fashion retailer Zalando reported a slump in quarterly profit on Wednesday after it cut prices to keep customers shopping online as stores reopened, but said it was well positioned to cope with a supply crunch.
With many fashion brands hit by the closure of Asian factories due to coronavirus lockdowns, finance chief David Schroeder said Zalando was well stocked for the next few months, with inventories up 41% compared to last year.
However, Schroeder said the company could see delays to deliveries of items for next spring/summer, not just for sneakers, with the sportswear industry particularly hurt by factory closures in Vietnam.
""Would we want to have even more stock, especially in the sneaker category? Yes,"" Schroeder said. ""But thanks to our platform model, we think we will find better answers to these challenges than many of our competitors in the industry.""
Zalando shares were down 2.3% at 0935 GMT.
Founded in Berlin in 2008, Zalando has grown rapidly to become Europe's biggest fashion e-commerce player, selling clothes, shoes and cosmetics from 4,500 leading brands in 23 countries on its platform.
""The inventory position is reassuring ahead of peak (season),""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts wrote in a note.
British rival ASOS (LON:ASOS), which sells far more of its own-label goods than Zalando, warned last month that supply chain pressures and consumers returning to pre-pandemic behaviour could reduce 2022 profit by over 40%.
Zalando said there was a ""fierce promotional environment"" in many European markets as reopened stores offered deals to shift stock, adding that unusually warm weather in September had increased sales of discounted spring/summer fashion.
However, as temperatures dropped in October, it saw demand recover for full-priced fall/winter wear. 
""We are off to a very good start to Q4,"" Schroeder said.
Third-quarter adjusted operating profit fell to 9.8 million euros ($11.35 million) from 118 million a year ago, while sales rose 23% to 2.3 billion euros, slightly ahead of analysts' average estimate of 2.24 billion.
British clothing retailer Next beat forecasts on Wednesday with a 17% rise in third-quarter full-price sales compared with 2019.
Zalando said its operating profit was in line with the number it posted in the third quarter of 2019, before the pandemic helped the company post exceptional results.
Zalando spent more on marketing on the period, also due to its recent launch in six new markets in eastern Europe.
Zalando reiterated it expects full-year sales to grow 26%-31% to 10.1 billion-10.5 billion euros and forecast adjusted earnings before interest and taxation to reach the upper half of its guided 400 million-475 million euros range.

It also reiterated a target for gross merchandise volume (GMV) - sales on its site made by the company or its partners - to exceed 30 billion euros by 2025, almost triple the 10.7 billion euros in 2020.

The deal marks a further step in efforts by the Italian-American vehicle maker to bolster its agricultural businesses, while preparing to spin-off its lower-margin truck, bus and engine operations.
CNH Industrial, which already owns a minority stake in Silicon Valley-based Monarch Tractor, said in a statement that electrification and machine automation were key elements of its strategy to become an even stronger technology leader in agriculture.
""We are confident that the new pathways provided by Monarch will rapidly strengthen our competitive position in sustainable precision farming,"" Chief Executive Scott Wine said.
No financial details of the agreement were provided.
Earlier this year CNH Industrial - the world's second largest agricultural equipment maker after John Deere (NYSE:DE), operating under the New Holland, Case IH and Steyr brands - struck a $2.1 billion deal to buy Raven (NASDAQ:RAVN) Industries to bolster its precision agriculture and autonomy operations.
The agreement is based on the launch of a scalable, modular electrification platform for low horsepower tractors, that will be developed across multiple product families in the coming years, CNH Industrial said in a statement.
""This agreement also furthers CNH Industrial's ongoing commitment to decarbonizing agriculture through alternative propulsion systems,"" it said.
""This partnership allows CNH Industrial to enhance its electrification capabilities and to develop new electric platforms more quickly,"" Equita analyst Martino De Ambroggi said in a note, adding more details on the scope of the agreement and electrification strategy were expected.

CNH Industrial will complete early next year a plan to spin off and separately list under the Iveco Group name its truck and bus units along with its FPT engine division.
After the spin-off CNH, which is controlled by Exor (OTC:EXXRF), the holding company of Italy's Agnelli family, will retain its construction equipment business.

Investing.com – Zillow stock (NASDAQ:ZG) plunged 17% in Wednesday’s premarket to a 16-month low, after the company decided to shutter its struggling home-flipping business.
The decision comes after the home-flipping operations, Zillow Offers, left a hole of around $381 million in the company’s third-quarter earnings. Zillow made a total net loss of $328 million in July-September, against a profit of $40 million in the same period last year.
Zillow Offers is a service to homeowners to sell without having to coordinate repairs or host open houses or showings. After buying a home, Zillow prepares it for sale by doing the same type of projects a typical seller would, then lists it on the open market.
The business suffered as Zillow tweaked its algorithms to grab share in a hot property market, overpaying for houses just when the prices were beginning to cool off. Having overpaid for houses earlier this year, it wrote down $304 million in its third-quarter accounts and expects another $265 million in writedowns in the current quarter, due to its misjudgments.
A further consequence of Zillow Offers being closed down will be a reduction of around 25% in the group's headcount.
Last month, the company suspended new home purchases to focus on clearing the backlog of already-signed contracts. The company had then blamed an ongoing labor shortage and other supply issues for its move.
Total revenue in the third quarter jumped 164% to $1.73 billion, driven by increased purchase and higher volumes in the refinance loan origination business and growth in the mortgage marketplace."

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's Unicaja on Wednesday said its recurrent net profit rose 53% year-on-year in the third quarter due to lower provisions and a boost from fees as it integrates Liberbank.
Net profit without accounting gains at the country's fifth biggest lender by assets reached 54 million euros ($62.5 million) in the July to September period.
Lower lending income however took it below the 63 million-euro forecast from analysts polled by Reuters.
Unicaja reported pro forma figures for the quarter and the same quarter a year ago, allowing the year-on-year comparison to take account of its acquisition of smaller lender Liberbank, which closed at the end of July.
Third quarter 2020 profit was 35 million euros.
Shares in Unicaja fell 2.6% to 0.9175 euros following a more than 20% rise in the last three months.
On an accumulated nine-months basis, Unicaja reported a badwill gain - a paper profit made when an asset is bought below its book value - of 1.301 billion euros. Including this gain, net profit rose to 1.395 billion euros.
The accounting gain was generated from Liberbank's equity of 3.125 billion euros minus fair value adjustments of 994 million euros, leaving an adjusted book value of 2.131 billion euros compared with a purchase price of 830 million euros.
Net interest income (NII), or earnings on loans minus deposit costs, fell 11.2% in the third quarter versus a year ago to 251 million euros, pressured by ultra low interest rates. It was down 5.7% compared to previous quarter, in line with forecasts from analysts polled by Reuters.
Pressure on lending income has driven lenders to seek other growth areas, such as fees, which rose 21% year-on-year in the quarter.
On Wednesday, Unicaja revised up its cost-savings from the acquisition to 210 million euros from initially 192 million euros per year by 2023.

As of end-September, Unicaja's total cost of risk, which is an indicator of potential future losses, fell to 41 basis points from 58 bps in the previous quarter. It aimed for a cost of risk of around 20 basis points for 2023.

SHANGHAI/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Third-quarter earnings from China's property sector and ancillary industries show that Beijing's crackdown on rampant borrowing is inflicting pain far beyond just the embattled China Evergrande Group and could force the authorities to ease policy.
Evergrande's long-drawn debt crisis has not spilled into China's broader financial markets as feared, but the worsening health of China's $5 trillion property sector is testing Beijing's resolve to press on with painful structural reforms. 
""Evergrande is not too big to fail, but the sector is,"" said Ronald Chan, Hong Kong-based Asia head of equities at Manulife Investment Management.
""Any consequent, potential impact on property prices in China will be detrimental."" 
Seven of the top 10 China-listed developers by revenue, including China Vanke Co and Greenland Holdings Corp, posted sharp falls in net profit during the July-September period, according to their quarterly reports.
Greenland's earnings dropped 27% while Vanke's profit fell 23% compared with a year earlier. Risesun Real Estate Development's profit tumbled 61%.
The list doesn't include Hong Kong-listed Chinese developers including Evergrande, Country Garden Holdings, or Guangzhou R&F Properties, which don't need to disclose third-quarter results under local rules. 
A separate list of 20 major China-listed developers tracked by Citic Securities, which includes firms such as Gemdale Corp and Yango Group paints a picture of lower margins, shrinking cash piles, and rising balance sheet risks.
The slowdown in the property market following tough measures this year to cool a frothy market, including lending curbs, property price caps and land sales restrictions, is hitting other parts of the economy.
Reflecting the collateral damage, China-listed makers of construction materials including cement, glass and home furnishing, recorded a 7% fall in third-quarter profit on average, according to Changjiang Securities.
Suzhou Gold Mantis Construction Decoration Co, a major building decoration engineering firm, reported a 52.6% drop in net profit while sales tumbled 31%. The company, which counts Evergrande as a client, said it is actively pursuing the 4.3 billion yuan ($672 million) in receivables owed by the heavily-indebted developer.
Property market woes ""impact the real economy more than the financial markets, where prices were quickly adjusted to prevent wider contagion,"" said Wei Yao, chief economist for APAC & China at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) Corporate and Investment Banking.
""What we're seeing is more like a slow motion correction, rather than a fast-moving crisis,"" which will potentially lead to a deeper, and longer slowdown in China, barring stimulus, she said.
China's financial regulators have already asked banks not to overreact in implementing property lending curbs, after the world's second-largest economy grew just 4.9% in the third quarter, the slowest pace in a year. 
The People's Bank of China has resorted to targeted easing, keeping cash conditions just comfortable and rates steady since cutting them at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. 
Some economists say more policy support is warranted.
Ren Zeping, economist at Soochow Securities, urged the government this week to ""lend its hand"" as the economy loses steam amid the property market stagnation, credit tightening and rising raw material costs. 

Societe Generale's Yao said China should further lower financing costs this year - through cuts to the amount of cash banks must keep as reserve and benchmark lending rates - to prevent economic growth from falling below the critical 4% pace in 2022.
""Chinese policymakers are willing to tolerate deeper slowdown"" to move forward with structural reforms, she said. ""But it's a delicate balance. If you don't lend your hand in a timely manner, it could be too late to rescue the economy.""

Citing rising costs and supply chain instability caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the company on Wednesday said it now expected its operating profit margin to be 4% from 5-7% previously - a far cry from its long-term target of a 10% margin.
""The prices are something I don't think anyone has experienced previously and it's a very, very tough environment,"" Chief Financial Officer Marika Fredriksson told Reuters. 
""I think it's likely it's going to continue into next year and I don't see the trend changing,"" she said, adding that the company has not yet cancelled any projects but there had been several delays.
The global supply disruptions are not the only challenge faced by companies in the industry, operators of wind farms are also grappling with weaker winds.
Compatriot Orsted (OTC:DOGEF), the world's largest developer of offshore wind farms, said on Wednesday low wind speeds continued to hit its earnings, showing that despite strong fundamentals, renewables are still an intermittent technology where swings in the level of winds and sunshine have a direct impact on earnings.
Vestas on Wednesday also announced that Fredriksson will be stepping down as CFO being the last of a Swedish trio - along with former CEO Anders Runevad and chairman Bert Nordberg - that has turned Vestas around and cut costs to lift the company's operating margin to industry-leading levels.
Hans Martin Smith, currently finance chief of Vestas' Northern and Central European business, will take over by next March.
Operating profit before special items fell 21% to 325 million euros ($376 million) in the quarter, missing the 381 million euros forecast by 16 analysts in a poll compiled by the company.
Its shares, which were already down some 33% so far this year, had fallen 10% by 0820 GMT.

""With unclear/less favourable onshore demand outlook, rising Chinese competition threat in onshore and input cost headwinds lasting longer, we believe it is still very early to be positive on the company,"" JP Morgan analysts said in a research note.

""For a lot of the markets that we need to reach both in range but also in capacity, it's a great product,"" he told reporters of the potential freighter. ""Would we be the launch customer? I don't know. We'll see.""
Chareonwongsak cited reports that China's JD (NASDAQ:JD) Logistics Inc plans to have a fleet of 100 freighters by 2030 as an example of the scale that AirAsia could seek in its cargo business as it focuses on growth in e-commerce.
""We think that Southeast Asia, if we focus on this market, can absorb that level of capacity,"" he said. 
Industry website Leeham News in August reported Airbus was in talks with customers about a freighter version of the A321neo.
An Airbus spokesperson said on Wednesday that it was always looking to advance its products and was in constant dialogue with its customers listening to their requirements.
""There are many studies and not all see the light of day,"" the spokesperson said. ""Details of discussions with our customers remain confidential.""
Airbus in July announced plans for a freighter version of its A350 widebody jet, in a challenge to Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's longstanding dominance of the market for dedicated cargo planes.. Boeing is also expected to launch a freight version of its 777X big jet soon, with Qatar Airways and FedEx (NYSE:FDX) seen as potential launch customers, market sources say.
In the narrowbody market, older versions of the A321 and 737 passenger planes are being converted into freighters but there is no new-build freighter plane on offer.
DEMAND DILEMMA
Airbus has looked at the possibility of offering new A320-family freighters in the past. In 2007, for example, Belgian express carrier TNT talked to Airbus about launching such a programme with a large order, Flightglobal reported at the time.
But since then demand for the passenger version of the A320 family has soared and Airbus faces little or no pressure to win freighter sales to add volume, industry sources cautioned. It is debating instead how to manage existing production demands.
Any new product would also have to overcome the hurdle of justifying a $2 billion or so investment with fresh demand, without simply displacing existing orders for jetliners.
""It is better to facilitate the passenger-to-freight conversion market,"" one industry source said.
The coronavirus crisis has nonetheless shed light on opportunities for narrow-body freight traffic as airlines shipped goods using passengers jets as temporary freighters. 
Teleport on Wednesday launched its first 737-800 freighter to be based in Bangkok. It plans to grow the fleet to six planes by 2023, Teleport Chief Operating Officer Adrian Loretz said.
Teleport is in talks with investors to raise $50 million to $100 million by the end of the year and would look to list as a separate company in three years, Chareonwongsak said.

The division, which also carries cargo in the belly of AirAsia passenger planes and has a food and parcel delivery business, is aiming for $1 billion of annual revenue within three years, he added.

Sales at the world's largest jewellery maker by production capacity in the United States, where it has around 570 shops, rose 59% in the third quarter compared with the same period in 2019.
""It's no secret that this is very much propelled by the stimulus check,"" CEO Alexander Lacik said.
""We had expected sales to cool off when stimulus checks stopped in September. So far we haven't seen that cooling off,"" he said, adding that credit card data shows Pandora is taking market share in the United States.
It remains to be seen when the growth will begin to abate, he said.

""So far it looks very strong,"" Lacik said.

LONDON (Reuters) -British clothing retailer Next beat guidance with a 17% rise in third-quarter full-price sales compared to 2019, before the pandemic disrupted trading, but maintained its full-year profit guidance as it expects sales growth to slow.
The lack of profit upgrade after four already this year sent Next's shares down 3.1% by 0837 GMT on Wednesday, paring year-on-year gains to 41%. The stock hit a record high in September.
Next, which trades from about 500 stores and online, said the impact of pandemic pent-up demand was likely to continue to diminish.
It said stock availability had improved since September but remained ""challenging"", with delays in its international supply chain being compounded by labour shortages in the UK transport and warehousing networks.
Next said that to date stock limitations had been offset by strong underlying demand.
""Although consumer finances are in good shape, price increases in essential goods (such as fuel) may moderate demand for more discretionary purchases,"" it added.
Next had reported in September that full-price sales in the first eight weeks of its fiscal third quarter had risen 20%.
It said on Wednesday they had risen 14% in the final five weeks of the period to Oct. 30. This was ahead of its forecast of 10% growth.
Third-quarter online sales rose 40%, while store sales in the United Kingdom and Ireland were down 6.1%. 
However, Next kept its forecast for full-price sales in the fourth quarter to rise 10% versus 2019-20 and for a full-year pretax profit of 800 million pounds ($1.1 billion), up 6.9% compared to 2019-20.
""We do not expect sales to continue at the level seen in Q3,"" it said.
Next has proved a resilient performer during the pandemic, benefiting from its long-established online operations.
Rivals with weaker or no online business, notably Primark, saw large falls in sales. Others, such as Topshop-owner Arcadia, and Debenhams went bust.

""Next ... increasingly looks like one of the high street’s winners, adapting better than most to changes in consumers’ shopping habits,"" said Zoe Gillespie, investment manager at Brewin Dolphin (OTC:BDNHF).
Separately on Wednesday German online fashion retailer Zalando reported a slump in quarterly profit as it offered discounts to try to keep customers shopping online.

Investing.com - European stock markets edged lower Wednesday in cautious trading ahead of a much-anticipated Federal Reserve meeting, which could see the start of the winding down of pandemic-era monetary stimulus in the world's largest economy.
At 3:45 AM ET (0845 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% lower, the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.2%, while the CAC 40 in France fell 0.1%. 
The U.S. central bank concludes its two-day policy-setting meeting later Wednesday, and is widely expected to start reining in its $120 million monthly bond-buying program, put in place at the start of the pandemic.
The bigger variable is to what degree Chairman Jerome Powell changes his language on the outlook for inflation which is running at a 30-year high. Admissions that the current spike is set to last for longer than at first thought will likely be taken as a coded warning of earlier interest rate increases.
Back in Europe, Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) stock rose 4.5% after the German airline posted a return to operating profit in the third quarter for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic as restrictions on transatlantic flying were lifted. The airline said it expects to stay profitable at the operating level in the current quarter.
BMW (DE:BMWG) stock climbed 0.9% after the German auto giant reported a sharp rise in third-quarter net profit, as higher prices and strong electric vehicle sales offset lower overall deliveries.
On the flip side, Vestas Wind Systems (OTC:VWDRY) stock slumped over 10% after the Danish wind turbine maker cut its operating margin forecasts citing input cost pressures.  Orsted (OTC:DOGEF), the continent's biggest operator of wind farms, also fell 1.0% after operational numbers that reflected the dramatic drop in wind power output in the third quarter.
German online fashion retailer Zalando (DE:ZALG) stock fell 2.2% as its third-quarter profit fell, while  Next  (LON:NXT) stock fell 3.2% after the British clothing retailer maintained its full-year profit guidance despite a jump in third-quarter sales. It expects sales growth to slow in the coming months.
In economic news, the main release Wednesday will be the September unemployment rate for the Eurozone, while British house prices rose in October at a faster rate than expected as robust demand, according to a survey by mortgage lender Nationwide.
Crude prices fell Wednesday after an industry report pointed to a sharp rise in oil inventories in the U.S., the largest consumer in the world, and as pressure grows on OPEC+ to increase supply.
The American Petroleum Institute released data late Tuesday which showed U.S. crude stocks rose by 3.6 million barrels for the week ended Oct. 29, more than the 1.5 million barrels that had been expected. The U.S. Energy Information Administration releases its data at 10:30 AM ET.
By 3:45 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 2% lower at $82.23 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 1.8% to $83.19. 
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,783.50/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher to 1.1587.

The company added it was on course for its best annual results in its 51-year history and, given its order books, it expects fourth quarter profitability to be even higher than in the third quarter.

It said positive factors, such as rising global demand for stainless steel and special alloys and higher prices, had more than offset cost increases, most notably for energy in Europe.

Quilter set a new dividend policy with a target pay-out range of 50% to 70% of post-tax, post-interest adjusted profits, up from a previous 40% to 60% of post-tax adjusted profits, it said in a statement.
The fund manager, which became a standalone company after the break-up of Anglo-South African financial services firm Old Mutual in 2018, expects the previously announced 480 million pound sale of Quilter International to Utmost to complete by the end of the year.
This would leave the firm with around 440 million pounds after costs, it said ahead of an investor day.
In addition to the shareholder payout, Quilter plans to spend 90 million pounds on a simplification programme to cut costs and invest in growth areas such as a ""hybrid"" advice offering and more digitalisation.
“We now look forward to executing the next stage of Quilter’s strategic journey, which will be characterised by a focus on growth and efficiency,"" CEO Paul Feeney said.

69,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2021 04:05AM ET</span>",Marketmind: Judgement Day for the Fed,"A look at the day ahead from Saikat Chatterjee. 
One of the most anticipated market events of the year is here.
The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected on Wednesday to detail plans to end its pandemic-era bond purchases by mid-2022 with a $15 billion per month ""taper"" broadly priced in. 
What will be more decisive for traders is whether Chair Jerome Powell sticks to the view of transitional inflation based on one-time effects such as supply chains shortages or signals that these factors will have a more persistent and sustainable effect on inflation. 
If he leans towards the latter, money markets which are already pricing in an astonishing 80 basis points of rate hikes by the end-2022, would get a further boost. That would increase pressure on policymakers to advance their projection for a first rate increase from 2023. 
But even if the Fed manages to strike a delicate balancing act, the greenback is likely to hold on to a sizeable chunk of 2021's near 4.5% gain for another year, according to a Reuters poll. That's because of a widening rate differentials versus its rivals. 
Equity markets, which have been largely impervious to the fireworks in bond markets in recent weeks, could take a tumble meanwhile if yields resume their rise again. 
Ahead of the Fed decision, U.S. stock futures are drifting lower and European stock futures are consolidating gains. Risk appetite is slightly on the back foot as new locally transmitted COVID-19 cases in China spiked to a near three-month high and Premier Li Keqiang warned of downward pressure on the economy. 
Benchmark yields on 10-year U.S. debt is holding well below last week’s highs while stock and currency market volatility, though slightly higher, remain pinned near 2021 lows. 
Elsewhere, oil prices fell as industry data pointed to a big build up in U.S. oil stocks and pressure mounted on oil producing group OPEC to increase supply. 
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Wednesday: 
- Central bank speaker corner: Lagarde, Centeno, Villeroy
-  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) to tighten the reins after string of scandals

""In most of Q3, we continued to see lower than normal wind speeds, which had an adverse impact on earnings from renewable assets in operation,"" Orsted said in its earnings report.
It said the negative impact from lower wind speeds amounted to around 2.5 billion crowns ($389.40 million) for the first nine months of the year compared with the same period last year and 1.7 billion crowns compared with a normal wind year. 
This shows that despite strong fundamentals, renewables continue to be an intermittent technology where swings in the level of winds and sunshine have a direct impact on earnings.
Orsted reported earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) at 2.98 billion Danish crowns ($463.99 million), 11% lower than last year and below the 3.07 billion crowns expected by analysts in a poll compiled by the company.
The weak wind power generation was partly offset by good performance at its combined heat and power plants boosted by higher power prices, which have hit record highs around the world as economies began to recover from the coronavirus crisis.

Orsted still expects EBITDA this year of 15 billion-16 billion crowns, excluding divestments, and repeated it would likely hit only the lower end of its forecast core profit range in 2021.

ZURICH (Reuters) -Geberit is seeing ""significant challenges on the raw materials markets,"" the Swiss building supplies company said on Wednesday, as higher costs weighed on profit growth during the third quarter.
The maker of piping and bathroom ceramics became the latest construction company to warn about higher expenses as the sector sees a resurgence in building activity after the pandemic shutdown last year. 
Suppliers making stuttering restarts to production and bunged up logistics networks have also raised the costs for companies like cement maker  Holcim  (SIX:HOLN), while energy prices are ticking upwards too.
Geberit said its bill for raw materials surged 15.6% during the three months to the end of September, curbing operating profit growth.
Sales rose 7.6 % to 854.8 million Swiss francs ($935.5 million) but operating profit rose by a much slower 1.5% to 230.7 million francs.
Raw materials are set to remain a challenge, with Geberit expecting prices to rise by around 3% in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter.
The company, whose results are seen as a proxy for the wider construction industry, uses metals like aluminium and zinc, plastics and ceramics in its products, which are used in new-build and refurbishment projects.
After a strong first half, Geberit said it was seeing growth trends slow down, as flattering comparisons with pandemic-hit 2020 figures faded.
It was also seeing a normalisation in stock levels at wholesalers, who had previously driven high demand by building up their inventories, and the first sign of a slowdown in the home improvements trend.
Still, Geberit said its third-quarter sales were 17.4% higher than the pre-coronavirus third quarter of 2019. It upgraded its profit guidance, sending the shares 1.9% higher in premarket activity.
The company now expects full-year net sales in local currencies to increase between 12% and 14%, roughly in line with its previous guidance.

It also expects an EBITDA (core profit) margin of 30% to 31%, slightly higher than its previous guidance for the upper end of its medium-term target range of 28% to 30%.

However, a disproportionate rise in sales of lower-margin products related to COVID-19 during and after the second and third pandemic waves left transactional gross margin behind sales growth year-on-year, the company said.

76,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2021 02:35AM ET</span>",Credit Suisse to tighten the reins after string of scandals,"By Oliver Hirt, Pamela Barbaglia and John O'Donnell
ZURICH/FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) will unveil a new centralised structure on Thursday in an attempt to bring its far-flung divisions to heel and draw a line under a string of scandals that have cost the Swiss bank billions of dollars, two sources said.
Over the past year, Credit Suisse has been fined for arranging a fraudulent loan to Mozambique, tarnished by its involvement with defunct financier Greensill, racked up $5.5 billion in losses when U.S. family office Archegos collapsed, and been rebuked by regulators for spying on executives.
Credit Suisse drafted in seasoned banker Antonio Horta-Osorio as chairman in April to stop the rot and he will lay out his charter to reform Switzerland's second-biggest bank on Thursday when it presents third-quarter results.
One key change is expected to be the creation of a single wealth management division that caters to a global elite, centralising oversight at the bank's headquarters in Zurich, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Under the current structure put in place six years ago, wealth management straddles three divisions: a Swiss business, an Asia-Pacific arm catering mainly to rich Chinese and an international arm based out of Switzerland.
Merging the wealth division would make Credit Suisse simpler and potentially pave the way for cost cuts.
It would also rein in local bankers who have enjoyed much autonomy, making them more answerable to senior managers who have often been blindsided by the risks that triggered past scandals, the sources said.
One of the people told Reuters that managers at the bank's headquarters had become very risk averse and they did not want to give leeway to local bankers, regardless of how much profit they were making.
A spokesman for Credit Suisse declined to comment. 
SHARES SUFFER
Credit Suisse's financial humiliation stands in stark contrast to its cross-town rival UBS. 
In the wake of massive losses and a bailout during the financial crisis, UBS successfully pivoted away from investment banking to wealth management and is now the world's largest wealth manager with $3.2 trillion in invested assets.
Its shares have climbed 57% in the past 10 years while Credit Suisse has slumped 53% over the same period. 
Shareholders have deserted Credit Suisse this year following the slew of bad headlines. Its shares are down 12% while UBS is up 36% while Wall Street rivals are riding high on the back of a boom in equity trading and M&A. 
Andreas Venditti, an analyst at Swiss private bank Vontobel, said it would take more than ""minor changes and a new divisional set-up"" at Credit Suisse to reverse the trend.
The expected revamp at Credit Suisse has also encouraged some high-profile dealmakers to approach the bank's senior management to suggest it merges with a rival, another person with knowledge of the matter said.
Those ideas have been rejected so far, however, the person said. 
Nonetheless, the prospect of a challenge by investors demanding the break-up of the bank, or that its shrinking market value makes it a target for a hostile foreign takeover, have long troubled managers, sources told Reuters earlier this year.
'WARNING SIGNALS'
With a market value of $28 billion, Credit Suisse is worth less than half of UBS and a fraction of Wall Street giants such as JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) weighing in at half a trillion dollars.
But an approach from the United States would not go down well in Switzerland. Relations between Swiss banks and Washington were damaged when the United States pressured them into giving up their strict secrecy code more than a decade ago.
A combination of Credit Suisse and UBS, which has been touted as an alternative alliance, would face its own problems. For one, it would dominate the Swiss market.
Another source said that while Credit Suisse had examined a sale or spin-off of its asset management business, that had been shelved. The person said, however, that once further efforts were made to cut costs and boost growth, a sale, or listing of the business on the market, could be back on the cards.
The bank's drive to centralise its operations is drawing on lessons from some of its recent failures, including Archegos.
Earlier this year, Credit Suisse published a report blaming a focus on maximizing short-term profits and enabling ""voracious risk-taking"" by Archegos for failing to steer the bank away from catastrophe. 
Despite long-running discussions about Archegos - by far the bank's largest hedge fund client - Credit Suisse's top management were apparently unaware of the risks it was taking.
The bank's chief risk officer and the head of its investment bank recall hearing about it first only on the eve of the fund's collapse.

""There were numerous warning signals,"" the report said. ""Yet the business ... failed to heed these signs.""

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) is expanding its green strategy by investing in an EU-backed fund to jointly back technology firms in the field of energy transformation.
The carmaker, which has committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2050, said on Wednesday it had entered a strategic partnership with EIT InnoEnergy and will become a shareholder in the EU-backed venture.
The move is in line with other steps by Volkswagen, which in September unveiled plans to set up its own 300 million euro ($348 million) venture capital fund to invest in decarbonisation projects and start-ups in the field.
""The idea is simply ... to use InnoEnergy as an additional way to find interesting enterprises and support them in scaling up their business models,"" said Jens Wiese, Volkswagen's head of group M&A, investment advisory and partnerships.
VW aims to become the world's largest seller of electric vehicles by the middle of the decade and has outlined plans to build six large battery cell factories with partners in Europe by the end of the decade.
EIT InnoEnergy has already invested 560 million euros ($650 million) and holds stakes in about 300 groups, including Swedish battery cell maker Northvolt, steel venture H2 Green Steel, and lithium miner Vulcan Energy Resources.
Supported by the EU's European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), EIT InnoEnergy funds start-ups and companies that are active in the energy transition towards decarbonisation and away from fossil fuels.
Volkswagen did not disclose the value of the investment or the size of the stake in EIT InnoEnergy, whose owners also include Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN), TotalEnergies, Engie and EDF (PA:EDF).

Volkswagen holds a fifth of Northvolt and, via its trucks unit Scania, has also invested in H2 Green Steel, whose backers include Mercedes-Benz, Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) founder Daniel Ek, and Northvolt co-founder Vargas Holding.

ROME (Reuters) -The extension of the deadline to return Italy's Monte dei Paschi (MPS) to private hands will be ""sufficiently long"" to ensure the bank can relaunch and attract new investors, a senior Treasury official said on Tuesday.
Italy's Treasury Director General Alessandro Rivera told a parliamentary hearing that Rome would eventually offload its stake in the bank it rescued in 2017.
Italy is in talks with the European Union over the deadline for the reprivatisation of MPS.
""Keeping it in state hands indefinitely is not an option,"" Rivera said, adding that failed negotiations over a potential merger with UniCredit had shown the EU that it is not possible currently to clinch a deal meeting the required legal and economic conditions.
Rivera did not clarify how long an extension Italy will seek. A source with knowledge of the matter has told Reuters that Rome wants to push back the deadline by years.
""We believe it's necessary to discuss an adequate extension. With adequate I mean a sufficiently long time span to implement further measures to strengthen the bank and improve its profit outlook,"" Rivera said.
After the collapse of the proposed UniCredit deal https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/exclusive-italy-unicredit-set-call-off-talks-over-monte-dei-paschi-sources-2021-10-23, Italy is preparing to see through some of the measures it had devised to smoothe the way for the sale. It plans to rid MPS of its residual problem loans as well as any non-ordinary legal risks, while also bolstering its capital, sources have told Reuters.
Rivera said the Treasury is ready to do its part to help MPS in its capital-raising efforts, indicating that Italy would buy into a new share issue to keep its current 64% stake.
In doing so, Italy intends to avoid inflicting losses on the bank's investors, in particular its junior bondholders, Rivera said, confirming what sources told Reuters last month.
The bank's junior debt has been dogged by concerns that its holders would have to incur losses under EU state aid rules before Italy could help with the bank's capital shortfall, but Rivera said that the new funds Rome is preparing to inject into MPS would not constitute state aid.
The size of the cash call will be set as part of discussions with European authorities on measures the bank must adopt after falling behind on restructuring commitments.

As a consequence, MPS will need to update the business plan management had readied to demonstrate its prospects through to 2025, Rivera said, adding that this is needed for both the European Commission, the European Central Bank and for the investment market.
""The ministry will do its part but it is paramount the plan is attractive for other investors,"" he said.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - An Apple employee who was fired https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-worker-says-she-was-fired-after-leading-movement-against-harassment-2021-10-15 last month after leading fellow workers in publicly sharing instances of what they called harassment and discrimination has filed a charge with the U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).
In documents related to the charge that were viewed by Reuters, former Apple program manager Janneke Parrish alleged that Apple fired her to stymie her efforts to organize fellow workers. 
""Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). terminated Parrish's employment based upon false and pretextual reasons and in fact terminated her employment in (an) attempt to nip-in-the-bud the successful organizing campaign that Parrish and her coworkers established to address and redress employees' workplace concerns,"" the charge states.
Parrish raised concerns about issues including the treatment of people with disabilities, pay equity, sexism and employee mental health, according to the charge. 
In an interview last month, Parrish said the iPhone maker informed her that she had been terminated for deleting material on company equipment while she was under investigation over the leaking of a company town hall to media. She told Reuters she denies leaking.
In response to Tuesday's complaint, Apple reiterated a prior comment that it does not discuss specific employee matters and is ""deeply committed to creating and maintaining a positive and inclusive workplace,"" taking ""all concerns"" from employees seriously.
Long famed for its secretive culture, Apple has experienced other examples of employee unrest in recent months. In September, two Apple employees told Reuters they had also filed charges Apple has said that it is ""deeply committed to creating and maintaining a positive and inclusive workplace"" and that it takes ""all concerns"" from employees seriously against the company with the NLRB. The workers accused Apple of retaliation and halting discussion of pay among employees, among other allegations.
Over the summer, current and former Apple employees began detailing on social media what they said were experiences of harassment and discrimination. Parrish and her colleagues began publishing the stories on social media and a publishing platform in a weekly bulletin titled '#AppleToo.' 
Since her termination, Parrish has continued sharing the digest and shifted to daily publication.
A growing number of tech workers across the industry have been raising concerns about their working conditions and technology's impact on society, said Laurie Burgess, a lawyer who is representing Parrish.

""Tech companies are underestimating the importance of social justice issues to their employees,"" said Burgess. 
The NLRB investigates all charges it receives and prosecutes employers if it finds the cases have merit.

SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea's Kakao Pay Corp saw its shares double in value from their initial public offering (IPO) price on their trading debut on Wednesday, as the fintech's expected growth in transactions and other services whetted investor appetite.
Kakao Pay shares opened at 180,000 won on the KOSPI versus an IPO price of 90,000 won, and gained to 187,500 won in early trade. The financial technology firm raised 1.5 trillion won ($1.27 billion) from its IPO.
China's Ant Group-backed Kakao Pay plans to use 854 billion won ($724.66 million), or about 56% of the funds the company raised after costs, for mergers and acquisitions, it said in a regulatory filing.
Kakao Corp, operator of South Korea's dominant chat app, remains a major shareholder with around a 48% stake. Ant Group's Alipay Singapore Holding has a 39% stake, and some of its shares can be traded without a lock-up period.
Having started payments service in 2014, Kakao Pay saw annual transactions grow from about 48 trillion won in 2019 to 67 trillion won in 2020. Transactions will likely grow sharply to around 100 trillion won in 2021, analysts said.
Kakao Pay had pushed back its IPO to November and slightly lowered an indicative price range after South Korean regulators said financial services platform apps needed to register or be licensed to provide financial product comparison and recommendation services.
""Regulation can be a new opportunity to gain more consumer trust,"" Kakao Pay chief strategy officer Shin Won-keun told a news conference last week.
Besides raising money for M&A, it is also preparing mobile stock trading services and seeking partnerships with global fintech companies to target potential overseas markets such as China, Southeast Asia and Europe, Kakao Pay said.
Outsized domestic retail investor demand has fed a boom in South Korean IPOs this year and increased volatility for newly-listed firms. The IPOs have raised more than four times the funds they did in 2020.

Nearly 80% of Nike's footwear makers and half of its apparel providers in Vietnam were forced to halt production in mid-July, which cam after authorities had imposed restrictions on movement to stop a major outbreak from spreading. 
Almost half of the American sports giant's footwear is made in Vietnam. 
Vietnam until the middle of this year had among the world's best coronavirus containment records, with limited disruption to its crucial manufacturing sector. 
However, that changed after May, when an outbreak emerged in its southern economic hub Ho Chi Minh City and spread to surrounding manufacturing provinces. 
The government-induced shutdown led to pressure https://reut.rs/3CGD93I from foreign business groups, which warned they could shift operations abroad. 
Those curbs were lifted a month ago, but the country is now facing labour shortages. https://reut.rs/3aqmtB4 At least 3 million people in Vietnam work in textiles and footwear manufacturing https://reut.rs/3k3k98b. 
The country has also prioritised vaccinating employees working in industrial parks to spur manufacturing activities.

By Samuel Shen and Vidya Ranganathan
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese stock market investors are swapping big tech names for ""small giants"" and luxury brands for mass market companies, aiming to cash in on President Xi Jinping's ""common prosperity"" plan for the economy.
The intent behind Xi's drive is a narrower gap between the rich and poor in the world's second largest economy. 
But the first policy moves rattled markets as authorities introduced heavy new regulations on industries such as technology, property and private tuition, sending shares in those sectors tumbling.
While some active fund managers have shunned China for the time being, others see opportunity in an economy aiming for a larger and richer middle class.
Chinese policymakers ""are talking about how to go from a pear-shaped type of economy, which is bottom-heavy, top-light, into an olive shape,"" said Ronald Chan, Hong Kong-based Asia head of equities at Manulife Investment Management. ""They are talking about how to split the pie going forward."" 
""Common prosperity"" also embodies China's desire for self-sufficiency in technology and energy and for industry to move up the value chain, said Chan, who has been buying Chinese solar energy companies while avoiding luxury spirit brands. 
Manulife's Greater China funds have also slashed holdings in tech giants such as  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent over the past year, according to public disclosures.
While it is difficult to estimate how big overall investment swings have been - particularly as passively managed funds continue to seek stock index heavyweights - market moves have been sharp.
China's new energy index has surged more than 70% this year, while the property sector is down over 10%. 
Among tech companies, those offering ""hard"" products and components have performed better than ""soft technology"", such as online providers. 
The KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF has plunged nearly 40% so far this year, while China's start-up board ChiNext is up 13% and Shanghai's hardware-heavy STAR Market, has barely budged.
""We've seen a lot of very extreme sentiment on China. Is it going back to Maoism? Is it investible?"" said William Sterling, global strategist at GW&K Investment Management, which invests in emerging markets including China. 
""It seems very, very unlikely that even with these new policy initiatives, the government would want to throw away the dynamism of the economy that the country's capitalist engine has created.""
Sterling bets Chinese consumer stocks will benefit from a growing middle class, but is avoiding property firms and related sectors such as cement and steel.

China’s Shanghai Composite edged down 0.15% by 9:58 PM ET (1:58 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component inched down 0.08%. The Caixin services purchasing managers index, released earlier in the day, was 53.8 for October, slightly higher than the 53.4 recorded during the previous month.
However, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang warned that the economy is facing new downward pressures amid an appeal to ensure there was adequate winter food supply by stocking up on essentials. Although speculation about the appeal continues, the government has downplayed its significance.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index edged down 0.12%. South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.77% while in Australia, the ASX 200 jumped 1.20%.
Japanese markets are closed for a holiday.
U.S. shares closed at another record high, seemingly resilient to COVID 19 related supply chain and labor upheavals.
Treasury two-year yields fell, with short-term rates falling globally thanks to the Reserve Bank of Australia’s dovish statement on Tuesday as it handed down its policy decision. Australian bond yields declined. The U.S. yield curve steepened, while cash treasuries will not trade in Asia due to the holiday in Japan.
All eyes are now on the Fed decision, due to be handed down later in the day. The U.S. central bank is widely expected to announce that it will begin asset tapering, but it is the exact timing of interest rate hikes that have investors divided.

(Reuters) -Facebook Inc announced on Tuesday it is shutting down its facial recognition system, which automatically identifies users in photos and videos, citing growing societal concerns about the use of such technology.
""Regulators are still in the process of providing a clear set of rules governing its use,"" Jerome Pesenti, vice president of artificial intelligence at Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), wrote in a blog post. ""Amid this ongoing uncertainty, we believe that limiting the use of facial recognition to a narrow set of use cases is appropriate.""
The removal of face recognition by the world's largest social media platform comes as the tech industry has faced a reckoning over the past few years over the ethics of using the technology. 
Critics say facial recognition technology https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/exclusive-why-us-hospital-oil-company-turned-facial-recognition-2021-04-20 - which is popular among retailers, hospitals and other businesses for security purposes - could compromise privacy, target marginalized groups and normalize intrusive surveillance.  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) has permanently ended facial recognition product sales, and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) have suspended sales to police indefinitely.
The news also comes as Facebook has been under intense scrutiny https://www.reuters.com/technology/changing-facebooks-name-will-not-deter-lawmaker-or-regulatory-scrutiny-experts-2021-10-20 from regulators and lawmakers over user safety and a wide range of abuses on its platforms.
The company, which last week renamed itself https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebooks-zuckerberg-kicks-off-its-virtual-reality-event-with-metaverse-vision-2021-10-28 Meta Platforms Inc, said more than one-third of Facebook's daily active users have opted into the face recognition setting on the social media site, and the change will now delete the ""facial recognition templates"" of more than 1 billion people.
The removal will roll out globally and is expected to be complete by December, a Facebook spokesperson said. 
Privacy advocacy and digital rights groups welcomed the move.
Alan Butler, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said, ""For far too long Internet users have suffered personal data abuses at the whims of Facebook and other platforms. EPIC first called for an end to this program in 2011,"" though he said comprehensive data protection regulations were still needed in the United States. 
Adam Schwartz, senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said that although Facebook's action comes after moves from other tech companies, it could mark a ""notable moment in the national turning-away from face recognition.""
Facebook added that its automatic alt text tool, which creates image descriptions for visually impaired people, will no longer include the names of people recognized in photos after the removal of face recognition, but will otherwise function normally.
Facebook did not rule out using facial recognition technology in other products, saying it still sees it as a ""powerful tool"" for identity verification for example.

The company's facial recognition software has long been the subject of scrutiny. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission included it among the concerns when it fined Facebook $5 billion to settle privacy complaints in 2019. 
A judge this year approved Facebook's $650 million settlement of a class action in Illinois over allegations it collected and stored biometric data of users without proper consent.

(Reuters) -Shares of  Avis Budget  (NASDAQ:CAR) Group Inc surged on Tuesday as retail investors rushed to get a piece of the heavily-shorted U.S. car rental company, giving a possible $5 billion boost to activist hedge fund SRS Investment Management, which has been the company's biggest investor for around a decade. 
Avis gained after quarterly results beat Wall Street estimates. Avis executives also said the company has been in talks with manufacturers about its plans to add more electric vehicles to its fleet.
The stock closed up 108% at $357.17 following multiple trading halts for volatility, its biggest daily percentage jump according to Refinitiv data going back to the 1980s. Shares jumped as high as $545.11 earlier in the session. That sent the Dow Jones Transportation Average surging to an all-time high.
The steep climb in Avis shares was evocative of the rally in shares of GameStop (NYSE:GME) and other so-called meme stocks earlier in the year, driven in part by retail investors coordinating on Reddit's WallStreetBets and other online forums.
About 21% of Avis Budget's free float shares are shorted, data from S3 Partners showed, increasing its vulnerability to a phenomenon known as a short squeeze, where investors betting against a company are forced to unwind their positions after a rally in the stock price.
Short sellers were hit with $4.29 billion in mark-to-market losses at a surge to $481.50 in Tuesday's session, S3 Partners' managing director of predictive analytics Ihor Dusaniwsky said.
""The short squeeze could force some existing short sellers to close out all or part of their positions in Avis."" 
However, one winner looked to be New York-based hedge fund SRS which held a 27.7% stake in Avis, according to a regulatory filing dated Sept. 10. That stake included 18.4 million shares of common stock in Avis, and exposure to 11.4 million more shares through cash-settled equity swaps that equate to around a 16.3% of the outstanding shares of the common stock, the filing showed. 
The gain by the hedge fund, founded in 2006 by Karthik Ramakrishna Sarma, a former managing director at Tiger Global Management, was earlier reported https://www.ft.com/content/d0640487-12f0-4d8a-bc79-160fca121d18 by the Financial Times.
Based on Avis's closing share price on Tuesday, SRS's position in the company, including its derivative holdings, would be worth $5.53 billion more than they were at Monday's closing price of $171.46, according to a Reuters calculation. 
SRS declined to comment for this story. 
According to the Financial Times, the fund reached a standstill agreement in February 2020 that placed three of its nominees on Avis’s board of directors.

Ybarra said the delay in the rollout of ""Overwatch 2"" and ""Diablo IV"" was due to the leadership change, but did not give a new timeline for their launch, while the company forecast an underwhelming adjusted sales in the holiday quarter.
Oneal and Ybarra took the helm three months ago after Allen Brack stepped down as president, a week after the company was sued for workplace harassment and pay discrimination.
Following this, the company last month fired more than 20 employees, with 20 more facing other forms of disciplinary action. 
The owner of ""Call of Duty"" and ""Candy Crush"" franchises also created an $18 million fund to compensate and make amends to eligible claimants, while Chief Executive Bobby Kotick said he would take a large paycut. 
In a letter to the company's gaming community, Oneal said she will leave at the end of the year to focus more on diversity in the gaming industry, which will ""hopefully make a broader industry impact that will benefit Blizzard"" and other studios.
With her exit, the company now has three female executives in the 13-member leadership team. 
Meanwhile, as pandemic-related curbs eased, Activision's total monthly active users in the third quarter remained unchanged at 390 million from a year earlier, indicating signs of slowing demand for games.
The company, which faces competition from rivals  Electronic Arts Inc  (NASDAQ:EA) and Take-Two (NASDAQ:TTWO), said in-game net bookings were same as the third quarter of 2020. 

Its adjusted sales for the third quarter was $1.88 billion, in line with Wall Street expectations. 
The company said it expects fourth-quarter adjusted sales to be $2.78 billion. Analysts were expecting it to be $2.93 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

Demand for its biscuits and snacks has bounced back across China, India, Latin America and other emerging markets after tepid sales last year, when the economic toll of the pandemic dealt a sharp blow to consumer spending in those regions.
Shares of the Chicago, Illinois-based company rose 2.3% in after market trade, as net revenue from its emerging markets segment grew 12.9% to $2.58 billion in the third quarter, following a 3.1% fall last year.
The chocolatier is now doubling down on those markets by increasing production lines to ramp up capacity rather than open new facilities, in an effort to save costs. 
Like other packaged foods makers such as  Campbell Soup  (NYSE:CPB) Co and Conagra Brands (NYSE:CAG) Inc, Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ) has been raising product prices in recent months to contend with higher costs of ingredients such as sugar and wheat, as well as packaging, transportation and labor.
""Costs have moved higher in the second half of the year relative to the first half, and we expect inflation to persist in 2022,"" said Chief Executive Officer Dirk Van de Put in a post-earnings call.
Mondelez now expects full-year organic net revenue growth of about 4.5%, compared with its prior forecast of an over 4% increase. Analysts on average were expecting 4.25%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Net revenue for the third quarter ended Sept. 30 rose 7.8% to $7.18 billion, surpassing estimates of $7.03 billion.

LISBON (Reuters) - Chip designer Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has been able to skirt most of the problems linked with the global chip supply shortage by forecasting demand years in advance, a top executive said on Tuesday.
Demand for electronics gadgets from people stuck in homes due to the pandemic has led to a shortage of semiconductors that are used from anything from mobile phones and cars.
But despite a squeeze in supply, AMD has been able to take market share away from rival Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in both PCs and servers with its latest line of processors.
""Our supply chain team has worked to make sure that we have months and years of forecast ahead into our supply chain,"" Chief Technology Officer Mark Papermaster said on the sidelines of the Web Summit conference in Lisbon, Portugal.
""Everybody has had to increase their focus on the supply chain but we did so from the very beginning of the pandemic."" Companies with existing ties with chip fabrication companies like Taiwan's TSMC were also able to guarantee a steady supply. AMD, which doesn't manufacture its own chips like Intel, depends on companies such as TSMC and GlobalFoundries to make the chips for them.

""We are using cutting edge semiconductor nodes and we are a very large purchaser in this area, so that is certainly helpful in securing our supply chain,"" Papermaster said.
Contrary to automakers, who are hardest hit by semiconductor shortage, AMD focuses on the smaller, more advanced chips which are less affected than the supply of mass-produced older chips.AMD has been focusing on high-margin chips, which not only allows the company to channel its resources but increases revenue, projected to rise 65% this year.

(Reuters) -  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) shares soared more than 13% in extended trading on Tuesday after the company reported an adjusted profit for the third quarter and outlined a path to sustained profitability on the back of drastic cost cuts and a return of riders and drivers.
Lyft's leaner cost structure allowed it to increase ridership without incurring rising expenses and executives said they targeted even higher adjusted profit in the fourth quarter, outlining their conviction for a continued recovery from a bruising pandemic.
Rides to airports, which are among the most profitable routes, nearly tripled from a year ago, executives said on an earnings call with analysts, in a sign of a broader U.S. economic recovery. 
Shares of larger rival Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc, which will report results on Thursday after the bell, rose 7% in after-market trading following Lyft's release. Uber has said it expects to break even on an adjusted EBITDA basis for the first time.
Overall, Lyft's active riders increased 11% to 18.9 million in the quarter ended Sept. 30. But ridership remains 35% below peak levels before the pandemic, with Lyft executives saying many consumers were waiting for COVID-19 vaccine booster shots or were hesitant to travel with unvaccinated children.
The company also said business travel to offices had not yet resumed, with workers particularly on the U.S. West Coast continuing to work from home. But executives said they were hopeful office workers would return in the first half of 2022.
""It's a matter of when, not if,"" Chief Financial Officer Brian Roberts said.
According to the California-based company's own measure, Lyft was profitable for the second consecutive time in its nine-year history. 
Lyft reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a measure that excludes one-time costs, primarily stock-based compensation, of $67.3 million. The metric came in significantly ahead of a Wall Street estimate for $30.7 million, according to Refinitiv data.
Lyft said it expected adjusted EBITDA of between $70 million and $75 million in the fourth quarter.
Overall, Lyft's third-quarter revenue rose about 73% on a yearly basis to $864.4 million, beating the Wall Street estimate of $862.68 million, according to Refinitiv IBES data. 
Revenue increased around 13% from last quarter, while total costs and expenses grew only 4% from the second quarter in a sign that Lyft is making do on its promise to cut both fixed and variable costs. Lyft's contribution margin, indicating the company's profitability excluding variable costs, rose to a record 59.4%. 
Lyft's net loss narrowed to $71.5 million, or 21 cents per share, from $459.5 million, or $1.46 per share last year, but President John Zimmer declined to say whether or when the company would target net profit. 
The company posted surprise adjusted earnings per share of 5 cents in the quarter compared with a loss of 3 cents expected by Wall Street.
Lyft said driver supply was up 45% compared with last year, but did not share how far off driver numbers remained from pre-pandemic levels.
Zimmer said in an interview with Reuters that drivers were feeling safer thanks to the availability of COVID-19 vaccines and were returning to the road in greater numbers after enhanced federal unemployment payments ended in September.
""We're seeing the right things happening in the market and will begin to taper incentives in the quarter ahead,"" he said.
Lyft and Uber have been spending heavily to lure drivers with big incentives as the pandemic opened up new jobs at Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s warehouses, Instacart's grocery services and restaurant deliveries.

But Zimmer said most ride-hail drivers worked on the platform part-time as a way to supplement income from other jobs, enjoying the flexibility provided by gig work.
""I feel very good about the supply conditions, and our ability to compete in the marketplace for talent, given the type of work and earnings that we offer,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration said on Tuesday it had issued a special information bulletin alerting manufacturers, operators and pilots that action may be needed to address potential interference with sensitive aircraft electronics caused by the use of 5G telecommunications technology.
The FAA has been in discussion with the Federal Communications Commission about its air safety concerns over the plan to begin using some additional spectrum for 5G wireless networks starting Dec. 5.
The FAA said on Tuesday operators ""should be prepared for the possibility that interference from 5G transmitters and other technology could cause certain safety equipment to malfunction, requiring them to take mitigating action that could affect flight operations.""
The bulletin said ""there have not yet been proven reports of harmful interference due to wireless broadband operations internationally.""
It also recommends pilots remind passengers that all portable electronic devices equipped with 5G be should be turned off or switched to airplane mode during flight.
The FAA warned of the potential of the ""degradation to the capabilities of safety systems and other equipment that depend on radio altimeters, particularly during low-altitude operations.""
The FAA said equipment manufacturers should also continue their testing to determine the susceptibility of specific radio altimeters to 5G interference and should explore design changes that could mitigate the effects of interference.
The aviation industry has voiced alarm about the plan to use C-Band spectrum for more than a year. Network carriers are expected to begin using the spectrum starting Dec. 5 starting in 46 markets.
FAA Deputy Administrator Bradley Mims in a letter first reported by Reuters on Friday said the agency shares ""the deep concern about the potential impact to aviation safety resulting from interference to radar altimeter performance from 5G network operations in the C band.""
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) said Tuesday it is ""committed to continuing to work with its federal partners to simultaneously preserve air safety and advance the deployment of new technologies.""

The aerospace and airline sector met with the FCC in August, warning that without changes ""major disruptions to use of the National Airspace System can be expected from the rollout of 5G"" and added the FAA will be forced to ""drastically reduce aviation operational capacity."" 
Wireless trade group CTIA said on Friday 5G networks can safely use C-band spectrum ""without causing harmful interference to aviation equipment,"" and cited numerous active 5G networks using this spectrum band in 40 countries.""

(Reuters) -  Amgen Inc  (NASDAQ:AMGN) on Tuesday said its quarterly revenue rose 4% as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic began to ease, but said new prescriptions will be subdued through 2021 and prices for some drugs remain under pressure from lower-cost competition.
For the full year, the biotechnology company lowered the top end of its revenue forecast to $26.2 billion from a previous $26.6 billion. Wall Street analysts had forecast $26 billion, according to Refinitiv. 
Amgen also slightly raised its outlook for 2021 adjusted earnings per share to between $16.50 and $17.10 from a previous range of $16.00 to $17.00.
Amgen shares closed up 2% at $214.26, but gave back most of those gain in extended trading and were down to $211 after hours.
The quarterly results were mostly in line with expectations, with investors next focusing on January, when Amgen is expected to hear from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on an application for asthma drug tezepelumab, Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Michael Yee said in a research note.
Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter, helped by share repurchases, were $4.69, beating the average analyst forecast of $4.27.
Full-year stock buy backs will come in near the high end of the company's estimated range of $3 billion to $5 billion, Chief Financial Officer Peter Griffith said on a conference call.
Amgen's net earnings fell 3% to $3.31 per share with a $400 million licensing-related expense from a collaboration with Japan's Kyowa Kirin Co Ltd.
Revenue for the quarter totaled $6.7 billion, up from $6.4 billion a year earlier, and in line with analyst expectations.
Amgen said sales volume for the quarter rose 8%, but net selling prices fell 7% as competition, including from cheaper generics and biosimilars, pushed down prices for its arthritis, migraine and infection-fighting drugs.

Sales of arthritis drug Enbrel fell 3% from a year earlier to $1.29 billion. Sales of newer cancer drug Lumakras totaled $36 million for the quarter, ahead of analyst estimates of $28 million.
Chief Executive Bob Bradway said the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic - including a decline in face-to-face doctor visits - ""has lingered longer than we thought it would at the beginning of the year.""

Avianca, along with rival Chile's LATAM Airlines (OTC:LTMAQ), were the two largest carriers in the region before the coronavirus pandemic, but both were sent into bankruptcy restructuring when the virus upended air travel, amid especially strict restrictions in Latin America.
Avianca had already posted several years of losses before the pandemic began, and went through a boardroom coup in 2019 led by United Airlines.
""Avianca announces that today, after presenting certain additional documentation that had been required by the court, the tribunal of the Southern District of New York confirmed the company's reorganization plan,"" the company said in a statement from Bogota.
""The airline expects to successfully complete that process and emerge from Chapter 11 before the end of the year as a financially stronger and more efficient airline.""
Avianca will have significantly less debt and more than $1 billion in liquidity when it finishes the bankruptcy process, the statement said.

The company plans to have 130 airplanes servicing 200 routes by 2025, it added.
During the bankruptcy process, Avianca received around $2 billion in new financing.

A Delta variant surge during the quarter had prompted fresh restrictions in several Asian countries, halting a recovery in the company's key growth markets.
""We continue to feel some lingering COVID effects across Asia, particularly in Japan, our second-largest market by revenue,"" Match said in a statement, sending its shares down 6%. 
The company expects fourth-quarter revenue between $810 million and $820 million, below analysts' average estimate of $838.5 million, according to Refinitiv.
The forecast was also weighed down by lower expected contribution from Hyperconnect, which Match bought earlier this year for $1.73 billion. The South Korean firm's flagship app Azar has faced a drop in usage and product development issues due to the pandemic.
Match said it was working to sharpen Hyperconnect's focus on social interaction, like its other dating apps, although this process was likely to take some time.
The company has tried to keep users interested after the pandemic boom last year by adding new features such as ""Plus One"" on Tinder to help single people find dates for a wedding.
Dallas, Texas-based Match said it was on track to pay more than $550 million in fees to app stores in 2021, as it navigates changes brought on by Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).
Improvements have started to emerge in the fairness of the app ecosystem, but there is a long way to go, it said. 

Revenue rose 25% to $801.8 million in the third quarter, but missed estimates. The company added 16.3 million payers and revenue per payer rose 8%.

(Reuters) - Carl Icahn's CVR Energy (NYSE:CVI) is moving forward with plans to produce renewable diesel at its Wynnewood, Oklahoma refinery in Spring of 2022 after halting the proposal earlier this year due to high soybean oil prices, executives said on Tuesday. 
However, plans to produce renewable fuels at its Coffeyville refinery in Kansas will depend on the expansion of low carbon fuel standard programs throughout America.
Various states such as New York and New Mexico are eying the adoption of low carbon fuel standards similar to California's landmark program. The program offers incentives for greener fuels by awarding tradable credits to producers that reduce the carbon intensity of their transportation fuels.
""We need a couple of those to happen to really have the Coffeyville conversion,"" said chief executive David Lamp on the company's third quarter earnings call on Tuesday. 
CVR Energy is eying production of 50 million gallons of renewable fuel at Coffeyville, potentially including 25 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel if regulatory conditions change.
Until Wynnewood's pretreater unit is up and running the company plans to run refined deodorized and bleached soybean oil and treated corn oil.
Soybean oil prices have fallen back from highs earlier this year. Lamp attributed the prices to demand from other renewable diesel projects coming online. 
Lower prices combined with other subsidies have caused Wynnewood project economics to drift back into positive territory, he said.

CVR's refining peers Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) and  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) recently announced joint ventures that would allow them to own soybean oil crushers to secure feedstocks for their renewable projects.
""There's many cases out there for new crushers that need to be built, and we think our location is a pretty good one for that. And we'll look for a call on the oil to take a position in those projects,"" Lamp said.

West Texas Intermediate futures are trading around $84 a barrel - a level not seen since 2014, while Henry Hub natural gas futures (NGc1) are around $5.53 per million British Thermal Unit (mmBTU), near a seven-year high. 
Despite soaring prices, most publicly traded energy companies have vowed to focus on shareholder returns over increasing production. On Tuesday, Chesapeake and Devon said they anticipated full-year output at or above the upper end of their forecasts, while spending would remain within anticipated ranges. 
Devon on Tuesday also said its board had authorized a $1 billion share-repurchase program, which represents 4% of its market capitalization.
Shares of Devon were up 5.5% in after-hours trading to $44.30, while Chesapeake rose 2.14% to $66.77.

As of Nov. 8, the bank will not allow new purchases or short positions in the related businesses, but clients with existing positions will be allowed to liquidate them, it said.
The restrictions apply to companies with U.S. operations that are not listed on the Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange or the Toronto Stock Exchange and have a ""direct nexus to marijuana-related activities."" 
Nasdaq and NYSE allow certain cannabis-related companies -- including Canadian companies that do not sell cannabis in the United States - to list their shares, but will not list companies involved in the direct cultivation or sales of the marijuana plant. 
However, such companies have still found workarounds to trade on over-the-counter exchanges.
Cowen and Co, another U.S. bank active in the cannabis trading space, in September increased its cash margin requirements for all marijuana related trades on its platform, according to a letter it sent to clients. 
A representative for Cowen did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Some investors have blamed recent selloffs in U.S. cannabis stocks on banks backing away from the sector and the new restrictions at JPMorgan and Cowen could add to the pressure.
The MSOS exchange-traded fund, which tracks U.S. marijuana stocks, has halved in value since hitting a peak in February.

It offers fasteners and related industrial and construction supplies under the Fastenal name.
The continued spread of COVID-19, along with an inflationary environment, are causes for concern for investors seeking to benefit from the economic recovery. However, the Fed’s continued near-zero interest rate policy, rapid vaccination programs, and supportive government policies have boosted the industrial sector’s growth. Furthermore, President Biden's bipartisan infrastructure bill proposal, which includes $550 billion in new spending for building roads, rails, and bridges, among others, is expected to help the sector grow significantly in the coming months. So, both GWW and FAST should benefit.
GWW has gained 5.2% in price over the past three months, while FAST has returned 3.7%. Also, GWW’s 26.4% gains over the past nine months are higher than FAST’s 22.3% returns. And GWW is the clear winner with 17.5% gains versus FAST’s 9.9% returns in terms of their past months’ performance.

Taylor Dart explains why this could be a buying opportunity with rock-bottom sentiment.Investors in the precious metals sector have had a very disappointing year thus far, watching the price of silver (SLV) crumble from a high of $30.00/oz in Q1 to just $23.75/oz week. This has hurt the silver producers, with the Silver Miners ETF (SIL) down nearly 40% from its year-to-date highs, given the margin pressure that they’ve experienced. However, while performance has been quite weak year-to-date, the metal looks like it’s trying to turn around, and with sentiment at its worst levels in years, this looks more like a buyer’s strike due to disgust with silver’s performance rather than a seller’s market. Let’s take a closer look below:
(Source: TC2000.com)
As shown in the chart above, the performance of the SIL has been horrendous since earlier this year, with the ETF plummeting from a high above $50.00 to below $34.00 before seeing a bit of a relief rally recently. In a highly emotional sector that rarely trades on fundamentals short-term, catching falling knives is rarely wise. However, there comes a point where fear in the market and pessimism morphs into extreme pessimism and complete capitulation, and this looks like what we may have seen last month for silver and many silver producers. This is evidenced by bullish sentiment falling to its lowest levels in more than three years in October based on its sentiment moving average, with the last occurrence (September 2018) being a major bottom for the precious metals complex. History does not have to repeat itself, but if there were ever a time to be open-minded to buying the dip, we’re getting very close to that point.

Investing.com – The major averages closed at fresh record highs Tuesday, as investors digested mostly bullish quarterly results just as the Federal Reserve kicks off its two-day meeting.
The S&P 500 rose 0.37% at a closing record of 4,630.65. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.39%, or 138.79 points to close at a record of 36,052.63. The Nasdaq climbed 0.34% to a closing record of 15,649.60.
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) rallied 4%, after lifting its full-year guidance following third-quarter results that beat analysts' consensus on both the top and bottom lines, driven by strong vaccine demand.
Investors are also awaiting news later Tuesday from a meeting of an advisory panel to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on whether to expand vaccine eligibility to children of ages 5 to 11.
McKesson (NYSE:MCK) third-quarter results also topped Wall Street estimates and the drug distributor raised its full-year earnings guidance, sending its shares closed up nearly 6%.
Technology, meanwhile, shrugged off its sluggish start to the week to rack up gains amid a more than 1% move in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).
Other big cap tech traded mixed as Facebook-parent Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) fell.
Semiconductor also pushed the broader tech sector higher following stronger than expected results from Apple chip supplier On-Semiconductor.
 ON Semiconductor  Corporation (NASDAQ:ON) rallied 4% to a record high after guiding fourth-quarter guidance on revenue and earnings above estimates. The upbeat results drew a flurry of positive commentary from Wall Street, with Baird raising its price target to $75 from $60.
Shares of  Avis Budget  (NASDAQ:CAR) more than doubled as its stronger quarterly earnings fueled positive upgrades from Wall Street. Morgan Stanley raised the firm's price target on stock to to $140 from $110. The surge in Avis added more than 1,000 points to the Dow Jones Transportation.
But not all sectors were participating in the melt up on Wall Street, with energy and consumer discretionary in the red.
Consumer discretionary stocks were weighed down by a fall in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) after its CEO Elon Musk appeared to cool some optimism on the Hertz order for 100,000 Tesla.


Under Amour eased some of losses in the sector after surging more than 16% after raising its full-year guidance amid quarterly results that topped analysts' expectations.
Energy was down more 1% as oil prices drifted lower ahead of fresh weekly U.S. petroleum data expected to show a rise in crude stockpiles.
The 10-year Treasury yield, meanwhile, fell 2% as investors as the Fed kicked off its two-day meeting.
The Fed is expected to announce its taper on monthly bond purchases, and keep interest rate unchanged, but the central bank's insight into inflation is expected to garner most of the attention.
Ahead of the Fed decision, investors see downside risks rather upside risks to equities.
""There is more risk to the downside for equities heading into the Fed decision,"" Melissa Brown, managing director of applied research at Qontigo, told Investing.com on Tuesday. ""Monthly data pointing to supply chain issues or that people don't necessarily want to take up the jobs that are available has to lead to higher inflation.""
Still, risk sentiment remains intact as investors are shifting out of defensive corners of the market to riskier sectors like small cap and higher-valuation growth stocks.
""Investors seem to be moving now more away from the really defensive sectors or the defensive kind of styles and getting a little bolder,"" Brown added."

Fed policymakers are expected to announce the withdrawal of pandemic-era stimulus when they conclude their two-day meeting on Wednesday afternoon.
Elon Musk, CEO of high-flying Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), put out a curious tweet that said the electric car maker had not signed a contract with rental car giant Hertz, and that comment sent Tesla shares falling 4% after hitting a new record high on Monday.
 Avis Budget  Group Inc (NASDAQ:CAR) a rental car rival to Hertz, shot up nearly 100% as of mid-afternoon after positive earnings and signs that consumer demand is returning.
All eyes are on the Fed's policy meeting. Investors will also be listening to what the central bank says about interest rates and the recent spike in inflation. For months it has said such price increases are transitory.
Solid corporate earnings, in addition to stimulus from the Fed, have pushed stocks higher in the last few weeks, with the three major indexes each hitting new highs.
On Tuesday, Covid-19 vaccine maker  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) gained after it raised its full year sales guidance and said sales from the vaccine could reach $36 billion. Fellow vaccine maker  Moderna  Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA)’s earnings report comes out later this week.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. CVS earnings

2. Etsy earnings
 Etsy Inc  (NASDAQ:ETSY) is expected to report third-quarter profit per share of 54 cents on revenue of $519.05 million.
3. Fed decision
The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to put its seal on Wednesday on the much-anticipated decision to start unwinding its $120 billion monthly bond purchases. The program began in March 2020 and has been hailed for its spectacular role in saving the U.S. as well as the global economy from the wrath of the pandemic. 
The market will also be looking out for cues on the next crucial decision the Fed has to take at a time of record inflation: that of hiking interest rates that have stayed at zero since the March intervention. The Fed’s decision will come out at 2:00 PM ET (1800 GMT).

(Reuters) - Stellantis NV, the world's fourth-largest automaker, is offering voluntary retirement program to pension-eligible employees in the United States, the company said late Monday.
The Netherlands-based firm said the early retirement is available to workers who are at least 55 years old and have been with the company for 30 years or who are at least 58 years old with 10 years of employment. 
The employees being offered the buyouts are already eligible to retire. 
""To assist in our transition, and to align our business priorities to a new set of critical skills and investment opportunities, Stellantis North America is offering a voluntary retirement program to eligible members of our team,"" the company said in an emailed statement.
Industry publication Automotive News first reported the development.

Unionized-salaried employees are not eligible for the buyouts, according to a CNBC https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/01/stellantis-offering-buyouts-to-pension-eligible-us-salaried-workers.html report. The company cited the buyouts as a way to assist in its pivot to focus more on electric vehicles, according to the report.
Stellantis, formed at the beginning of the year from the merger of Fiat Chrysler and France's PSA, had announced plans to build factories in North America with LG Energy and Samsung (KS:005930) SDI Co to jointly produce electric vehicle (EV) batteries for the North American market.

(Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) on Tuesday posted a quarterly profit that trounced market expectations as supply bottlenecks and a global economic recovery helped drive a rebound in crude prices.
Oil prices have gained nearly 63% since the start of 2021, with global crude benchmark Brent rising above $86 a barrel to its highest level in about three years after the pandemic depressed fuel demand in 2020.
This year's strong demand offers ""some pretty constructive tailwinds for the industry,"" Chief Executive Ryan Lance said on a conference call.
ConocoPhillips said it was still evaluating production targets for next year. It plans to keep the number of shale drilling rigs ""steady"" until the close of its $9.5 billion purchase of Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa)'s Permian assets, expected in the current quarter. 
The company forecast fourth-quarter production between 1.53 million barrel of oil equivalent (boe) per day and 1.57 million boe per day, excluding Libya and any impact from the Shell deal.
Its production, excluding Libya, rose 41.36% to 1.51 million boe per day in the third quarter, while the total average realized price surged nearly 84%.
Adjusted earnings of $1.77 per share beat expectations of $1.51 per share, according to Refinitiv data.
SCOPE-3 TARGET
Senior Vice President Dominic Macklon said ConocoPhillips does not believe in setting emissions reduction targets that include the use of the company's fuels, as they do not address consumer demand and would shift supply to less accountable producers and jurisdictions.

Unlike their European counterparts, few U.S. producers have set so-called Scope 3 targets that include emissions from customers using the fuel they have purchased. 
ConocoPhillips has, however, outlined net-zero 2050 goals for Scope 1 emissions that include its own operations and Scope 2 emissions, which account for the power generation to run its facilities.

Investing.com — Facebook parent company Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:FB) said Tuesday that it is shutting down the social media app's facial recognition system as part of a company-wide plan to restrict the use of facial recognition in its products. 
The Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:FB) which still trade under the Facebook name though it will eventually change tickers, dipped 0.6% on Tuesday.
The company said that over one-third of its daily active users had opted into its facial recognition setting and were able to be recognized, with the move likely to result in more than a billion people's facial recognition templates being deleted.
""As part of this change, people who have opted in to our Face Recognition setting will no longer be automatically recognized in photos and videos, and we will delete the facial recognition template used to identify them,"" the company stated. 
However, the change will also impact Automatic Alt Text (AAT), which creates image descriptions for blind and visually impaired people. AAT will no longer be able to include the names of people but will function normally otherwise.
Meta cited concerns about the place of facial technology in society as one of the reasons for its removal. However, the company said it still sees facial recognition technology as a powerful tool, including when people need to verify their identity or to prevent fraud and impersonation.
Meta went on to say, ""regulators are still in the process of providing a clear set of rules governing its use. Amid this ongoing uncertainty, we believe that limiting the use of facial recognition to a narrow set of use cases is appropriate.""
Meta, formerly Facebook, has come under pressure in the past month after a former employee released a plethora of company documents containing information such as the company knowing Instagram was harming certain user's mental health and that an algorithm changed increased divisiveness on the platform. It is one of the latest in a number of  scandals the company has been involved in, in the past."

Investing.com – The major averages continued trade near fresh record highs Tuesday, led by health care stocks amid mostly bullish quarterly results just as the Federal Reserve kicks off its two-day meeting.
The S&P 500 rose 0.35% and hit an earlier all-time high of 4,635.30. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.39%, or 140 points to an intraday record of 36,088.10. The Nasdaq climbed 0.10%, and had earlier notched a record of 15,656.60.
Health care stocks led the broader market higher, with McKesson and  Pfizer  among the top gainers after reporting better-than-expected quarterly results.
Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) lifted its full-year guidance following third-quarter results that beat analysts' consensus on both the top and bottom lines, driven by strong vaccine demand. The drug maker's shares jumped more than 4%.
Investors are also awaiting news later Tuesday from a CDC meeting on whether to expand vaccine eligibility to children of ages 5 to 11.
McKesson (NYSE:MCK) third-quarter results also topped Wall Street estimates and the drug distributor raised its full-year earnings guidance, sending its shares up nearly 6%.
Technology, meanwhile, shrugged off its sluggish start to the week to rack up gains amid a more than 1% move in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).
Other big cap tech traded mixed as Facebook-parent Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) fell.
Semiconductor also pushed the broader tech sector higher following stronger than expected results from Apple chip supplier On-Semiconductor.
 ON Semiconductor  Corporation (NASDAQ:ON) rallied 4% to a record high after guiding fourth-quarter guidance on revenue and earnings above estimates. The upbeat results drew a flurry of positive commentary from Wall Street, with Baird raising its price target to $75 from $60.
But not all sectors were participating in the melt up on Wall Street, with energy and consumer discretionary in the red.
Consumer discretionary stocks were weighed down by a fall in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) after its CEO Elon Musk appeared to cool some optimism on the Hertz order for 100,000 Tesla.


Under Amour eased some of losses in the sector after surging more than 16% after raising its full-year guidance amid quarterly results that topped analysts' expectations.
Energy was down more 1% as oil prices drifted lower ahead of fresh weekly U.S. petroleum data expected to show a rise in crude stockpiles.
The 10-year Treasury yield, meanwhile, fell 2% as investors as the Fed kicked off its two-day meeting.
The Fed is expected to announce its taper on monthly bond purchases, and keep interest rate unchanged, but the central bank's insight into inflation is expected to garner most of the attention.
Ahead of the Fed decision, investors see downside risks rather upside risks to equities.
""There is more risk to the downside for equities heading into the Fed decision,"" Melissa Brown, managing director of applied research at Qontigo, told Investing.com on Tuesday. ""Monthly data pointing to supply chain issues or that people don't necessarily want to take up the jobs that are available has to lead to higher inflation.""
Still, risk sentiment remains intact as investors are shifting out of defensive corners of the market to riskier sectors like small cap and higher-valuation growth stocks.
""Investors seem to be moving now more away from the really defensive sectors or the defensive kind of styles and getting a little bolder,"" Brown added."
128,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2021 02:35PM ET</span>",California farm town lurches from no water to polluted water,"By Daniel Trotta
TEVISTON, Calif. (Reuters) - The San Joaquin Valley farm town of Teviston has two wells. One went dry and the other is contaminated.
The one functioning well failed just at the start of summer, depriving the hot and dusty hamlet of running water for weeks. With temperatures routinely soaring above 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius), farm workers bathed with buckets after laboring in the nearby vineyards and almond orchards. 
Even as officials restored a modicum of pressure with trucked-in water, and after the well was repaired, the hardships have endured. Teviston's 400 to 700 people - figures fluctuate with the agricultural season - have received bottled drinking water since the well failed in June.
But for years, probably decades, the water coming from Teviston taps has been laced with the carcinogen 1,2,3-Trichloropropane, or 1,2,3-TCP, the legacy of pesticides. 
The Western U.S. drought, the most severe in 125 years of record-keeping, is exacting a further toll on communities throughout the San Joaquin Valley, where people living on the edge of farmland gather many of the crops but little of the largesse from California's $50 billion agricultural industry.
For Esperanza Guerrero, 35, a Mexican immigrant and homemaker whose husband works at a dairy farm, the poor water quality poses additional dangers for her 16-year-old daughter, who can drink only purified water because of a gastrointestinal ailment.
""It's very stressful as a mother to know that if for any reason she should wash a piece of fruit (with tap water) and eat it, she's going down,"" Guerrero said while picking up bottled water from the community depot.
Teviston, devoid of any retail or commercial business, won a $3 million settlement in June from pesticide producers Dow Chemical Company and Shell (LON:RDSa) Oil Company and distributors that will pay for a water treatment plant.
Dow declined to comment on Teviston, but said there was ""no merit"" to allegations in similar lawsuits brought by other local jurisdictions in the San Joaquin Valley.
""The plaintiffs' claims in these cases are based on a California water quality standard that went into effect in 2018, several decades after the product formulations in question were discontinued. To the extent TCP was present in past product formulations, it would have been at levels so low as to pose no environmental risk,"" the company said in a statement.
Shell declined to comment on active litigation.
The settlement will help Teviston resolve the dilemma of having to choose between safe or affordable water, said Todd Robins, an attorney with San Francisco-based Robins Borghei LLP who has represented other towns like Teviston in similar lawsuits. 
The arid, forbidding land of the San Joaquin Valley has been transformed into one of the most fertile plains in the world by farmers, politicians and engineers who changed the course of mighty rivers and brought water hundreds of miles to a valley so broad and flat that in most directions the fields meet sky. 
The drought has made both surface and ground water scarce.
The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which operates canals moving surface water from Northern California further south, has cut allotments to farmers this year: first to a mere 5% of normal, then down to zero.
That increased demand on the aquifers. Growers who operate their own wells are lowering the water table for neighboring towns like Teviston that depend on well water.
Outside the valley, many environmentalists criticize growers. The people of Teviston don't paint them as the enemy.
""We need the farms. Without the farms, we don't have any work,"" said Frank Galaviz, a director on the town council who has emerged as Teviston's leading water advocate.
THE ENEMY BELOW
Historically, the farms have faced another nemesis besides drought.
Beneath the ground, tiny worms called nematodes infest roots. For decades, through the 1980s, growers injected their soil with the since-discontinued pesticides Telone, made by Dow, and D-D, made by Shell, according to Robins, who has pieced together the history of 1,2,3-TCP contamination through about 70 lawsuits against both companies. 
By the 1990s health officials established that TCP was carcinogenic and would linger in the water table for a lifetime unless removed by filtration. California's TCP problem is concentrated in the San Joaquin Valley, state data show. 
Telone and D-D were essentially a byproduct of other chemical processes that would have been disposed of were it not found to be an effective pesticide, enabling the companies to offload the byproduct by selling it to farmers, Robins said.
""It's a dirty secret,"" Robins said, adding that Dow's reformulated Telone II became more effective once TCP and other impurities were removed.
While Teviston awaits a treatment plant, its TCP levels remain above safe levels. In May, testing showed the TCP level was nearly three times the maximum acceptable level, and in March it was more than seven times the limit, according to the state's Safe Drinking Water Information System. In September, Teviston showed a negligible amount, an outlier that experts said could be skewed by the new well or the extreme drought. 
Teviston's marginalization dates back nearly a century, when Black workers arrived to work white-owned cotton farms. While the farmers had sought the Black workers, the workers were unwelcome in white towns, and they formed a tent city that became Teviston. Over the years the workforce became immigrant Mexican, another politically disadvantaged class, and white family farms were supplanted by corporations operating ever larger tracts of factory farms.      
Dorris Brooks, an African American woman who lives at the end of Teviston's water line, said past efforts to improve well water have only resulted in temporary relief. 
""You can see there's actually sludge that comes out of the tap,"" Brooks said.

Brooks, who moved to Teviston as an adult 43 years ago, questioned whether the settlement was just.
""That company got away with for messing up the water and the people's lives,"" Brooks said. ""There's sick people here.""

However, mega tech players Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) missed sales estimates in their recently released results, due primarily to supply chain issues. Read on, let’s discuss.
The S&P 500 reported its best month since November 2020, rising to record highs in October. Of the S&P 500 companies that reported earnings in October (approximately 50% did), more than 80% beat Wall Street analysts’ estimates, despite global supply chain issues.
However, the recently released results of some big tech companies disappointed investors. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) missed analyst estimates due to the semiconductor chip shortage for iPhones, iPads, and Macs. The shortage proved to be worse than expected and cost the company $6 billion. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) also has had a disappointing quarter, with declining sales growth. Moreover, the company expects its costs to increase in the current quarter due to the supply strain, labor shortages, and high shipping costs.
On top of that, Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar introduced bipartisan legislation that could rein in big tech, if passed, by prohibiting tech giants from advertising their own products and services over others, on their platform. The bill marks the latest in a string of legislation that Democrats and Republicans have introduced to curb the influence of these mega-sized companies.

Users will only require a Netflix subscription to play those games and there will be no additional fees or in-app purchases, the company said. 
Offering games for free to current subscribers echoes the strategy Netflix used when moving from a business of DVDs-by-mail to streaming movies. 
Its move into gaming was announced in July, as the company faced a sharp slowdown in new customers after years of rapid expansion, a pandemic-fueled boom in 2020 and searing competition from the likes of Disney+ and HBO Max. 

Netflix has already introduced its games like ""Stranger Things: 1984"", ""Stranger Things 3: The Game"", ""Card Blast"", ""Teeter Up"" and ""Shooting Hoops"" titles on Android to Netflix members in Spain, Italy and Poland.
The streaming giant also bought video game creator Night School Studio in September and rolled out five mobile gaming titles in select European markets.

131,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2021 02:26PM ET</span>","From Boeing to Mercedes, a U.S. worker rebellion swells over vaccine mandates","By Tina Bellon and Eric M. Johnson
AUSTIN/SEATTLE (Reuters) - In Wichita, Kansas, nearly half of the roughly 10,000 employees at aircraft companies  Textron Inc  (NYSE:TXT) and Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE:SPR) remain unvaccinated against COVID-19, risking their jobs in defiance of a federal mandate, according to a union official.
""We're going to lose a lot of employees over this,"" said Cornell Beard, head of the local Machinists union district. Many workers did not object to the vaccines as such, he said, but were staunchly opposed to what they see as government meddling in personal health decisions.
The union district has hired a Texas-based lawyer to assist employees and prepare potential lawsuits against the companies should requests for medical or religious exemptions to vaccination be denied. 
A life-long Democrat, Beard said he would no longer vote for the party. ""They'll never get another vote from me and I'm telling the workers here the same thing."" 
The clock is ticking for companies that want to continue gaining federal contracts under an executive order by Democratic President Joe Biden, which requires all contractor employees be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by Dec. 8.
That means federal contract workers need to have received their last COVID-19 shot at least two weeks before the deadline to gain maximum protection, according to U.S. government guidance. 
With a three-week gap between shots of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, workers must get the first jab by Wednesday. If the government holds fast to its deadline, it is already too late to choose  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s vaccine, which is given in two doses four weeks apart. Workers could opt to get Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s single-shot vaccine until Nov. 24 to meet the deadline.
Vaccines remain by far the most effective way to prevent COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths, particularly faced with the extremely contagious Delta variant of the virus that can cause infections even among those fully vaccinated. 
Despite vocal opposition from some, vaccine mandates have been effective at shrinking the rates of the unvaccinated and convincing the reluctant to roll up their sleeves.
Several big employers such as Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), 3M and airlines including American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and JetBlue have imposed mandates. In some industries, including among food workers, unions have supported vaccine requirements.
But the mandate has stirred protests from workers in industries across the country, as well as from Republican state officials.
Opposition to the mandate could potentially lead to thousands of U.S. workers losing their jobs and imperil an already sluggish economic recovery, union leaders, workers and company executives said.
More legal clashes are likely over how companies decide requests for vaccination exemptions. 
For the companies, time is getting tight, though the Biden administration has signaled federal contractors will not have to immediately lay off unvaccinated workers who miss the Dec. 8 deadline.
Under government guidance published on Monday, companies will have flexibility over how to implement the mandate, which may allow them to avoid mass firings. 
""A covered contractor should determine the appropriate means of enforcement with respect to its employee,"" the guidance said.
For Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co in the United States, more than 7,000 workers have applied for religious exemptions and around 1,000 are seeking medical exemptions, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. That amounts to some 6% of the planemaker's roughly 125,000 U.S employees.
'ILLEGAL, IMMORAL AND IMPRACTICAL'
At a rally last week outside Boeing property in Auburn, south of Seattle, many of the three dozen workers gathered in driving rain said they would rather be escorted off Boeing property on Dec. 8 than take a vaccine. Others said they would pursue early retirement. 
""The mandate is illegal, immoral and impractical,"" said one veteran Boeing program analyst who attended the rally. ""We are standing together against a company and government trampling on our rights.""
Many legal experts have said vaccine mandates in the interest of public health are legal. The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected several challenges to mandates, with the high court last week turning away a healthcare worker who sought a religious exemption to a COVID-19 vaccine mandate.
The rebellion has put Boeing executives in a bind. The company could lose skilled staff, but must comply with a presidential order.
A Boeing spokesperson said the company was committed to maintaining a safe working environment for its employees.
The order's provision for religious and medical exemptions is causing more tension.
Two Textron workers who requested religious exemptions told Reuters the company's human resources representatives quizzed them on the name of their church leaders and asked detailed questions about their faith.
Textron declined to respond to questions, but in a statement said it was obligated to comply with Biden's order and was taking steps to do so.
""Employees who are unable to receive the COVID-19 vaccination due to a medical condition or sincerely held religious belief are being provided an opportunity to request an accommodation from this requirement,"" Textron said.
Spirit AeroSystems did not respond to a request for comment.
Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX)' CEO Greg Hayes last week warned the U.S. defense firm will lose ""several thousand"" employees because of the mandate.
A group representing FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX),  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) and other cargo carriers said it would be virtually impossible to have all their workforces vaccinated by the deadline.
Some companies have imposed vaccine mandates even absent immediate government regulation. 
Mercedes-Benz USA, the U.S. unit of German carmaker  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) which is not a U.S. government contractor, told employees in an October email seen by Reuters that proof of vaccination against COVID-19 would become a condition of employment beginning Jan. 4.
The carmaker said it implemented the move in anticipation of a separate U.S. government vaccine mandate that would apply to businesses with at least 100 employees, affecting some 80 million workers nationwide.
Less than half of the company's workers at U.S. import processing centers are vaccinated and many refuse to get a shot, according to a source familiar with the matter.

Mercedes USA in a statement said it had given employees 90-day notice to fulfill the requirement, adding that two thirds of its U.S. employees - not including factory workers in Alabama - have provided proof of vaccination to date.
""We expect that the vast majority of our employees will provide proof of vaccination before the deadline,"" the company said.

(Reuters) -Marathon Petroleum Corp signaled on Tuesday that a sustained rally in natural gas prices could take a toll on earnings, sending the largest U.S. refiner's shares down 4%.
The warning comes after U.S. natural gas prices soared more than 60% in the third quarter -- translating into higher costs since natgas is used to power refining operations -- as sky-rocketing global rates keep demand for U.S. liquefied natural gas exports elevated. [NGA/]
""For every $1 change in natural gas prices, we anticipate there is an approximate $360 million impact to annual EBITDA to our R&M (Refining and Marketing) segment,"" Chief Financial Officer Maryann Mannen said.
""Based on current prices, we estimate that in the fourth quarter, higher natural gas prices have the potential to impact our business by an incremental $0.30 per barrel,"" Mannen added.
Marathon said there was still some uncertainty around supply-demand dynamics heading into the fourth quarter, but lower inventories and strong holiday travel could be supportive.
""Looking at next year, if global product inventories remain tight and demand continues to recover, we would expect the refining sector to rebound in 2022,"" Chief Executive Officer Michael Hennigan said.
Total throughput, or amount of crude processed, rose to 2.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in the third quarter from 2.5 bpd in the year-ago period.
The refiner expects fourth quarter total refinery throughput to be 2.79 bpd.
The company also said it is pursuing strategic alternatives, which could include a sale of its 68,000 bpd Kenai, Alaska refinery. 

Marathon posted an adjusted profit of 73 cents per share, beating analysts' average estimate of 71 cents per share, according to Refinitiv IBES.
However, rivals Valero and Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) beat quarterly earnings expectations by a larger margin, and that could weigh on Marathon's shares, brokerage  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) wrote in a note.

(Reuters) -Pfizer Inc on Tuesday said it expected 2021 sales of the COVID-19 vaccine it developed with German partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) to reach $36 billion and forecast another $29 billion from the shot in 2022, topping analyst estimates for both years.
The U.S. drugmaker said it is seeking to sign more vaccine deals with countries, which could drive sales even higher next year. It has the capacity to produce 4 billion doses in 2022 and has based its projections on sales of 1.7 billion doses.
Still, Chief Executive Albert Bourla said he was concerned that low- and middle-income countries would not place orders for next year's vaccine doses early enough, and could again end up behind wealthier countries.
""The high-income countries, they have the tendency to be way more proactive, and they are placing their orders,"" Bourla said in an interview. ""I want to make sure that I go on record publicly... they need to place orders, period.""
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) said it expects to deliver at least one billion doses of its vaccine to low- and middle- income countries next year. 
The vaccine brought in sales of $13 billion in the third quarter. The company splits gross profit from sales of the shot in most of the world with BioNTech.
Beyond 2022, Pfizer said it expects the market for COVID-19 vaccines to be durable, and continue generating sales for years to come. 
Pfizer said it is planning for private markets for the vaccine to emerge sometime in the foreseeable future, particularly in the United States. But Bourla said Pfizer may yet sign another big supply contract with the U.S. government.
""As long as the government thinks they should be going with mass vaccinations that they buy and distribute, we will support them,"" he said.
Pfizer shares were up more than 5% at $45.92. 
The Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was the first to receive U.S. authorization last year, and U.S. regulators are likely to give the green light to begin administering it to children ages 5 to 11 as soon as Wednesday.
Pfizer's updated vaccine sales forecast suggests the shot will account for as much as 44% of its total revenue for the year. 
Wall Street on average expected COVID-19 vaccine sales of $35.44 billion this year and $22.15 billion for 2022, according to Refinitiv data. 
FLU-LIKE MARKET
Analysts have said that Pfizer and other COVID-19 vaccine makers stand to reap billions of dollars from annual vaccine boosters over the next few years.
Pfizer is already planning for a potential clinical study of a fourth dose of the vaccine, which could generate the type of data to support annual vaccination, according to Pfizer Chief Scientific Officer Mikael Dolsten.
Pending that data, he said, the company could file for annual COVID-19 vaccinations before next year's flu season.
U.S. regulators recently authorized a round of booster doses for certain age and risk groups for the Pfizer/BioNTech,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) vaccines in the face of data showing protection can wane over time. Other nations are also administering booster shots. 
A majority of booster doses are expected to be sold to high-income countries, which pay more for the shots as part of Pfizer's plan to link the price of its vaccine to a country’s ability to pay.
Sales of the vaccine, called Comirnaty, have vastly outpaced those from rivals Moderna and Johnson & Johnson, who have been unable to keep up with Pfizer's manufacturing scale-up.

The company is on track to deliver 2.3 billion doses of the vaccine, out of the roughly 3 billion it plans to produce this year. 
Pfizer is also studying an experimental antiviral drug to treat COVID-19. If it receives authorization, they could start supplying doses before the end of the year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Senator Tom Cotton has removed his hold on President Joe Biden's nominee for a key post in the U.S.-China tech battle, after the official said he would ""aggressively"" police tech exports to Beijing, according to a Cotton aide and a document seen by Reuters.
The decision removes a hurdle to a final confirmation vote on Alan Estevez's nomination as undersecretary for the U.S. Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), but it is unclear whether Democratic Senator Bob Menendez, who opposed the nominee in a committee vote, will allow the process to move ahead quickly.
Estevez, a former Pentagon official, was nominated in July for the position at BIS, the agency that oversees U.S. exports and which has found itself at the center of the U.S.-China tech war.    
    But Cotton last month placed a ""hold"" on a final Senate confirmation vote, demanding answers to written questions aimed at assessing whether Estevez would tow a hard line on China. A Cotton aide told Reuters on Monday that the senator from Arkansas had removed his hold after receiving a letter from the nominee. 
In a written response dated Oct. 29 and seen by Reuters, Estevez said he would do his best to accelerate the roll-out of new rules on advanced technologies and, if appropriate, strengthen U.S. restrictions on sales of semiconductor software and technology.
    He also promised to consider extending a rule that restricts the overseas sale of semiconductor chips to Huawei Technologies, the Chinese telecommunications equipment maker blacklisted by the United States, to other blacklisted Chinese firms with links to the military or human rights violations.
""I will not hesitate to aggressively use the tools available at BIS to control exports of technologies that can harm our national security and foreign policy interests,"" Estevez wrote in his response to Cotton and Republican Senator Bill Hagerty, who co-signed the letter to Estevez last month.
Estevez added that it was ""imperative"" for the Biden administration to keep China from reaching its goal of matching or surpassing U.S. military might.
Any senator can hold up a fast-track confirmation process that requires consent by all 100 senators.
    Menendez came out against Estevez when the Senate Banking Committee took up his confirmation and later also opposed expediting a final full vote in the Senate.

    The New Jersey Democrat's opposition stems from Estevez's response to questions regarding returning oversight of U.S. fire arms exports to the State Department. A spokesman for Menendez on Tuesday told Reuters the issue still had not been resolved.
The Commerce Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Earlier this year, the agency sued the tech giant and its subsidiary, Amazon Logistics, alleging the company failed to fully pay tips that drivers in its Amazon Flex (NASDAQ:FLEX) program had earned. 
Amazon Flex drivers deliver goods and groceries ordered through programs like Prime Now and Amazon Fresh. The lawsuit alleged the company kept drivers' tips over a two-and-a-half year period and stopped the practice after learning of the agency's investigation in 2019.

Amazon agreed in February to settle the case and surrender all the money it withheld, the FTC said.
The agency said it will send 139,507 checks and 1,621 PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) payments to Amazon Flex drivers. Drivers who had more than $5 withheld by Amazon will receive the full amount of their withheld tips. The highest amount going to a single Amazon Flex driver is more than $28,000, while the average amount is $422, the FTC said.

Given this backdrop, we believe that companies with the potential to develop metaverse products—Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (FB), Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), and Immersion Corporation (NASDAQ:IMMR)—could be solid bets to cash in on the emergence of this revolutionary technology. Let’s discuss.Broadly speaking, metaverse refers to an alternate reality, a ‘mirror world’ where people work and socialize, a collective shared virtual space created by the convergence of physical reality and virtual reality. With cryptocurrencies and blockchains now coming to the fore, with a growing understanding of their scope, metaverse has been gaining steam.
Recently, several tech and gaming companies have been increasing efforts to build a metaverse. As a result of this push, the virtual reality market is expected to grow by $75.57 billion, at a 55.3% CAGR , between 2020 - 2025.
Given this backdrop, we think it could be wise to invest in tech stocks Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc.

MILAN (Reuters) - Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) will seek technology partnerships as it moves ahead with the transition towards cleaner mobility, new CEO Benedetto Vigna said on Tuesday after the sportscar maker raised this year's core earnings guidance.
Vigna was presenting his first set of quarterly results. 
The technology industry veteran, who took the CEO role at the beginning of September, must help drive the company known for its roaring, high-octane engines into a new era of silent, electric powertrains.
Asked if he was concerned about Ferrari's ability to pivot to technologies that require a lot of investment, Vigna told analysts: ""I would say that the solution is to go through partnerships."" 
He said Ferrari was ""small"" but it had a strong brand.
""I think it's important to leverage, at the best, the partnerships. It's important that you select the areas where you want to excel. And on the others, you work with partners."" 
New partnerships could develop along the lines of an existing tie-up with Britain's Yasa, now part of Daimler (OTC:DDAIF), which is supplying electric drive technologies for Ferrari's SF90 Stradale and 296 GTB hybrid models.
""I think I can bring the experience that I've been able to navigate ... in an environment that is changing pretty fast,"" said Vigna, 52, a former head of the largest division of semiconductor maker STMicroelectronics. 
Analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said they saw Ferrari as an emerging electric vehicle (EV) play that is being very much overlooked by the market. 
""The window of opportunity to own Ferrari while the market holds its 'EVs are bad for Ferrari' narrative won't last long,"" they said.
Ferrari's Milan-listed shares shares closed up 1.19%, paring a previous fall to hit new all-time highs after a rise of almost 20% since early October.
The company was seeing a ""record order intake"" worldwide, particularly in China and the United States, Vigna said, adding that it had no supply-chain issues.
""The team in Ferrari with also the support of suppliers have been able to manage properly this (supply chain) situation that many players are facing all over the world,"" he said.
A richer product mix, thanks to the hybrid SF90 family and the Monza SP1 and SP2 models, drove a 12% growth in third-quarter core earnings, prompting the upgrade to full-year guidance, Ferrari said.
It now expects full-year adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) for 2021 of around 1.52 billion euros ($1.76 billion). That is above the previous guidance of between 1.45-1.50 billion euros.

In the third quarter, adjusted EBITDA grew 12% to 371 million euros, slightly topping analyst expectations of 365 million euros, according to a Reuters poll, while revenue rose 19% to 1.053 billion euros.($1 = 0.8620 euros)

(Reuters) - European shares crept up to a record high on Tuesday as a strong outlook from hearing aid maker Demant supported healthcare stocks, although broader gains were stifled by losses in miners and the prospect of major central bank meetings. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index closed 0.1% higher at 479.71 points, with healthcare stocks leading gains with a 1.3% rise. Denmark's Demant was among the best performers in the sector after it unexpectedly hiked its annual profit outlook.
Mining stocks led losses, down 2.9% on a slump in iron ore and copper prices, as loose supply conditions and a poor demand outlook for China rattled metal markets. [IRONORE/]
 Antofagasta  (LON:ANTO) and ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT) SA were among the worst performers in the sector.
The STOXX 600 had closed at a record high on Monday, carrying over strong gains from October on the back of positive earnings and a jump in bank stocks fuelled by expectations of a rate hike by the European Central Bank next year.
""The environment of higher inflation and higher yields favours certain corporates, but it's uncertain for others, which leaves you in a very volatile market,"" said Bert Colijn, senior economist at ING.
""But the underlying moves are positive, with better-than-expected GDP figures and a quicker-than-expected recovery.""
About 166 companies of the STOXX 600 have reported quarterly earnings so far and 65.7% have topped profit estimates, according to Refinitiv IBES data. In a typical quarter, 52% beat estimates.
Focus now turns to a decision by the Fed on when it plans to begin tapering its massive stimulus measures, as well as a decision from the Bank of England later in the week. Both banks are expected to outline measures to contain a recent spike in inflation. 
A survey showed euro zone manufacturing activity remained strong in October, but supply chain bottlenecks and logistical problems sent input costs soaring and curtailed growth.
Among individual stocks, meal-kit delivery firm HelloFresh surged 17.3% after raising its sales forecast for 2021.

Weighing on UK's blue-chip FTSE 100, the world's largest online betting group Flutter Entertainment dropped 7.7% after trimming its full-year forecast due to unfavourable sports results and a temporary closure of its Dutch operations.
London-based Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) slumped 7.8% despite reporting a doubling in profit for the third quarter. The bank said it had $4.2 billion in exposure to China's real estate sector, where China Evergrande Group has been grappling with an enormous debt pile.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s shares fell 4% in early trading on Tuesday, after a steep jump following the news of the biggest-ever order - 100,000 electric cars for Hertz - on Oct. 25, which helped Tesla breach $1 trillion in market capitalization.
Musk tweeted late Monday, ""If any of this is based on Hertz, I'd like to emphasize that no contract has been signed yet.""
""Hertz deal has zero effect on our economics.""
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
However, Hertz said in a statement that the deliveries of the Teslas had already started. 
""We are seeing very strong early demand for Teslas in our rental fleet, which reflects market demand for Tesla vehicles."" 
Hertz's interim Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields had told Reuters last week the order will primarily include Model 3 vehicles. Considering Tesla's cheapest Model 3 sedan starts at about $44,000, the order could be worth about $4.4 billion, if the entire order were for the mass-market sedan.

""Tesla has far more demand than production, therefore we will only sell cars to Hertz for the same margin as to consumers,"" Musk said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit on Tuesday aimed at stopping Penguin Random House, the world's biggest book publisher, from buying competitor Simon & Schuster, saying the deal would give the company ""outsized influence"" over what Americans read.
German media group Bertelsmann, which owns Penguin Random House, last year agreed to pay $2.175 billion in cash to buy Simon and Schuster from ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC), strengthening its presence in the United States and adding novelist Stephen King, Pulitzer Prize winner Anthony Doerr and veteran journalist Bob  Woodward  (NASDAQ:WWD) to its stable of authors.
In its complaint filed in federal court in Washington, the Justice Department said the deal would give ""outsized influence over who and what is published, and how much authors are paid for their work.""
The complaint stresses the importance of the companies competing for top-selling books as well as the money earned by the people who write them.
""Authors are the lifeblood of book publishing in America. But just five publishers control the U.S. publishing industry,"" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. ""If the world's largest book publisher is permitted to acquire one of its biggest rivals, it will have unprecedented control over this important industry.""
The complaint said that the publishers have argued that the deal is needed so they can better negotiate with ecommerce giant Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). But the Justice Department in its complaint quoted a top Penguin Random House executive as saying that he ""never, never bought into that argument"" and that a post-merger goal would be to become an ""exceptional partner"" to Amazon. 
The department did not specify when or in what context the executive's comments were made.
If the merger were to go forward, the deal would give Penguin Random House nearly half of the market for publishing rights to blockbuster books while its nearest competitors would be less than half its size, the complaint said.
The complaint also said that Simon & Schuster is the fourth biggest U.S. book publisher and that, if combined with Penguin Random House, its U.S. revenues would be twice that of their closest competitor's.

Penguin Random House and Simon & Schuster said in a joint statement that they will ""fight this lawsuit vigorously."" They said the government did not allege that the deal would harm competition in book sales. 
""The market for selling books is unconcentrated and the combined shares are well below the levels of concern,"" they added.

By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) said on Wednesday that 175 of its suppliers have now committed to use clean energy for the work they do for the iPhone maker, helping to bring more than 9 gigawatts of clean energy onto power grids.
The new round of suppliers - which is an increase from the 70 suppliers and nearly 8 gigawatts of power the company reported last year - are part of the company's efforts to make its sprawling global supply chain carbon-neutral by 2030. 
The companies must commit to using energy sources such as solar or wind energy for the work they do for Apple, part of Apple's efforts announced last year for its products to have what it calls a ""net-zero"" climate impact.
Among the suppliers is South Korea's SK Hynix Inc, which supplies memory chips for Apple devices and is one of the first Korean firms to join Apple's program. Also joining will be Franco-Italian chipmaker STMicroelectronics, a top supplier of sensors and other chips in iPhones that Apple said has started nine new renewable energy projects since committing to the program.
Apple now has suppliers on the program in 24 countries, including India, Japan and South Korea.
""One of the things that comes along with this is building a core of businesses in different markets on different grids who are demanding clean energy. That's helpful to policy makers,"" Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives told Reuters.

Apple previously signed major suppliers such as Foxconn parent Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, which assembles many of its products, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, which makes Apple's processor chips, to clean energy pledges in 2019.
Apple also announced it was providing funding for 10 smaller renewable energy projects aimed at helping renewable power to under-resourced communities. The projects include work with communities in South Africa, the Philippines, Colombia and the Oceti Sakowin Power Authority formed by six Sioux tribes in the western United States.

(Reuters) - KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc said on Tuesday its third-quarter distributable earnings more than doubled to $925.1 million, driven by strong growth in management fees and profit from asset sales in its private equity business.
KKR and other private equity firms have benefited from a flurry of mergers and acquisitions as the global economy has been recovering from the pandemic. Its peers Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Inc and  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) Inc reported record earnings last month due to strong asset sales.
KKR said it generated $448 million in quarterly income from asset sales such as divestment of its stake in supplement maker The Bountiful Company to the Swiss food giant Nestle SA (SIX:NESN) in a $5.75 billion deal.
Its shares rose 1.5% to $78.83 per share in late morning trading.
KKR said it invested $24 billion to buy new assets, including a majority stake Indian cosmetics firm Vini Cosmetics for $625 million and to acquire several apartment buildings such as The District at Scottsdale in Arizona.
KKR said it will continue to assess whether to buy a secondaries business or build its own team to make such investments. 
""As we've talked about in the past, the secondary and co-invest space is adjacent to a lot of what we do,"" KKR Co-Chief Executive Scott Nuttall said during an analyst earnings call, his first after being named to the position last month.
""It's not a have to do, but it is something that we continue to spend time on.""
Several investment firms purchased secondaries businesses in recent months to tap into the growing market for second-hand private equity assets. On Monday, Franklin Templeton agreed to buy secondaries firm Lexington Partners for $1.75 billion.
STRONG EARNINGS
KKR said its after-tax distributable earnings per share doubled to $1.05, exceeding the average Wall Street analyst forecast of 93 cents, according to Refinitiv. 
Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), KKR said net income rose 7% to $1.1 billion, largely due to revenue from its insurance subsidiary, Global Atlantic.
KKR's private equity and opportunistic real estate fund portfolios rose 9% and 14%, respectively. Its leveraged credit funds rose 1%. Private equity funds managed by KKR rivals Blackstone and Carlyle appreciated by 9.9% and 4%, respectively.

KKR said its total assets under management reached $459 billion, versus $429 billion in the prior quarter, on strong fundraising. Its unspent capital remained flat at $111 billion.

(Reuters) -  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) on Tuesday announced a new round of technologies aimed at making its cloud computing services work in data centers it does not own - including the cloud data centers of its rivals.
The strategy, Microsoft executives and analysts say, has been key to the company's rise in the cloud computing infrastructure market, which research firm  Gartner  (NYSE:IT) estimates hit $64.3 billion and where Microsoft is second only to market leader Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Amazon Web Services. Microsoft last week said revenue from Azure, its flagship cloud offering, grew 48%, results that helped it overtake Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) as the world's most valuable publicly traded company.
Microsoft's strategy has involved constructing its most lucrative cloud software services, such as database tools, so that they can run inside its own data centers, those owned by customers or even those of rivals like Amazon.
Microsoft's cloud and artificial intelligence chief Scott Guthrie told Reuters that the move has persuaded some customers to use its services when they cannot always use Microsoft's data centers. Royal Bank of Canada, Guthrie said, faces legal requirements to keep some of its computing work in its own data centers and uses a technology called Azure Arc to connect those facilities to Microsoft's cloud.
""The challenge with higher-level services historically has been the concern of 'lock in' - what happens if I can only use them in your data center?"" Guthrie said. ""That freedom of movement causes customers to feel much more comfortable using those services.""

Ed Anderson, a vice president distinguished analyst with Gartner, said the approach does open doors for Microsoft with customers, but it also forces the company to compete on the quality of its software services rather than by packaging them with cheap computing power.
""To be honest, that's a better way to compete,"" Anderson said. ""Customers are suspicious of rhetoric. They look for evidence of capabilities and are cautious of things where in principle technology is multi-cloud but maybe the software licensing doesn't support it.""

(Reuters) - DuPont (NYSE:DD) Inc on Tuesday agreed to buy engineering materials maker Rogers (NYSE:ROG) Corp for $5.2 billion, its biggest deal since splitting from DowDuPont, to supply to fast-growing industries such as electric vehicles, 5G and clean energy.
Chief Executive Officer Ed Breen, a well-known deal maker, has been building out DuPont's high-margin businesses such as electronics and water solutions. The company in July snapped up Laird Performance Materials for $2.3 billion after earlier divesting its nutrition & biosciences unit.
On Tuesday, the company announced plans to sell a substantial portion of its more cyclical mobility & materials unit, including its stake in the DuPont Teijin Films joint venture.
DuPont is looking at a couple of other targets, Breen told Reuters, adding that any deal would be to expand in the company's core businesses.
Breen, who has previously headed Tyco International, Motorola (NYSE:MSI) and General Instrument, is credited with being instrumental in the merger of Dow and DuPont and the spilt of the chemicals conglomerate into three companies later. DuPont then emerged as an industrial solutions-focused business.
Rogers stock was up 30% in morning trade, just shy of the offer of $277 per share. DuPont's shares gained 5%, reversing course from premarket trade. 
DuPont also beat third-quarter estimates, as strong demand and pricing gains helped offset higher raw material costs. 
Sales of $4.3 billion topped estimates of $4.1 billion, while profit of $1.15 per share beat expectations of $1.12, according to Refinitiv IBES data. 

However, DuPont cut its full-year sales and profit forecasts, after having raised them twice so far, citing slowing orders in automotive markets due to a global chip shortage.
Breen said he expects the chip shortage to ""persist well into 2022, though may be not at the same level as now,"" adding he expects it to ease only when next capacity comes online, expected through next year.

Renewed restrictions due to the Delta variant of COVID-19 in some Eastern markets as well as in parts of Europe hampered demand for the M.A.C brand owner's lipsticks and foundations at brick-and-mortar stores.
The cosmetics maker's muted forecast overshadowed a strong first quarter boosted by strength in its La Mer and Clinique skin care brands as shoppers kept up their nighttime routines.
""The lack of pass-through from a strong first quarter is most notable,"" Stifel analyst Mark Astrachan said.
Estee said its makeup category was the only segment yet to reach 2019 levels and added that traffic at its stores that were open also had not breached pre-pandemic levels.
A global supply chain crunch resulting from port congestions and a shortage of labor has led to delays in transportation, and is expected to add to its expenses through the rest of fiscal 2022.
The company now expects net sales to rise between 12% and 15% in fiscal 2022, down from its prior estimate of a 13% to 16% increase.
Still, Chief Financial Officer Tracey Travis said  Estee Lauder  (NYSE:EL) was in ""very good shape"" for the holiday season, adding that the company has been taking measures including producing products early and using air freight to avoid delays.

Hence, we think it could be wise to stay away from overvalued EV stocks Hyzon Motors (HYZN), Lordstown Motors (RIDE), Vicinity Motor (VEV), and Ayro (AYRO), which were the worst performing industry players last month. Let’s discuss.The electric vehicle (EV) industry is expected to grow significantly in the long run based on supportive government policies and regulations amid rising automobile emission concerns. However, the EV market faces chip and labor shortages and supply chain issues, which make the industry’s near-term prospects bleak.
Furthermore, the industry has become overcrowded, with several new entrants vying for market share. But the fundamental weakness and overvaluation of many new participants make them risky bets for investors. In a reference to how the market values EVs versus traditional internal combustion engine (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) makers, Bernstein’s Tony Sacconaghi stated, “In 2014, they accounted for 15% of all BEVs [battery electric vehicles] sold. Today they account for 28%. However, even if they ultimately were to account for 50% of all EVs sold by 2030—which may be aggressive—it remains difficult to justify their current valuations.’’
Given this backdrop, we think it could be wise to stay away from EV stocks Hyzon Motors Inc. (HYZN), Lordstown Motors Corp. (RIDE), Vicinity Motor Corp. (VEV), and Ayro, Inc. (AYRO) now. Their sky-high valuations are not justified by their weak financials and growth prospects. Furthermore, these stocks were the worst-performing industry participants last month.

The ongoing semiconductor chip shortage continues to impact EV production. Nevertheless, falling EV battery costs and increased demand for EVs have heightened investors’ interest in the industry. This is evidenced by the Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF (DRIV) and the KraneShares Electric Vehicles and Future Mobility Index ETF’s (KARS) 12.3% and 15.6% gains, respectively, over the past month. This compares to the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 5.9% returns over the same period.
So, we think it could be wise to add EV stocks, Tesla Inc. (TSLA), Lucid Group Inc. (LCID),  Xpeng Inc . (XPEV), and Li Auto Inc. (LI), to your watchlist now. These stocks were the top-performing industry participants last month.

Investing.com – Clorox stock (NYSE:CLX) gained nearly 3% Tuesday as the maker of bleaches, wipes and other cleaning products posted first-quarter sales and profit that were higher than estimates even as both were lower year-on-year
Gross margins in the first quarter eroded a massive 1190 basis points to 37% owing to higher commodity, manufacturing and logistics costs. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percent.
The company exuded confidence about rebuilding its margins, notwithstanding a challenging operating environment and incremental cost headwinds.
It reiterated its annual guidance of a 2% to 6% decline in sales and an erosion of 300-400 basis points in gross margins. Net sales in the last financial year were $7.34 billion.
September-quarter net sales fell 6%, to $1.80 billion as pandemic-driven shopping for cleaning products cooled off. Volumes were weaker and so were sales of higher-margin products.

Investing.com —  Avis Budget  Group Inc (NASDAQ:CAR) shares have rocketed Tuesday morning following a strong third-quarter earnings report, which saw its sales nearly double from a year ago as demand for car rentals comes back.

The strong earnings came following a run-up of short interest in the past few months. Avis stock has already been halted several times for volatility today. 
Prior to its third-quarter earnings, the company had already made fantastic gains in 2021, climbing from around $35 per share to its high of $179.82 on Monday. 
According to the APE Wisdom website, today's move has seen Avis become one of the top trending stocks on social media and one of the top four most discussed stocks on the Reddit WallStreetBets forum.

Investing.com – Generac stock (NYSE:GNRC) slipped more than 6% Tuesday as investors feared share dilution from the generator-maker's offer to buy Canadian smart thermostat maker Ecobeen for up to $770-million.
Generac will pay $200 million in cash along with $450 million in stock to buy Ecobee. The company could issue another $120 million in stock to sew the deal based on Ecobee meeting certain conditions. The acquisition is expected to close during the fourth quarter.
Typically the issue of fresh equity depresses profits per share.
Adding to the subdued sentiment for the stock were the company’s third-quarter numbers with both earnings and sales falling short of estimates.
Net sales increased 34% to a record $943 million during the third quarter but came in below the $961.36 million analysts expected.
Adjusted profit per share rose by 27 cents to $2.35 but was below the $2.37 analysts forecasted.
The company maintained its full-year net sales growth guidance range of approximately 47%-50% on 2020 sales of $2.5 billion."

But given the sector’s intense competition, not all cannabis operators are well-positioned to capitalize on the industry tailwinds. Therefore, we believe investors are better off avoiding fundamentally weak cannabis stocks HEXO (NASDAQ:HEXO), Flora Growth (FLGC), and Neptune Wellness (NEPT). These stocks declined more than 15% in price in October. Read on.The U.S. cannabis industry has been gaining steam due to the legalization of recreational marijuana in several states and a change in consumer preference toward innovative cannabis products. However, the health risks associated with cannabis use in adolescents raise questions related to marijuana consumption. Furthermore, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has to date not approved cannabis as a treatment for cancer or any other medical condition.
Several challenges, including restricted access to capital and a stigma surrounding cannabis use, could impede the industry’s growth. On the other hand, with cannabis laws gradually becoming more favorable for the cannabis industry, more players are entering the space, making the industry increasingly competitive. Therefore, not all cannabis operators are well-poised to withstand the challenges and survive in the heavily competitive market.
Given this backdrop, it could be wise to steer clear of cannabis stocks HEXO Corp. (HEXO), Flora Growth Corp. (FLGC), and Neptune Wellness Solutions Inc. (NASDAQ:NEPT), which possess weak fundamentals. These stocks declined more than 15% in price in October.

160,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2021 11:28AM ET</span>",BlackRock raises $673 million for climate-focused infrastructure fund,"By Simon Jessop and Ross Kerber
GLASGOW/BOSTON (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) told Reuters it has raised a target-beating $673 million for an infrastructure fund with backing from the French, German and Japanese governments to invest in climate-focused projects such as renewable energy in emerging markets. 
The world's largest money manager hopes the fund, announced on Tuesday and dubbed the Climate Finance Partnership, will show how to mobilize private capital in developing countries to tackle climate change, a sticking point at United Nations climate talks under way in Glasgow. Investors have been wary of investing in risky projects without more certainty they will get a return.
State-owned development banks from France, Germany and Japan and philanthropic institutions such as the Grantham Environmental Trust and the Quadrivium Foundation are providing 20% of the fund's capital and have agreed to take losses before other investors. 
While a number of multibillion-dollar renewable energy funds have been raised over the last year to help build out solar, wind and other projects, the vast bulk has been spent in richer countries offering investors lower risk.
Emerging economies, including countries across Africa, Asia and Latin America, will need around $1 trillion a year out to 2050 to help them transition to a low-carbon economy, BlackRock said. In 2020, just $150 billion was invested, excluding China.
BlackRock and the fund's other backers are trying to muster more support for such emerging markets-focused initiatives at the COP26 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow. The new fund could help developed nations meet a target of mobilizing $100 billion a year to help poorer countries tackle climate change.
Among the fund's 22 backers were French energy company TotalEnergies and institutional investors including AXA and Dai-ichi Life Insurance. The fund comfortably beat its fundraising target of $500 million, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said on Tuesday, speaking at the Green Horizon Summit, held alongside the COP26 climate talks in Scotland.
""We could have raised a lot more and this is a great example of leveraging what public capital can do,"" Fink said. He also backed the concept of energy companies spinning off a portion of their assets and said world leaders should rethink how institutions like the World Bank could be reformed to harness more private-sector lending.
""We're going to have to change finance,"" he said.
The fund has a typical 10-year lock-up with a five-year investment period, with the average equity investment likely to be in the $25 million-$75 million range, David Giordano, global head of renewable power at BlackRock Alternative Investors, told Reuters.
""One of the key things that we talked about with our partners back in 2018, when we started down this path, was really coming up with something that was simple but did provide that sense of de-risking the emerging markets,"" Giordano said.
Kenya, Morocco and Egypt were all attractive for investment, as were Peru and Vietnam, where the government was ""really committed"" to the energy transition, Giordano said.

Renewable energy in non-OECD countries is expected to represent 49% of global energy capacity by 2050, Edwin Conway, global head of BlackRock Alternative Investors, said.
""Now, that's huge ... I think we're talking about decades, with regard to the opportunities that are ahead,"" Conway said.

Investing.com — Ford Motor (NYSE:F) stock has stayed resilient, climbing just over 0.8% after initially sliding at the open, despite a downgrade by Nomura on Tuesday.
In a note to investors, Nomura analyst Anindya Das downgraded Ford to reduce from neutral with a price target of $13. 
""Ford's stock is up 104% year-to-date. By comparison, Ford's peer group (comprising GM, Stellantis, Toyota, Honda, and Nissan) is up 23%, while the S&P 500 is also up 23%,"" said Das.
The analyst continued by saying that the market has been enthused and justified in by several factors such as the company's success in offsetting volume and market share losses and management's progress with turning around Ford's international operations.
""However, we find it difficult to justify the current premium valuation over peers, especially after Ford’s weak wholesales outlook for 2022 (+10% y-y) due to difficulty in securing sufficient chip supplies,"" added Das.
""This implies Ford’s 2021 wholesales would still be ~17% lower than 2019-levels. In contrast, Ford’s Asian peers are already indicating significant production normalization in November globally, which would continue thereafter,"" the analyst said. "

Production of the iPad was down half from Apple's original plans for the past two months, the newspaper said on its website, adding that parts intended for older iPhones were also being switched to the iPhone 13.
Apple has weathered the supply crunch better than many other companies due to its massive purchasing power and long-term supply agreements with chip vendors, eating into its rivals' market share in the smartphone and tablet space in the third quarter.
However, Apple's top boss Tim Cook warned the impact of supply constraints will be worse during the current holiday sales quarter and the chip shortage is now affecting most of the company's products.
The iPhone maker is prioritizing its flagship iPhone 13 output in part because it forecasts stronger demand for the smartphone than for the iPad as Western markets begin to emerge from the pandemic, Nikkei said, citing unidentified sources.
Moreover, a vacuum created by Huawei's exit from the market has shifted demand to players including Apple in China, which helped the company's sales in the last quarter. Apple posted a staggering 83% annual sales growth in China during the quarter.

The iPhone business, Apple's largest, raked in about $192 billion last year. The iPad business, which dominates the tablet space with over a third of global market share, brought in nearly $32 billion. 
Apple did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.

(Reuters) -Under Armour Inc on Tuesday raised its full-year forecasts, alleviating investor concerns regarding holiday inventory shortages flagged by nearly all its peers and sending its shares up 16%.
Factories in Vietnam, where Under Armour (NYSE:UA) sources about one-third of its products from, have begun reopening after months-long shutdowns that has caused severe distress to many apparel brands.
Bigger rival  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) has cut its fiscal 2022 sales estimates, expecting delays during the holiday season, while Puma SE advised people to shop early for Christmas.
""Nearly all factories that Under Armour does business with, including those in Vietnam are open,"" finance chief David Bergman said, noting port congestion and container availability at some Asian ports have improved.
Under Armour still had to cancel some spring/summer 2022 orders to ease pressure on the factories that will take until the year end to ramp up to full capacity, it said. 
It also warned of a hit to its revenue in the first half of 2022 before the challenges, including congestion at U.S. ports, start to dissipate.
However, analysts have said Under Armour, which has deployed pricier air freight to bring in goods, is navigating supply-chain challenges well.
They also believe the athletic wear boom that is helping Under Armour, Nike and Adidas AG (DE:ADSGN) could last at least through next year.
Under Armour has also been spending more on marketing, pulling out of discounter stores and sharpening its focus on its own stores to elevate its brand image.

""UA remains one of the few that successfully raised its pricing power, rather than simply enjoyed higher prices on lower industry promotions,"" brokerage BMO Capital Markets said.
The athletic wear maker said it expected 2021 adjusted per-share earnings to reach 74 cents, above Refinitiv IBES estimates of 55 cents, after it posted better-than-expected third-quarter results.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)said on Tuesday it will consider new oversight rules for some platforms for trading U.S. Treasuries, in a move aimed at boosting transparency and competition.
Gary Gensler said he asked staff to revisit a 2020 proposal issued https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-sec-marketdata-idINKBN26J2WK under the Trump administration intended to treat electronic trading platforms for corporate debt and municipal securities more like stock exchanges.
""I've asked staff to reconsider (bringing)... certain Treasury trading platforms into the SEC's regulatory regime and to make recommendations,"" said Gensler. Staff would also consider if ""other key platforms"" could be brought in, he said.
Analysts say potential crypto trading platforms could be captured by the new rules.
In its 2020 proposal, the SEC said it wanted to better enable regulators to hold firms accountable for technology glitches that affect trading and assess a platform's preparedness for cyber attacks by mandating data backups in case of disaster or emergency scenarios.
Gensler's comments come amid illiquidity concerns in the $14.8 trillion U.S. Treasuries market. Players anticipate inflation gains could push the Federal Reserve to accelerate interest rates hikes, after ultra-low rates helped flatten the yield curve at its swiftest pace since 2011.
The Federal Open Market Committee is widely expected to announce Wednesday that it will begin tapering its $120 billion-per-month bond buying program.

Gensler added that the SEC will also consider rule changes in equity trading that may shrink the increments at which smaller companies' stocks are priced, as well as reevaluate best bid and offer components.
He said the agency will soon address potential conflicts of interest in how online brokers use digital engagement practices when marketing to investors after it reviews public comments it sought https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/us-markets-regulator-wants-public-feedback-firms-digital-engagement-practices-2021-08-27 in October.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Apollo Global Management Inc said its distributable earnings rose to an all-time high in the third quarter driven by more asset sales in its private equity portfolio and income from its credit business.
Apollo joins peers Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Inc and  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) Inc that reported record distributable earnings last month due to strong asset sales, as economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and low interest rates drove mergers and acquisition activity to new highs.
Distributable earnings, which is the cash used to pay dividends to shareholders, rose to a record $752.1 million, up from $205.1 million a year earlier. That translated to distributable earnings per share of $1.71, which surpassed the average Wall Street analyst estimate of $1.10, according to Refinitiv.
A big chunk of Apollo's earnings came from the $248.8 million it generated from the divestment of its annuities platform Venerable to a fund it manages and its insurance subsidiary, Athora, Apollo Chief Executive Marc Rowan said during an analyst earnings call.
""In our view, Venerable is not a great product to be part of a public company, given the inherent volatility of GAAP results if business is run properly,"" Rowan said.
Apollo reported a drop in net income under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to $249.2 million, down 5% from the prior year, owing to an uptick in compensation expenses and income taxes.
Its shares were trading down 1.67% at $75.05 on Tuesday morning after the call.
The New York-based firm said it cashed out $8.8 billion worth of investments in the third quarter, including selling down its stake in financial firm OneMain Holdings (NYSE:OMF) Inc and profits from education provider Apollo Education Group.
Apollo said it invested $28.3 billion to acquire new assets, including its $5 billion takeover of Yahoo from telecoms giant  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ).
Apollo said its private equity funds appreciated 4.8%. Its corporate credit funds and real estate, infrastructure and principal finance funds rose 1.7% and 6% respectively. Blackstone's private equity funds rose by 9.9%, while Carlyle's buyout funds rose 4%.
Total assets under management rose to $481.1 billion, up from $471.8 billion in the prior quarter, driven by growth in premiums from its insurance businesses Athene Holding (NYSE:ATH) Inc and Athora.

167,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2021 10:31AM ET</span>",Dubai to list utility Dewa under bourse expansion plan,"DUBAI (Reuters) -The Dubai government plans a stock market flotation of utility Dubai Electricity & Water Authority (Dewa), it said on Tuesday, among 10 state-backed companies to be listed as part of plans to boost activity on the local bourse. 
The listing plans are aimed at making Dubai a more competitive market against bigger bourses in the region, such those in as Saudi Arabia and neighbouring Abu Dhabi, that are seeing larger listings and strong liquidity.
The Dewa listing plan comes a day after the emirate's deputy ruler Sheikh Maktoum bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum said Dubai is aiming to list 10 state-backed companies, state news agency WAM reported. 
""The announcement of Dewa is a very strong signal to the market and investors that what they announced yesterday was not a proposed plan, but a done (deal), and execution has started,"" Mohammed Ali Yasin, chief strategy officer at Al Dhabi Capital, said. 
Dubai will also launch a $545 million market-maker fund to boost trading on its stock market.
""I am sure we're going to be hearing about more listings,"" Yasin said, citing Dubai-based energy company ENOC and airport services provider dnata as probable candidates. 
Dubai, one of the seven emirates of the United Arab Emirates, had also approved a 1 billion dirham fund to encourage technology companies to list on the local bourse, WAM citing Sheikh Maktoum as saying.
UNDER PRESSURE 
He said a committee overseeing the stock market's development had approved a goal to double the financial market's size to 3 trillion dirhams, adding that 10 state and state-related firms would be listed on Dubai Financial Market.
Sheikh Maktoum also announced the formation of a market supervisory committee and specialised courts for capital markets in the emirate, the trade and tourism hub of the Gulf. 
A spate of de-listings and an absence of big initial public offerings have put Dubai's stock market under pressure, raising questions over the future of one of the Gulf's major exchanges, launched two decades ago.
The latest announcement boosted shares of Dubai Financial Market by more than 14% on Tuesday, its biggest intraday gain in about 18 months. 
The benchmark Dubai index ended nearly 4% higher, outperforming other Gulf bourses.
Sheikh Maktoum, who oversees stock markets in the emirate, tweeted on Tuesday that Dewa would be listed on the Dubai bourse in coming months.
Dewa had 884,404 water customers and 990,258 electricity customers as of the end of 2020, according to company data.
Dewa also owns the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in Dubai, which has a planned production capacity of 5,000 MW by the end of the decade.

Authorities have not disclosed which other companies will be listed.

(Reuters) -Ralph Lauren Corp said on Tuesday it expects to face higher shipping and commodity costs in the next few months as the high-end apparel maker is spending heavily to ensure stores are stocked with its Polo shirts and sports jackets during the holiday season. 
The New York-based company's shares fell 4% in morning trade even after the company raised its full-year revenue forecast.
Unlike its European luxury peers, which manufacture the bulk of their products in their home market, Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL) sources the vast majority of its offerings from outside the United States, with 40% manufactured in China and Vietnam alone, making the company more susceptible to shipping delays and factory closures.
Those supply chain disruptions have especially hobbled the clothing industry, with apparel having the highest online out-of-stock levels among U.S. retail sectors in the run-up to the holiday season, according to Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Analytics.
However, Ralph Lauren said it was confident it would have enough stock to meet holiday demand, in part because it is spending heavily to ship products by air.
""While we expect continued variability of inventory flows, from quarter-to-quarter, we believe our inventories are well positioned... to meet demand for the upcoming holiday and spring '22 seasons,"" Chief Financial Officer Jane Nielsen said.
The retailer said it expects constant currency fiscal 2022 revenue to rise 34% to 36%, compared with a prior forecast of a 25% to 30% increase. 

But Ralph Lauren kept its full-year operating margin forecast unchanged at 12% to 12.5%, due to higher freight costs and increasing prices of raw materials such as cotton.
Ralph Lauren's net revenue rose 26% to $1.50 billion in the second quarter ended Sept. 25, as resurgent demand for luxury goods in North America and Europe helped offset some pressure in Japan and China where the reinstatement of virus restrictions kept people away from stores.

The coffee seller, owned by military veterans, has been valued at about $1.7 billion, according to a release by the companies.
Black Rifle is known for its pricier coffee and firearms-themed products such as its AK-47 Espresso Blend. It also sells branded apparel and produces digital content to promote its products to veterans and first responders. It has successfully embraced social causes to drive its sales at a time when consumers are increasingly looking for such brands.

LONDON (Reuters) - BP (NYSE:BP) added more than a billion dollars to its share buyback programme on Tuesday as it likened itself to a ""cash machine"" benefitting from higher oil and gas prices and a strong trading performance in the third quarter. 
Natural gas and power prices around the world surged as tight gas supplies collided with strong demand in economies recovering from the pandemic. 
BP said it expected natural gas prices to remain strong in the coming months of peak winter demand. 
The company ""is a cash machine at these sort of (oil and gas) prices and the business is running very well,"" Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney told Reuters.
Underlying replacement cost profit, the company's definition of net earnings, reached $3.32 billion in the third quarter, exceeding analysts' expectations for $3.06 billion.
That compares with $2.8 billion in profit in the second quarter and $86 million a year earlier, when energy demand and prices collapsed because of the pandemic. 
The results were boosted by ""very strong trading,"" which helped BP weather large fluctuations in gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices throughout the quarter.
Reuters reported last month that BP's trading arm made at least $500 million in the quarter.
""It's not only a trading story. We have had production growth, we have stronger reliability and availability in our businesses,"" Looney said. 
Although the headline profit reflects a strong business, BP reported a loss attributable to shareholders of $2.54 billion because of accounting effects and hedges as a result of fluctuations in LNG prices, which are expected to balance out over time.
BP shares were down 2.5% by 1320 GMT, compared with a 1.1% decline in the broader European energy index. 
Graphic:BP's profits- https://graphics.reuters.com/BP-RESULTS/xmpjogqwbvr/chart.png
BUYBACKS
The company said it would repurchase a further $1.25 billion of its shares by early 2022, after buying $900 million during the third quarter. BP plans to maintain buybacks at a rate of around $1 billion per quarter if oil prices remain at $60 a barrel or over. 
BP's net debt fell further to $32 billion from $32.7 billion in the second quarter. 
The long-term outlook for fossil fuel demand is uncertain as world leaders gathers this week in Glasgow, Scotland, for a U.N. conference critical to averting the most disastrous effects of climate change.
BP plans to sharply reduce its carbon emissions in the coming decades by increasing its renewable power capacity 20-fold by 2030, while reducing its oil output by 40% and diverting more funds to low-carbon investments.
Its profits today come entirely from oil and gas operations. 
The company said it plans to spend $14 to $16 billion in total next year, with around $9 billion going to oil and gas projects. BP will boost its spending on U.S. shale oil and gas to $1.5 billion in 2022 from around $1 billion this year, Chief Financial Officer Murray Auchincloss told analysts.

""The company can talk about 'Performing while Transforming' all it likes but it needs to prove to shareholders and the markets as a whole that it can transition to renewables in a way that doesn't hammer its margins, and the jury is likely to remain out on that,"" Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said in a note.
Looney told Reuters the company had not faced calls from investors to split into separate low-carbon and oil and gas divisions, after an activist fund called for rival Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) to break up its business last week.

(Reuters) -  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) Corp on Tuesday raised its 2021 revenue forecast for the third time this year as the news and information company benefits from a recovering global economy.
The upgrade came as the parent company of Reuters News reported third-quarter sales and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) that beat analysts' average forecasts. 
""We've seen pretty good signs of activity in our core segments, across all parts of our businesses,"" Chief Executive Steve Hasker said in an interview.
""2021 has been at the upper end of our expectations in terms of return to solid if not healthy economic activity.""
Shares of Thomson Reuters rose about 3% on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange. 
The company now expects full-year revenues to increase 4.5-5.0%, compared with its previous forecast of 4.0-4.5%.
Quarterly revenues climbed 6% to $1.53 billion, compared to expectations of $1.5 billion, while an 18% rise in adjusted EPS to 46 cents beat analysts' mean estimate of 38 cents, according to Refinitiv.
Four of Thomson Reuters' five divisions - Legal Professionals, Tax & Accounting Professionals, Corporates, and Reuters News - showed sales rising 6% on a constant currency basis.
Reuters News revenue benefited from gains in its business with media customers and a 60% rise in sales at its events business that was hurt by the pandemic. 
Reuters News makes more than half its revenue from supplying news to Refinitiv, a data company spun off from Thomson Reuters and now owned by the London Stock Exchange (LSE) 
Hasker said he saw opportunities to invest in three areas in Reuters News: its business with Refinitiv; its agency operations which supply video, pictures, graphics and stories to media companies; and the professional news segment serving lawyers, accountants and other groups. 
Quarterly group operating profit fell 11% compared to the prior year when the company received a ""significant"" benefit from the revaluation of warrants the company held in Refinitiv.
The LSE in January closed its $27-billion deal for Refinitiv. Thomson Reuters holds a minority stake in the LSE following the deal, worth $7.1 billion at the end of October. 
Thomson Reuters still has $700 million remaining of a $2 billion mergers and acquisition budget, but Chief Financial Officer Michael Eastwood said the company had much more available for deals.

""Given the passage of time and the performance of our business, we have significant capacity beyond the $700 million,"" he said in an interview.
Thomson Reuters launched in October a $100 million venture fund to invest in early stage companies serving professional audiences.
The company said on Tuesday it had repurchased $1.1 billion worth of shares by the end of October, as part of a $1.2 billion buyback program."

Investing.com – Ralph Lauren stock (NYSE:RL) fell nearly 5% on Tuesday on the apparel retailer’s plans to increase spending in the current half of the year.
Operating expenses jumped around 20% from last year in the second quarter ended September 25 and the company said they “continue to reflect the company's plans to increase marketing and other strategic investments to support long-term growth, including a higher level of spend in the second half of the fiscal year.""
Second-quarter reported revenue rose 26%, to $1.5 billion, above expectations with double-digit growth across all regions. Adjusted profit per share was $2.62 and above estimates.
Parts of Ralph Lauren’s key markets – China and Japan among them – are still reeling under the pandemic, with restrictions of varying limits imposed locally. Availability of raw materials is a big issue as some factories in China and Vietnam are still shut while shipping lines remain congested, both due to higher traffic and lack of personnel.
About 40% of Ralph Lauren products are manufactured in China and Vietnam.
A sharply brighter outlook and a promise to resume share repurchases failed to cheer up investors, who worry about the impact of supply chain challenges on retailers.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Tuesday as investors largely marked time ahead of the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting which starts later. 
Expectations are that the Fed will start to phase out its bond purchases, which have run at $120 billion a month since early last year, to reflect the progress made by the economy this year - and the increasing nervousness about a rise in inflation that seems set to last longer than originally predicted. 
""U.S. policymakers are quietly abandoning the 'transitory inflation' argument, and the likelihood of rising prices and interest rates is higher than it’s been in the last several years,"" said Sonal Desai, chief investment officer for fixed income with Franklin Templeton in a blog post at the weekend.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock quickly overcame its premarket dip, paring a loss of 5% before the open to be down only 0.6%. The stock had fallen after CEO Elon Musk tweeted that Hertz Global has yet to sign a contract for the 100,000 Tesla Model 3 cars that it said it  would add to its fleet by the end of 2022 last week.  Hertz stock, by contrast, fell 8.9%.  Tesla is also having to recall nearly 12,000 cars because of safety issues, according to an NHTSA release. 
The car hire sector more broadly was on fire:  Avis Budget  (NASDAQ:CAR) stock was suspended, up 35%, after an earnings report that showed solid earnings in the third quarter and drove a $1 billion increase in the company's buyback program. 
Also up by over 40% was the special purpose acquisition company SilverBox Engaged Merger Corp I (NASDAQ:SBEA), which announced it will merge with Black Rifle Coffee Company, a coffee subscription service that caters primarily to U.S. military veterans. 
Going in the other direction was education technology company Chegg. Chegg (NYSE:CHGG) stock fell 44% after its third-quarter results fell short of expectations and management guided for an even weaker fourth quarter, reflecting an unexpected slowdown in the U.S. tuition market.
Another decliner was Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID), which fell 7.6% after a blistering rally over the last week tied to the start of customer deliveries. 
On a heavy day for earnings, Under Armour (NYSE:UA) stock rose 18.5% after the apparel maker raised its guidance for the third time this year. Estee Lauder  (NYSE:EL)r edged up 0.6% despite the cosmetics group warning of supply-chain issues in its quarterly update, while  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) stock rose 2.0% and BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) stock rose 3.7% after the former sharply revised up its estimate of how much their Covid-19 vaccine will bring in this year.
Fellow vaccine-maker  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) saw its stock rise 4.8% after Indonesia became the world's first country to authorize its anti-Covid drug.

(Reuters) - Office rental company IWG is considering whether to separate its digital and technology businesses from its real estate assets, the company said on Tuesday, breaking its silence over a media report in September about a possible break-up.
The owner of the Regus and Spaces brands, which has offices in more than 3,300 locations across 110 countries, said it had started to assess the strategic and commercial rationale for such a move and would provide updates in the first half of 2022.
""The potential to more broadly leverage the intellectual property of the group, together with the ownership structure of the property portfolio, is the subject of further review,"" the company said in a trading statement.
In September, Sky News reported that IWG was exploring a multi-billion-pound break-up and said the company was also considering a U.S. listing for its workspace booking app Worka.
IWG Chief Executive Officer Mark Dixon declined to comment on Tuesday about either the profile of the businesses under review or any financial aspects.
IWG's London-listed shares were 2.3% higher by 1245 GMT, outperforming the FTSE 250 index, which was down 0.1%.
""The rationale is to release any hidden value. It is early days,"" said Andrew Shepherd-Barron, analyst at Peel Hunt.
""IWG is always keen on hidden value wherever possible and has done it in the past through the sale of master franchise agreements. But it is not yet obvious there is hidden value here to be released,"" Shepherd-Barron said.
Besides its physical office spaces, the company has several digital businesses which allow customers to find and book workspaces online, such as Worka and Meetingo.
IWG said its revenue fell 0.3% in the third quarter to 550.8 million pounds ($752 million) as a rise in COVID-19 cases around the world hit client plans to bring staff working remotely back to offices.
IWG said occupancy at its pre-2020 operations was 71.2% in the third quarter, only slightly higher than 70.1% a year ago.

The company said, however, that the outlook for the remainder of the year remained encouraging.

The strong quarterly results and $2 billion share buyback reported by Asia-focused rival HSBC last week had raised hopes among some investors that StanChart would follow suit, but analysts said it was conserving capital instead.
""We had hoped that a further $250 million share buyback would be announced today. Management has essentially decided to keep its powder dry,"" said Investec analyst Ian Gordon, referring to a possible bid for Asian retail banking operations earmarked for sale by  Citigroup  (NYSE:C)
The British-based bank also took a slightly more uncertain view of the global recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic than rivals who have released cash set aside to cover bad loans that never materialised.
""The economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic has continued to be uneven and punctuated by supply chain disruption,"" StanChart said in its results statement.
PROFIT LEAP
StanChart's third-quarter statutory pretax profit more than doubled year on year to $996 million, helped by lower credit charges. The average estimate from 16 analyst forecasts compiled by the bank was for a $942 million profit.
Credit impairment charges fell to $107 million from $353 million, with the bank saying it expects these to remain at low levels in the fourth quarter.
Overall income rose 7% to $3.8 billion, with the bank reiterating its target of 5-7% income growth from next year.
StanChart, which bases its business on capturing trade flows between its key markets of Asia, Africa and the Middle East, said trade income rose 13% to its highest since early 2018.
CHINA EXPOSURE
The bank said it had $4.2 billion in exposure to China's real estate sector, where China Evergrande Group is grappling with a $300 billion debt pile and stoking fears of further defaults and contagion risks.
""We continue to monitor the potential second-order impacts of recent developments,"" StanChart said, stating that overall exposure of $18.5 billion to commercial real estate, a fraction of the group's $302 billion in total customer loans and advances.
Like HSBC, StanChart has been betting on the world's second-largest economy to help to drive growth, but Winters faces a challenge convincing investors of his bank's prospects

StanChart, the biggest shareholder of which is Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings with close to a 17% stake, is trading at a lower multiple than its peers. It trades at 0.44 times book value for 2022, compared with 0.62 times for HSBC and 0.55 for  Barclays  (LON:BARC), Refinitiv data shows. 
Winters is by far the longest-serving CEO at a major British-based bank. The shock departure of Barclays CEO Jes Staley on Monday means Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds (LON:LLOY) and NatWest have all had a change at the top in the past two years.

(Reuters) - Autonomous delivery vehicle maker Nuro raised $600 million in its latest funding round, the Silicon Valley-based startup said on Tuesday, bringing on board Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google as an investor.
The funding round, led by Tiger Global Management, lifted Nuro's valuation to $8.6 billion from $5 billion previously, according to a person close to the deal.
 Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp's Woven Capital, SoftBank Group Corp's Vision Fund 1, Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co. were among other investors.
Self-driving startups are racing to build war chests to develop and commercialize technology, an expensive and time-consuming process. Alphabet's self-driving unit Waymo in June raised $2.5 billion. 
Nuro, whose R2 unit has no pedals or steering wheel and only room for packages, said it has signed a five-year strategic partnership with Google Cloud to support self-driving simulation and data management. 
Google Cloud said it was also looking to help Nuro optimise how it makes deliveries for retailers and other businesses, with the aim of transforming local commerce together.
Nuro's founders, Dave Ferguson and Jiajun Zhu, both worked on Google's self-driving car project, later spun out as Waymo, before launched Nuro.

Nuro's R2 has been tested in several cities, including Houston in Texas, Phoenix in Arizona, and Mountain View in California. 
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave Nuro approval in February last year to deploy up to 5,000 R2 vehicles on public roads over two years. The company has not disclosed the number of R2s on the road.

184,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 02, 2021 09:09AM ET</span>",Traders Call on Bank of England to End Bond Buying Early,"(Bloomberg) -- A dramatic cut to the U.K.’s bond supply in coming months is raising the possibility of the Bank of England resorting to a counter-intuitive move: ending quantitative easing to stabilize the market.
The central bank has been buying gilts for over 12 years since the financial crisis to keep yields low and trading orderly. Yet a larger-than-expected cut in bond sales announced last week sparked turbulence, sending long-term rates plunging and upending market dynamics with rare inversions of parts of the yield curve.
That’s led some players to call on the BOE to end its bond-buying program early to improve liquidity. It has currently penciled in stopping QE in December, though policy makers could vote to bring that forward at a meeting this week.
“The market is having to digest an extreme scarcity of gilt supply between now and April 2022, yet we have our central bank exacerbating the problem by taking a further 20 billion pounds of gilts out of the market between now and early December,” said Aaron Rock, an investment director at abrdn plc in Edinburgh. “Quite frankly it makes no sense.”
The BOE’s predicament is complicated by markets almost fully pricing in a 15-basis-point rise in its key interest rate on Thursday. Keeping the bond-buying program running while simultaneously hiking may send a confusing message.
Yet ending it would go against previous guidance. The BOE said in September that any future tightening should start with a rate hike even if a move “became appropriate” before its bond-buying program finishes. Also, coming so soon after a budget that saw borrowing slashed, it might reawaken accusations that QE only existed to fund Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak’s emergency pandemic spending.
The BOE’s answer, as it was to the original concerns over deficit financing, may lie in market stability. A majority of RBC Capital Markets’ customers believe the BOE should end the program early, according to a sales note on Tuesday, after the broker warned there was a dearth of liquidity akin to conditions in March 2020.
“There has to be a strong market stability argument for ending early,” RBC said in a recent report. “Anecdotally, market participants have not been shy about giving that message to the BOE.”
Slashed Supply
Britain slashed bond sales to 194.8 billion pounds ($265.7 billion) last Wednesday, with long-end supply hit particularly hard. The cut was more than 50% larger than analysts in a Bloomberg survey forecast, leading to aggressive curve-flattening moves. Thirty-year gilt yields plunged by the most since March 2020 on the day of the announcement.
Still, ending QE early would risk jeopardizing future BOE communication, according to analysts at Nomura International Plc. Either way, the controversy looks set to make Thursday’s meeting the most important this year.
“Should the Bank ultimately end any programme early, that could water down the potential announcement effect of future QE decisions as the markets might see QE as being an envelope rather than a target,” said Nomura economist George Buckley. “Moreover, as we approach the end of the current QE programme, the benefit of ending purchases early becomes less relative to the potential cost of watering down future QE signaling.”

Investing.com –  Estee Lauder  stock (NYSE:EL) fell 3% in Tuesday’s premarket trading as supply chain woes and a resurgent coronavirus in key markets forced the cosmetics maker to lower its guidance for the year.
The company warned that higher transportation and logistics costs could affect sales and operating expenses in the remaining part of the financial year.
The maker of La Mer beauty products now expects annual net sales to rise by 13.5% at midpoint, shaving off a neat 100 basis points from the forecast it gave earlier. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percent.
Sales of skincare products, makeup and fragrances rose in the first quarter but would have been higher had renewed restrictions due to the Delta variant not been put in place in some key markets. These included some Eastern markets, parts of Europe and South America.
The company said it will aim to overcome higher costs through price increases, better product mix and the use of air freight and less congested ports. Gross margin this time fell by 90 basis points.
Net sales in the first quarter rose 23% from the same period last year, to $4.39 billion. Every region showed growth as economies reopened and people spent more on grooming to look and feel better.
Adjusted profit per share was $1.89, and like sales, was higher than estimates."

Investing.com –  Under Armour  (NYSE:UA) stock (NYSE:UAA) soared more than 10% in Tuesday’s premarket trading as continuing sales momentum at the sportswear retailer led it to raise its annual guidance for the third time.
Under Armour now expects 2021 annual revenue to be $5.62 billion, up 25% from last time. It had given a forecast of around 20% growth in revenue earlier.
Third-quarter revenue was up 8% at $1.5 billion, a sign that the pandemic-driven demand for casual and sportswear remains sticky. Sales had risen 91% in the second quarter.
Earnings at 31 cents per share blew past estimates, coming in at more than double the estimate as the company worked on executing its cost-savings plan. Cost of products sold fell by 310 basis points. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percent.
The company also took a lower restructuring charge this time compared to last year’s quarter.
Most of the geographies including North America, Asia Pacific and Latin America showed growth as economies reopened and people visited stores to renew their clothing stocks. E-commerce sales fell 4%.
The results were a sharp contrast with the latest updates from rivals  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and Adidas (OTC:ADDYY), which had flagged serious supply chain problems due to the closure of factories in south-east Asia.

Fondazione MPS President Carlo Rossi told a press conference ""nobody in Italy was tearing their hair out"" over the collapse in talks between the Treasury and UniCredit to sell Monte dei Paschi and this was also the view of the foundation.
After emptying its coffers to support the ailing bank over the years, the foundation has seen its holding in MPS fall to zero from more than two thirds decades ago.
""I don't think there is a chance we could play a different role (in MPS' future) than we do now,"" Rossi said.
Rossi said that ""an effort of the imagination"" was now necessary to reinvent a future for MPS, adding no other buyers were in sight.

""I don't think it would be a good idea to repeat the path followed with UniCredit and look for another white knight,"" he said.
""The valuation was a stumbling block in the talks, but I reckon it's difficult another private buyer could meet the ministry's requests ... unless maybe a foreign player wanted to pay a premium to get into the Italian market,"" he added.

188,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2021 08:01AM ET</span>",Shipper Maersk says port delays will stretch into new year,"By Stine Jacobsen
COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - The chaos that has bedevilled global supply chains in recent months will extend into next year, with a lack of truck drivers preventing hundreds of container vessels from offloading goods around the world, shipping group Maersk said. 
""The whole system has become one gigantic bottleneck,"" Chief Executive Soren Skou told reporters on Tuesday.
Skou said the biggest problem preventing containers from leaving ports is a lack of labour, particularly drivers of heavy goods vehicles in the United States and Britain despite salaries having been raised ""significantly"".
There are 300 container vessels laying idle outside ports, Skou said after Maersk reported robust third-quarter earnings on the back of record freight prices driven by the supply chain problems as the global economy recovers from the coronavirus crisis.
LOWER VOLUMES
To meet the rising demand, Maersk said it has added more capacity but this could not offset the port congestion that sent third-quarter container volumes down 4% from the same period in pre-pandemic 2019 and slightly below the level in last year's third quarter.
""A too large proportion of our capacity is tied up lying waiting outside the ports,"" Skou said. 
Maersk, which handles one in five containers shipped worldwide, said its main ocean business is now expected to grow more slowly than global container demand. The company now expects demand to grow by 7-9% this year, up from previous guidance of 6-8%.
Container demand growth is then expected to slow to 2-4% next year, it said, reflecting normalisation of the burgeoning consumer demand for material goods during the pandemic. 
Maersk shares, which have gained 40% this year, were up almost 3% at 1148 GMT.
END-TO-END SOLUTIONS
Maersk also announced that it is buying freight-forwarder Senator International along with two Boeing (NYSE:BA) aircraft to further the group's diversification.
The group, which relies on ocean shipping for two thirds of its revenue, aims to expand its services to include more air and land-based freight, hoping to deliver door-to-door logistical solutions to clients such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Puma.
Strong financial results during the pandemic have accelerated the company's ongoing transformation from a container shipping company to an integrated logistics company.

It said that final third-quarter earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) tripled to $6.9 billion compared with a preliminary figure of close to $7 billion issued on Sept. 16 when the company also raised its 2021 forecasts. 
Maersk also said it would extend its share buyback programme by an additional $5 billion over 2024 and 2025.

190,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2021 07:51AM ET</span>","Airlines reopen lounges with new perks, more walk-ins from economy","By Allison Lampert
MONTREAL (Reuters) - Airlines are reopening airport lounges with higher-end service to lure back premium travelers after the pandemic, while increasingly opening the VIP experience to tourists - for a fee. 
Premium travel plummeted during the COVID-19 crisis, depriving airlines of higher-margin fares. But with traffic rebounding in certain regions and U.S.-bound travel set to reopen on Nov 8, lounges are a crucial weapon in airlines' post-crisis strategies for retaining their more profitable clients.
United Airlines opened its first Polaris (NYSE:PII) lounge at Washington Dulles on Oct 21 and announced plans last Thursday to reopen existing lounges in New York, Chicago and Houston by end-year, with the rest set to follow in early 2022.
Air France has inaugurated a 3,000-square-metre temple to French design in one of its main terminals at Paris Charles de Gaulle. Dubai's Emirates and Air Canada both plan upgrades to lounge dining and service. 
""A lot of the narrative around 2022 is really going to be around that food program, how we serve our customers and elevating that aspect of the experience,"" said Mats Winter, director of product for Canada's largest carrier. 
Air Canada wants a ""competitive product"" for its business clientele but also for leisure travelers who are making up a growing part of premium-fare purchases, he said. 
""The mix has changed, but our commitment to making sure we have a great premium product hasn't. We are obviously keeping a very close eye on the traffic we are seeing in our lounges,"" Winter added.
NEW REVENUES
Designed as an oasis for premium travelers, lounges could attract more passengers looking to avoid crowds during COVID, said Michael Di Corpo, managing director of Montreal-based firm IEG, which sells software for managing airport lounges.
Passengers globally are contending with longer lines due to requirements like proof of vaccination, while many face longer layovers since ailing airlines now offer fewer direct flights.
""We're seeing more of the 'paying their way' as a way of generating revenues, assuming they're not at capacity,"" Di Corpo said, referring to the purchase of daily lounge access.
Airlines contacted by Reuters don't break out revenues from lounge services. 
While some airlines have previously sold lounge access to passengers from the back of the plane, pressure to find new revenues in the wake of the industry's worst crisis has grown.
Qatar Airways for one, recently launched a less expensive Business Lite fare, where lounge access costs extra.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), which reopened the first of its Flagship Lounges in September to premium classes on long-haul flights, made paid access available for the first time. 
The airline is especially targeting people traveling for occasions like weddings and reunions, a spokeswoman said. 
But there are limits to the democratization of lounges, which can represent investments of millions of dollars.
The last thing executives say they can afford is to crowd out corporate clientele or well-off individuals who drive profits on routes like the Atlantic, with the U.S. lifting restrictions Nov 8 for vaccinated foreigners.
At American, the $150 cost of a day pass to Flagship doesn't give economy passengers access to its most elite service, a private restaurant within the lounge. It does include food with a different menu and space. 
United said Polaris lounges would remain premium class only. 

Air Canada decided last November to open three of its Maple Leaf lounges to paying walk-in economy passengers and travelers from other airlines on a trial basis to use spare capacity during COVID-19. It has since ended the practice in Vancouver. 
""We don't want this to eventually drive capacity concerns, for example, for our premium customers,"" Winter said.

Investing.com –  Pfizer  stock (NYSE:PFE) gained nearly 4% in Tuesday’s premarket trading as higher revenue from its vaccine against Covid-19 led the company to raise its guidance for the year.
The company now sees $81.5 billion in sales in 2021 at the midpoint of its forecast range, including $36 billion in sales of Comirnaty, its Covid-19 vaccine. That's $2.5 billion more than the previous forecast. But the non-Covid vaccine business is now seen fractionally weaker as the company pegged sales from that at $45.5 billion at midpoint, down from $46 billion projected earlier.
Group sales for the third-quarter sales were 130% higher than a year earlier at $24.1 billion, driven by increasing vaccinations against the pandemic the world over. Adjusted profit per share was $1.34 and was also higher than estimates.
The likely revenue from Covid-19 vaccines reflects 2.3 billion doses expected to be delivered in 2021 under already-signed contracts, up from 2.1 billion doses the company had tied up earlier. The company had then forecast sales of $33.5 billion from the Covid vaccine.
The recall of Chantix tablets during the quarter due to quality issues weighed on the outlook. The company has since stopped shipments of the product. Chantix is a treatment to help patients quit smoking and is intended for short-term use. However, tests had shown an unacceptably high level of a carcinogen in the medication.

North American airlines have reported upbeat results this quarter as vaccinated travelers, who have not seen friends and family for over a year, take to the skies. Canada's decision to open its borders also benefited Air Canada, which generated net cash of C$153 million ($123.34 million) in the third quarter, compared with its earlier expectation of a net cash burn between C$280 million and C$460 million. ""We are encouraged by the favourable revenue and traffic trends in the third quarter"" Chief Executive Officer Michael Rousseau said in a statement. The company said it also augmented its fleet by reaching a pact with Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co to accelerate delivery of four Boeing 737 MAX aircraft into the current quarter and will add two Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY)'s A220-300 aircraft in 2024.

Air Canada's revenue rose to C$2.1 billion, beating analyst expectations of C$1.82 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data. The carrier's net loss narrowed to C$640 million, or C$1.79 per share in the quarter, from C$685 million, or C$2.31 per share, a year earlier.

194,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2021 07:27AM ET</span>","Tesla recalls nearly 12,000 U.S. vehicles over software communication error","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc is recalling nearly 12,000 U.S. vehicles sold since 2017 because a communication error may cause a false forward-collision warning or unexpected activation of the emergency brakes, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said Tuesday.
The California automaker said the recall of 11,704 Model S, X, 3 and Y vehicles was prompted after a software update on Oct. 23 to vehicles in its limited early access version 10.3 Full-Self Driving (FSD) (Beta) population.
FSD is an advanced driver assistance system that handles some driving tasks but Tesla says does not make vehicles autonomous.
NHTSA said Tesla ""uninstalled FSD 10.3 after receiving reports of inadvertent activation of the automatic emergency braking system"" and then ""updated the software and released FSD version 10.3.1 to those vehicles affected.""
The agency said it ""will continue its conversations with Tesla to ensure that any safety defect is promptly acknowledged and addressed.""
The recall comes after NHTSA last month asked Tesla why it had not issued a recall to address software updates made to its Autopilot driver-assistance system to improve the vehicles' ability to detect emergency vehicles.
Tesla said the issue was prompted by a software communication disconnect between two onboard chips that prompted an issue that could produce ""negative object velocity detections when other vehicles are present.""
If the automatic emergency braking system unexpectedly activates while driving, it could raise the risk of a rear-end 
collision, Tesla said, but added it was not aware of any 
crashes or injuries related to the issue. 
After the Oct. 24 reports, Tesla said canceled the FSD update on vehicles that had not installed it and disabled FCW and AEB on affected vehicles.
The same day, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted of FSD: ""Seeing some issues with 10.3, so rolling back to 10.2 temporarily. Please note, this is to be expected with beta software.""
On Oct. 25, Tesla began deploying the over-the-air software update and re-enabled FCW and AEB features on vehicles with the update.
Tesla said as of Oct. 29, more than 99.8% of the vehicles - all but for 17 - had installed an update and no further action is necessary.

NHTSA in August opened a formal safety probe into Tesla's Autopilot system in 765,000 U.S. vehicles after a series of crashes involving Tesla models and emergency vehicles.
The U.S. auto safety agency also asked Tesla in October about its ""Autosteer on City Streets” which the company also refers to as FSD first leased in October 2020, and raised concerns about limits on disclosure by drivers of safety issues.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening largely unchanged Tuesday, with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in focus ahead of the start of an eagerly-awaited Federal Reserve meeting.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 20 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded largely flat, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 20 points, or 0.1%.
The three major indices all closed at record levels on Monday, with the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining almost 100 points, ending 0.3% higher. The broad-based S&P 500 closed up 0.2% and the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite gained 0.6%.
The Federal Reserve’s highly-anticipated two-day policy meeting starts later Tuesday, and the central bank is expected to announce that it would begin to buy fewer bonds each month to head off rising inflationary pressures.
Investors will also be interested in what the central bank says about rising prices, and consequently about when it will start raising interest rates, as inflation is running at a 30-year high. What it says on this subject will be an important determinant of risk appetite in the weeks ahead.
More quarterly earnings reports are scheduled from the likes of drugmaker  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS), oil giant ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), ride-hailing company  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) and sports equipment company Under Armour (NYSE:UA).
Tesla will also be in focus, with the stock trading sharply lower premarket after CEO Elon Musk tweeted that its ground-breaking bulk order from car rental firm Hertz Global hasn't been finalized yet.

199,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 02, 2021 06:45AM ET</span>",DuPont Slumps on Fresh Bout of Corporate Reconstruction,"
By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Dupont stock (NYSE:DD) plunged 6% in Tuesday’s premarket as the company announced a major recast of its operations, spending heavily to gain greater exposure to the electric vehicle and 5G industries.
The company said it will buy electronics-materials specialist Rogers Corporation (NYSE:ROG) for $5.2 billion. Rogers makes products for use in high-frequency circuit materials, ceramic substrates for power semiconductor devices, and high-performance foams which go into a variety of highly specialized end-markets, but a growing share of its business is with the EV sector and 5G telecommunications.
Rogers stock (NYSE:ROG) soared 30% in premarket trading.
To help fund the acquisition, DuPont is planning to sell a substantial part of its Mobility & Materials segment, which accounted for nearly a third of group sales in recent years. The Engineering Polymers and Performance Resins lines of business as well as the group's stake in the DuPont (NYSE:DD) Teijin Films joint venture are both candidates for disposal.
DuPont has three divisions -- Electronics & Industrials, Mobility & Materials, and Water & Protection.
The Mobility & Materials business brought $1.3 billion in net sales in the September quarter, up 30% on-year.
The E&I unit, which would be combined with Rogers, accounted for roughly 35% of the company’s $4.3 billion of net sales in the third quarter.
Rogers is expected to make $950 million in 2021 revenue. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022, a DuPont release said.
The company declared its third-quarter earnings also today. Adjusted profit per share was $1.15. Both sales and profit were higher than estimates.
Dupont in its current shape is itself the consequence of a highly-expensive piece of corporate restructuring barely five years ago, when it merged with Dow Chemical before resuming trading in a heavily restructured form under its own name."

A memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed during the two-week COP26 summit in the Scottish city of Glasgow. 
The two firms agreed to ""evaluate the potential for large-scale deployment of low-carbon technologies in Indonesia,"" ExxonMobil said in a statement. 
""We are evaluating large-scale carbon capture and storage projects that have the potential to make the greatest impact in the highest-emitting sectors around the world,"" said Joe Blommaert, president of ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions.
""And there are opportunities in Indonesia and throughout Southeast Asia."" 
CCS traps emissions and buries them underground but is not yet at the commercialisation stage. 
Exxon Mobil aims to build CCS hubs across Asia, and one in Southeast Asia that is similar to a CCS facility it has also proposed to set up in Houston, Texas.
Advocates of CCS see the technology as being essential to help meet net zero emissions and key to unlocking large-scale economic hydrogen production. 
Critics, however, say CCS will extend the life of dirty fossil fuels.
Indonesia, the world's eighth-biggest carbon emitter, recently brought forward its goal for net zero emissions from 2070 to 2060 or sooner. 
""The use of CCS technology is part of Pertamina's energy transition to clean energy,"" Pertamina CEO Nick Widyawati said in a separate statement.

Dwi Soetjipto, head of Indonesia's upstream regulator SKK Migas, said last month its mega Cepu block in East Java would be a potential location for ExxonMobil's CCS project. 
""This CCS collaboration is a step towards making it happen,"" Soetjipto said on Tuesday.

203,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2021 06:35AM ET</span>","Japan Airlines narrows H1 loss on cost cuts, flags annual loss","TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan Airlines Co Ltd (JAL) reported on Tuesday a narrower first-half loss before interest and tax from a year ago, helped by cost cuts the carrier undertook during the pandemic, but it flagged a wider-than-expected annual loss.
The company posted a first-half loss of 151.8 billion yen ($1.34 billion). In the prior year, Japan's second-largest airline had reported a loss of 223.9 billion yen in the six months ended Sept. 30.
JAL said on Tuesday it would report a full-year loss of 198 billion yen, larger than the consensus loss of 120 billion yen from 12 analysts polled by Refinitiv. 
In August, the carrier failed to provide a full-year earnings forecast, saying uncertainty made prediction too difficult.
The airline, like the travel industry in the world's third-largest economy, was badly hit as Japan was under a state of emergency for much of the second quarter.
JAL said its workforce would shrink by 2,500 people by the end of the business year on March 31 to 33,500 people as older workers retired and it froze new hiring to lower costs.
Rival ANA Holdings Inc said last week that it expected to report an operating loss in the current financial year, down from an earlier prediction of a profit, and that it would reduce staff numbers by 20% within five years through attrition and retirement.
JAL said it expected to stop burning cash by the fourth quarter of the financial year as travel demand improved. 
It said domestic passenger numbers began increasing last month, and by March should reach 92% of pre-COVID levels, though international traffic would remain subdued at 23% of pre-COVID levels.
Japan on Tuesday confirmed plans to gradually ease COVID-19 border restrictions, but fell short of calls from business lobbies to open up the country in line with its major trading partners.
The country is still under strict regulations preventing most non-resident foreigners, including tourists and business travellers, from entering.

The government has decided to review border controls in stages, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told reporters on Tuesday, responding to media reports that quarantine for business travellers would be cut to three days from 10.

Located in the country's southwest Yunnan province, the 66,000 square meter distillery will source water from the Erhai lake and will begin construction next year.
Single malts are one of the few drinks that Chinese consumers enjoy at home or in small groups, with volumes rising 20% in 2020, wine and spirits consultancy IWSR said, adding that it is also a preferred tipple among its large population of millennial consumers. 
COVID-19-driven restrictions on foreign travel have also saved people money and driven a growing fondness for high-end spirits.
In July, the Johnnie Walker whisky maker reported that double-digit growth in scotch whiskeys contributed to a 38% jump in net sales in Greater China in its fiscal 2021 ended June 30.

While demand for the new console is strong, the Kyoto-based company has struggled to get enough semiconductors to make the machines, the newspaper said. The company had originally planned to make about 30 million consoles, a record high, it said.
The new Switch got off to a rocky start last month during its debut, suggesting supply constraints were hampering the company’s biggest product launch in years, Bloomberg News reported. The $350 OLED edition sold 138,409 units in the domestic market over its launch weekend, sales tracker Famitsu said, compared with the original Switch’s inaugural weekend sales of 330,637 in 2017. 
A company spokesman confirmed the chip shortage is affecting production. He declined to comment on the reported 24 million figure and said the company is assessing the magnitude of the impact now.
Nintendo said in May it was targeting sales of 25.5 million consoles in the year ending March 2022, having sold 28.8 million units in the prior period. Management had hoped to exceed that figure, Bloomberg News reported at the time.
The new model sports a more vibrant 7-inch OLED display along with a new flexible stand, more storage space and better speakers as well as an internet cable port. Nintendo’s own flagship store in the Shibuya district of Tokyo implemented a lottery to determine who gets to buy the device. 
Nintendo shares have dropped 24% this year amid concerns over the new Switch.

Investing.com – Tesla stock (NASDAQ:TSLA) traded more than 5% lower in Tuesday’s premarket after CEO Elon Musk tweeted that its ground-breaking bulk order from car rental firm  Hertz Global  (OTC:HTZZ) hasn't been finalized yet.
An October 25 press release by Hertz said it had placed with Tesla an order for delivery of 100,000 Model 3 cars by end of 2022. The news was taken as a sign of electric vehicles advancing further into the mainstream auto market and triggered a breathtaking rally in the stock, already one of the most expensive in the S&P 500 by any valuation metric. Around half of the order appears earmarked for a partnership with Uber (NYSE:UBER) that Hertz flagged in a separate press release two days later.
The stock has risen by almost a third since, taking just six trading sessions to add nearly $300 billion in market value.
Given that Tesla's Model 3 sedan starts at about $44,000, estimates pegged the size of the order at closer to $4.4 billion, which at Tesla's current operating margins would equate to well under $1 billion of profit.
Musk’s tweet came in response to a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) follower thanking the CEO for the recent surge in the stock price. The stock rose 8.5% Monday and touched a lifetime high of $1,209.75 during the session.
“Tesla has far more demand than production, therefore we will only sell cars to Hertz for the same margin as to consumers. Hertz deal has zero effect on our economics,” Musk said in the tweet."

Investing.com –  Novavax  stock (NASDAQ:NVAX) was looking to extend its previous session’s gains Tuesday after its Covid-19 vaccine secured its first approval for emergency use in any country.
The stock climbed more than 5% in premarket trading after closing almost 16% higher Monday on the news that Indonesia had allowed Novavax’s NVX-CoV2373 for emergency use.
CEO Stanley Erck told Reuters it expects regulators in India, the Philippines and elsewhere to decide on the approval within weeks.
The development is a big boost to Novavax’s plans, which have been held back by manufacturing challenges. Those issues delayed the approvals to the vaccine in the U.S. and Europe, pegging it behind the likes of  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)-BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) which have already delivered billions of doses.
The problems led Novavax's stock to shed more than half of its value in the last two months. It has now recouped around one-third of those losses.
Erck said Novavax has resolved all of its manufacturing challenges and does not expect regulators to have any further concerns about its production processes.
India’s Serum Institute will make the vaccine and market it in Indonesia under the brand name Covovax.
In a separate press release, Novavax said it has filed for vaccine authorization with the Canadian regulator and completed submission for final review to the European Medicines Agency. It also expects to make a full submission for approval to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in ""several weeks"", according to Erck.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded in a mixed fashion Tuesday, with investors focusing on the ongoing corporate earnings season ahead of the start of an eagerly-awaited Federal Reserve meeting.
At 4 AM ET (0900 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.4% higher, the CAC 40 in France was largely flat, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.6%.
European stock indices posted gains through much of last month, helped by a generally positive earnings season, but the news has been more mixed Tuesday.
AP Moeller - Maersk (CSE:MAERSKb) stock rose 0.2% after the shipping giant tripled its quarterly profit. It also said it will increase its existing buyback program by $5 billion, expecting exceptionally high shipping rates to stay strong through the first quarter of next year at least.
Fresenius (DE:FREG) stock rose 4.7% after the German health care company outlined plans to restructure its Fresenius Medical Care (NYSE:FMS) business, including cutting up to 5,000 full-time jobs. HelloFresh (DE:HFGG) soared over 14% after the meal-kit delivery firm raised its 2021 sales forecast.
Dragging the FTSE 100 index down, in particular, was the heavily-weighed resources sector with iron ore prices down another 5% in China today, unwinding all of its pandemic rally. BHP Group (LON:BHPB) stock fell 3.8%, Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) stock dropped 3% and  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) stock was 3.9% lower.  
BP (NYSE:BP) stock fell 2.2% despite the energy giant stating it would buy back an additional $1.25 billion of shares after posting a strong rise in profit, while Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) stock dropped over 6% despite reporting a stronger-than-expected pre-tax profit for the third quarter.
Away from the corporate sector, the Fed’s two-day policy-setting meeting starts later Tuesday, with the central bank widely expected to start winding down its $120 million monthly bond-buying program. 
The Fed will likely have to update its thinking about rising prices, and consequently about when it will start raising interest rates, as inflation is running at a 30-year high. What it says on this subject will be an important determinant of risk appetite in the weeks ahead.
In economic news, the German manufacturing PMI for October fell to 57.8, a small drop from the 58.2 level in September.  
Crude prices stabilized at the recent high levels Tuesday with preliminary October output data for the top producers suggesting the global supply situation remains tight.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets with allies including Russia later this week to discuss their production levels.
According to a Reuters survey, the group increased output by 190,000 barrels per day over the month, below the 254,000 b/d they could have increased output by under their current deal. 
The American Petroleum Institute will also release its latest U.S. crude oil supply data at 4:30 PM ET.

ZURICH (Reuters) -Adecco Group warned ""pretty unprecedented"" labour shortages would continue to push wages higher in the short to medium term, as lower-than-expected third quarter results and guidance for modest growth sent its shares sharply lower.
Inflation is picking up across the world, driven in part by a shortage of workers in some sectors as economies bounce back from the pandemic, creating a dilemma for central bankers who are wary of withdrawing stimulus measures too quickly. 
""The mismatch between supply and demand we see in the labour market is pretty unprecedented,"" Chief Financial Officer Coram Williams told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday.
""Labour markets are flexible, they come back, they reorientate, but in the short to medium term you can expect to continue to see a candidate and talent scarcity that is likely to drive wage inflation,"" he said.
""Long term that benefits us because we’re part of the solution, but in the short term it means we can also find it difficult to find the candidate."" 
Shares in  Adecco  (SIX:ADEN) were 5.8% lower at 0820 GMT.
ZKB analysts pointed to Adecco's relatively modest organic revenue growth of 9% versus rival Randstad's 21% and Manpower's 11% in the third quarter. 
Randstad last month warned labour market shortages would be a major theme ""for years to come"" and ManpowerGroup (NYSE:MAN) also mentioned it was seeing a tight labour market.
Williams said the global chip shortage was weighing on Adecco's business with the automotive industry, particularly in its No.1 market France, and noted talent scarcity in hotel, catering, and tourism sectors, which employees have left to find work elsewhere.
""We have seen a modest sequential improvement in the weekly figures in October,"" Williams said, adding this was underpinning confidence for modest revenue growth in the fourth quarter. 
Third-quarter revenues adjusted for currency movements, trading days and divestments rose 9% to 5.22 billion euros ($6.06 billion), slightly shy of analyst forecasts for 5.28 billion euros in a company-gathered poll https://www.adeccogroup.com/investors/analyst-consensus. 

Group operating income rose 75% to 196 million euros, reflecting an absence of one-off COVID-related charges, while net income of 133 million euros also just missed forecasts.

SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) -Chinese developers' shares and bonds stumbled on Tuesday on worries over spreading financial contagion, as sources said one of the country's top 20 homebuilders is seeking a new extension for its onshore debts.
Fujian province-based Yango Group Co. Ltd. has been in talks with investors to discuss the extension of payments on yuan-denominated asset-backed securities that holders can redeem this month, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The company plans to repay interest in full, with unpaid principal rolled over for a year, they said. Reuters was unable to confirm whether the company would make principal payments on the securities this month.
Yango Group did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.
On Monday, Yango offered to exchange some U.S. dollar bonds for new notes personally guaranteed by its chairman to avoid defaulting on upcoming debt payments.
Fitch Ratings said Tuesday that it considered that offer a distressed debt exchange, downgrading Yango's rating to ""C"" from ""B-"". Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investors Service earlier cut Yango's corporate family rating to Caa2 from B2, citing liquidity risk.
""Yango may not be able to mobilise all of its cash holdings to repay its maturing debts, given that most of it resides in its project companies. In addition, Yango's exposure to its joint ventures is significant, which could limit its ability to control its cash flow,"" Moody's said in a statement.
China Chengxin International, a domestic agency, said it had placed the company on a watchlist for possible downgrades, while Dagong Global Credit Rating Co on Monday cut its outlook on Yango to negative due to uncertainty over funds for debt repayments.
The downgrades and warnings weighed on market sentiment on Tuesday, pushing Hong Kong's mainland properties sub-index down more than 4% at one point, taking its losses since an Oct. 22 peak - when China Evergrande Group narrowly avoided a $19 billion default - to nearly 17%. 
The CSI300 real estate index of A-shares fell 2.4%, while Yango's own shares fell as much as 9%.
Yango Group's bonds fell sharply for a second day, with Duration Finance quoting its 12% March 2024 bond down almost 58% on the day to less than 13 cents, yielding nearly 160%. Its Shenzhen-traded April 2024 bond fell more than 20%, triggering a trading halt.
November 2022 and 2023 bonds issued by Evergrande unit Scenery Journey fell more than 12% to about 20% of their face value ahead of coupon payments totalling $82.5 million this weekend.
Bonds issued by developers Yuzhou Group Holdings Co, Ronshine China Holdings and Zhenro Properties Group also fell more than 10%.
Clarence Tam, fixed income portfolio manager at Avenue Asset Management in Hong Kong, said the Yango exchange offer had aggravated gloomy sentiment. Falling market value forced some leveraged products to unwind positions, weighing prices down further, he said.
""Quality BB and split names ... suffer the most these two days,"" said Tam. 

Evergrande narrowly avoided a catastrophic default for the second time in a week on Friday, making a last-minute payment on an overdue dollar bond coupon. On Tuesday its shares gave up early gains to fall 2.5%.
Evergrande's woes have brought collateral damage to China's property sector, with some Chinese developers forced into formal default on their dollar bonds last month and others proposing extended payment schedules.

216,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2021 04:00AM ET</span>","ByteDance to reorganise into six units, CFO steps down to focus on TikTok","By Yingzhi Yang and Brenda Goh
BEIJING (Reuters) - TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew will step down as its parent ByteDance's chief financial officer (CFO) to focus on running the short video platform full time, according to an internal memo the company shared with Reuters.
The memo, which was sent by ByteDance co-founder Liang Rubo to staff on Tuesday, also outlined a major reshuffle at the Beijing-based company to create six business units (BUs).
This is the biggest organizational change since ByteDance co-founder Zhang Yiming said in May he would step down as CEO. Zhang remains chairman and has more than 50% of voting rights. Liang will officially take over from Zhang as CEO in December.
Chew's shift comes after ByteDance said in April that it did not have any imminent plans for an IPO. It had been looking at a Hong Kong or New York listing, sources previously told Reuters. 
One of the world's largest private companies, ByteDance had a valuation of about $300 billion in recent trades.
Chew joined ByteDance as CFO in March and was appointed as TikTok CEO in May. Liang did not elaborate on replacement plans for the CFO role, but a person familiar with the matter said the company was not rushing to seek candidates to fill the position.
ByteDance will also be reorganised into six units - TikTok and its Chinese version Douyin, work collaboration unit Lark, business services unit BytePlus, gaming unit Nuverse, and education tech unit Dali Education, Liang said in the memo.
This will help ensure ""business lines and teams that work closely together are grouped as BUs"", he added.
The TikTok unit will support operations of the short video app and its expansion into areas such as global e-commerce. 
ByteDance's Chinese products, including Douyin, news aggregator Toutiao, video-streaming platform Xigua, will be folded into the Douyin unit, which will take over all ""information and service"" operations in the Chinese market. 

The bulk of ByteDance revenue, totalling $34.3 billion in 2020, was generated in China, sources have said. 
Liang also said that Dali, which has undergone layoffs and product closures after China issued rules barring curriculum-based tutoring for profit plunging, would provide services for education stakeholders such as artificial intelligence-powered learning, education for adults and smart hardware.

219,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2021 03:20AM ET</span>","Maersk expands air freight with new Boeing planes, logistics firm acquisition","COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Denmark's A.P. Moller-Maersk said on Tuesday it will buy freight-forwarder Senator International along with two Boeing (NYSE:BA) aircraft, the firm's latest move to boost its businesses beyond ocean shipping. 
Maersk, which handles one in five containers shipped worldwide, will acquire the German logistics firm, whose largest business is within air freight, for an enterprise value of around $644 million, it said. 
During the pandemic, many airlines have been forced to park unused passenger jets, driving up demand for cargo space on dedicated freighters at a time when soaring demand from lockdown-ridden consumers has put a strain on global trade. 
With two-thirds of Maersk's revenue still coming from container shipping, the firm is aiming to expand its services to include more air and land-based freight, hoping to deliver door-to-door logistical solutions to clients like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Puma. 
""The COVID situation has only accelerated the fact that we need to move on this,"" Maersk's chief executive of ocean and logistics, Vincent Clerc, told Reuters. 
""Obviously we are making these acquisitions to flesh out a network that we hope to scale. So we trust that this will be growth generating."" 
On top of the acquisition, expected to close in the first half of 2022, Maersk will add two new Boeing 777 freight aircraft as well as three leased cargo planes to its existing fleet of 15 aircraft.
""Our target is to have about a third of our capacity provided through own tonnage, and two-thirds through belly-space on commercial airlines,"" Clerc told Reuters. 

While the leased planes will be operational next year, the newly built Boeing planes are expected to be delivered in 2024. Combined with Senator International's six airplanes, this will roughly double Maersk's air cargo capacity. 
""We feel this is the right mix to assure a certain level of operational control where it's necessary, but also still be able to have the flexibility that we need by moving with commercial airlines,"" Clerc said.

220,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 02, 2021 02:59AM ET</span>",European Stock Futures Edge Lower; Fed Meeting in Focus,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open with small losses Tuesday, handing back some of the previous session’s gains ahead of the start of an eagerly-awaited Federal Reserve meeting.
At 2 AM ET (0700 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.2% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.1% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.2%.
Investors around the world are focusing on the start of the Fed’s two-day policy-setting meeting later Tuesday, with the central bank widely expected to start winding down its $120 million monthly bond-buying program. 
The Fed will likely have to update its thinking about rising prices, and consequently about when it will start raising interest rates, as inflation is running at a 30-year high. What it says on this subject will be an important determinant of risk appetite in the weeks ahead.
Ahead of this, there are a number of corporate earnings for investors to focus on, with the generally positive third-quarter season having helped the main European indices post gains of just under 1% on Monday.
U.K.-based bank Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) posted a stronger-than-expected pretax profit for the third quarter, aided by lower credit charges and growth in trade finance, while Swiss staffing company  Adecco  (SIX:ADEN) expects fourth-quarter revenues to grow modestly due to a continued increase in hiring across the continent.
Earnings from the likes of energy giant BP (NYSE:BP), German health care company Fresenius (DE:FREG) and Dutch health nutrition firm DSM (AS:DSMN) are also out. Elsewhere, shipping giant AP Moeller - Maersk  (CSE:MAERSKb) said it will increase its existing buyback program by $5 billion, expecting exceptionally high shipping rates to stay strong through the first quarter of next year at least. 
Investors will also follow the ongoing COP26 conference in Glasgow, a U.N. conference aimed at limiting the effects of climate change, with one hundred countries having given themselves nine years to halt and reverse deforestation, backed by a fund of $19 billion.
In economic news, the main release Tuesday will be the German manufacturing PMI for October.  
Crude prices edged higher Tuesday with preliminary October output data for the top producers suggesting the global supply situation remains tight.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets with allies including Russia later this week to discuss their production levels.
According to a Reuters survey, the group increased output by 190,000 barrels per day over the month, below the 254,000 b/d they could have increased output by under their current deal. 
The American Petroleum Institute will also release its latest U.S. crude oil supply data at 4:30 PM ET.
By 2 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% higher at $84.28 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.5% to $85.11. 
Additionally, gold futures were largely unchanged at $1,795.80/oz, while EUR/USD edged higher to 1.1608.

221,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2021 02:16AM ET</span>",Investors tell Big-4 auditors they risk AGM rebellion over climate accounting,"By Simon Jessop and Carolyn Cohn
GLASGOW/LONDON (Reuters) - Major investors have warned the world’s top four audit firms they will vote to stop the firms working for the companies they invest in at AGMs from next year if audits do not integrate climate risk.
The challenge, laid out in letters from an investor group managing around $4.5 trillion that were seen by Reuters, marks an escalation in the group's efforts to ensure investors were armed with robust information.
The investors have been pushing auditors to improve for several years amid concern they were misrepresenting the true health of companies by not factoring in potential hits from the impact of climate change and associated policy changes.
Ahead of the COP26 climate talks in Scotland, the group had called for governments to force companies and auditors to file accounts in line with the world's goal of limiting global warming by mid-century.
The letters dated Nov. 1 and sent to Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC by the investor group pointed to recent research showing more than 70% of assessed 2020 audits had fallen short.
The group includes asset managers Sarasin & Partners, Pictet and  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors and pension schemes including RPMI Railpen. The investors said that after three years of discussions with the firms, they ""cannot afford to wait another three years"" for audits to improve.
At the next season for corporate annual general meetings, the auditors could ""increasingly expect to see"" investors vote against their reappointment if they failed to meet expectations, the letters said.
In the letter to Deloitte, for example, the group said the auditor was responsible for 19 of the companies assessed in the research, including oil major BP (NYSE:BP), miner Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) and building materials company CRH (NYSE:CRH).
""While we have identified some welcome signs of leadership, notably at BP, based on our analysis overall these audits have not met our expectations,"" the letter said.
""Outside the UK, the picture is worse. Of the remaining 16 audits undertaken by Deloitte, only three mention climate risk. None provides the visibility we seek on the potential financial implications of a 1.5C pathway, which global leaders have committed to delivering.""
Paul Stephenson, managing partner audit & assurance at Deloitte, said the auditor agreed that ""climate-related risks should be accounted for and disclosed appropriately in annual reports and financial statements. 
""We are clear that along with investors, professional bodies, regulators, standard setters and audited entities we have an important role to play in enhancing confidence in the information provided to markets,” he said.
CHALLENGING
Cath Burnet, Head of Audit at KPMG UK, said the firm had trained all its auditors last year on the impact of climate change risk on companies, in addition to the accounting and reporting implications.
""Our role as auditors includes challenging the recognition and measurement that climate has on the financial statements, as well as challenging narrative where it is misleading or inconsistent,"" she said. 
A PwC spokesperson said that ""to increase transparency in this area, our future audit opinions on larger UK listed companies will further explain how material climate-related risks have been addressed. 
“We welcome investor engagement in this area which will help drive company disclosure and the setting of clear climate related goals."" 
EY said in an emailed statement that the firm's audit teams ""continue to consider the risks that climate change brings to the companies we audit, where it relates to financial reporting.
""We are actively involved in developing standards and are supportive of ongoing work to establish a framework that companies and auditors can report against which would provide more consistent reporting for investors.""
The world's leaders meet in Glasgow this week aiming to accelerate climate action in an effort to cap global warming at no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial norms by mid-century.
After first writing to the Big Four audit firms in 2019, the investors said structural changes linked to climate change and associated policy action were accelerating, citing a recent United Nations report that issued ""code red for humanity"" over climate change.

""This is driving a more robust policy response globally,"" the latest letters said.
""Auditors that fail to test accounting assumptions taking these structural shifts into account are, in our view, failing in their duty to shareholders.""

(Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors in Colorado on Monday charged a 20-year-old California man with assaulting a flight attendant on an Oct. 27 American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) flight that forced its diversion.
The New York to Santa Ana, California, flight made an unscheduled landing in Denver after the alleged assault in which witnesses said a flight attendant was punched in the nose, resulting in bleeding and a concussion.
Brian Hsu, of Irvine, California, who is also charged with interference with a flight crew, was released on a $10,000 unsecured bond by U.S. Magistrate Judge Autumn Spaeth after making an initial appearance https://court.cacd.uscourts.gov/cacd/CrimIntakeCal.NSF/b3e4628792211f8d882571ee007340ec/873eeec84edc07c78825878000617295?OpenDocument in a U.S. district court in Santa Ana on Monday.
Spaeth ordered him to appear in Denver on Nov. 15 for a hearing and directed him to submit to a mental health evaluation.
A lawyer for Hsu did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
U.S. airlines have reported a record number of violent incidents this year and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has pledged a ""zero tolerance"" approach.
American Airlines Chief Executive Doug Parker said in a video posted on Instagram https://www.instagram.com/p/CVlEKgSD-F- last week ""this type of behavior has to stop,"" calling the incident ""one of the worst displays of unruly behavior we've ever witnessed."" 
An FBI agent said in an affidavit a witness reported Hsu punched the flight attendant in the face near the lavatory.
The flight attendant felt dizzy after the flight and was removed by stretcher. She was taken to the hospital where doctors told her that she had a concussion and she told the FBI she ""currently has pain in her nose, head, and sinuses.""
Hsu told the FBI he was returning home to California from New York after receiving brain surgery in Rhode Island. 
Hsu said he accidentally bumped a flight attendant and claimed the flight attendant then ""charged at him and hit her nose against the palm of his right hand.""
The flight attendant said she was struck on the head when speaking to another flight attendant. After telling the passenger to sit down because the fasten seat belt sign was lighted, ""the male passenger raised his arms as though he were going to stretch"" but then struck her on the head, the FBI said.
The flight attendant said she ""took a defensive posture"" and then he charged at her flailing his arms, the FBI affidavit said, adding the passenger initially backed down but later charged her and ""struck her in the face.""
On Oct. 8, President Joe Biden said he instructed the Justice Department to ""deal"" with https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-says-us-will-deal-with-violence-airplanes-2021-10-07 the rising number of violent incidents onboard planes.
Through Oct. 25, there have been 4,941 reports of unruly passenger incidents, including 3,580 related to pandemic face covering regulations.

In June, a group representing major U.S. airlines such as American, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and United Airlines, as well as aviation unions, asked the Justice Department to prosecute violent air passengers.
A union representing Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) workers said in May that a flight attendant ""was seriously assaulted, resulting in injuries to the face and a loss of two teeth.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's biggest industrial property company Goodman Group bumped up its profit forecast on Tuesday, citing supply chain blockages and a scarcity of warehouse space around the world, driving its shares to a record.
The upgrade shows a company benefitting from a squeeze in shipping capacity that has pushed up costs for manufacturers and retailers globally, as well as prompting them to hold on to supplies, enlarging storage requirements.
Goodman, which is building a mega-warehouse for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) in Sydney's outskirts, said it now expects to grow operating earnings per share 15% in the 2022 financial year, up from a forecast of 10% growth it gave in August.
""No one's giving up warehouse space,"" CEO Greg Goodman said in an interview.
""If you can get stock, you're sitting on it and filling your warehouses out, whatever product lines you're in,"" added Goodman, who holds 2% of Australia's 15th-largest company by market value.
Goodman shares rose 7% in afternoon trading, their biggest one-day gain since initial pandemic lockdowns in early 2020 drove analysts to upgrade their forecasts, touching their highest intraday level of A$23.95 before closing at A$23.49, up 5.6%. The broader market was down 0.3%.
""Increased demand, intensification, scale and duration of developments provide strong medium to long term earnings visibility and (assets under management) growth,"" said Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analysts in a client note, which called Goodman's update ""ahead of our expectations"".
The company, which has 153 properties in Australia and a presence in 14 countries, expects total assets under management to grow to A$70 billion ($52.65 billion) by June 2022, from A$62 billion in September with around A$12.7 billion of development projects in progress.
CEO Goodman said he expected the benefit from supply chain stoppages to last after the stoppages were resolved since customers wanted to adapt to long-term changes like population growth in cities, demand for shorter freight journeys to cut carbon emissions, and takeup of electric delivery vehicles.
""It was happening pre-COVID; all COVID did was put a bit of an accelerator under it, and customers that were thinking about it longer term are now going, 'I've got to think about it a bit shorter term',"" he said.

(Reuters) -A California judge on Monday said he would rule against several large counties that accused four drugmakers of fueling the U.S. opioid epidemic, saying they failed during a trial to prove their $50 billion case.
Orange County Superior Court Judge Peter Wilson issued a tentative ruling https://tmsnrt.rs/3mwfCNb finding Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd, Endo International (NASDAQ:ENDP) PLC and  AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV)'s Allergan (NYSE:AGN) unit not liable.
It marked the first trial win for any drug companies in the more than 3,300 lawsuits filed by states and local governments over a drug abuse crisis that the U.S. government says led to nearly 500,000 opioid overdose deaths over two decades.
The ruling came as J&J and the three largest U.S. drug distributors - McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK),  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH) and AmersourceBergen -- work to finalize a proposed deal to pay up to $26 billion to settle the thousands of cases against them.
A bankruptcy judge in August approved a settlement by OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma and its wealthy Sackler family owners of the claims against them that the company values at more than $10 billion.
During a months-long, non-jury trial, the populous Santa Clara, Los Angeles and Orange counties and the city of Oakland argued the drugmakers' marketing downplayed opioids' addictive risks and promoted them for broader uses than intended.
They argued the advertising led to billions of pain pills flooding their communities and a rise in overdose deaths. They said the companies should pay more than $50 billion to cover the costs of abating the public nuisance they created, plus penalties.
But Wilson said even if the drugmakers' marketing contained any misleading statements, the counties put forward no evidence to show that their promotional activities caused any medically inappropriate prescriptions to be written.
He agreed with the companies that the epidemic could not be considered a legal public nuisance because the federal government and the state had at the time determined the benefits of medically appropriate prescriptions outweighed their harms.
""There is simply no evidence to show that the rise in prescriptions was not the result of the medically appropriate provision of pain medications to patients in need,"" Wilson wrote.
J&J in a statement said the decision showed its marketing was ""appropriate and responsible."" John Hueston, Endo's lawyer, said it demonstrated his client's ""lawful conduct did not cause the widespread public nuisance at issue in plaintiffs' complaint.""
Teva in a statement said it continues to pursue a national settlement framework and that the ruling was a ""clear win"" for patients who would benefit from comprehensive settlements being finalized.
Representatives for the California plaintiffs did not respond to requests for comment. They could potentially challenge the tentative ruling before it becomes final. Tentative decisions are typical in California state courts.
In a statement, the lead lawyers overseeing related federal lawsuits against the companies -- Jayne Conroy, Paul Farrell and Joe Rice -- said they strongly disagreed with the ruling and stressed that it did not impact related cases nationally.

The only other opioid trial to reach a verdict resulted in an Oklahoma judge in 2019 ordering J&J to pay $465 million to the state. J&J is appealing that decision.
Trials are currently underway a New York case against Teva and AbbVie and in Ohio against three pharmacy chain operators. A West Virginia federal judge recently finished hearing evidence in a trial involving the distributors.

(Reuters) - The Sandbox, a Hong Kong-based gaming platform that allows users to build a virtual world using non-fungible tokens (NFTs), has raised $93 million from investors led by SoftBank’s Vision Fund 2, the company told Reuters on Monday. 
The latest fund raising came a little over a year after its last round, as the company saw fast growth in monthly active users and crossed $144 million in transaction volume on the platform. It also marks Vision Fund 2’s first investment in a company that issues its own cryptocurrency. 
The Sandbox, majority-owned by blockchain gaming developer Animoca Brands, allows players to build, own, and monetize their virtual gaming experiences on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides creators with ownership as NFTs and offers tools to create assets on the platform. 
It has announced partnership with brands and celebrities, including rapper Snoop Dogg, who will create a digital replica of his mansion in the Sandbox’s metaverse. 
The company declined to disclose its valuation, but the crypto currency it backs, the Sandbox coin, has a market cap of nearly $2 billion. The company said it currently owns about 22% of the tokens. 
The price of the coin has jumped over 200% after Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) announced it would change its name to Meta Platforms Inc last week, which spiked investor interest in companies that build metaverse gaming experience. Metaverse refers to the idea of a shared virtual platform that people can access through different devices and where they can move through digital environments.
This investment will help fuel the growth of the Sandbox creators' economy as it expands from gaming into fashion, architecture and virtual concerts, Sebastien Borget, chief operating officer and co-founder told Reuters in an interview.

""We are creating this open metaverse. We are positioning the Sandbox against those giant tech companies who are claiming the metaverse to be theirs, offering an alternative where users are first,"" said Borget.
Amid explosive growth for the NFT market, SoftBank has led a series of fundings in NFT-related companies this year. Its recent investments include sports NFT startup Candy Digital as well as NFT fantasy soccer game Sorare.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Tuesday morning, as U.S. shares came off a record-high close and investors await policy decisions from key central banks.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.32% by 9:42 PM ET (1:42 AM GMT). South Korea’s KOSPI rose 1.65%, with October’s consumer price index growing 0.1% month-on-month and 3.2% year-on-year.
In Australia, the ASX 200 fell 0.63%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index jumped 1.72%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.25% while the Shenzhen Component was steady at 14,476.53.
In the U.S., the S&P 500 hit a new peak and the Dow Jones Industrial Average touched 36,000 for the first time. Optimism over recent corporate earnings provided a boost, as Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) extended a rally. However, COVID-19-related supply chain challenges, alongside higher energy costs, could become a bigger challenge should they feed into wider, more enduring price pressures.
Investors now look to the U.S. Federal Reserve, which hands down its policy decision on Wednesday where it is expected to announce that it will begin asset tapering. The decision comes as the most-widespread U.S. supply crunch since 1973’s oil crisis fuels price pressures.
Other central banks handing down policy decisions include the Reserve Bank of Australia, whose decision is due later in the day. The Bank of England will hand its decision down on Nov. 4.
The key focus for the Fed meeting “will be much more on the Fed’s inflation stance than asset tapering,” Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Bank head of global G10 FX research Steve Englander said in a note.
“The elephant in the room is the headline and underlying inflation, which are higher than the Fed was anticipating,” he added.
On the data front, October’s Institute of Supply Management (ISM) manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI), released on Monday, was 60.8. The manufacturing PMI was a lower-than-expected 58.4.
The ISM non-manufacturing PMI is due on Wednesday. Trade data, including exports and imports, will be released on Thursday, followed by the latest U.S. jobs report, including non-farm payrolls, on Friday.
Meanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden’s $1.75 trillion tax and spending package seemed to hit a bump on the road, after Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat, warned that he could vote against the package and appealed for more time for Congress to assess the plan’s impact."
230,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2021 09:36PM ET</span>",Barclays CEO Staley departs after Epstein probe,"By Lawrence White
LONDON (Reuters) -  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Chief Executive Jes Staley is leaving the bank after a dispute with British financial regulators over how he described his ties with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Staley will be replaced as chief executive by the bank's head of global markets C.S. Venkatakrishnan, who pledged on Monday to continue his predecessor's strategy for Britain's third-biggest bank by market value. 
Staley's shock departure comes after Barclays was informed on Friday of the unpublished findings of a report by Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential (NYSE:PUK) Regulatory Authority (PRA) into Staley's characterisation of his relationship with Epstein, who killed himself in jail in August 2019 while awaiting trial on charges related to sex trafficking.
""In view of those conclusions, and Mr Staley's intention to contest them, the Board and Mr Staley have agreed that he will step down from his role as Group Chief Executive and as a director of Barclays,"" the bank said. 
""It should be noted that the investigation makes no findings that Mr Staley saw, or was aware of, any of Mr Epstein's alleged crimes, which was the central question underpinning Barclays' support for Mr Staley following the arrest of Mr Epstein in the summer of 2019,"" it said in a statement.
The investigation has yet to be published, though regulators have said previously that it was focused on how truthful Staley was about his ties to Epstein. 
If Staley is found to have misled regulators he could face a fine, a ban from Britain's financial industry or both. 
Barclays shares fell 2% following the announcement, before paring losses to trade down 1% at 1315 GMT, underperforming European rivals.
'I THOUGHT I KNEW HIM WELL' 
Staley dealt with Epstein during his long career at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), where Epstein was a major private banking client until 2013. 
A college dropout who styled himself as a brilliant financier, Epstein socialised in elite circles, including with former and future U.S. presidents. In 2008, he was registered as a sex offender but continued to maintain ties with powerful players in business and finance.
The New York Times reported in 2019 that Epstein had referred ""dozens"" of wealthy clients to Staley. It reported that Staley visited Epstein in prison when he was serving a sentence between 2008-09 for soliciting prostitution from a minor, while Bloomberg reported he visited Epstein's private island in 2015.
Staley told reporters last February that his relationship with Epstein had ""tapered off significantly"" after he left JPMorgan in 2013, and that he had not seen the disgraced financier since taking over as CEO of Barclays in 2015.
""I thought I knew him well, and I didn't. I'm sure with hindsight of what we all know now, I deeply regret having had any relationship with Jeffrey Epstein,"" he said at the time.
Epstein's links with prominent men have come back to haunt some of them. 
Leon Black, the billionaire investor, stepped down https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apollo-global-clayton-idUSKBN2BE1E0 from Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO), the private equity firm he co-founded, earlier this year after an outside review found he had paid Epstein $158 million for tax and estate planning. 
Britain's Prince Andrew https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/prince-andrew-seeks-dismissal-accuser-giuffres-lawsuit-2021-10-29 has quit royal duties over his associations with Epstein while Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates has said it was a ""huge mistake"" to spend time with the financier.
Britain's FCA and PRA regulators said in a statement they could not comment further on the Epstein investigation, which was launched https://www.reuters.com/article/us-barclays-results-idUSKBN2070NF after JPMorgan provided them with emails between Epstein and Staley from Staley's time as head of JPMorgan's private bank, the Financial Times reported last year.
RIGHT STRATEGY
Staley told staff in an internal memo seen by Reuters that he did not want his personal response to the investigations to be a distraction.
""Although I will not be with you for the next chapter of Barclays' story, know that I will be cheering your success from the sidelines,"" he said.
Staley has 28 days to formally notify the FCA that he is contesting its findings, after which an independent committee inside the watchdog will uphold or reject its conclusions, a source familiar with the process told Reuters.
If upheld, the investigation passes to an independent Upper Tribunal which again can back or reject the findings, the source said, in a process that could take months. 
The bank's new CEO Venkatakrishnan, who followed Staley to Barclays from JPMorgan and is known as Venkat, told staff on Monday the strategy put in place by his predecessor was ""the right one"", according to a separate memo also seen by Reuters.
Venkat added that he would announce changes to the organisation of the investment bank in the coming days, likely to mean filling his previous role and any other resulting vacancies, sources at the bank said.
Barclays' share price has fallen 9% since Staley's joined the bank nearly six years ago, a tenure not without controversy. 
His greatest success, insiders and analysts say, was to fight off a campaign by activist investor Edward Bramson in 2018 to have Staley removed on the grounds that Barclays' investment bank was underperforming and should be cut back. 

Bramson sold his stake earlier this year, and the bank's recent results have shown the investment bank performing strongly.
Also in 2018, Britain's financial regulators and Barclays fined Staley a combined 1.1 million pounds ($1.5 million) after he tried to identify a whistleblower who sent letters criticising a Barclays employee.

232,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2021 08:25PM ET</span>",Rogers Communications boardroom tussle outcome deferred to Nov. 5,"By Eva Mathews and Sarah Berman
(Reuters) -A battle for control of Rogers (NYSE:ROG) Communication Inc's (RCI) board wrapped up in a Canadian court on Monday as lawyers for former chairman Edward Rogers said he had the authority to appoint a new board without an in-person shareholder meeting, while company lawyers argued due processes were not followed.
RCI, Canada's largest wireless carrier, is embroiled in a boardroom battle after a feud in the founding family erupted into the open, weighing on the stock and raising doubts about the fate of a multibillion-dollar takeover.
The judge has set Nov. 5 to decide on the validity of the new board.
The dispute was triggered after Edward Rogers, son of late founder Ted Rogers, tried to remove Chief Executive Joe Natale in September, saying he had lost confidence in the CEO's ability to lead the merged entity after the planned C$20 billion ($16.1 billion) takeover of Shaw Communications (NYSE:SJR) goes through.
That put Edward Rogers at odds with his mother and two sisters, who backed Natale, and resulted in his removal as the company chair. Edward Rogers used his position as chair of the family-owned Rogers Control Trust, the entity that owns the majority of voting shares in the company, to name a new board, which recognized him as chairman.
He then approached the court in British Columbia, where the company is incorporated, to legitimize the new board.
RCI lawyer David Conklin told British Columbia Supreme Court Justice Shelley Fitzpatrick that the late founder foresaw a stalemate between the family trust and the board of directors, and specifically requested a public meeting to resolve it.
Conklin argued the former chair did not give shareholders an opportunity to respond to his plan to remove and appoint new board members, violating the company's own governance practices.
Lawyer Ken McEwan, arguing for Edward Rogers, said the former chair required the majority of shareholder votes to reconstitute the company's board of directors. As chairman of the family trust, he controlled 97.5% of the voting shares, giving him the authority to act, McEwan added.
Judge Fitzpatrick questioned McEwan about whether a meeting should have taken place before Edward Rogers could act on behalf of the family trust. McEwan said Edward Rogers had sufficient shareholders such that a meeting was not necessary.
Stephen Schachter, a lawyer representing RCI, said company rules require an in-person meeting to dismiss board members and refill their seats.
Schachter said Edward ""cannot thumb his nose"" at due process.
The family row playing out in public is a rare occurrence in Canada and has caught analysts and investors by surprise. The boardroom drama in the middle of Rogers' biggest takeover is a distraction, analysts have warned. Shaw last week reiterated its support for the deal.
Shaw stock closed on Monday at C$35.47, compared with Rogers' offer price of C$40.50, which is a sign that some market players have doubts about the success of the deal.
""Shaw shareholders could get cold feet and pull out of the deal,"" said Keith Snyder, an analyst at CFRA Research. If it pulls out, he added, that would give competitors like BCE (NYSE:BCE) Inc or Telus (NYSE:TU) Corp a chance to make a bid for the company. 
Matthew Dolgin, an analyst at Morningstar, believes a resolution cannot be expected soon. The events have weighed on Rogers' stock, which is down 1.4% this year, compared with a 17.9% rally in BCE and a 12.67% gain in Telus.

""Normally we'd more readily dismiss the actions and desires of an ousted chairman, but the complexity of the firm's family control makes it anything but cut-and-dried,"" Dolgin said.

LISBON (Reuters) -In her first public address since she leaked a trove of damaging documents about Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)'s inner workings, whistleblower Frances Haugen urged her former boss, Mark Zuckerberg, to step down and allow change rather than devoting resources to a rebrand. 
""I think it is unlikely the company will change if [Mark Zuckerberg] remains the CEO,"" Haugen told a packed arena on Monday at the opening night of the Web Summit, a tech fest drawing dozens of thousands to the Portuguese capital, Lisbon.
The former Facebook product manager replied in the positive to the question of whether Zuckerberg should resign, and added: ""Maybe it's a chance for someone else to take the reins... Facebook would be stronger with someone who was willing to focus on safety.""
The social network, with nearly 3 billion users, changed its name to Meta last week, in a rebrand that focuses on building the ""metaverse,"" a shared virtual environment that it bets will be the successor to the mobile internet.
But early adopters of the virtual worlds known as the metaverse blasted Facebook's rebranding as an attempt to capitalise on growing buzz over a concept it did not create to deflect from recent negative attention.
Commenting on the rebranding, Haugen said it made no sense given the security issues that have yet to be tackled. 
""Over and over Facebook chooses expansion and new areas instead of sticking the landing on what they've already done,"" Haugen told an animated crowd which frequently burst into applause as she spoke.
Facebook's announcement came amid strong criticism from lawmakers and regulators over the corporation's business practices - particularly its enormous market power, algorithmic decisions and the policing of abuses on its services.
The social media network, which operates a dual class share structure through which Zuckerberg and a small group of investors control the company, has hit back saying the documents leaked by Haugen were being used to paint a ""false picture."" 

Haugen told British and American lawmakers last month that Facebook would fuel more violent unrest worldwide unless it curbed its algorithms which push extreme, divisive content and prey on vulnerable demographics to keep them scrolling.
""A key problem is that the foundation of the platform's security is based on monitoring content language by language, which does not scale to all the countries where Facebook operates,"" Haugen noted.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States is rolling out Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines for children aged 5 to 11 this week, but most of the 15 million shots being shipped initially are unlikely to be available before next week, the White House said on Monday.
Millions of doses specifically formulated for children of that age group will start arriving at distribution centers over the next few days, White House coronavirus response coordinator Jeff Zients said, and the federal government has purchased enough supply for all eligible 28 million children.
""We are ready to execute, pending CDC's decision. And starting the week of November 8th, our vaccination program for kids ages 5 through 11 will be running at full strength,"" Zients told reporters at a briefing.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday authorized the  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) coronavirus vaccine for children aged 5 to 11 years, making it the first COVID-19 shot for young children in the United States. 
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still needs to advise on how the shot should be administered, which will be decided after a group of outside advisers discuss the plan on Tuesday. 
Following the CDC's decision, parents will be able to visit vaccines.gov and filter locations offering the vaccine for the children, Zients said.
""The whole plan is based on Pfizer vaccines,"" he said. 
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc said on Sunday it would delay filing its request for an emergency use authorization for a half-strength 50-microgram dose of the vaccine for children ages 6 to 11.
Shares in Moderna fell 2.3%, or $8.04, to $337.17 on Monday while Pfizer shares were off 10 cents at $43.64.
At the end of last week, the seven-day average number of coronavirus cases dropped 3% to around 69,000 daily cases, the average hospitalization rate fell 10% to around 5,100 cases, and the daily deaths average fell 10% to around 1,100, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said at the same briefing.

U.S. Chief Medical Advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said it was ""very likely"" everyone would be able to get a vaccine booster shot ""within a reasonable amount of time.""
Currently the CDC recommendations for boosters cover specific categories of people.

236,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2021 06:25PM ET</span>",EV startup Rivian could be worth nearly as much as Honda in U.S. IPO,"By Noor Zainab Hussain
(Reuters) -Rivian Automotive Inc, which is backed by Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), is targeting a valuation of more than $53 billion for its U.S. debut, making the electric vehicle manufacturer potentially almost as valuable as rival Honda Motor. 
The startup is looking to raise up to $8.4 billion, setting it up to be the third-largest initial public offering (IPO) by funds raised in the past decade in the United States.
Only three other companies have raised more than $8 billion while going public since 2011, according to data from Dealogic.
 Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) raised a record $25 billion in 2014, Meta Platforms Inc garnered $16 billion in 2012, while Uber (NYSE:UBER) made $8.1 billion in 2019.
Since last year, companies in the EV space have emerged as some of the hottest investments, especially among SPAC investors on the hunt for the next Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. 
While Rivian has yet to sell any significant volume of its electric vans or trucks, it could likely be valued higher than Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), although less than Honda, General Motors (NYSE:GM) or its backer Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co.
Founded in 2009 as Mainstream Motors by R. J. Scaringe, the company changed to Rivian in 2011, a name that is derived from ""Indian River"" in Florida, a place Scaringe frequented in a rowboat as a youth.
The startup has been investing heavily to ramp up production, including for its upscale all-electric R1T pickup truck, which was launched in September, beating out competition from established rivals such as Tesla, General Motors and Ford.
Rivian, which disclosed nearly $1 billion in losses for the first half of this year, had about 48,390 pre-orders for its pickup trucks and R1S SUVs in the United States and Canada as of September.
It is currently pursuing a two-track strategy: building electric delivery vans for Amazon and developing an electric pickup and SUV brand aimed at affluent individuals.
Amazon, which disclosed a 20% stake in Rivian at the end of October, has ordered 100,000 of its electric delivery vans as part of the e-commerce giant's effort to cut carbon footprint.
Ford holds a more than 5% share in the EV startup, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
STIFF COMPETITION
Rivian, which confidentially filed paperwork for an IPO in August, will, however, face tough competition from automakers in both the consumer and commercial van markets. 
Ford said last week it has more than 160,000 orders for its F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck and that an electric version of its Transit commercial van is ""completely sold out."" 
General Motors is gearing up production of electric delivery vans, SUVs and pickup trucks.

Rivian said it would sell 135 million shares at a price range of between $57 and $62 each. Reuters reported in September that it could seek a valuation of nearly $80 billion and raise up to $8 billion in its U.S. listing. 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and J.P. Morgan are the lead underwriters. Rivian will list on the Nasdaq under the symbol ""RIVN"".

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) -Global equity markets rose on Monday as investors await clarity from the U.S. Federal Reserve as to whether it will might raise interest rates sooner than they anticipated several months ago, before a sustained bout of inflation.
Wall Street advanced to record highs as gains for energy shares and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) were countered by declines in the tech sector only to stumble slightly lower, closing the session mixed. European stocks also hit record highs following upbeat earnings reports and a surge in banking shares.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.71% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.44% as the multi-national mood was supported by Japan's post-election boost and stabilizing coal prices in China.
Harley-Davidson Inc (NYSE:HOG) shares jumped after the European Union removed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products, including whiskey, power boats and company's motorcycles.
The euro zone bank sector touched its highest level in more than two years and was the day's best performer as bond yields surged on expectations the European Central Bank will hike rates next year. [GVD/EUR]
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 94.28 points, or 0.26%, to 35,913.84 after eclipsing 36,000 points for the first time ever during intraday trading. The S&P 500 gained 8.29 points, or 0.18%, to 4,613.67 while the Nasdaq Composite added 97.53 points, or 0.63%, to 15,595.92.
Japan's Nikkei rose 2.61% in early trades after Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's Liberal Democratic Party won an unexpected comfortable victory, raising hopes for political stability and stimulus in the term ahead. 
The dollar drifted lower after posting its biggest daily rise in more than four months last Friday as hedge funds pared bearish bets before the Federal Reserve's policy meeting this week.
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday is expected to approve plans to scale back its $120 billion monthly bond-buying program put in place to support the economy, while investors will also be focused on commentary about interest rates and how sustained the recent surge in inflation is.
""This (meeting) is going to be a relatively big deal,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management in Chicago. ""We are expecting to hear the glide path for tapering the bond purchases.
""The market has to be on guard for a more aggressive, hawkish view from the Fed,"" said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said tapering would be over by mid-year 2022, which has been pegged as June, but that could also mean May, Chandler said. 
The Reserve Bank of Australia meets on Tuesday, the Fed on Wednesday and the Bank of England on Thursday. 
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, fell 0.326%, with the euro up 0.39% to $1.1605.
U.S. Treasury yields were mixed on Monday and German bond yields edged higher but trimmed earlier gains as investors retained their bets for two rate hikes from the ECB next year. 
ECB President Christine Lagarde disappointed expectations of a firm pushback against the recent market pricing of two hikes next year, which are at odds with the bank's inflation outlook. 
Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 1/32 in price to yield 1.5575%, from 1.556% late on Monday, while German 10-year yields slid to yield -0.099%.
""We may come out of (the) week past peak yield volatility, or at least, past peak rate hike fever,"" said NatWest Markets strategist John Briggs. ""A lot of the things that went parabolic and took market rate hike expectations to a boil are at least looking like they are calming a bit.""
Commodities stabilized with a further drop in Chinese coal prices pushing them 50% below last month's record high. 
Swaps pricing points to a better-than-even chance of the BoE hiking on Thursday, while the RBA will likely make some sort of guidance adjustment after again declining to defend its yield target on Monday.
A survey on Monday showed U.S. manufacturing activity slowed in October, with all industries reporting record-long lead times for raw materials, indicating that stretched supply chains continued to constrain economic activity early in the fourth quarter.
And a U.S. Treasury Department-led regulatory body called for Congress to regulate issuers of ""stablecoins"" like banks and urged financial agencies to assess whether the role of these fast-growing digital assets in the country's payments system posed a systemic risk.
Oil prices settled higher on Monday as expectations of strong demand and a belief that a key producer group will not turn on the spigots too fast helped reverse initial losses caused by the release of fuel reserves by No. 1 world energy consumer China.

U.S. crude settled 0.6% higher at $84.05 per barrel and Brent closed at $84.71, up 1.2% on the day.
Spot gold added 0.6% to $1,792.63 an ounce. Bitcoin last fell 1.03% to $60,726.53.

(BBBY), which is headquartered in Union, N.J., are two prominent players in the retail industry. TJX operates as an off-price apparel and home fashions retailer that sells family apparel, home fashions, fine jewelry and accessories, and other merchandise worldwide. It operates through four segments—Marmaxx; HomeGoods; TJX Canada; and TJX International. BBBY operates a chain of retail stores that sells domestic merchandise, home furnishings, consumables, and various juvenile products internationally. It also operates Decorist, an online interior design platform that provides personalized home design services.
Despite the recent resurgence of COVID-19 cases, rising inflation, and supply chain disruptions, retail sales rose for two straight months—0.9% in August and 0.7% in September. An expected increase in consumer spending ahead of the holiday season, supported by an improving job market, should further drive the industry’s growth. With increasing foot traffic at brick-and-mortar stores ahead of a holiday season, the National Retail Federation (NRF) expects holiday sales to rise between 8.5% -10.5% during November and December. The global retail industry is expected to grow 7.2% in 2021. So, both BBBY and TJX should benefit.
While BBBY has declined 60.3% in price over the past nine months, TJX has surged 2.3%. TJX is a clear winner with 26.6% gains versus BBBY’s negative returns in terms of the past year’s performance. But which of these stocks is a better pick now? Let’s find out.

(Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes notched record closing highs on Monday as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares surged and the energy sector gained while investors looked ahead to a major Federal Reserve meeting later in the week.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average eclipsed 36,000 points for the first time ever during intraday trading, ending just shy of that level.
Accommodative monetary policy has been one of the key supports for the stock market, with the benchmark S&P 500 rising 22.8% so far this year.
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday is expected to approve plans to scale back its $120 billion monthly bond-buying program put in place to help the economy during the coronavirus pandemic, while investors will also be focused on commentary about interest rates and how sustained the recent surge in inflation is. 
""This (meeting) is going to be a relatively big deal,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management in Chicago. ""We are expecting to hear the glide path for tapering the bond purchases.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 94.28 points, or 0.26%, to 35,913.84, the S&P 500 gained 8.29 points, or 0.18%, to 4,613.67 and the Nasdaq Composite added 97.53 points, or 0.63%, to 15,595.92.
Tesla shares jumped 8.5%, helping lift the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector about 1.5%.
Shares of the electric car maker have charged higher since the company's market value crossed $1 trillion last week. 
Among S&P 500 sectors, energy led the way, rising 1.6%, while the communications services group dropped 0.7%.
The small-cap Russell 2000 index was a standout, rising 2.7% for its biggest daily percentage gain since late August.
A survey on Monday showed U.S. manufacturing activity slowed in October, with all industries reporting record-long lead times for raw materials, indicating that stretched supply chains continued to constrain economic activity early in the fourth quarter. 
With over half of S&P 500 companies having reported, third-quarter earnings are expected to have climbed 39%, according to Refinitiv IBES.
""There continues to be positive sentiment around earnings despite some high-profile misses,"" said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at investment management firm Invesco.
In company news, Harley-Davidson Inc (NYSE:HOG) shares jumped 9.1% after the European Union removed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products, including whiskey, power boats and company's motorcycles. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.84-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.05-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 46 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 208 new highs and 39 new lows.
About 10.5 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 10.3 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) -Australian mining billionaire Andrew Forrest is planning what could be up to an $8.4 billion ""green hydrogen"" investment in Argentina, the South American country's government said on Monday after a meeting between the businessman and President Alberto Fernandez.
Forrest, whose Fortescue Metals Group (OTC:FSUGY) Ltd aims to become carbon-neutral by 2030, is a major backer of green hydrogen, a zero-carbon fuel made by electrolysis using renewable power to split water into hydrogen and oxygen.
While currently more expensive than rival fuels, backers tout it as a clean replacement for fossil fuels in industries otherwise hard to decarbonize. The International Renewable Energy Agency has forecast rapid growth in coming years.
Fortescue is looking at developing the project in the province of Río Negro with a view to producing green hydrogen on an industrial scale, which the government said would help create more than 15,000 direct jobs and additional ones indirectly.
""It is expected to turn Río Negro into a global green hydrogen export hub by 2030,"" the government said. ""It is the most important international investment for our country in the last 20 years.""
Fernandez and Forrest, it said, met on the sidelines of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow.
Agustin Pichot, the Latin America head of Fortescue Future Industries, the mining firm's green energy unit, said in a press conference alongside government officials that the project would be one of the company's most important worldwide.
""We signed a memorandum of understanding a few months ago and today we are talking about an investment of around $8 billion,"" he said.

The Australian company will carry out analysis on local resources as well as wind availability, which it uses as the main energy source to power production. If that goes well, public consultations and other work for construction would begin.
A $1.2 billion pilot stage aiming to produce 35,000 tons of green hydrogen is planned for 2022-2024, before a $7.2 billion first productive stage aiming for an output of some 215,000 tons of green hydrogen - enough to power 1.6 million homes.

(Reuters) -Weather and staffing-led turbulence stretched into a fourth day for American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), with the top U.S. carrier cancelling more flights on Monday to push the total number to nearly 2,300. The airline said it canceled 340 flights, or 6% of its total planned flights on Monday, as of 11 a.m. ET.
Staffing shortages have hit American Airlines, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co and  Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE) Inc in particular, as they ramp up flights ahead of the holiday season but face problems finding enough pilots and flight attendants.
""Flight Attendant staffing at American is strained and reflects what is happening across the industry as we continue to deal with pandemic-related issues,"" flight attendants' union APFA said.
American's pilot union said last month they planned to picket the carrier's major hubs to protest work schedule, fatigue, and a lack of adequate accommodation this summer.
The cancellations are another setback to the Texas-based company, which is already reeling from rising fuel and labor costs impacting the industry as the U.S. prepares to open borders to fully vaccinated travelers.
""The airline had particular weather issues that then spiraled into rippled cancellations and were compounded by an inability to fill out schedules from their labor reserves,"" UBS analyst Myles Walton said.
Severe winds at the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport reduced American's arrival capacity by more than half, with the inclement weather also impacting staffing.
The company, however, hoped some of that impact could be mitigated with nearly 1,800 flight attendants returning from leave starting Monday.
""We expect considerable improvement beginning today with some residual impact from the weekend,"" company spokeswoman Sarah Jantz said in a statement. American's shares recovered losses to trade up 1%.

Meanwhile, rival airlines seemed to have fared better. 
Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) said on Monday it has not experienced any weather-related cancellations so far, while United Airlines said there were no ""widespread cancellations"".

(Reuters) -Novavax Inc expects regulators in India, the Philippines and elsewhere to make a decision on its COVID-19 vaccine within ""weeks,"" its chief executive told Reuters, after the shot on Monday received its first emergency use authorization (EUA) from Indonesia.
 Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) shares were up about 13% after the company also said it had filed an application for emergency use of the vaccine to Canada and the European Medicines Agency.
For Indonesia, the shot will be manufactured by the world's largest vaccine manufacturer, Serum Institute in India (SII), and sold under the Indian company's brand name, Covovax. Novavax said initial shipments into Indonesia are expected to begin imminently. 
The World Health Organization (WHO) is also reviewing Novavax's regulatory filing and the U.S. drugmaker expects that review to be resolved in the coming weeks, Chief Executive Stanley Erck told Reuters in a phone interview on Monday.
A green light from the WHO would set the stage for Novavax to begin shipping doses to the COVAX program that supplies shots to low-income countries. Novavax and SII have together committed to provide more than 1.1 billion doses to COVAX, which is co-led by the WHO. 
“I think we'll get some doses to COVAX this year,"" Erck said. ""But I think (Novavax is) going to really start being able to ship large quantity to COVAX in the first quarter"" of 2022.
Erck said Novavax has resolved all of its manufacturing challenges and does not expect regulators to have any further concerns about its production processes.
He said Novavax is “in dialogue with the U.S. FDA and ... we expect a full submission within the next several weeks.”
Novavax had delayed filing for U.S. approval, and Politico reported last month that the company faced production and quality problems.
SII is authorized to make the Novavax vaccine and the U.S. company said it will apply for regulatory authorization for other facilities, such as its plant in the Czech republic, in the coming weeks.
Indonesia is slated to receive 20 million doses of the protein-based vaccine this year, according to the government.
Penny Lukito, chief of the National Agency for Drug and Food Control of Indonesia, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Novavax has so far applied for EUA in various countries, including the UK, Australia, India and the Philippines.
“It will be weeks, not months, for them to review” Novavax’s regulatory submissions and potentially clear the shot for use, Erck said.

The company, along with Japanese partner Takeda Pharmaceutical Co, said on Friday it was preparing to seek regulatory approval for a rollout in Japan early next year. 
The Novavax shot was shown to be more than 90% effective, including against a variety of concerning variants of the coronavirus in a large, late-stage U.S.-based trial.

The National Agency of Drug and Food Control of the Republic of Indonesia granted emergency use authorization, or EUA, for Novavax's Covid-19 vaccine. The vaccine will be manufactured by SII in India and marketed by SII in Indonesia under the brand name Covovax.
There had previously been concerns about the timing of approvals for Novavax's vaccine. However, investors have been buoyed by today's news, with shares currently trading over 12% above Friday's close, around $167.69. Its stock price initially hit a high of over $173 following the news.
Stanley C. Erck, the company's President and CEO said it ""marks the first regulatory authorization worldwide of a protein-based COVID-19 vaccine based on Phase 3 clinical data demonstrating efficacy and a favorable safety profile.""
""This is a landmark moment for Novavax and our partner, Serum Institute of India, and it is the first of many authorizations that Novavax expects in the coming weeks and months for our vaccine globally,"" he added.
Elsewhere, Novavax announced regulatory progress after filing for vaccine authorization with Health Canada and completing its submission for a rolling review to the European Medicines Agency."

(Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that have yet to be certified by peer review.
Heart attack patients with COVID-19 have lower survival rate
The odds of surviving a heart attack are significantly lower when a person also has COVID-19, even though such patients tend to be generally younger than typical heart patients, a new study found. The researchers reviewed data on more than 80,000 people who had heart attacks in the United States in 2019 or 2020. Most of them - about 76,000 - had heart attacks at home or at work, or in some other community setting. In this group, 15.2% of those with COVID-19 later died in the hospital, compared to 11.2% of heart attack patients without COVID-19. Among the roughly 4,000 patients who were already hospitalized when the heart attack occurred, 78.5% of those with COVID-19 died, compared to 46.1% of those without COVID-19, according to a report published on Friday in JAMA https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2785893. Overall, the COVID-19 heart attack patients were more likely to have gone into cardiac arrest - when the heart stops beating - and less likely to undergo procedures to reopen clogged heart arteries, the researchers found. They said more research is needed to understand why a diagnosis of COVID-19 increases the risk for death in patients having heart attacks.
Early Israeli data support  Pfizer  booster

Early data on the efficacy of a booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE) and partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) announced by the Israeli Health Ministry and now published in a peer-reviewed journal suggest a sharp reduction in risk of severe infections soon after administration. Pfizer has said that its vaccine's efficacy wanes over time. From late July through late September, when the Delta variant was predominant, researchers tracked more than 1.4 million people who had received two doses of the vaccine at least five months earlier, half of whom had also gotten a third dose at least a week before being enrolled in the study. As reported on Friday in The Lancet https:// those who received the booster had a 93% lower risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization, a 92% lower risk of severe illness, and 81% lower risk of COVID-19-related death. The average age in the study was 52. Both groups - boosted and unboosted - had similar lifestyles and health status. As it was not a randomized controlled trial, the data cannot prove cause and effect. And how long any extra protection lasts is not yet clear, given that no one was tracked for more than two months, and half were tracked for less than two weeks.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Amazon.com on Monday asked the https://apps.fcc.gov/els/GetAtt.html?id=285359&x= U.S. Federal Communications Commission for approval to launch and operate two prototype internet satellites by the end of 2022 as part of the company's effort to create a space-based satellite network.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has pledged to spend at least $10 billion to build 3,236 such satellites through its Project Kuiper program, said the testing and demonstration launch is ""an important step toward Amazon’s goal of delivering high-capacity, low latency broadband communications services to tens of millions of unserved and underserved consumers and businesses.""
Amazon said on Monday it ""continues to invest in Project Kuiper as we approach full production launches and prepare to serve tens of millions of customers around the world.""
In 2020, the FCC approved the Project Kuiper plan for the constellation of low-Earth orbit satellites to compete with the Starlink network being built out by Elon Musk’s SpaceX.
Amazon has sparred with Musk, recently accusing the billionaire of ignoring a variety of government-imposed rules, including several Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requirements.
""The conduct of SpaceX and other Musk-led companies makes their view plain: rules are for other people, and those who insist upon or even simply request compliance are deserving of derision and ad hominem attacks,"" Amazon wrote. ""If the FCC regulated hypocrisy, SpaceX would be keeping the commission very busy.""

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Musk are rivals in the private space launch business. Bezos' Blue Origin has challenged the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's decision to award a $2.9 billion lunar lander contract to SpaceX.
SpaceX has accused Amazon in its own filing with the FCC of seeking to delay SpaceX's plan: ""While SpaceX has proceeded to deploy more than 1,700 satellites, Amazon has yet to even attempt to address the radiofrequency interference and orbital debris issues that must be resolved before Amazon can deploy its constellation.""

Investing.com – The major averages retreated from record highs Monday, though gains in energy and consumer discretionary kept downside momentum in check ahead of data-laden week including a decision from the Federal Reserve on bond buying.
The S&P 500 fell 0.1% and hit an earlier all-time high of 4,619.20. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1%, or 38 points after topping 36,000 for the first time ever. The Nasdaq climbed 0.37%, and had earlier notched a record of 15,531.0. In small caps, the Russell 2000 Futures, up 2.4%, remained on track for its best day in a year. 
Energy was up about 1% as oil prices continued to rise amid expectations that the major oil producers are unlikely to turn increase production to alleviate the energy supply crunch.
Bank of America forecast Brent crude to hit $120 a barrel by the end of June 2022 as the rebound in gasoline demand amid refining-capacity constraints could continue to support oil prices.
 Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN),  Marathon Oil  (NYSE:MRO), APA Corporation (NASDAQ:APA) were among biggest gainers in the sector.
Consumer discretionary continued to add to gains from last week, led by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) as the electric vehicle maker climbed to fresh record highs.
Casino stocks including  Las Vegas Sands  (NYSE:LVS), Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN), Melco Resorts & Entertainment (NASDAQ:MLCO) also lifted the sector, shrugging off data showing casino revenue in the Asian gambling mecca of Macau fell by 40% in the 12 months through October.
Tech, however, was a drag on the broader market as big tech started the week on the backfoot amid a rise in Treasury yields.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Microsoft and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) were in the red.
The 10-year Treasury yield topped 1.6%, but pared some gains as U.S. manufacturing data continued to point supply-chain woes that aren't expected to ease anytime soon.
""The manufacturing sector is growing, but it faces severe headwinds, which are unlikely to fade materially before next spring,"" Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a note.
In other news,  Coca-Cola Co  (NYSE:KO) acquired Bodyarmor for $5.6 billion as the beverage giant's history seeks to provide ramp-up competition against Gatorade, the leader in the sports drink market.
Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG), meanwhile, jumped 9% after the U.S. and the European Union ended their dispute on steel and aluminum tariffs, mitigating the risk of the motorcycle maker incurring a 56% levy on its imports into the EU.
The grind higher on Wall Street comes just a day ahead of the Fed's two-day meeting starting Tuesday, expected to culminate in an unchanged decision on rates and an announcement that the pace of bond purchases would be reduced by about $15 billion a month. "

The program will be tested at 10 locations in the Netherlands, the company said on Monday, adding that Dutch non-Tesla EV drivers can access the Tesla stations, or Superchargers, through the Tesla app. 
(Graphic: Tesla opens superchargers for other EVs: https://graphics.reuters.com/TESLA-EVCHARGING/zdvxormmrpx/chart.png) 
Tesla drivers can continue to use these stations and the company will closely monitor each site for congestion.
Tesla operates more than 25,000 Superchargers worldwide, while other carmakers have formed alliances or invested in startups for networks as they rush new electric vehicles to market.
The Superchargers are open to cars with the Combined Charging System (CCS) favored by BMW, Mercedes-Benz maker Daimler (OTC:DDAIF), Ford and the Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), which includes Audi and Porsche.
Tesla uses the CCS standard in Europe, allowing a wide range of cars to charge in stations without an adapter that uses a similar connector. 
Charging prices for non-Tesla drivers will include extra costs to support a broad range of vehicles and site adjustments to accommodate these vehicles, Tesla said. The price to charge can be lowered with a charging membership, it added. 

""This move directly supports our mission to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy,"" the company said.
Tesla, which crossed $1 trillion in market capitalization for the first time last week, has defied supply chain issues and global chip shortages to mark a record quarter for car deliveries as demand ramps up and its investments in new factories pay off.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Rising illiquidity in the $14.8 trillion U.S. Treasuries market could spill over into other financial markets as hedge funds reduce their capacity to take on risk, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) warned in a report on Monday.
Leveraged hedge funds in particular have likely suffered large losses from the rapid increase in short-term Treasury yields, the report added. 
""These moves have exposed still fragile U.S. Treasury market conditions,"" Mark Cabana, head of U.S. Rates Strategy at Bank of America, wrote.

The warning comes as expectations that rapid gains in inflation may prompt the Federal Reserve to move more quickly to raise interest rates have helped flatten the yield curve at its swiftest pace since 2011. [L1N2RP2KS]

The Federal Open Market Committee is widely expected to announce Wednesday that it will begin tapering its $120 billion-per-month bond buying program. 
While the move to end the support of the economy it put in place at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic has been well-telegraphed to investors, some investors worry that surging inflation will force the central bank to unwind its bond buying faster and eventually raise interest rates sooner than the Fed had earlier suggested.

Blackrock is the biggest institutional shareholder of THG after the company founder Matthew Moulding's 14.19% holding, according to Refinitiv Eikon.
THG was rocked by a 35% share price collapse after an underwhelming investor presentation in October, forcing it to address corporate governance concerns more broadly.
The company has tried to allay investor concerns, but so far has had little traction in halting the fall in its share price. 
THG appointed an executive from backer SoftBank to its board of directors last month and said it was looking for an independent chair ahead of a proposed premium listing on the London Stock Exchange.

Shares of THG have fallen nearly 66% since the start of September.

DOHA (Reuters) - Qatar and Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY) will team up in a multi-billion pound project to develop and invest in green technology start-ups in the UK and the Gulf Arab state which they hope will reach ""unicorn"" status as worth more than $1 billion.
In a joint statement on Monday they said they aim to create five such fast-growing companies by 2030 and up to 20 by 2040, adding the venture would be based at a pair of science and engineering campuses that Doha will fund in the north of England and in Qatar.
The partners said the campuses would be testing grounds for start-ups to ""prove and scale"" technologies to combat climate change. They said they hadn't yet decided on the exact location or design of either campus but would announce more in “mid-2022”.
The announcement by the world's largest liquefied natural gas supplier and the aerospace group - first reported by the Times of London on Saturday - came as world leaders began the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow.
The project aims to create a ""substantial"" investment pool to finance research and development and provide early-state venture capital investment to create and scale-up businesses. Rolls is expected to provide engineering and manufacturing support.
The partners said they hope to attract co-investors and to create investment opportunities for Qatari businesses and investors. The project aims to create some 10,000 jobs.

The non-profit Qatar Foundation will administer the project for Qatar, in a shift for the wealthy Gulf state whose major investments in the UK are managed by sovereign wealth fund the Qatar Investment Authority. 
Qatar holds several high-profile investments in the UK, including the Shard skyscraper, Harrods department store and the Savoy hotel.

The deal marks a shift in strategy for the world's largest beverage maker after it spent the last year offloading or discontinuing brands, including its own energy-drink brand, to focus on Coca-Cola sodas.
The deal, which values BodyArmor at about $6.59 billion, is Coca-Cola's largest for a single brand; It comes about three years after the company bought British coffee chain Costa for $5.1 billion.
BodyArmor, which markets itself as electrolyte-filled energy recovery drink for athletes, currently makes about $1.4 billion in annual retail sales and has a 50% growth rate, Coca-Cola said. ""It gives Coke a strong stable of products in the rapidly growing sports hydration category. It's a nice premium brand that has opportunity for expansion over time,"" Edward Jones analyst John Boylan said about BodyArmor that gained popularity after basketball star Kobe Bryant backed it in 2013.
However, Boylan believes the massive deal would only ""give Coke a solid No. 2 position in an attractive category"". 
Coca-Cola, which had first acquired a 15% stake in BodyArmor in 2018, said the brand's co-founder Mike Repole will stick around after the deal to advise on the marketing and packaging of products.

At the time Coca-Cola took its initial stake, BodyArmor was valued at $2 billion, according to a Sunday Wall Street Journal report https://www.wsj.com/articles/coke-to-pay-5-6-billion-for-full-control-of-bodyarmor-11635713140. 
The deal comes as Coca-Cola and rival PepsiCo face immense supply chain bottlenecks, forcing the companies to raise prices to counter higher freight and raw material costs. PepsiCo has even said it has had to deal with a shortage of Gatorade bottles.

John Roe will join as managing director, head of BlackRock Investment Stewardship (BIS), Americas, next week, according to a memo sent to employees on Monday and seen by Reuters.
BlackRock oversees $9.5 trillion in assets and already has one of the most powerful voices in the governance world, as it is large owner in most companies. It also has recently signaled it is taking a much tougher stance on climate and sustainability issues.
Roe will replace Ray Cameron, who for three years headed investment stewardship for the Americas and moved to BlackRock's institutional client business several weeks ago. The investment stewardship team in the United States has seen some turnover with a number of people leaving recently.
Roe co-led the ESG (environmental, social and governance) Group as a partner at Joele Frank and previously worked at prominent proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), where he was head of ISS Analytics. Before that he worked as chief operating officer at an equity investment fund.
""John therefore joins us with a blend of governance experience gained from his time on the buy side, in a leadership role at a proxy advisor firm, and his most recent role at Joele Frank,"" Sandy Boss, BlackRock's global head of investment stewardship, wrote in the memo.

As its assets swell, BlackRock, one of the world's biggest asset managers, has become increasingly influential in guiding corporate behavior.

(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST) have reached a tentative agreement to settle lawsuits over the presence of a cancer-causing substance in several recalled J&J sunscreen products.
Lawyers for the companies and for plaintiffs suing over the Neutrogena and Aveeno-branded aerosol sunscreen products disclosed the settlement in a court filing in the Fort Lauderdale, Florida federal court on Friday, without revealing its terms.
They said they expected to submit the settlement for court approval by Nov. 19.
J&J said in an emailed statement: ""This agreement, which is subject to court approval, is not an admission of liability or wrongdoing ... We strongly dispute the merits of these lawsuits and stand behind our position that we marketed our sunscreen products appropriately and responsibly.""
J&J voluntarily recalled four Neutrogena aerosol sunscreen products and one from Aveeno on July 14, after finding small amounts of benzene, a carcinogen. It said the levels it detected were too low to pose a health risk, but ""out of an abundance of caution"" pulled all lots of the products and offered refunds.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said following the recall it was investigating how benzene had ended up in the sunscreens.
A federal judicial panel earlier this month consolidated lawsuits filed nationwide against J&J and Costco, which sold the products, in the Florida court. The settlement would resolve all of the claims in the consolidated litigation, according to the filing.

Plaintiffs have said in court filings that tens of thousands of consumers could have claims.

Read on to learn why.With the holiday season around the corner, consumer stocks have been enjoying immense investor attention. According to a National Retail Federation report, holiday sales will grow between 8.5% -10.5% year-over-year this month and next month. U.S. retail sales were up 0.7% in September.
Supply-chain issues continue to impact the consumer sector in terms of the production and delivery of goods. Rising inflation is also a concern, but improving labor market prospects have been easing those worries. In addition, consumer spending increased 0.6% in September, and The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index rose to 113.8 in October from 109.8 in September.
So, if one has $5,000 lying about, we think one should consider betting on fundamentally sound consumer stocks Unilever PLC (UL), Ennis, Inc. (EBF), and Natural Grocers by Vitamin Cottage, Inc. (NGVC). They are each expected to generate significant returns this year and beyond.

Germany is Amazon's biggest market after the United States, and Verdi, a leading services sector union, has been organising strikes on and off at Amazon sites in the country since 2013 to protest low pay and poor conditions.
Verdi said it had called the latest strike to demand a rise in pay in line with agreements the union has reached with the broader retail and mail-order industries in Germany.
The union said workers at three Amazon warehouses in the states of Saxony and Hesse would go out on strike on Monday, coinciding with All Saints' Day, which is a public holiday in some German states. 
It would not say how many workers joined the strike on Monday.
Workers at four more locations will go on strike starting in the early hours of Tuesday, and the strikes would last from between 24 hours to up to three days, Verdi said.
""It is unacceptable that a multinational corporation worth billions and (which) makes money hand over fist still refuses to give employees the wage increases that other companies in the industry pay,"" Verdi representative Orhan Akman said in a statement.
Verdi said it wants Amazon to recognise the collective agreements in the retail and mail order industry, and to reach an agreement over fair working conditions with Amazon.
Amazon said in a statement that it offers excellent pay, benefits and career opportunities.
The company said it was not seeing any impact on its clients as a result of the strike. 
Earlier this year, Amazon said it would guarantee an entry-level wage at its German warehouses of 12 euros ($13.9) an hour from July, which will rise to at least 12.50 euros per hour from autumn 2022.

Amazon's wages exceed Germany's current minimum wage of 9.60 euros per hour. Germany's minimum wage, however, is set rise to 12 euros if an agreement is reached by the next coalition government of the centre-left Social Democrats, the Greens and the liberal Free Democrats.

279,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2021 12:26PM ET</span>","Emirates strips its first ever A380 for furniture, memorabilia","DUBAI (Reuters) - Dubai's Emirates, which championed the Airbus A380 as the backbone of a global airline network built around the Gulf, has begun stripping one of the four-engined behemoths for the first time as the superjumbo gives way to smaller and leaner models.
The announcement on Monday comes just weeks before Emirates is due to take delivery of its last A380 from Airbus, bringing to an end an era in which the double-decker passenger jet dominated the airline's growth plans.
The airline has salvaged engines, landing gears and flight control components from the 13-year-old jet that flew its first commercial flight from Dubai to New York in August 2008, it said in a statement.
The A380 would now be stripped of parts to be transformed into furniture, memorabilia and other retail items to be sold and with a portion of proceeds to benefit the airline's charity that helps disadvantaged children.
""It’s an elegant and fitting retirement solution for this iconic aircraft and our flagship,"" Emirates President Tim Clark said.
With no major secondary market, Emirates was left with little choice but to strip the world's largest commercial passenger jet for parts that could be repurposed. 
Airbus ended production of the plane in 2019, 12 years after it started and after it was unable to secure a sustainable order book. Emirates was the largest customer of the A380 jet, having ordered 118 superjumbos, but its inability to reach a deal with engine makers on future orders spelled the end of the aircraft. 
The jet's decline also came before the COVID-19 pandemic that drove the airline industry into its worst ever crisis. Most airline executives expect it will take the industry several years to recover to pre-pandemic demand for air travel.
The aircraft had proved popular with passengers, which Emirates long argued is a key attraction for its customers while also helping it carry more passengers between slot-constrained airports than any other commercial jet.

Emirates has said it will still play a key role in its all-wide-body fleet with plans to enhance its remaining A380s. Its new A380s will feature a new premium economy product.
""Emirates will continue to be the largest operator of this spacious and modern aircraft for the next two decades,"" Clark said in a Sept. 1 statement.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Starlink, the satellite internet division of billionaire Elon Musk's rocket company SpaceX, registered its business in India on Monday, company documents filed with the government showed, as it gears up to launch internet services in the country.
Having a local unit, Starlink Satellite Communications Private Limited, will allow the company to apply for licenses which it needs from the government before it can provide broadband and other satellite-based communication services. 
""Pleased to share that SpaceX now has a 100% owned subsidiary in India,"" country director for Starlink in India, Sanjay Bhargava, said in a LinkedIn post. 
""We can now start applying for licenses, open bank accounts, etc,"" said Bhargava, who according to his LinkedIn profile joined the company only in October. 
Starlink is one of a growing number of companies launching small satellites as part of a low-Earth orbiting network to provide low-latency broadband internet services around the world, with a particular focus on remote areas that terrestrial internet infrastructure struggles to reach.
Its competitors include Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Kuiper and OneWeb which is co-owned by the British government and India's Bharti Enterprises. 
In India, Starlink plans to ""carry on the business of telecommunication services"" including satellite broadband internet services, content storage and streaming, multi-media communication, among others, according to the company filing.
It will also deal in devices such as satellite phones, network equipment, wired and wireless communication devices, as well as data transmission and reception equipment, it said. 
Starlink separately said it will focus on ""catalyzing rural development"" in India through its broadband services, according to a company presentation shared by Bhargava on LinkedIn over the weekend.

Once it is allowed to provide services, Starlink will, in the first phase, give 100 devices for free to schools in Delhi and nearby rural districts. It will then target 12 rural districts across India.
The company aims to have 200,000 Starlink devices in India by December 2022, 80% of which will be in rural districts, it said in the presentation. Starlink has already received over 5,000 pre-orders for its devices in India.

The Danish company lifted its full-year outlook, citing strong U.S. sales, but its share price dropped 4.8% in early trade as it also said sales at Pandora stores grew just 5% in the third quarter, while analysts had expected 14% growth. 
Pandora's shares had surged 40% this year as the company had seen sales top pre-pandemic levels since shops reopened after lockdowns.
""The sell-out growth is kind of disappointing in Q3,"" said Sydbank analyst Per Fogh.
Still, the company said it had continued to see strong sales in the United States, its biggest market, in the third quarter as massive government stimulus and vaccinations against COVID-19 fuelled spending on goods and services.
For 2021, Pandora now expects organic sales growth of 18-20%, up from a previous forecast of 16-18%, and an earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margin of 24-24.5%, up from a previously forecast 23-24%. However, that was below an average forecast of 24.6% from analysts compiled last month.
""COVID-19 and the unusually high level of U.S. growth continue to create increased uncertainty around the guidance,"" it added.
Pandora, best known for its silver charm bracelets, said third-quarter sales came in at 4.73 billion Danish crowns ($734.92 million), beating the 4.67 billion expected by analysts in a poll compiled by the company. 
It reported quarterly EBIT of 957 million crowns, which was above the 917 million expected by analysts, and resulted in an EBIT margin of 20.2%.

""Revenue growth and the EBIT margin were lifted by continued strong U.S. performance and a sequential improvement in Europe as COVID-19 restrictions were eased,"" Pandora said. 
The firm will report full third-quarter earnings on Nov. 3.

284,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2021 12:06PM ET</span>",Ryanair slams 'delusionary' Boeing in 737 jet price row,"By Conor Humphries and Tim Hepher
DUBLIN (Reuters) -The boss of Ireland's Ryanair on Monday ramped up a war of words with Boeing (NYSE:BA), calling the U.S. planemaker ""delusionary"" for imposing what he termed a double-digit percentage price hike for 737 MAX 10 jets in talks this year. 
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary also said Boeing needed to ""get its shit together"" after what he described as delays in the delivery of 65 jets from an existing MAX order, though he was ""reasonably confident"" they would arrive for the summer peak.
A Boeing spokesperson said it was committed to supporting Ryanair as a long-standing partner, but added it would ""continue to be disciplined"" in commercial decisions. 
Industry sources blamed the delays on shipping problems for galleys linked to a worldwide logistics logjam.
Europe's largest low-cost carrier in September abruptly ended talks with the U.S. planemaker over an order of 737 MAX 10 jets worth tens of billions of dollars because of differences over price.
Speaking on Monday following the airline's latest financial results, O'Leary said Boeing's approach was ""delusionary"". 
""Boeing out of the blue sought a ... substantial double-digit price increase. I don't understand the strategy,"" he said, before reiterating that Boeing badly needs Ryanair's business. In a call with investors, O'Leary said he was having a ""marital tantrum"" with Boeing, Ryanair's long-time sole supplier. 
O'Leary in September said Ryanair had been in talks to order at least 100 of the 230-seat MAX 10.
Sources say the dispute over MAX 10 was already rumbling when Ryanair ordered 75 more of the smaller MAX 8-200 version in December last year. Two industry sources said Ryanair had rejected previous lower offers on the MAX 10 since that date. 
Asked on an investor call whether the price increase was compared to an earlier offer or compared to prices paid in the past, O'Leary declined to comment.
NEW ABNORMAL
Insiders say brinkmanship and flared tempers are more common in the cut-throat aerospace industry than executives care to admit, in contrast with the polished 'win-win' arguments favoured whenever such hard-fought deals are announced publicly.
Ryanair and Boeing have often clashed behind the scenes as Europe's pioneering low-cost carrier insisted on the lowest possible prices, echoing fraught negotiations between Airbus and some of its key low-cost customers. But it is unusual for the knockabout to become public. The spat partly reflects two sources of abnormal volatility stemming from overlapping crises, industry sources say. First is uncertainty over the shape of the recovery, with Ryanair and Boeing appearing to bet on different paths. While O'Leary has said Boeing is ignoring reality about prices, he has also said demand is likely to snap back quickly. Second is the uncertainty that swirled around valuations for the MAX - once Boeing's most reliable cash and profit benchmark - in the wake of a two-year safety crisis. The MAX 10 has struggled to keep up with runaway sales of the Airbus A320neo and the industry began the year uncertain how much the market would pay for it. But a deal for United Airlines to order 200 MAX 10 in June encouraged Boeing to set the bar higher, driving up the offer for Ryanair, market sources said.
Consultancy Ascend by Cirium said in September MAX values had increased ""very slightly"" as inventory declines.

With hundreds of MAX yet to be delivered after the grounding and COVID-19 crisis, sources say Ryanair believes prices should be set lower than previous MAX 10 offers, but the planemaker has drawn a line on the grounds that it would be uneconomic to produce and industry sources say the talks remain deadlocked.
Boeing declined comment on confidential talks. A Ryanair spokesman said it had nothing to add to O'Leary's comments.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Biden administration said on Monday that a planned rule requiring private-sector employers with 100 or more employees to mandate COVID-19 vaccines or regular testing will be published in the coming days.
The Labor Department said the White House Office of Management and Budget had completed its regulatory review of the rule known as an emergency temporary standard (ETS). The White House said in September the rule would cover more than 80 million private-sector employees.
When the administration will mandate compliance with the new rules is not yet known. Many industries have called for the mandates to be delayed until after the holiday season.
The ETS process was last used in June to institute healthcare workplace rules to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Before that, The Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) last ETS was 38 years ago https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/biden-vaccine-mandate-will-test-us-workplace-regulator-2021-09-13/#:~:text=With%20more%20than%2080%20million%20workers%20covered%2C%20%22OSHA,the%20new%20requirements%2C%20the%20White%20House%20said%20Friday and the government has had a mixed record of success using the fast-track procedure.
The ETS has only been used 10 times in OSHA's 50-year history. Courts have invalidated or halted four of those rules and partially blocked one, according to the Congressional Research Service.
Separately, the White House issued new guidance https://www.saferfederalworkforce.gov/faq/contractors on Monday to federal contractors after it said last week https://www.reuters.com/world/us/white-house-signals-flexibility-over-dec-8-vaccine-deadline-businesses-2021-10-27 it was giving them new ""flexibility"" to meet a Dec. 8 deadline for employees to be vaccinated.
White House COVID-19 coordinator Jeff Zients said he does not expect any disruptions to the U.S. economy or holiday travel as a result of the mandate.
""We’re creating flexibility within the system. There is not a cliff here,"" Zients said last week.
The mandate covers millions of federal contractor employees and companies including Boeing (NYSE:BA), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL),  Union Pacific  (NYSE:UNP) and  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) have said they will comply with the contractor mandate.
The new guidance said contractors ""should determine the appropriate means of enforcement"" for employees refusing vaccination who do not have a pending request for accommodation, such as a religious or medical exemption.
The White House said contractors can follow the federal model to address unvaccinated employees that ""encourages compliance, including through a limited period of counseling and education, followed by additional disciplinary measures if necessary. Removal occurs only after continued noncompliance.""
Companies can also use ""its usual processes for enforcement of workplace policies,"" it said

The White House said separately that federal employees ""should not be placed on administrative leave while the agency is pursuing an adverse action for refusal to be vaccinated.""
Federal contractor employees not complying must follow workplace safety protocols for unvaccinated people. Federal agencies can deny entry to unvaccinated contractors to federal workplaces.

Investing.com – Intel stock (NASDAQ:INTC) rose 1% on Monday as Northland Capital upgraded it to market perform from underperform earlier.
Analyst Gus Richard has a $49 target for the stock against $42 earlier, according to reports. The stock touched a high of $49.59 so far during the session underway today.
According to Richard, the world “desperately” wants a second source to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), and Intel is a contender due to a lack of alternatives.
Holding the company back is the lack of evolution over the last 15 years, the analyst wrote in his note. Even as the analyst doesn’t have high hopes from Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger’s plans, the chances are not zero either, the reports said quoting him.
Intel is investing $20 billion in setting up two new chip plants in Arizona and aims to become a major provider of foundry capacity in the U.S. and Europe to serve customers globally. The chip giant has joined  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) to work on creating next-generation logic and packaging technologies.
From dominating the chip industry over several decades, Intel failed to capture the emerging opportunities in mobiles and Cloud. It’s now looking to capture some of that share."

Investor sentiment has been further bolstered by the expected passage of infrastructure bills in Congress soon. These factors, along with the continuing low-interest-rate environment, we think make the backdrop favorable for mid-cap stocks. Therefore, fundamentally sound mid-cap stocks of Compañía Cervecerías Unidas (CCU), Piper Sandler (PIPR), and  Newmark Group  (NASDAQ:NMRK) could be solid bets now. Read on.October proved to be the best month for investors in some time. The S&P 500 rose 6.9% for the month, registering its best gain since November last year, owing to impressive third-quarter earnings reports from several companies. The expected passage of a $1.75 trillion human infrastructure bill soon, along with the anticipated passage of a $1 trillion traditional infrastructure spending bill, has contributed to the bullish market sentiment.
Mid-cap stocks tend to perform well when the economy exhibits growth potential, interest rates are low, and the stock market shows bullish tendencies. Investors’ interest in mid-cap stocks is evident in the SPDR S&P MIDCAP 400 ETF Trust’s (MDY) 47% returns over the past year versus the broader SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust’s (SPY) 40.6% gains.

292,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2021 11:11AM ET</span>","PG&E gets subpoena over Dixie fire, expects to take $1.15 billion loss","(Reuters) - PG&E (NYSE:PCG) Corp said on Monday it had received a subpoena from the U.S. attorney's office seeking documents from the Californian utility related to the Dixie Fire, and expects to take a loss of $1.15 billion from the blaze this year.
The company, in a regulatory filing, said it received the subpoena on Oct.7. 
The so-called Dixie, ranked as the second-largest California wildfire on record, scorched through Northern California communities and forests in early August, forcing thousands to flee from their homes and prompted precautionary power shutdowns.
The cause of the Dixie fire remains under investigation. PG&E had said the blaze may have started when a tree fell onto one of the utility's power cables. 
The company emerged from bankruptcy last year. It had sought protection from creditors after wildfires sparked by its equipment in 2017 and 2018 drove the utility's potential liabilities into tens of billions of dollars.
On Monday, the San Francisco-based PG&E posted a loss of $1.091 billion, or 50 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, compared to profit of $83 million, or 4 cents per share, a year earlier.

The company had said in July it would bury 10,000 miles of power lines in high-risk fire zones as a safety measure after its equipment caused multiple destructive wildfires over several years.
Shares of PG&E were down as much as 2.97% at $11.255 in morning trading.

Bank of America is expected to seek regulatory approval early next year, the report added, and is also planning to submit applications for licenses that will allow it to trade and underwrite stocks and bonds, among other things. 
The lender's latest move comes a year after China approved rules allowing global banks to operate fully-controlled businesses in the country. 
In August, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) got the green light from Beijing to become the first foreign owner of a brokerage in China, while in October Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) received approval from Chinese regulators to take full control of its mainland securities business. 
Western banks have increasingly moved towards China's expanding capital markets, driven by lucrative underwriting fees on equity and bond transactions. Full ownership of business units will allow banks to expand their operations in the multi-trillion-dollar Chinese financial sector.

The biotech company said the FDA informed it Friday evening it needed more time to evaluate recent international analyses of the risk of a type of heart inflammation called myocarditis after vaccination, a rare side effect that has mostly affected young men following the second dose.

Investing.com – Harley-Davidson stock (NYSE:HOG) climbed more than 8% Monday as the company is seen as a beneficiary of the tariff deal reached two days ago between the U.S. and EU.
The deal is expected to ease supply-chain pressures and high prices of steel, metals and other raw materials.
The company called it “an important course correction in U.S.-EU trade relations”.
The new deal maintains the tariffs but would allow limited amounts of European imports to enter the U.S. without attracting any tariff. In return, the EU would drop retaliatory tariffs.
The maker of iconic motorcycles was among the U.S. companies whose products were hit with retaliatory tariffs by the EU after the Trump administration slapped levies on steel and aluminum imports.
The then administration imposed a 25% tariff on European steel and 10% on aluminum in 2018. The EU countered with tariffs on up to $7.8 billion of U.S. exports.

Hence, we believe fundamentally weak meme stocks Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD), GameStop (GME), and IronNet (IRNT) are best avoided now. Read on.Meme stocks emerged as a pandemic-induced diversion from traditional investing practices, with the zealous involvement of millennials as retail traders. Several social media forums helped retail traders bet against hedge funds, causing a short squeeze in some fundamentally weak stocks. However, with most meme stocks failing to maintain the price levels they achieved, the meme craze is gradually fading. Another reason for the declining interest in meme stocks is the revival of cryptocurrencies. Retail traders’ attention is shifting toward potentially lucrative opportunities offered by cryptocurrencies. So, while there are still new meme names on social media forums, the most popular candidates in this space are losing focus.
According to the alternative data provider Quiver Quantitative, the average number of daily comments on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum last month was only half of its last year’s value. Furthermore, the number of active users and funded accounts on a few financial platforms that allow investors to invest in stocks saw a dip in the third quarter.

The company’s stock price is often considered a proxy for global growth.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Sega Sammy Holdings on Monday said it is exploring a strategic alliance with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to develop big budget titles using the Xbox maker's cloud gaming tech, driving anticipation the move could signal a deeper tie-up. 
Tokyo-based Sega is exploring making titles with global reach on Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, it said in a stock exchange statement without providing further details, including whether a deal would involve exclusivity for the titles or capital investment. 
Sega shares jumped 6% in morning trading. 
Microsoft's own major cloud gaming initiative is available via the Xbox Game Pass, a cross-platform subscription service which features Sega titles such as the hit ""Yakuza"" series. 
Cloud gaming cuts ties to bulky hardware but requires a fast internet connection. Deep pocketed Microsoft's push into the nascent sector comes as Xbox is widely seen as being on the backfoot in the console battle with  Sony  (NYSE:SONY)'s PlayStation. 
""By working with Microsoft to anticipate such trends as they accelerate further in future, the goal is to optimise development processes and continue to bring high-quality experiences to players using Azure cloud technologies,"" Sega said. 
A bid for ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" publisher Sega by Microsoft has been rumoured for decades. Japan, the world's third largest gaming market and a major innovator in the industry, remains a weak spot for the Redmond, Washington-based firm. 

The two firms have a long history of partnership with Monday's announcement coming after a string of critically acclaimed recent releases from Sega including in the ""Persona"" and ""Total War"" series.
Sega, which abandoned its own console business after a string of flops, is a prolific maker of ""pachinko"" machines for gambling and has flagged its ambitions to widen the appeal of its video games.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair on Monday reported its first quarterly profit since before COVID-19, but downgraded its annual forecast to a loss as it prepared to slash winter prices to build momentum for what it believes will be a bumper summer next year. 
Europe's largest budget airline, which flew more passengers this summer than any European rival, made a profit of 225 million euros ($260 million) for the three months to the end of September, marking its first quarterly profit since the final three months of 2019. 
But the Dublin-based airline said it expected a loss of between 100 million and 200 million euros for the financial year that ends on March 31, a downgrade from its July forecast of ""somewhere between a small loss and breakeven"", citing fare discounting and higher fuel costs. 
""There is no doubt that the remainder of the fiscal year will be challenging, the winter will be tough"" Group Chief Executive Michael O'Leary told investors. 
But keeping prices low and passenger numbers high over the winter will ""set us up strongly for a very strong recovery"" in the summer of 2022 when ticket prices should return to pre-COVID levels ""if not better"", O'Leary said. 
Flights for next summer are booking at prices around 5% higher than 2019, he said.
That should help lift the airline to an annual profit in its next financial year, which ends in March 2023, he said.
OPPORTUNITIES
The contraction of European short-haul capacity by up to 20% from pre-COVID levels next year and around 10% the following year will allow for ""dramatic market share gains,"" he added. 
Ryanair carried 39.1 million passengers in the six months ended September, more than double the number in the period last year but 54% fewer than the same months in 2019. 
O'Leary said Ryanair hoped to fly 103-104 million passengers in the year to March, compared to 149 million in the year before the pandemic. 
Ryanair will then fly a record 165 million passengers next year and will likely beat a 2026 target of 225 million passengers a year, O'Leary said. 
Ryanair's after-tax loss of 48 million euros for the six months to September, which included a 273 million loss in the first quarter, was slightly worse than the 43 million euros forecast in a company poll of analysts.
Its shares briefly dropped more than 4% to 16.2 euros in early trade. They peaked at 17.28 euros during a bullish investor call before settling back to 16.95 at 1352 GMT, flat on the day. 
Ryanair announced on Monday that it was looking at delisting from the London Stock Exchange in coming months due to a fall in trading volumes there after Brexit forced it to impose restrictions on British-owned shares.
O'Leary also ramped up a war of words with his main aircraft supplier Boeing (NYSE:BA), saying the planemaker was ""delusionary"" for imposing a double-digit percentage price increase for 737 MAX 10 planes, which he said had led to the collapse of talks earlier this year.
He said he did not think Boeing would meet a target of delivering 65 of an existing order of 737 MAX200 jets by April, but was ""reasonably confident"" they would arrive in time for next year's summer peak. 

A Boeing spokesperson said it valued Ryanair's business but that it would continue to be disciplined and make decisions that made sense for the company.

302,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2021 10:26AM ET</span>",Factbox-Five things to know about Barclays' new CEO Venkat,"LONDON (Reuters) -  Barclays  (LON:BARC)' Chief Executive Jes Staley unexpectedly left the bank on Monday due to a dispute with British financial regulators over how he described his ties with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. 
He will be replaced by C.S. Venkatakrishnan, widely known as Venkat, who was previously Head of Global Markets. 
Here are five facts about Venkat. 
ANOTHER JPMORGAN ALUM
Venkat is one of a cadre of Barclays senior executives poached from rival JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) along with Staley. They include Global Head of Investment Banking Paul Compton, who was also Staley's right-hand man in the reorganisation and streamlining of Barclays' various group entities in recent years.
Others include Tushar Morzaria, who was Chief Financial Officer of the U.S. lender's investment bank before taking up the CFO role at Barclays under Staley, and Ashok Vaswani who worked at a JPMorgan-funded private equity firm and now heads Barclays' consumer banking division.
BEHIND-THE-SCENES SUCCESSION PLAN
Although Staley's departure is sudden, the British lender says it has had succession planning ""in hand for some time"". The bank said in its stock exchange announcement on Monday that it had reviewed potential external candidates for the top role but identified Venkat as its preferred candidate over a year ago. 
Barclays shook up its top ranks in September 2020, promoting Venkat from group chief risk officer to head up global markets to give him a run at leading the lender's critical investment banking unit.
SAFE PAIR OF HANDS
Barclays will be hoping Venkat's experience as group chief risk officer - from 2016 to 2020 - will make him a safe pair of hands after Staley's controversial tenure. 
While in a senior risk job at JPMorgan, he flagged the potential for massive losses from a derivatives trade - a scandal later known as the ""London Whale"" that led to a $6.2 billion loss. 
A U.S. Senate investigation found some losses could have been averted if JPMorgan had listened to Venkat's warning, Bloomberg reported this month, adding Venkat was known for his unflappability and fondness for emojis even in a crisis. 
Venkat has a bachelor's degree, a master's and a PhD from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
BIG MONEY
Venkat will be on a higher base salary than his predecessor, amid a red hot recruitment market as banks largely put COVID-19 costs behind them. Venkat will receive 2.7 million pounds ($3.69 million) in fixed pay – half in cash and half in shares. Although that tops Staley's 2.4 million pounds a year, it's still a cut from Venkat's - undisclosed - fixed pay as head of global markets, Barclays' board said. 
Venkat will also be eligible for a bonus up to a maximum of 93% of his fixed pay and long term incentives up to 140% of fixed pay per year, as well as a cash payment in lieu of pension of 135,000 pounds a year. 
Staley's overall pay package came to 4 million pounds last year.
PROTEGE
Venkat is likely to pursue the same strategy as Staley at least in the near term, according to an internal memo to staff seen by Reuters on Monday.
""Jes has been my manager, mentor and friend for many years,"" he wrote.

""The strategy we have in place is the right one, and we will continue our existing plans to transform our organisation and build on our financial prowess.""

By Arriana McLymore and Lisa Baertlein
NEW YORK, NY (Reuters) - Shoppers hoping to nab holiday gifts online this year may need to prepare well in advance for their purchases. Numerous retailers are setting earlier deadlines for merchandise ordered online to reach customers’ homes before Christmas. 
Frères Branchiaux Candle Co co-founder Celena Gill designated Nov. 30 as the last day for customers to place their orders if they want scented soy candles to arrive before Christmas. “We have already seen a delay in shipping this month and we anticipate that it will be worse as we near Christmas day,” Gill said. She declined to comment on last year's deadline.
State Bags, a New York-based luggage company, is cutting off Christmas shipping three days earlier than last year’s deadline of Dec. 18. It will not offer its annual two-day holiday shipping promotion this year due to supply chain issues, co-founder Jacqueline Tatelman said. 
FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and United States Postal Service set ground shipping deadlines for Dec. 15, identical with last year’s delivery cutoffs - even though there is one day more between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year. UPS is providing delivery deadline estimates on its website based on timing, location and shipping services. 
By some estimates, there may be nearly 5 million more packages per day than delivery drivers can handle during the peak season when unit volumes can double. And, FedEx has already signaled trouble for its ground unit, which handled more than 9.3 million packages a day for customers including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) last quarter. In September, the Memphis-based company warned that employee hiring and retention problems were slowing deliveries. 
UPS, the world’s biggest parcel delivery firm, is dropping low-profit customers – a move that could hit vulnerable retailers. On the other hand, UPS will make nationwide deliveries on Saturdays this year and is taking several other steps to minimize “chaos costs” and improve on-time service, UPS Chief Executive Carol Tome said. 
Retailers typically use delivery cutoff dates as a competitive differentiator, and during normal times, they push them out as far as possible to appeal to last-minute shoppers. But that strategy comes with extra risk this year, particularly for small shops vulnerable to bad customer reviews. And, in a year marked by hurricanes and other severe storms, there’s little wiggle room for other unforeseen disruptions due to factors such as wicked winter weather. 
But this year, retailers large and small are encouraging customers to shop early to shift demand and ease supply chain backups. Some U.S. shoppers are panicked that supply chain snarls will spread to home delivery of Christmas gifts, Tome said on a conference call with analysts on Tuesday.
“In fact, some think that 50% of holiday shopping will be completed by Cyber Monday,” said Tome. “Some of our customers are actually pulling forward promotions,” she said, referring to retailers’ earlier Christmas marketing messages that translated into a bump in demand. 
For example, UPS began working with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), its biggest customer, several months ago. Still, it will again enforce volume limits and not pick up all requested packages if unexpected volume threatens to swamp its system – a move that hit retailers like Gap, Macy’s and  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) last year. 
Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) is encouraging its merchants to update their shipping policy pages to highlight delays and lower expectations. The company is also suggesting that merchants offer earlier Black Friday-Cyber Monday sales and integrate local delivery options and curbside pickup for brick-and-mortar merchants. 
Meanwhile, Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) has improved its estimations of delivery dates to promote sales and reduce uncertainty for its community of homemade or vintage goods sellers. “Nearly every item from a U.S. seller will include an estimated delivery date this holiday season,” Etsy CEO Josh Silverman said in a blog post. 

Larger retailers including Walmart,  Target  (NYSE:TGT), Amazon, Macy’s and Best Buy have not announced their final delivery cutoff dates, but they are promoting options to reduce stress on the system. They’re offering early and extended Black Friday deals and enticing customers to use gig delivery services like DoorDash and Shipt or “buy online, pick up store” options. 
Last year, Walmart announced its delivery deadlines in mid-December, while Amazon notified customers at the end of November that eligible products were available for two-day and one-day shipping on Dec. 23 and Christmas Eve.

Investing.com — Shares of American electric vehicle manufacturer Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID) opened higher Monday after the company delivered its first dream edition vehicles over the weekend.
""No longer just a Dream. The very first members of the #LucidOwnersClub are here to take delivery of their Dream Editions,"" Lucid tweeted.








Lucid shares opened up the session at $40 and are currently priced around the $38.50 mark, up 0.5% from Friday's close.
The company hosted an owners club meeting over the weekend where members took delivery of the vehicles. 
""This is a big day. We always said until we've handed cars to customers, we haven't achieved a damn thing,"" said Lucid's CEO Peter Rawlinson.
New owners took the vehicles through the Lucid Owners Club inaugural rally to showcase the cars' performance capabilities. 
Last week, Lucid said it intends to follow the deliveries of the Air Dream edition with deliveries of its Lucid Air Grand Touring versions."

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened the week at new record highs, building on the confidence given by a third-quarter earnings season that for the most part has seen companies continue to churn out cash as the global economic recovery from the pandemic continues.
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 157 points, or 0.4%, at 35,977 points, having earlier traded above 36,000 for the first time. The Dow was outperforming the two other main indices, as the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite notched a gain of only 0.2% each.
The moves come at the start of a week likely to be dominated - both in the U.S. and further afield - by central banks. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce the phase out of its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases on Wednesday, while the central banks of Australia and the U.K. are also both expected to tighten policy at their meetings. Analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) GS said over the weekend that they now expect the Fed to start raising interest rates as early as July next year, a year earlier than they had previously expected. 
Similar shifts in expectations have driven two-year bond yields to their highest in 20 months, creating a flatter yield curve that typically signals an economic slowdown ahead. However, the continued momentum of many cyclical stocks, illustrated again on Monday by the Dow's outperformance, has once again underlined that the post-pandemic recovery is not a typical business cycle. 
""The Fed is walking a fine line,"" wrote Allianz (DE:ALVG) ALVG Global Investors chief investment officer for fixed-income Franck Dixmier in a note to clients. ""The risk of the Fed making a monetary policy mistake is growing. Lifting rates too early, when inflation would eventually prove to be temporary, would put the recovery at risk, but acting too late would ultimately see the Fed forced to raise rates more than necessary.""Cyclicals were benefiting at the expense of megacap tech names in early trading, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock and even Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock falling by over 1% each. While the first two had produced underwhelming numbers last week for the three months through September, Alphabet had soundly beaten expectations thanks to sustained growth in advertising revenue. 
Electric vehicle makers also performed strongly, with Lucid (NASDAQ:LCID) stock rising another 2.2% at the start of a week when it expects to make its first customer deliveries. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock rose 1.2%, underpinned by news of a long-term supply deal for lithium products, from Chinese supplier Gangfeng Lithium, while Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) ADRs rose 3.1% to test a nine-month high after posting a sharp rise in year-on-year deliveries in October. 
Elsewhere,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock fell 6.1% after saying at the weekend that the Food and Drug Administration needed more time to assess the suitability of its Covid-19 vaccine for adolescents. 
Elsewhere, 'meme' stocks were in focus as AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) stock rose 1.9% after the movie theater operator reported its best weekend for ticket sales since the start of the pandemic. GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock also rose 2.7%, shrugging off ominous-looking news that chief operating officer Jenna Owens had left the company after only seven months. GameStop gave no explanation for her departure. 
Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) stock surged 7.2% on the less ambiguous news that the U.S. and European Union had agreed to end their dispute over steel and aluminum import tariffs. The EU had imposed retaliatory tariffs on a handful of U.S. companies including the motorcycle maker in response to import duties on European metal."

312,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2021 09:27AM ET</span>",Epstein links catch up with Barclays chief Staley,"By Iain Withers and Lawrence White
LONDON (Reuters) - For nearly six years running British bank  Barclays  (LON:BARC), American Jes Staley built a reputation as a corporate survivor but the former JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) dealmaker could not escape his past.
During a tumultuous tenure, Staley, 64, fought off a corporate raider's attempts to break up the bank, survived a probe into his mistreatment of a whistleblower, and navigated Britain's third-biggest lender through the coronavirus pandemic.
But it was Staley's links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein starting from his time at JPMorgan that finally forced him out.
Barclays said on Monday that Staley had stepped down as chief executive following an investigation by British regulators into his characterisation of his relationship with Epstein - both to Barclays and the regulators.
Details of the findings have yet to be published but the Bank of England and the UK's Financial Conduct Authority have said previously the investigation was focused on how truthful Staley was about his ties to Epstein, who died in jail in August 2019 awaiting trial on charges related to sex trafficking.
While it was known that Epstein was Staley's client at JPMorgan, media reports have painted a picture of a potentially deeper relationship, including a trip with his wife to Epstein's Caribbean island.
Barclays said Staley intended to contest the findings of the UK investigation. It said the probe did not find that Staley either saw, or was aware of, any of Epstein's alleged crimes. 
Staley has said previously he deeply regretted his ties to Epstein, which he says began in 2000 while at JPMorgan and ended in late 2015 - before he joined Barclays in December that year.
Epstein was registered as a sex offender in 2008 after a conviction for soliciting a minor for prostitution. The New York Times reported that Staley visited Epstein in prison when he was serving his sentence.
Staley did not respond to a request for comment made through Barclays on Monday.
QUESTIONABLE JUDGMENT
Staley joined Barclays when its board rolled the dice and hired the U.S banking veteran - once tipped as a successor to JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon - to turn around its investment bank, which was badly trailing Wall Street rivals.
After years of underwhelming trading results at the division, the bank faced a big test when activist investor Edward Bramson built up a stake of more than 6% stake and pushed to split the investment bank from its retail business.
Staley stuck to his guns and fought off the attack. His strategy was vindicated when volatile markets during the COVID-19 pandemic led to a jump in investment banking profits. Bramson admitted defeat in May this year.
Barclays insiders, especially traders in its investment bank, generally revered Staley for returning some swagger as the bank took on Wall Street rivals on their home turf, following the comparatively dour tenure of his predecessor Antony Jenkins.
Staley, who says he greatly admires his former boss Dimon, sought to emulate his mentor by hiring a raft of lieutenants from JPMorgan as he bet big on investment banking at a time when British rivals were cutting back.
He worked at the U.S. bank for 34 years, climbing up the ranks to lead its private bank, asset management unit and later chair its investment bank before leaving in 2013 to join a hedge fund after being sidelined in a management reshuffle.
Staley's judgment has been questioned during his time at Barclays. Lawyers said he was lucky to survive an investigation by regulators into his attempts to unmask a whistleblower who sent letters criticising a senior employee.
Regulators found that the bank's efforts to track down the whistleblower became a transatlantic effort, with Staley's office enlisting the support of the lender's security team and an employee in the United States.

Staley was fined a combined 1.1 million pounds by regulators and Barclays but escaped more severe sanctions.
""This is not the first time Staley has faced negative headlines,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. ""Ultimately his departure shows how important governance can be, particularly for a high profile company like Barclays which faces the glare of political and regulatory pressure.""

DUBLIN (Reuters) -Ryanair is planning to delist from the London Stock Exchange in coming months due to a fall in trading volumes there, executives said on Monday, dealing another blow to London's status as a global financial center after Brexit.
The Irish airline's move comes after its British shareholders' voting rights were restricted post-Brexit and follows miner BHP saying in August it would do away with its dual-listed structure and make Sydney its main listing.
""I think we will probably delist sometime in the next six months,"" Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary told a conference call.
The LSE had no immediate comment.
Brexit had pushed EU stock ownership of the company below 50% - given the UK is no longer part of the bloc - and the ""European Commission wants us to be seen to be taking action,"" O'Leary said. 
Ryanair had said in 2020 that UK nationals, like other non-EU nationals, would from January 2021 no longer be permitted to acquire its ordinary shares - a decision taken to ensure the airline remains majority EU-owned and retains full licensing and flight rights in the bloc after Brexit.
Ryanair has a primary listing on Euronext Dublin and its American Depository Receipts (ADRs) are listed on the U.S. Nasdaq. In 2012 it downgraded its listing on the LSE from premium to standard - hitting daily turnover on the LSE with most volume already migrating to European exchanges.
Monthly trading volume in Ryanair's London-listed shares averaged 20.5 million in the 10 months to end-October, down almost 68% from the average turnover in 2020, according to Reuters calculations based on Refinitiv data.
TRADING VOLUME 
Ryanair trading volumes in Dublin have also fallen this year but to a lesser extent. In the 10 months to end-October monthly volume there averaged 35.5 million, down 44% on 2020.
Another high-profile delisting would come as listings on the LSE have fizzled and its main market has underperformed. European stocks have outperformed the British blue chip index by nearly 9 percentage points this year, according to Refinitiv data.
""Many firms may be looking at the FTSE and the sheer underperformance and the high costs involved in listing here,"" said a sales trader at a local brokerage.
Having two share trading venues, one each in the UK and EU, is considered expensive and particularly onerous for airlines, whose operating licences to fly between destinations within the bloc are reserved for operators that are majority owned and effectively controlled by EU, EEA or Swiss nationals.
""The migration away from the LSE is consistent with a general trend for trading in shares of EU corporates post Brexit,"" the airline said in a statement alongside its six-monthly results. 

Britain is pushing to keep the City of London as a global financial centre in the aftermath of Brexit, which has largely cut off the UK financial sector from clients in the bloc.
The bulk of trading in euro-denominated shares shifted overnight from London to Amsterdam after Britain fully left the EU on Dec. 31, 2020.

It said it expected the chip shortage to stabilise this quarter and gradually ease in the second half of 2022.
Carmakers globally have taken sharp output cuts this year as supply chain disruptions and booming demand for consumer electronics have led to an acute shortage of chips critical in powering electronic devices.
Czech-based Skoda's production lines came back on line on Sunday after a two-week outage caused by the chip shortage but the company said on Monday that it would still need to scale back production over the coming weeks.
""This year, the company expects that it will not be able to produce approximately 250,000 vehicles by the end of the year due to missing parts,"" it said in a statement as it reported nine-month earnings results.
The shortages started having an impact on its production in the third quarter, it said.
""The company anticipates that the situation regarding the supply of semiconductors will stabilise again from the fourth quarter 2021 onwards and will then (be) gradually easing in the second half of 2022,"" Skoda said.
 Tata Motors  (NYSE:TTM) Ltd, owner of Jaguar Land Rover, also said on Monday that it continued to be hit by the chip shortage and Skoda's parent Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) warned last week of the impact of the shortage on its business.[
Skoda's Chief Executive Thomas Schaeffer said in a newspaper interview published on Monday that Skoda expected to be producing at ""almost full capacity"" in November and December after the previous drops, if parts are available.
The company said it delivered 700,700 vehicles globally in the first nine months of this year, down 2.9% year-on-year, while deliveries outside China rose 8.5%.
Skoda reported revenue of 13.3 billion euros ($15.39 billion) for January-September, up 10.7% from a year earlier, and said operating profit nearly doubled to 900 million euros. Production was disrupted during periods last year due to coronavirus-related lockdowns.

Earlier this year the carmaker said it had tens of thousands of cars in stock that were nearly finished but were awaiting chips. Dealerships have reported months-long waits for new cars.

Goldman was one of several banks that had lent to Archegos Capital Management, the family office run by former Tiger Asia manager Bill Hwang, which defaulted on margin calls earlier this year, triggering a fire sale of stocks including those in ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) and Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Inc.

Global banks lost over $10 billion when the fund blew up, with Switzerland's  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) the hardest hit among its lenders.

318,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2021 08:53AM ET</span>",Metaverse pioneers unimpressed by Facebook rebrand,"By Elizabeth Howcroft
LONDON (Reuters) - Early adopters of the virtual worlds known as the metaverse criticised Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)'s rebranding as an attempt to capitalise on growing buzz over a concept that it did not create. 
The term metaverse has become a tech buzzword this year, with companies and investors keen to be a part of the next big thing. But users have for years been spending time in these fast-growing but obscure virtual worlds.
""They are essentially trying to build what many of us have been building for years but rebrand it as their own,"" said Ryan Kappel, an American who for more than two years has hosted meet-ups in different metaverses. 
Facebook did not immediately reply to a request for comment. 
Facebook's name change to Meta Platforms and details on its plan to build its own immersive digital world, announced on Thursday, comes as the company battles criticism from lawmakers and regulators over its market power, algorithmic decisions and policing of abuses on its services.
In virtual worlds, users can walk around as an avatar, meet friends and play games. Some that are based around blockchain also allow users to speculate on virtual real estate.
""I think Facebook has made this early name change to essentially secure the new trademark legally as soon as possible as more brands become interested,"" said a UK-based crypto investor known as Pranksy, who said he first bought virtual world real estate around early 2020.
Artur Sychov, who founded metaverse Somnium Space in 2017, said Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's announcement of the rebrand felt ""rushed... kind of like trying to insert themselves into the metaverse narrative which is happening right now.""
Sychov spends up to five hours a day in Somnium Space along with 1,000 to 2,000 other daily users. 
Dave Carr, communications lead at the organisation that runs the virtual world Decentraland, said Facebook's move might meet resistance from metaverse users who are wary of its control over content. 
""People who want to determine the future of the virtual worlds they inhabit, maintain ownership of their creative output and move freely between them will choose the decentralised version,"" he said, describing Decentraland's metaverse environment as decentralised and Facebook's plan as likely centralised.
Decentraland, founded in 2017 with about 7,000 daily users now, sees itself as an alternative to traditional social media platforms that sell user data and control the content that users see.
Many existing metaverse platforms are based on blockchain technology that makes central control impossible. Blockchain is the distributed-ledger architecture that underlies cryptocurrencies. In these virtual worlds, people use cryptocurrencies to buy land and other digital objects in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
However, the reaction from early metaverse adopters was not all negative. Some said Facebook's entry could raise interest in the concept of virtual worlds generally, attract more users and support development of multiple virtual worlds.

Tristan Littlefield, co-founder of NFT company nft42 and metaverse user since 2018, said his first reaction to Facebook's announcement was negative because he dislikes its sale of user data.
But ""having a behemoth like Facebook come in and just dump billions of dollars ... could be a positive"" because of the new people it would bring to the space, he said.

319,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2021 08:53AM ET</span>",Who's building the metaverse?,"By Elizabeth Culliford
(Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) changed its name last week to Meta Platforms Inc to signal its focus on the metaverse, which it thinks will be the successor to the mobile internet. 
The metaverse broadly refers to the idea of a shared virtual platform that people can access through different devices and where they can move through digital environments.
Well before Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's splashy demos featuring giant robots and digital time travels to ancient Rome, dozens of companies were crafting the software and hardware that could be used for this ""Ready Player One"" future. 
The concept, which could be more than a decade away from being fully realized, will take cooperation among tech giants. In June, investment firm Roundhill Investments created an exchange traded fund (ETF) to track and profit from the work of the metaverse enablers. Hours before Facebook announced its rebrand, another firm launched its own metaverse ETF.
Here are a few of companies playing a role:
ROBLOX
Video game platform Roblox Corporation, which went public this year, envisions the metaverse as a place where ""people can come together within millions of 3D experiences to learn, work, play, create and socialize."" 
Roblox aims to give users and developers ways to create digital worlds. Its CEO has also talked about future shopping and conducting business on the platform, which has its own virtual economy powered by its Robux currency. 
MICROSOFT
 Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s CEO Satya Nadella in an earnings call this year said the company was working to build an ""enterprise metaverse"" as the digital and physical worlds converge in its offerings. 
Microsoft, which owns Xbox and the world-building game Minecraft, is also a key player in the gaming world. Xbox boss Phil Spencer has talked about planning for ""a metaverse or mixed-reality construct."" 
FACEBOOK
Facebook, which will start trading as Meta Platforms on Dec 1, has said it wants to be seen as a metaverse company rather than a social media one. The tech giant, which has about 3 billion users, has been investing heavily in augmented and virtual reality and has been building out its VR environment Horizon, accessed through its Quest headsets. 
NVIDIA 
Computer chip maker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp built its Omniverse platform for connecting 3D worlds into a shared virtual universe. It says Omniverse, which is used for projects like creating simulations of real-world buildings and factories, is the ""plumbing"" on which metaverses could be built.
UNITY 
Unity Software Inc, which develops software used to design video games, is another company that could sell tools or technology used to build the metaverse.
SNAP 
Snapchat owner  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) has long been building custom avatars and augmented reality filters to overlay digital features on the real world. This year it unveiled its first true augmented reality glasses, available for developers to experiment with creating experiences for the spectacles.
AUTODESK
Cloud software firm Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) makes programs used by architects and engineers to design and create buildings and products. Its software is also used to build virtual worlds for gaming and entertainment. 
TENCENT 
Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd is the world's largest video gaming firm by revenue and has stakes in major game studios like Epic Games and Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI). The South China Morning Post reported this year that Tencent has registered many metaverse-related trademarks for its social site QQ.
EPIC GAMES
Epic is the company behind video game phenomenon Fortnite, which has moved beyond its core shooting game to social experiences like dance parties and virtual music concerts. Users pay to dress their avatars in different costumes and can build their own islands and games. Epic also owns a large gaming engine, Unreal, used to develop games and other visual effects like TV show backdrops. 
Epic CEO Tim Sweeney, a vocal critic of big platforms like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, has argued the metaverse will need to be a participatory, common space. 

AMAZON
Ecommerce giant Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), which is the world's largest cloud services vendor and has multiple media offerings, is also seen as a potential player in the metaverse.

(Reuters) - Along with the supply-chain headaches everyone is fighting - from clogged ports to empty store shelves - Ryan Gunnigle is focused on the potential for the opposite problem: gluts.
""Customers are just flinging crazy orders right now, so it's hard to determine the real level of demand,"" said the chief executive of Kids2, the Atlanta-based toy company best known as the maker of Baby Einstein and other baby-oriented brands. Business always surges around the holidays, but this year has been turned on its head by the pandemic.
A key danger in the current environment, he said, is that companies will order too many goods as they scramble to fill orders, especially in the run-up to the holidays, which could quickly lead to piles of unsold electronic baby books and high chairs once the crisis eases.
Some economists also see signs of a demand peak, easing inflationary pressures in coming months.
Nancy Lazar, head of economic research at Cornerstone Macro, said in a seminar on Friday that spending on items like furniture and computers - which exploded during the pandemic - have already cooled and that demand for many consumer goods will lessen in 2022. This drop in demand will come as supply chain blockages ease, ""both putting downward pressure on prices,"" she said.
Global producers all face similar risks. 
The natural response of retailers and other businesses reliant on distant factories - including Kids2, which produces in China - is to hike orders because they worry about running out of goods before their stocks can be replenished. That magnifies the problem as the rush creates an even stronger surge of orders at far-flung factories, a process known as the bullwhip effect. The pandemic and an energy crisis in China make the situation especially fraught.
Gunnigle said he sees signs of the supply situation easing a bit, including a slight drop in the cost of booking shipping containers and fewer ""blank sailings,"" when one of their cargo boxes misses its spot on a ship out of China. 
""We're starting to see things flow a little bit easier,"" he said.
That said, the curve balls keep coming, making it difficult to plan amid so much uncertainty. 
Consider the power shortages roiling Chinese factories in some regions of that country. Gunnigle just learned, for instance, that the Chinese factory that produces baby teethers for Kids2 has halted production until the energy problem is resolved. That producer uses a type of plastic that has soared in cost, which together with surging energy prices makes it uneconomical to produce, he said.
'PADDED' LEAD TIMES
Gunnigle is in a good position to gauge the danger of piling up too many goods. While many of his competitors have set up shop in other countries, he has doubled down on China - recently opening the first phase of a factory complex on the banks of the Yangtze river in central China at a cost of $20 million.
That factory, together with a joint-venture plant, makes half of the goods the company sells worldwide - with most of the rest coming from other Chinese factories. ""I think our response time has been a lot better than our competitors because of that,"" he said, noting that as early as May, Toys2 added up to two-and-half months to the time it expected to receive goods from China - on top of the normal average of 70 days.
""We've really padded our lead times,"" he said. ""Not just in manufacturing - but in our estimates of the time it takes to get to the port, get things on boats, time to unload the boats.""
Earlier this year, the bottleneck was in China. Having his own factory and a tight relationship with his joint-venture producer allowed him to quickly shift production toward producing things that were facing the biggest bottlenecks. The company also prioritized which goods it put into its containers, to maximize shipments of the most in-demand items. 
The problem has now shifted to the United States, focused on Southern California, where earlier this month more than 100 ships were awaiting access to the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. 

That will change yet again in coming months, said Gunnigle, who said his operations team is now focused on bottlenecks that will form in China at the end of this year and the beginning of next, ""because containers on the West Coast and East Coast are not being returned to China fast enough to replenish goods coming from China to support Q1 demand.""
All the company's early work is one reason he is keeping a close eye on the risk of oversupply. ""There's a lot of inventory in the pipeline,"" he said. ""I just want to make sure we don't get stuck with too much.""

321,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2021 08:52AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Goldman Sachs offers new way for investors to bet on SPACs - sources,"By Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) has come up with a new offering that allows investors to bet on special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), its latest attempt to capitalize on the dealmaking trend, people familiar with the matter said.
The product is structured as a two-year bond that pays interest and gives investors exposure to SPACs without owning them, the sources said. It could appeal to institutional investors who want regular income through a portfolio of many SPACs, the sources added.
One of the sources, however, said Goldman Sachs has so far only arranged a handful of these products, referred to as ""SPAC-linked structured notes.""
Goldman does not charge a management fee for the offering. The bank makes money by providing investors financing to participate in the product and by keeping some of the returns on the SPAC stocks for itself, depending on how well they perform, the sources said. 
Investors also receive a payout based on the SPAC stocks' performance at the end of the two years, the sources said. If they are willing to take on more risk to juice their returns, they can also borrow from Goldman to add leverage to the offering, but have to pay the bank back for any losses, the sources said.
Goldman Sachs declined to comment on the details of the product. 
The boom in the SPAC market, whose size has reached $137.4 billion last month from $13.6 billion two years ago, has already been a boon for Goldman Sachs' investment banking business. The bank said in April that financing SPAC deals – though a small part of its overall business – helped boost revenue and that advising SPACs on acquisitions would be a ""tailwind"" for earnings in the future.
The new SPAC product is being offered by a desk in Goldman Sachs' global markets division, which is the sales and trading arm of the bank, rather than investment banking, the sources said. 
Investors are allowed to bet on the shares of SPACs where Goldman Sachs bankers had a deal role, the sources added. SPACs sponsored by Goldman Sachs are excluded.
Investors have some protection against losses. SPAC stocks can be redeemed for their initial public offering value when shareholders vote on their mergers, and investors can provide instructions to Goldman Sachs to carry out such redemptions, according to the sources. 
'DOCTOR SELLING DONUTS'
Mike Stegemoller, a banking and finance professor at Baylor University in Waco, Texas who has studied SPACs, said that Goldman Sachs' role as both adviser and financier of SPAC deals and seller of this new product poses a conflict, even if different parts of the bank are involved.
This is because SPACs cannot complete their mergers with companies if too many investors redeem their shares, bleeding them dry on cash they need to pay for their deal. By offering redemptions of SPAC shares as a safety net for its investor clients, Goldman Sachs is relying on a practice that is a thorn in the side of some of its investment banking clients – SPACs and the companies that do deals with them.
""It's like a doctor selling donuts in the office,"" Stegemoller said.
To be sure, many investors already exercise their right to redeem their SPAC shares, and Goldman Sachs' new product will not change that. Reuters could not establish whether Goldman Sachs has informed its SPAC clients about the new product and what their reaction would be. 
Goldman declined to comment on the conflict. 

Goldman Sachs' new product has already irked some hedge fund managers who hoped they would not be competing for investors with a top Wall Street bank.
""If you're an investment bank underwriting a SPAC IPO, and advising on a business combination, it can be perceived as effectively working against clients and potential clients if you are soliciting investors to redeem SPACs,"" said Julian Klymochko, founder and CEO at Accelerate Financial Technologies Inc, which manages an exchange traded fund that invests in SPACs.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) with lithium products for three years, enabling the car-maker to lock in crucial supplies as prices for battery metals surge.
The Chinese company will provide battery grade lithium hydroxide products to the electric-vehicle maker from 2022 to 2024, according to a statement. Ganfeng didn’t give a value for the contract in the filing.
The new deal comes as Tesla enjoys booming orders that have sent its shares surging and helped founder Elon Musk extend his lead as the world’s richest person. With the adoption of electric-vehicles gaining traction globally, analysts expect key battery raw materials including lithium and cobalt to extend this year’s gains as the race for new supply heats up. 
Global lithium consumption is projected to grow fivefold by end of this decade, according to BloombergNEF. Tightening supplies are sparking a wave of dealmaking among lithium miners, with Ganfeng and other producers involved in a flurry of acquisitions in recent months.
Ganfeng signed a three-year deal with Tesla in 2018 to supply a fifth of its production to the vehicle maker. China’s largest lithium miner didn’t disclose details on sales volumes as the new agreement was announced on Monday.

Investing.com – Tesla stock (NASDAQ:TSLA) traded nearly 4% higher in Monday’s premarket as the company handed China’s Ganfeng (SZ:002460) a three-year order to supply battery-grade lithium products.
The order for Ganfeng secures supplies of a critical input for the world’s largest EV-maker at a time when supplies are short and there’s a race to tie up raw material linkages, some of them rare in the EV chain.
Ganfeng is already an established supplier of battery-grade lithium to EV producers including Tesla.
The sales amount and value of the contract are still pending Tesla's purchase orders, Ganfeng said on Monday in a filing to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.
Tesla is now focusing on starting production at two new factories - one in Austin, Texas, and another outside Berlin, by the end of the year. Those plants are the key to sustaining growth that has defied skeptics in the last 18 months: output was up 64% on the year in the third quarter at 237,823 vehicles, while deliveries were up by even more, thanks largely to its Shanghai factory. Automotive revenue jumped 58% to $12.05 billion while total revenue rose 57% to a record $13.75 billion.
Tesla stock touched a lifetime high of $1,094.94 Wednesday becoming the first automaker to boast $1 trillion in market capitalization, The stock has acquired momentum in the last week thanks to a bulk order of 100,000 vehicles from car rental firm  Hertz Global  (OTC:HTZZ), which many have seen as a landmark in the 'mainstreaming' of electric vehicles.

(Reuters) - In an indication of the opposition to the Biden administration's sweeping COVID-19 vaccine mandate, ordinary Americans are using a little-known procedure to get meetings with government officials to try to undermine the required shots for workplaces.
U.S. President Joe Biden announced in September a nationwide vaccine or testing mandate for every business with at least 100 employees, which will be implemented as a rule from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).
As the Biden administration is finalizing the rule, critics are using an obscure Washington lobbying process to meet with senior policy analysts to vent frustrations, query decisions and present what they say is evidence about the dangers of the COVID-19 vaccines. 
The meetings are normally used by well-connected groups trying to win an advantage for companies or unions. But few things are normal about the vaccine mandate, which could be published as soon as next week.
Thirty-six of 129 half-hour teleconference meetings on the vaccine rule were scheduled with individuals, according to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, or OIRA, which schedules the meetings. 
The others were with businesses such as  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) and Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co or with trade groups, which have urged delaying the rule or want employees pay for testing, according to information on the OIRA site.
By comparison, only three of 56 OIRA meetings about a similar COVID-19 rule in June were with individuals and all of 26 meetings in 2016 about regulation of silica were attended by interest groups.
The Biden administration declined to comment.
The vaccine mandate is highly unlikely to be derailed or substantially changed by individuals, even though some of them are openly trying to bog down the process. 
""Feel strongly about the OSHA vaccine mandate rule? Do something!"" read the start of a discussion on AR15.com, a firearms forum. ""If anyone wants to jam up the OSHA vaccine mandate rule, you can go to this page and request a meeting.""
The mandate has been criticized by Republican governors such as Ron DeSantis of Florida. Leaders of unions representing firefighters and police officers in New York City say more than a third of their members could be sent home on unpaid leave when enforcement of a similar COVID-19 vaccine mandate takes effect there on Monday.
LOBBYIST TERRITORY
Stuart Shapiro, a professor at Rutgers University, said meeting requests by individuals during the rule-making process are unusual. 
""It's generally the province of Washington lobbyists,"" said Shapiro, a former OIRA staff member.
One person who met with Biden officials was Clifford Knopik, a data analyst from Washington state who learned about the process on social media.
""I didn’t actually think they would give me a slot,” said Knopik, who said he discussed what he described as unreliable COVID-19 health data from Washington. 
Trade group representatives said the influx of meetings with individuals caught them by surprise.

""I've never seen anything like it,"" said Eric Conn, who met with Biden officials on behalf the Employers COVID-19 Prevention Coalition. 
He said he thought the meetings with individuals might be reducing the amount of time senior policy analysts were spending with industry and advocacy groups. ""It appears to have impacted the quality of the opportunity for stakeholder feedback,"" he said.

326,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2021 07:25AM ET</span>",China developer Yango aims to avoid defaults with bond swap backed by its chief,"By Andrew Galbraith
SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Chinese homebuilder Yango Group offered on Monday to exchange some U.S. dollar bonds for new notes personally guaranteed by its chairman as it struggles to free up cash and avoid defaulting on upcoming debt payments.
Yango's liquidity crunch comes against the backdrop of a crisis at larger rival China Evergrande Group, which has stoked concern among investors globally about the country's deeply indebted, $5 trillion property sector and tightened funding access for other developers. 
Yango is offering $25 in cash and $1,000 in new notes for each $1,000 of existing bonds exchanged, it said in a Hong Kong bourse filing. The exchange offer applies to its U.S. dollar notes due in February 2023, January 2022 and March 2022, which have an outstanding face value of $747 million.
The new bonds are personally guaranteed by Lin Tengjiao, Yango's founder and chairman, the filing said. The Hurun Global Real Estate Rich List of March 2020 had estimated Lin's personal fortune at $2.4 billion.
Yango said it is also seeking the support of investors to change the terms of its five other outstanding dollar bonds.
It said the offer was part of ""overall efforts to improve our liquidity, preserve options to stabilize our operations as a going concern, and avoid imminent payment defaults and potential holistic restructurings of our debts and business operations.""
Government policy tightening, credit events and deteriorating consumer sentiment had cut off refinancing avenues for property firms ""and put enormous pressure on our short-term liquidity,"" Yango said.
SHARES, BONDS SLUMP 
The announcement follows a report from financial information provider Redd on Friday that Yango had asked holders of its onshore asset-backed securities (ABS) to refrain from asking for repayment for a year over concerns it would struggle to pay this month.
On Monday, Redd reported that Yango had sweetened its offer with plans to pay more than 10% upfront in cash, and a second instalment in March, with the remaining principal extended to November 2022. It did not say whether investors had accepted the offer.
Yango's shares in Shenzhen slid 7.5% on Monday and are down by nearly a quarter over the past week. The CSI300 real-estate sub-index slipped 1.6% on Monday against a 0.4% drop in the blue-chip index.
In the onshore bond market, the Shenzhen Stock Exchange halted trading of Yango's April and August 2024 yuan bonds after they fell more than 30% on the day.
""There is an ABS maturing on Nov. 8, so it's a bit dangerous. The onshore market is anxious,"" said a Beijing-based portfolio manager who asked not to be named, as he was not authorised to speak with media.
Domestic rating agency Dagong Global Credit Rating Co on Monday cut its outlook on Yango to negative due to uncertainty over the source of funds for debt repayments. However, it kept the ratings of the company and its onshore bonds unchanged at ""AAA"".
Yango did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.
In international debt markets, Yango's 7.5% February 2025 dollar bond fell more than 20% to a discount of about 85% of its face value, according to Duration Finance. Other Chinese developers' bonds also slumped, weighing on an Asian high-yield bond ETF, which fell more than 1%.
Yango has eight outstanding U.S. dollar bonds worth a total $2.24 billion and 14 outstanding yuan-denominated bonds worth 13.1 billion yuan, according to Refinitiv data. Holders of the February 2023 notes, worth a total of $247 million, have the option to demand early repayment on Nov. 12.
COLLATERAL DAMAGE
Evergrande narrowly avoided a catastrophic default for the second time in a week on Friday, making a last-minute payment on an overdue dollar bond coupon just before its grace period expired. It shares ended up nearly 4% on Monday.
Evergrande's woes have brought collateral damage, with some other Chinese developers forced into formal default on their dollar bonds last month and others proposing extended payment schedules.
Xinyuan Real Estate Co avoided a default on a maturing dollar bond in October by reaching an agreement with bondholders to exchange maturing notes for new bonds and cash. 

Ronshine China Holdings on Monday became the latest Chinese homebuilder to be downgraded by a global ratings agency, as Fitch announced it had cut the company's rating to ""B"" with a negative outlook, citing uncertainties over the refinancing of ""significant"" maturing debt.
Chinese developers face maturities on bonds worth a total of $92.3 billion in the next year, according to Refinitiv data.

Investing.com – Roblox stock (NYSE:RBLX) traded 1% higher in Monday’s premarket a day after the company restored its services, ending a three-day outage.
A company statement indicated that the outage wasn't due to external malicious activity, reducing the risk that the data of its customer base - which consists largely of minors - could be compromised.
Roblox, an online platform which allows users to play and create games, began experiencing issues around Thursday afternoon.
Roblox said the outage was not due to any peak in external traffic or any particular experience, playing down speculation that a traffic surge due to a Halloween promotion event in partnership with food chain Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) was responsible.
“A core system in our infrastructure became overwhelmed, prompted by a subtle bug in our backend service communications while under heavy load,"" the company said in a statement. ""The failure was caused by the growth in the number of servers in our datacenters.”.
Roblox indicated it will compensate the game designers who make its service tick. It pledged to ""make its creator community economically whole,” if they had suffered loss as a result of the outage."

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Monday, starting the new month on a positive note as investors gear up for a week that includes a deluge of corporate earnings, a Federal Reserve meeting and the official U.S. jobs report.
At 7:10 AM ET (1110 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 180 points, or 0.5%, S&P 500 Futures traded 20 points, or 0.5%, higher, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 70 points, or 0.4%.
The three major indices all closed at record highs on Friday, with the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 5.8% in October, the broad-based S&P 500 up 6.9% and the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite 7.3% higher.
Solid earnings have been behind these strong gains, and while many of the top names have now reported, a wider swath of companies is scheduled to release numbers this week. 
Away from earnings, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) will be in the spotlight following a report in the Wall Street Journal saying that the soft drinks giant is taking full control of sport drink-maker BodyArmor. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) will also be in focus after weather and tight staffing rosters disrupted its weekend flying schedule, while gaming platform Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) was hit by a lengthy outage over the weekend.
That said, most eyes this week will be on the two-day policy meeting of the Federal Reserve, concluding on Wednesday, which is widely expected to result in the start of the tapering of its bond purchases. The gathering could also provide clues about when the central bank will increase interest rates, with the market now looking for the first hike in the summer of 2022.
The economic calendar is largely empty Monday, but the other big event for the week will be October’s official employment report on Friday, which is expected to show a sharp improvement in hiring to 413,000 payrolls following the previous month’s disappointing 194,000 release.
Crude prices gained Monday even after China, the world’s second largest consumer, announced it had released gasoline and diesel from its fuel reserves, easing concerns about the tight nature of the global supply.
This week also sees the latest meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies including Russia, a group called OPEC+. These top producers are expected to stick to their plan to add 400,000 barrels per day of supply in December when they get together on Thursday.
By 7:10 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% higher at $84.00 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.8% to $84.42. 
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,785.85/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1570.

Investing.com – ADRs of Barclays (NYSE:BCS) fell 1.7% in Monday’s premarket trading as Chief Executive Officer Jes Staley stepped down following a probe by British regulators into his ties with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
C.S. Venkatakrishnan, head of global markets, will take over as chief executive immediately, the bank said.
Epstein was arrested in the summer of 2019 and killed himself in August the same year while awaiting trial on sex trafficking offences.
In a statement to the stock exchange, Barclays said it had become aware of the joint investigation's preliminary conclusions regarding what Staley told the bank about his association with Epstein, a version of events that the bank had in turn passed on to the regulator largely unchanged.
Staley plans to contest the conclusions.
“It should be noted that the investigation makes no findings that Mr Staley saw, or was aware of, any of Mr Epstein’s alleged crimes, which was the central question underpinning Barclays’ support for Mr Staley,” Barclays said in its statement.
According to a report by the Financial Times last year, U.K. regulators began to probe Staley’s links with Epstein after JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) provided them with emails the two exchanged when he was the head of its private bank. Staley became Barclays CEO in December 2015. Other reports indicated that Staley had visited Epstein's private island earlier that year, pointing to a social relationship that lasted far past the end of their initial business relationship.

Here is a timeline of the key events leading up to the Canadian telecom and media company's court battle based on various affidavits submitted in the Supreme Court of British Columbia and public statements.
Sept. 15 - Former Rogers Chairman Edward Rogers and lead independent director John MacDonald speak on phone, where Edward says he has lost confidence in CEO Joe Natale and sees former CFO Tony Staffieri as his replacement.
Sept. 18 - Natale tells MacDonald he (the CEO) inadvertently overhears a conversation in which Staffieri is discussing a secret plan plotted by Edward to shake up the company board and senior leadership. Soon after that, Natale meets with the independent directors and asks for Staffieri to be removed. Staffieri quits the company on Sept. 29. 
Sept. 19 - Edward meets Natale and is joined by MacDonald, and in that meeting Edward tells Natale that he has lost trust and wishes to terminate the CEO.
Sept. 24 - Rogers board meets to discuss the terms of Natale's removal but a decision to find his successor is deferred. Following that, the independent directors led by MacDonald speak to Natale and obtain his consent to stay on as CEO.
Sept. 26 - Rogers board meets again to discuss a resolution including to retain Natale, and to terminate Staffieri.
Sept. 29 - Another board meeting takes place, which is not attended by Edward, where the resolution to withdraw Natale's resignation is accepted, and the decision to terminate Staffieri is made. Staffieri resigns the same day.
Oct. 21 - Rogers board meets to consider quarterly earnings. The board announces that Edward is stepping down as chair, and lead independent director MacDonald is named the new chair. Edward uses his position as chair of the family-owned Rogers Control Trust, which owns the majority of voting shares in the company, to constitute a new board, which recognizes him as chairman.
Oct. 22 - Rogers Communication issues statement and calls Edward's decision to constitute a board invalid.

Oct. 23 - Edward holds an initial meeting of the rival board and says he would petition the Supreme Court of British Columbia to validate the new board.
Oct. 26 - Edward files petition in B.C. court and in his affidavit claims that his mother, fellow board director Loretta Rogers, had supported firing Natale and had made a speech to the board asserting so in late September. Loretta Rogers disputes this, saying that Edward Rogers and board director Alan Horn had given her inaccurate information about Natale's performance as CEO.

* Edward Rogers - The only son of the late founder Ted Rogers, the 52-year-old Edward was removed as chairman of Rogers Communications on Oct. 21 after he attempted to push out CEO Joe Natale and replace him with former CFO Tony Staffieri without due process, according to an affidavit filed by Rogers Communications' new chairman. As the chairman of the family-owned Rogers Control Trust, which owns the majority of voting shares in the company, Edward wields power in the ongoing battle. He formed a rival board which nominated him as the chairman and has petitioned the court to legitimize his slate of board members.
* Loretta Rogers - The family matriarch, Loretta, 82, is a Rogers board member and backs Natale as the CEO. She is also a member of the Rogers Control Trust, along with her daughters Melinda Rogers-Hixon and Martha Rogers. In an affidavit filed with the British Columbia court, Loretta said she disagrees with Edward's portrayal of events in the lead-up to the boardroom brawl's becoming public. Loretta initiated the motion to remove Edward as chairman and claims he lied to her about Natale's performance. Edward argued in his affidavit that he wanted to remove Natale as CEO as he failed to turn around the business and he had lost confidence in his ability to lead the company through the C$20 billion ($16.1 billion) merger with Shaw Communications (NYSE:SJR). In her affidavit, Loretta said, independent directors of Rogers had criticized Edward for trying to ""insert himself as the de-facto CEO"" and jeopardizing the planned C$20 billion ($16.1 billion) takeover of Shaw Communications.
* Joe Natale - Current CEO of Rogers Communications, Natale was hired from Telus (NYSE:TU) Corp more than four years ago to improve performance. Rogers shares are down 5.6% since Natale joined, while rival BCE (NYSE:BCE) Inc is up 3.9% and Telus has jumped 27%. Natale inadvertently heard a conversation between former CFO Staffieri and another ex-Rogers executive that outlined the upcoming board and management shakeup in the company, which precipitated the crisis. Natale asked the independent directors to remove Staffieri, and he left soon. 

* John MacDonald - The current Rogers Communications chair, MacDonald has disputed Edward's claim that the company board had agreed to remove Natale. MacDonald, who was the lead independent director, has also claimed in his affidavit that the board believed Natale ""had met the requisite performance criteria and exceeded his goals.""

Investing.com – American Airlines stock (NASDAQ:AAL) traded 0.2% higher in Monday’s premarket, shrugging off concerns around the impact on the company from the latest chaotic weekend at U.S. airports.
The airline cancelled more than 1,900 flights over the weekend as wind gusts slowed arrivals at its busy Dallas-Fort Worth hub. Lack of pilots and flight attendants at the right places also aggravated the problem.
American is the third airline to have its weekend schedule badly disrupted in as many months, as bad weather conditions combine with stretched personnel and aircraft rosters.  Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE) in August and then Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) in October both had to cancel large numbers of flights due to similar issues.
The market is ignoring the short-term disruptions, however, and pinning its hopes on a broad demand revival. The U.S. loosened restrictions on international arrivals last month as the pandemic receded, suggesting that times are likely to get better for the sector.
Signs of a turnaround were visible in the airlines’ last earnings. American returned to profit in the third quarter and said it will add capacity to cater to rising demand. Third-quarter profit was $169 million compared to a loss of $2.39 billion in July-September last year. Excluding items, the company still posted a third-quarter net loss of $641 million.
The airline said it expects more than 6,000 peak-day departures in the current quarter.

Investing.com – Coca-Cola stock (NYSE:KO) traded up 0.1% in Monday’s premarket while a report in The Wall Street Journal said the company is taking full control of sport drink-maker BodyArmor.
According to the WSJ report, Coke is likely to pay $5.6 billion for the 70% stake it doesn’t own in the company. The sellers include the company’s founders and investors including some well-known names like NBA’s James Harden and MLB’s Mike Trout who helped popularize the drink.
The acquisition is Coke’s attempt to widen its portfolio of non-aerated and low-calorie drinks as consumers look for healthier alternatives. It's also a fresh attempt to crack the stranglehold of its rival  Pepsico  (NASDAQ:PEP) on the sports drink market. Pepsico's Gatorade accounts for nearly two-thirds of the U.S. market, the WSJ said, while Coke's own Powerade sports drinks have a market share of less than 15%.
BodyArmor’s products include sports drinks, alkaline water and caffeinated sports drinks. It expects to generate about $1.4 billion in retail sales this year, the report said quoting people familiar with the matter. Sales were about $250 million in 2018 when Coke first invested in the startup.
PepsiCo stock also edged 0.2% higher.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Monday on the back of generally positive third-quarter corporate earnings, but  Barclays  (LON:BARC) bucked the trend after its CEO resigned. 
At 4:10 AM ET (0910 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 1.1% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.6%.
Barclays PLC (LON:BARC) stock fell 1.2%, underperforming a strong banking sector, after the U.K. financial institution announced that chief executive Jes Staley is to step down after an investigation into his ties with the disgraced late financier Jeffrey Epstein by U.K. regulators. 
Remaining in the sector, Swiss banking giant UBS (SIX:UBSG) and French bank Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) stock both climbed over 1%, hitting 52-week highs, with investors turning to financial institutions amid talk of rising interest rates.
Elsewhere, Ryanair (LON:RYA) stock rose 0.2% after the low-cost airline reported its first quarterly profit since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, while Pandora (OTC:PANDY) stock fell over 5% after the Danish jewelry company warned about continued Covid-induced uncertainty - even as it raised its outlook for the year.
In economic news, German retail sales slumped 2.5% on the month in September, down 0.9% on the year, returning to long-term trend as consumers re-directed spending toward services.
Most eyes this week will be on the two-day policy meeting of the Federal Reserve, concluding on Wednesday, which is widely expected to result in the start of the tapering of its bond purchases. The gathering could also provide clues about when the central bank will increase interest rates.
Over the weekend, influential investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) brought forward its forecast for the first post-pandemic U.S. interest rate hike by a year, to July 2022.
These small gains in Europe come after more of a mixed session in Asia, with disappointing Chinese PMI data weighing on the positive tone. However, a decisive victory for Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's Liberal Democratic Party in a general election supported the Nikkei. 
Attention on Monday will also be on the COP26 conference in Glasgow, a U.N. conference aimed at limiting the effects of climate change, a day after the G20 big economies failed to agree on a deadline for halting net carbon emissions.
Crude prices pushed higher Monday even after China, the world’s second largest consumer, announced it had released gasoline and diesel from its fuel reserves, easing concerns about the tight nature of the global supply.
This week also sees the latest meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies including Russia, a group called OPEC+. These top producers are expected to stick to their plan to add 400,000 barrels per day of supply in December when they get together on Thursday.
By 4:10 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% higher at $83.75 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.7% to $84.28. 
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,785.45/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1571.

338,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2021 04:15AM ET</span>",Marketmind: A week of central banks,"A look at the day ahead from Sujata Rao. 
It's hard to believe that just a month or so back the first Fed rate hike was not expected until Jan 2023. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is among those to now predict a hike next July, bringing forecasts forward a whole year after the U.S. core PCE index -- the Fed's preferred inflation measure - came in at 4.4% annualised. 
A euro zone rate rise in July? Highly unlikely, even if headline inflation is at 4.1%, nonetheless it's fully priced.
All of which makes it an scintillating week for central bank watchers, with the Fed likely announcing a taper, the Bank of England an interest rate rise, Norway signalling its second rate hike of the year. The most interesting might be the Reserve Bank of Australia which could revise its guidance after last week letting its 3-year bond yield bust past the targeted 0.1%.
Bond markets are calmer this morning -- the Aussie yield is down more than 22 bps, after rising 90 bps last week.
Stock markets got off to a good start, with Japan's Nikkei rising 2.3% after an unexpectedly comfortable election victory for Prime minister Fumio Kishida. European shares are opening higher and Wall Street futures are pointing north. 
Company results are cheerful too, with analysts upping earnings expectations - among others, Ryanair reported its first quarterly profit since before COVID-19 and jewellery firm Pandora (OTC:PANDY) lifted sales and profit margin outlook for the year.
There is no shortage of growth headwinds though. After last week's below-forecast U.S. Q3 GDP, another reminder from China on Monday, with factory activity shrinking for the second month, while German retail sales dropped 0.9% year/year versus forecasts of a 1.8% rise. 
Finally an interesting nugget from BofA which points out that mentions of supply chain issues during Q3 earnings calls were up 412% year-on-year. 
(For graphic on supply chain mentions - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zdvxormoapx/supplychains.PNG) 
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Monday:
-Biden to tout 'largest investment' in climate in Glasgow
-Asian factories shake off lockdown blues, now face supply headaches
- China knocked oil prices lower with forecast it would release gasoline and diesel reserves

- Britain warned France on Monday to back down in a fish row
-International Energy Forum conference starts – 2 days

339,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2021 04:03AM ET</span>",China's property woes put prestige global projects in play,"By Marc Jones and Tommy Wilkes
LONDON (Reuters) -China's property sector woes could spell trouble for prestige mega-projects in London, New York, Sydney and other top cities as the developers behind them scramble for cash.
While China Evergrande Group's struggles have dominated the crisis, the risk to multi-trillion dollar global property markets stems from some of its rivals that have spent the last decade competing to build ever taller and grander skyscrapers.
Shanghai-based Greenland Holdings, which breaches as many of China's debt ""red lines"" as Evergrande, has just built Sydney's https://www.greenlandaustralia.com.au/en/greenland-centre tallest residential tower, has plans to do the same in London https://spirelondon.com and has billions of dollars worth of projects in Brooklyn, Los Angeles, Paris and Toronto.
The developer says it remains committed to its flagship builds including its long-delayed, 235 metre-high Spire (NYSE:SR) London tower, but it put part of another major London site on the market earlier in the year and other firms are hoisting for sale signs too.
Evergrande and Kaisa Group, which was the first Chinese property firm to default back in 2015, are both trying to sell Hong Kong buildings to drum up desperately-needed cash., while Oceanwide Holdings has just had what was supposed to be San Francisco's tallest tower seized by disgruntled creditors. 
""I suspect, as with anything, if you're running into liquidity issues you start to look to sell your investment properties,"" said Omotunde Lawal, head of emerging-markets corporate debt at asset manager Barings, which holds some Chinese property firms' bonds. 
As many Chinese firms overpaid for prime overseas sites in the scramble to secure them, the question is who will buy them, Lawal added. ""Probably they are unlikely to get cost, so I think it depends on just how desperate they get.""
SIZABLE ASSET SALES
Guangzhou R&F Properties is another major firm in focus after it required an emergency cash injection this month. It has two giant unfinished developments in London, including one with a dozen skyscrapers next to the Thames https://www.thamescity.com, as well as numerous builds in Australia, Canada and the United States. 
An R&F spokesperson in London said it remained ""fully committed"" to all its British projects. 
But with nearly $8 billion of debt to repay in the next 12 months, only $2 billion of freely available cash and sales down nearly 30% year-on-year last month, major credit rating agencies say it will need to cash in some chips. 
""R&F's capacity to handle its near-term debt maturities will hinge on the execution of sizable asset sales,"" S&P said, predicting that buildings, hotels and various stakes in projects could all be sold. Fitch meanwhile estimates R&F has 836 billion yuan ($130 billion) of assets that could potentially be sold. 
R&F, Greenland, Evergrande and Kaisa have all declined to comment further on their finances. Oceanwide said last week it was ""actively discussing"" the situation with its San Francisco project with the creditors involved.
SPENDING SPREE
Chinese developers went on a major international spending spree between 2013 and 2018, but the splurge has slowed abruptly since as Beijing has moved to curb firms' excessive debts.
After pouring more than 28 billion pounds into London projects in 2018, they have spent 1.5 billion pounds in the first half of 2021, the lowest amount since 2012, data from Real Capital Analytics shows.
Figures from estate agents Knight Frank paint a similar picture in Australia, New York and other top north American cities, where Greenland, R&F and others big firms including Country Garden, Poly Property and China Vanke also spent tens of billions of dollars a year.
Stephanie Hyde, UK chief executive of real estate firm Jones Lang LaSalle, which markets for R&F in London and another firm called Xinyuan which has just narrowly avoided default, told Reuters she wasn't aware of any Chinese firms looking to sell-up due to strains back in China.
If they did decide to sell though, they were likely to find buyers relatively quickly she added, due to the flood of international investment money current circling global property markets like London where prices are now at a record high. 
Chris Gore, a central London principal at real estate firm Avison Young, said he wasn't aware of any sudden selling plans either, but that the pressure would grow on Chinese firms if the crisis at home continued.
""If they needed to sell and could sell for a profit, then I think they would just sell,"" Gore said. ""There wouldn't be a problem if a few wanted to sell, but if they all suddenly wanted to exit at the same time, they couldn't.""

The airline has repeatedly lambasted Boeing this year over the twin-engined jumbo, which is at least three years behind its originally planned arrival.
Asked by Reuters if Emirates would hold talks with Boeing at the five day air show that starts November 14, Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum said: ""There will be a discussion...before and during the air show.""
Emirates last month warned that the uncertainty would cause significant disruption for one of the world's biggest carriers, with its President Tim Clark saying then he did not know when the first of the 126 777X jets Emirates has ordered would arrive.
Emirates is a launch customer for the 777X which it will use to replace the 777 jets that are the backbone of its all-wide-body fleet. Boeing had orginally planned to deliver the 777X in June 2020 but is now targeting late 2023.
In April, Sheikh Ahmed said that some of the 126 777X jets ordered could be swapped for smaller Boeing 787 Dreamliners. 
Emirates already revised its order for the 777X in 2019, cancelling orders for 24 of the jets as part of a deal that saw it agree to buy 30 Dreamliners.
Sheikh Ahmed, a senior member of the Dubai's ruling family, also told reporters at a Dubai news conference that he expected to see ""good deals"" for civil and military contracts announced at the air show, without disclosing details.

He declined to say if Emirates would make any announcements.
The biennial show, this year’s biggest aerospace trade show and a spectacle for business deals worth billions of dollars, will take place from Nov 14 to 18 under capacity restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Investing.com -- Jes Staley is to step down as chief executive of U.K. bank  Barclays  (LON:BARC) after an investigation into his ties with the late financier Jeffrey Epstein by U.K. regulators. 
The bank said that it had become aware of the ""preliminary conclusions"" of a probe by the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential (NYSE:PUK) Regulatory Authority into Staley's links to Epstein, and how Barclays had represented them in a statement to the regulators. 
The bank said its board is ""disappointed with this outcome.""
Staley had successfully shepherded Barclays through a difficult few years, fighting off an activist investor campaign that disputed his strategy of betting big on Barclays' investment bank. The unit delivered record profits through the early phases of the pandemic, and Barclays signaled that it will keep a strong focus on its investment bank despite the change at the top, appointing head of global markets C.S. Venkatakrishnan to take over as CEO.
However, Staley's tenure had also been marked by controversy, including a run-in with regulators over his hounding of a whistleblower, and, for the last 18 months, by his links to Epstein, who committed suicide while awaiting trial for sex crimes. The inquiry by the FCA and PRA was launched after U.S. regulators handed emails between the two men to the U.K. bodies.
Staley had known Epstein as a client when he headed JPMorgan's (NYSE:JPM) wealth management business in the early 2000s. However, he stayed in touch with Epstein long after the latter was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008. Acccording to various reports, Staley visited Epstein in Florida while he was still serving his sentence in 2009, and visited Epstein's private island as late as 2015.
The bank said that the probe, which is still continuing,  ""makes no findings that Mr Staley saw, or was aware of, any of Mr Epstein's alleged crimes."" "

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open marginally higher Monday, with investors buoyed by generally positive corporate earnings but wary at the start of a week that includes a Federal Reserve meeting that is expected to signal the start of QE tapering.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.1% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.2%.

Chairman Antonio Horta-Osorio, who joined the bank in April from Britain's Lloyds (LON:LLOY), has promised a new strategy for Switzerland's second-largest lender and a review of the bank's risk management and culture in the wake of crises that prompted a raft of executives to leave.
The review comes earlier than expected. The bank, whose share price has fallen 29% since the start of March, had said in the past it would be unveiled before the end of the year.
The investor event will be held in London and will be accessible via webcast and telephone conference.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) last month agreed to pay around $475 million to U.S. and British authorities to resolve bribery and fraud charges relating to the $2 billion Mozambican corruption scandal, while its subsidiary pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge in New York.
The settlement was the latest blow for the scandal-plagued Swiss bank and was announced the same day that Switzerland's financial regulator reprimanded it for a long-running corporate espionage saga.

The bank was already reeling from a string of scandals including heavy losses from the collapse of U.S. family office Archegos, client losses stemming from the collapse of supply chain finance company Greensill, and allegations that it snooped on former top wealth management executive Iqbal Khan.
Horta-Osorio has said the scandals are the gravest he has seen.

A company spokesperson declined to comment on the report, which cited no sources for the information, and said OMV was working on a new corporate strategy that would be presented in the first quarter of 2022.
Kurier said a task force had been working for four weeks on the project, which still needed to be coordinated with shareholders Mubadala of Abu Dhabi and Austria's state holding company OeBAG.
OMV on Friday reported better-than-expected third-quarter results thanks in part to its chemicals and materials division, centred on its 75% stake in Borealis, whose former boss Alfred Stern is now group chief executive.
Stern has said the new strategy will focus on sustainability.
Under the plan reported by Kurier, Borealis, together with three refineries and petrol stations, would remain central to new OMV as ""OMV Chemicals"".
The group's energy exploration and production operations, as well as renewable energies projects, would be spun off into a separate company that would be delisted. OMV would sell a majority stake, probably to private equity companies, the report said.
According to the newspaper, OMV could raise 6 billion to 8 billion euros ($9.25 billion) in fresh capital for the energy business to invest in petrochemicals.
Johann Pleininger, veteran head of OMV Exploration & Production, could run the energy company, it added.
OMV may buy the remaining 25% of Borealis from Mubadala for an estimated 3 billion-4 billion euros, the paper added.

Both companies in five to six years could be as big as OMV is today. Jobs would be preserved and both head offices would remain in Vienna, Kurier said.

347,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2021 02:21AM ET</span>",Strong tech support could help sell Congress on global tax rules -Yellen,"By Andrea Shalal
DUBLIN (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said she expected U.S. tech giants to broadly support the reallocation of taxing rights agreed to by nearly 140 countries as part of a broader deal on global taxes, saying the impact on U.S. companies should be minor.
Yellen told Reuters on Sunday the support of the big global players should help foster bipartisan support among U.S. lawmakers for what is known as Pillar 1 of the tax deal negotiated by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
Leaders of the world's 20 biggest economies (G20) this weekend backed the overall OECD deal, which also calls for implementation of a global minimum corporate tax of 15% by 2023.
Yellen said the minimum tax part of the deal would provide welcome certainty for large internet companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), by eliminating the complicated web of digital services taxes they face in many countries, and could help boost support for the broader deal.
U.S. lawmakers are expected to approve the global minimum tax part of the deal as part of a broad, Democratic-only spending bill winding its way through Congress, Treasury officials said.
The second component on the reallocation of taxes is still being finalized but will require separate passage.
It has already drawn criticism from Republican lawmakers and some non-digital companies, but Yellen said she believed Congress would eventually ""come around,"" especially given the support of big companies.
Senior Senate Republicans have argued that the approach agreed to in principle by the OECD would require a new international tax treaty, which would need Senate ratification by a two-thirds majority.
""I think they’re going to be telling members of Congress that they like this agreement and they can live with it,"" Yellen said of the tech companies. ""When you have businesses supportive, rather than lobbying against something, I think that will be helpful.""
Initial calculations by the Treasury Department showed little harm to U.S.-based multinational corporations, even if some of their taxed profits were allocated elsewhere since they would be eligible for other tax credits.
""We’ve done some calculations that suggest the impact is small,"" she said in an interview en route to Dublin from the G20 meetings in Rome. ""In the end, it depends on exactly where the revenue ends up coming from.""
Yellen arrived late on Sunday in Ireland, a low-tax country that overcame domestic reservations to back the global mininum tax deal - a move that will require it to raise its current rate to 15% from 12.5%.

Yellen said she was confident the Irish economy would weather the change, given its well-educated workforce and positive business environment, plus Ireland's status as the only English-speaking country in the European Union.
""There’s real economic activity that goes on in Ireland. It’s not just a tax haven,"" she said. ""I think Ireland will still be in a very favorable position.""

348,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2021 02:10AM ET</span>",China's giant state-owned companies struggle to align climate rhetoric with reality,"By David Stanway
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Ambitious pledges from China's leaders to cut emissions have put its giant, carbon-intensive state corporations under pressure to respond, but they are at risk of falling short amid confused policy signals and other constraints. 
When Chinese President Xi Jinping said last September that the world's biggest source of greenhouse gases would slash emissions to ""net zero"" by 2060, attention turned to China's state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
China has already submitted updated climate targets to the United Nations as a new round of climate change talks gets under way in Glasgow. The next challenge is working out how to implement them.
However, the struggles facing China's giant firms will make it harder for Beijing to offer stronger pledges and smooth the way for a more ambitious programme of global emissions cuts - especially as it negotiates its way through crippling power shortages. 
""State firms are busy drafting their plans and trying to set their targets, and some of them are already creating more detailed planning for the transition,"" said Ma Jun, director of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE), which tracks the environmental and climate records of big corporations in China.
""How to ensure that they can fulfil other demanding targets while in the meantime achieving climate targets needs a real solid transitioning strategy, and so far there are still major gaps,"" Ma added. 
IPE has assessed 58 listed units of Chinese state-owned enterprises from sectors such as steel, petrochemicals, electric power and aviation, covering more than 1 billion tonnes of annual emissions. 
The study found that although they are generally ahead of their private sector counterparts, some are lagging, and on indices such as energy efficiency, sectors like steel are still behind global rivals, Ma said.
Of the 58, 91% have disclosed climate and emissions data in their official reports. More than half have taken action to reduce emissions, but only 16% so far have announced targets. 
Meanwhile, just six have issued formal ""climate declarations"", including giant power generators like Huaneng, Huadian and Datang, all of which have vowed to bring emissions to a peak by 2025, earlier than the national 2030 goal.
Three others - Baowu Iron and Steel, China's biggest steelmaker - as well as the two biggest oil and gas suppliers PetroChina and Sinopec (NYSE:SHI) - have all promised to hit ""net zero"" around 2050, a decade earlier than the national target.
According to IPE data, Sinopec scores highest among Chinese SOEs when it comes to data disclosure, targets and specific actions relating to climate change, and ranks 35th globally, behind the likes of Dell and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). 
In a report published last month, IPE said the average score in the Greater China region is significantly lower than the rest of the world. 
SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES
SOEs play a big role in China's top-down political system, and Xi's pledge last year to neutralise a 10 billion-tonne annual carbon footprint prompted associations from a wide range of high-emitting industries to draw up roadmaps.
But they are also compelled to meet other ""social responsibilities"", including the guarantee of energy and raw material supplies, as well as wider goals such as employment and social stability.
Crippling power shortages in recent weeks are seen as a sign that in a crisis, Chinese firms will quickly return to fossil fuels because the system gives them no other option. 
Some critics - including policy researchers at state think tanks - say China's targets have not put enough pressure on big firms, with coal consumption only set to fall in 2026 and local authorities still allowing coal power capacity to increase. 
China's structural reliance on coal - caused in part by an inflexible power market and pricing system - also makes it difficult for enterprises to source renewable power.
Many enterprises have no choice but to buy electricity from state coal-fired power plants, with local governments seeking to protect jobs and economic interests.
""There's always been an incentive for provinces to build within the province and trade amongst themselves, when really what they should be doing is making use of the transmission lines,"" said Matt Gray, analyst with climate think tank TransitionZero. 
Though steel firms, for example, have been encouraged to switch from blast furnaces to cleaner electric arc furnace technology in order to slash pollution, they are still forced to rely on coal-fired electricity.       

Solar and wind power lost because of a lack of grid access also remains a bigger problem than regulators admit, according to a report by environmental inspectors this year.
    ""If we really want renewables to really function, we need a lot more support - the whole (electric power) system needs to be transformed,"" Ma said.

Nomura last week said its second-quarter net profit was almost wiped out by a charge of about 39 billion yen ($342 million) that it said was related to legacy transactions in the United States from before the global financial crisis in 2007 and 2008.
The loss followed a $2.9 billion hit from the collapse ofU.S. investment fund Archegos - news of which emerged in March. Nomura stock slumped more than 16% on March 29 after the firm flagged a potential loss at a U.S. subsidiary. 
Hideyasu Ban, an equity analyst at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF), said Nomura's latest quarterly earnings was below his expectations.
""We estimated that its earnings would start normalizing this quarter and its core businesses did, but 39 billion yen of reserve provisioning against the transactions before the global financial crisis was unexpected.""
Bucking the broader positive trend, Nomura traded 6.58% lower at 513.9 yen by 0451 GMT, after falling as much as 7.8% earlier in the session. 

The Nikkei share average hit a one-month high on Monday after Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's ruling party held on to a majority in a parliamentary election. 
Nomura has been underperforming the benchmark Nikkei since the beginning of the year, losing 5.96% against the Nikkei's jump of 7.74% so far.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Westpac Banking Corp on Monday disappointed investors hoping for a quick restructure at Australia's No. 3 lender, revealing big cuts in margins and still-high expenses, knocking its shares sharply lower.
Westpac reported cash earnings for 2020/21 of A$5.35 billion ($4.02 billion), just below expectations but more than twice last year's result after the release of funds set aside for pandemic losses, and announced a A$3.5 billion share buyback.
However, its shares sank more than 6% to an eight-month low as investors pointed to the fall in margins, particularly in the second half, and higher expenses, which put pressure on core earnings.
""Our underlying results are not where we want them to be, and we recognise we have more to do to become the high-performing company we aspire to be,"" Chief Executive Peter King said.
Westpac is slowly emerging from a costly turnaround https://www.reuters.com/article/australia-banks-westpac-int-idUSKBN27T0IB to fix outdated software and convoluted procedures that led last year to record fines for breaches of anti-money laundering law and market-share losses in mortgages, it's main product.
""They are on a far better footing going forward, but the market has focused on the cost of rectification rather than the benefits that flow from this,"" said Regal Funds Management portfolio manager Mark Nathan.
""I think the market expects most of the cost benefit to flow through in 2023 and 2024, rather than through the 2022 fiscal year,"" he said.
MARGIN PRESSURE
A rebound in the Australian economy and sky-rocketing house prices helped drive a 4% rise in Westpac's mortgage book after a decline last year, but the growth came at the expense of margins.
Net interest margin, a key measure of profitability that measures the difference between what banks charge for loans and what they pay, fell 10 basis points during the second half, to 1.99%. For the full year, it was 4 basis points lower at 2.04%.
In the second half, cash earnings fell at all the bank's business units, including retail and business banking, institutional banking and its New Zealand subsidiary. Core profit, excluding a pre-announced A$1.3 billion hit from Westpac's institutional bank and remediation costs, was 13% lower for the year. 
""We expect significant consensus earnings downgrades on the back of today's result,"" Macquarie banking analyst Victor German said. 
Westpac CEO King said competition was likely to put further pressure on margins.
Smaller rival Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, last week reported https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australian-lender-anz-posts-65-jump-annual-cash-profit-2021-10-27/#:~:text=SYDNEY%2C%20Oct%2028%20(Reuters),induced%20boom%20in%20home%20lending flat margins but a shrinking loan book, missing out on the pandemic-induced boom in home lending, and vowed it would prioritise re-growing its home lending business.
Westpac's King also reiterated his commitment to cutting the bank's cost base https://www.reuters.com/article/westpac-results-idUSL1N2MQ00W by over a fifth to A$8 billion by fiscal 2024, a key part of his strategy. Still, that is far from the A$11 billion in costs it reported on Monday that excluded an A$2.3 billion one-off ""notable"" charge.
Westpac said it expects demand for credit to remain high, although home price growth would likely moderate to about 8%, King said, given tighter restrictions on home lending https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-banking-watchdog-tightens-home-loan-requirements-2021-10-05.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mixed on Monday morning, with investors digesting the latest economic data from China and the outcome of an election in Japan.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.29% by 10:02 PM ET (2:02 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component fell 0.71%. The Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) for October was 50.6, slightly higher than the 50 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com.
The manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMIs, released the day before, were at 49.2 and 52.4 respectively.
China’s property sector is also in the spotlight, with at least four developers defaulting on bonds in October alone. China  Evergrande  Group (HK:3333) avoided default twice by paying overdue coupons at the last minute.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid 1.27%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 2.39% and South Korea’s KOSPI was up 0.45%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 gained 0.52%.
In Japan, shares jumped more than 1% after Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s Liberal Democratic Party preserved its outright majority in Sunday’s election. The surprise result not only prevented the worst-case scenario from unfolding but also paved the way for fiscal stimulus.
A slew of central banks will hand down their policy decisions throughout the week, starting with the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) on Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday, and the Bank of England on Thursday.
Australian sovereign bonds recovered from their collapse on Friday when the RBA decided against defending its yield target. Short-term bond yields in places such as Australia and Canada rose as bets that interest rate hikes due to inflationary pressures also increased. In the U.S., longer-maturity Treasury yields also rose.
However, fixed-income market volatility suggests that investors anticipate a slowdown in the economic recovery from COVID-19 as persistent inflation prompts central banks to begin asset tapering. Global shares currently remain close to record highs, however.
“Having been bullish on equities it feels right to turn a touch more cautious this week,” Pepperstone Financial Pty head of research Chris Weston said in a note.
“Although, the fact that equities have held up so well considering the rapid re-pricing of interest rates is certainly a positive.”
Meanwhile, the earnings season also continues. Companies including Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB),  Moderna  Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA),  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE), SoftBank Corp. (T:9434)  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp. (T:7203), and  Uber Technologies Inc . (NYSE:UBER) will release their results throughout the week."

(Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co delivered its first KC-46A aircraft to Japan, the company said on Sunday, the first delivery of the aerial refueling jet to a customer outside the United States, as growing tensions with China spur Japan to ramp up defense spending.
The Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) took delivery of the jet under a contract first signed in 2017. Boeing in a statement called the delivery a ""significant milestone"" for U.S.-Japan cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region.
The U.S. Air Force and JASDF initially awarded a contract for one KC-46A, but have since exercised options for three more of the jets. Boeing touts the aircraft as its most state-of-the-art refueling tanker, equipped with advanced sensors and capable of carrying cargo and passengers as it refuels other planes. 
Still, the KC-46 line used by the U.S. Air Force has run into performance snags, including defects with an on-board video system.
Sunday's delivery comes at a tense time for Japan, as it looks to counter China's military assertiveness in Asia.

The country's ruling party - which defied expectations by maintaining a majority in Sunday's parliamentary election - has pledged to double defense spending as public sentiment grows increasingly wary of China. 
Japan's military strategy is focused on defending territory along the edge of the East China Sea, where it is locked in a dispute with the Chinese government over a group of uninhabited islands.

The benchmark Topix gained 1.5%, boosted by makers of electronics and automobiles, while the blue-chip Nikkei 225 Stock Average climbed 1.9%. 
The ruling Liberal Democratic Party defied worst-case scenarios to secure a majority by itself. While the party lost 15 seats, the losses were less than forecasters expected. The victory allays immediate fears that Kishida, whose early polling numbers were unimpressive, might become another short-term prime minister after predecessor Yoshihide Suga lasted just a year on the job. 
“The market will react positively to the fact that the LDP didn’t lose that many seats,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, the chief market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) DS Asset Management. “Had the LDP failed to secure a majority by itself, market expectations for the longevity of the Kishida administration would have been shattered.”

Among those who lost seats was Secretary General Akira Amari, who stepped down from the senior party role following his defeat. Markets will be watching to see who Kishida chooses to replace Amari, who was not a popular pick for the role following his resignation in 2016 amid a funding scandal.

The FDA informed Moderna that the review may not be completed before January 2022, the company said in a statement, dealing a potential setback to the timing of an emergency use authorization (EUA) for that age group.
Moderna Chief Executive Stephane Bancel told Reuters last week https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/exclusive-moderna-covid-19-shot-could-start-being-used-children-teens-within-2021-10-27 that based on conversations with the agency, he believed the vaccine would be authorized for those 12 to 17 in the next few weeks.
The U.S. biotech company said it was told late on Friday that the FDA needed the additional time to evaluate recent international analyses of the risk of a type of heart inflammation called myocarditis after vaccination, a rare side effect that has primarily affected young males.
Moderna said it is conducting its own review of new external analyses on the increased myocarditis risk in those less than 18 years of age as they become available. 
Moderna applied for U.S. authorization of its shot for those aged 12 to 17 in June.

Americans of those ages are eligible for the similar COVID-19 vaccine from  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) after it was cleared by the FDA and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in May.
Moderna also said it will delay filing its request for an EUA for a half strength 50-microgram dose of the vaccine for children ages 6 to 11 while the FDA completes its review of the 12-17 filing.

(Reuters) - American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) canceled nearly 850 domestic and international flights on Sunday, citing staffing shortages and unfavorable weather, pushing total cancellations to 1,739 and counting since Friday. 
A spokeswoman for American, the world's largest airline, said the company had canceled 848 flights as of 3:00 p.m. EST (1900 GMT) Sunday, more than 16% of its total. That follows 548 trips canceled by American on Saturday, and 343 on Friday. Sunday's figure could change as the day goes on. 
In a letter to employees on Saturday, the Fort Worth, Texas-based company said severe winds at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport reduced arrival capacity by more than half. Additional inclement weather means ""our staffing begins to run tight as crew members end up out of their regular flight sequences,"" the letter said. 
Airlines have been tight on staffing due to the coronavirus pandemic that drastically reduced demand for air travel. As normal life resumes, many are ramping back up.
In Saturday's letter, American said nearly 1,800 flight attendants are returning from leave starting on Monday, while more than 600 newly hired flight attendants will be coming on board by the end of the year.
The airline had offered voluntary leave to some employees to help weather the pandemic. It also furloughed 17,500 employees, though those people are now back to work, a company spokeswoman told Reuters on Sunday.

Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Co has also said it is hiring aggressively, aiming to add 5,000 new workers by the end of 2021.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Investors are weighing whether momentum from the stock market's record-breaking rally will continue in the last two months of 2021, a traditionally strong calendar period for equities but a stretch that may carry more risks than usual this year. 
The S&P 500 has rallied 22.6% year-to-date, its best January-through-October performance since 2013, and November and December tend to be among the strongest months for stocks. 
This time around, however, the year-end period may have more than its usual share of pitfalls, as investors brace for the looming unwind of a $120 billion-per-month Federal Reserve government bond buying program that has helped stocks more than double from their March 2020 lows. Many are also keeping a wary eye on ructions in the bond market, as well as worries over looming inflation and a debate over tax legislation in Washington. 
“If the appropriate items fall into place you could continue the seasonality of a year-end rally,"" said Alan Lancz, president of investment advisory firm Alan B. Lancz & Associates in Toledo, Ohio. 
November traditionally has started a bullish period for U.S. equities. Since 1945, the S&P 500 has climbed an average of 6.8% in the November-through-April period, the highest average change for any rolling six-month span, compared with an average 1.7% gain from May through October, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.
In particular, November and December have been the S&P 500's second- and third-best months of the year since 1950, with the index rising an average of 1.7% and 1.5%, respectively, according to the Stock Trader's Almanac. The benchmark index gained 6.9% in October, helped by a better-than-expected start to the earnings season.
One major test for that run will come as the Fed begins to taper its bond buying program, a move the central bank is expected to announce at the end of its monetary policy meeting next week. While officials have telegraphed plans to begin reducing bond buying as early as November, investors will be listening for signals that the recent surge in inflation may force the central bank to taper and eventually raise interest rates faster than expected. 
The Fed's communication about its view on how sustained the recent surge in inflation will be is critical to markets, said Anu Gaggar, global investment strategist at Commonwealth Financial Network.
""So far they have maintained that this is transitory, but if we see a change in the wording around that, that could potentially spook the market a little bit,” Gaggar said.
Investors are tracking volatility in the bond market, which has come as rates for short-term U.S. government bonds soared in response to expectations that surging inflation will force the Fed and other central banks to tighten monetary policy more aggressively. While those recent moves have not weighed on stocks, surges in longer-dated Treasury yields could make equities less attractive for some investors.
In Washington, legislation to increase spending on infrastructure could boost some areas of the market, but investors are also wary of proposals that might create higher levies on corporate profits, income or investments. On Thursday, President Joe Biden was dealt a setback as the House of Representatives abandoned plans for a vote on an infrastructure bill. 
Some high-profile investors see the potential for downside. BofA Global Research this week called for a year-end target on the S&P 500 of 4,250, about 7.5% below current levels. BofA analysts pointed to extended valuations, ""near-euphoric"" sentiment and a bevy of risks to corporate profit margins, including potential tax hikes and labor inflation. 
Lancz said that given the ""phenomenal"" stock gains in October, those returns might be ""borrowing a little bit from what we might see in November and December."" 

Still, market declines have been met with swift buying in 2021. The S&P 500's biggest drop this year - a 5.2% fall from early September to early October - was recouped in just 13 trading days. 
""The market has, at every turn this year, surprised people,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago. ""Every time people leave it for dead, the buy-the-dip mentality has continued to be strong.”

362,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2021 03:45AM ET</span>","Saudi Aramco's quarterly profit surges on oil price, volumes","By Hadeel Al Sayegh and Saeed Azhar
DUBAI (Reuters) -Saudi Arabian state oil producer Aramco (SE:2222) said on Sunday its third-quarter net profit more than doubled, boosted by higher crude oil prices and volumes sold, beating analysts' forecasts.
The oil giant's best quarterly earnings since its listing in December 2019 was fuelled by the strongest quarterly average crude prices since its shares began trading.
Aramco shares were up 1% in early trade after the company disclosed its results and have risen about 9% this year to a market valuation of just over $2 trillion, a goal sought by de-facto Saudi leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman before the company's initial public offering.
Aramco's net income jumped to $30.4 billion for the quarter to Sept. 30 from $11.8 billion a year earlier, it said in a bourse filing. That was above the median net profit forecast of $28.4 billion from four analysts. 
""Our exceptional third quarter performance was a result of increased economic activity in key markets and a rebound in energy demand, as well as our unique low-cost position,"" Amin Nasser, Aramco's chief executive, said in a statement. 
Rita Guindy, an analyst at Arqaam Securities, said the sequential earnings growth is mainly driven by the upstream segment – with a 12% quarter-on-quarter improvement in crude oil volumes at 9.6 million barrels per day and a higher oil price. 
The company's free cash flow rose to $28.7 billion from $12.4 billion. It declared a dividend of $18.8 billion for the third quarter, in line with its guidance.
""There is good potential for a special dividend at the end of this year and that looks more and more likely now, in my view,"" said Yousef Husseini, analyst at EFG Hermes, noting Aramco's strong free cash flow and strong de-leveraging.
Oil prices have rallied to multi-year highs with global crude futures climbing 4.5% in the quarter, helped by the decision by OPEC+ to maintain its planned output increase rather than raising it on global supply concerns.
Brent oil futures are trading around $84.4 a barrel, up about 63% so far this year, while benchmark U.S. crude is at roughly $83.57 a barrel, up just over 70% over the same period.
Aramco's market capitalisation is just below Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s market cap of $2.46 trillion, but above Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s $1.9 trillion valuation.

Of its major rivals,  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) also posted its highest quarterly net profit since the last quarter of 2017, while Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) reported a third-quarter profit of $4.13 billion last week, below analyst forecasts, sending its share price lower. 
Aramco's capital expenditure rose 19% from a year earlier to $7.6 billion in the quarter.

HONG KONG/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian investment conglomerate Macquarie Group (OTC:MQBKY) has priced its shares at A$194 each to raise A$1.5 billion, two people with direct knowledge of the deal told Reuters.
The Sydney-based firm launched the deal on Friday to sell up to 7.9 million shares to raise A$1.5 billion as it revealed it had more than doubled its first-half profit https://www.reuters.com/article/macquarie-group-results/australias-macquarie-posts-record-profit-to-step-up-green-investments-idUSKBN2HI2XJ to A$2.04 billion. At A$194, the firm sold 7.73 million shares in the bookbuild to reach its targeted raising figure, one source said.
The sources asked not to be named as the information has not been made public.
Macquarie did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday.
Shares in Australia's largest asset manager and the world's biggest infrastructure investor are to resume trading Monday after trading was halted on the Australian Securities Exchange on Friday when the deal was launched.
Raising A$1.5 billion will take Macquarie's stack of surplus capital to almost A$10 billion, while the funds it manages have a separate $A27.9 billion in equity ""dry powder"" to deploy, chief executive Shemara Wikramanayake said on Friday.
The final price was a 1.9% discount to Macquarie's closing share price on Thursday.
Macquarie said it will also carry out a retail investor share purchase plan to raise an unspecified amount of funds.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) upgraded Macquarie's rating to a buy and increased its target price for the stock by 13% following its first half profit result, according to a note published on the weekend.
The bank also said it would raise its forecasts for Macquarie's earnings by 17% for 2022 and about 10% for the following two financial periods.

Its asset management arm said on Friday https://www.reuters.com/article/thyssengas-ma-macquarie-idAFL8N2RP6E8 it would buy Germany's second-largest gas pipeline operator, Thyssengas, from DIF and EDF (PA:EDF) Invest to use the company's grid network to transport climate-friendly gases.
Macquarie, which had owned Thyssengas between 2011 and 2016, did not specify the price. Sources close to the matter said on Friday the sales price was at the upper end or above the 1 billion-1.2 billion euros mentioned by sources in June.

The new deal on wages and employee benefits covers about 10,100 employees across 12 facilities in Iowa, Illinois and Kansas. 
""The negotiators focused on improving the areas of concern identified by our members during our last ratification process,"" said Chuck Browning, UAW Vice President and Director of the Agricultural Implement Department. 
UAW said it will not release details of the tentative agreement until members at Deere locations meet and review terms of their proposed contract.
""Out of respect for the process and our employees, we’re unable to speak to the details of the agreement,"" the company said.
About 90% of the union's members in early October rejected a previous tentative deal agreed between Deere and the UAW, and subsequently decided to go on strike.
The strike is the first against Deere by the UAW in more than three decades and comes in the middle of the U.S. corn and soybean harvest season, at a time when farmers are struggling to find parts for tractors and combines. 

The last strike against Deere by the UAW was in 1986 when workers sat out for 163 days.

366,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2021 05:50PM ET</span>",How an accidental phone answer exposed 'coup plan' at Canada's Rogers Communications,"By Sarah Berman
(Reuters) - In mid September, Rogers (NYSE:ROG) Communications Inc CEO Joe Natale called his then finance chief Tony Staffieri, who was discussing a secret plan to shake up Canada's biggest telecom company's board and senior management, including Natale.
Staffieri accidentally answered Natale's call. 
That left the line open for 21 minutes as Natale listened to Staffieri detail the big upcoming management reshuffle which ex-chairman Edward Rogers had plotted, according to an affidavit filed by Rogers Chairman John MacDonald.
MacDonald's affidavit follows an Oct. 26 submission by Edward Rogers to the Supreme Court of British Columbia as the two factions fight for control of Rogers Communications' board. A hearing is due on Monday. 
Soon after the call Natale convened a meeting with independent directors to discuss what he had overheard. He told them he had lost confidence in Staffieri and sought his termination.
Less than two weeks later, Staffieri left the company, even as Rogers was navigating its biggest ever M&A, the C$20 billion ($16.1 billion) bid for smaller rival Shaw Communications (NYSE:SJR).
Staffieri's departure did not stop Edward, the only son of the company's late founder Ted Rogers, from pursuing his plans. In the ensuing battle, the board of directors, including his mother and two sisters, voted to remove Edward as chairman and replace him with lead independent director MacDonald, who backed Natale as CEO.
The details and the timeline revealed in MacDonald and Edward's affidavit capture the turmoil gripping Rogers Communications, and the wide rift and lack of trust within the family.
Differences within company boards and wealthy families are not unusual, but such a spat playing out in the open is rare in Canada and has caught investors and analysts by surprise and attracted the attention of regulators.
It has also weighed on Rogers shares, which are down 2.9% this year, compared with 17% gains for BCE (NYSE:BCE) Inc and a 12.6% rise for Telus (NYSE:TU) Corp in the same period.
S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings said the distractions could hinder Rogers' ability to raise capital while also navigating regulatory hurdles before it can complete the Shaw deal. 
Responding to his removal as chairman, Edward used his position as chair of the family-owned Rogers Control Trust, which owns the majority of voting shares in the company, to constitute a new board, which recognized him as chairman. He then petitioned the Supreme Court of British Columbia, where the company is incorporated, to legitimize the new board.
The sequence of events outlined in court filings differ, but the common thread is Edward apparently falling out with the family's matriarch, Loretta Rogers, as well as with his sisters Melinda Rogers-Hixon and Martha Rogers.
Spokesmen for Edward Rogers and other family members declined to comment, while Rogers Communications was not available for immediate comment.
In his affidavit, Edward said Natale had failed to turnaround the business and that the board agreed to replace Natale as CEO. Loretta Rogers said her decision initially to support Edward was based on wrong and incomplete information provided by Edward, and that she changed her view on learning additional facts and continues to back Natale. 
In MacDonald's affidavit he said the board and family members had not voted to terminate Natale, and that instead they believed he had ""exceeded his goals"" as CEO.

368,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2021 02:50PM ET</span>",International opposition mounts over proposed U.S. EV tax credit,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The European Union, Germany, Canada, Japan, Mexico, France, South Korea, Italy and other countries wrote U.S. lawmakers saying a proposed U.S. electric vehicle tax credit violates international trade rules, according to a joint letter made public Saturday.
A group of 25 ambassadors to Washington wrote U.S. lawmakers and the Biden administration late Friday saying ""limiting eligibility for the credit to vehicles based on their U.S. domestic assembly and local content is inconsistent with U.S. commitments made under WTO multilateral agreements.""
The U.S. Congress is considering a new $12,500 tax credit that would include $4,500 for union-made U.S. electric vehicles and $500 for U.S.-made batteries. Only U.S. built vehicles would be eligible for the $12,500 credit after 2027, under a House proposal released this week. 
Canada and Mexico have issued separate statements in the last week opposing the plan. The U.S. State Department declined to comment Saturday and the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The proposal is backed by President Joe Biden, the United Auto Workers (UAW) union and many congressional Democrats, but opposed by major international automakers, including  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY),  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), Honda Motor Co, Hyundai Motor Co and BMW AG.
A dozen foreign automakers wrote California's two senators on Friday urging them to abandon the plan that they said would discriminate against the state.
UAW President Ray Curry said the provision will ""create and preserve tens of thousands of UAW members' jobs"" and ""would be a win for auto manufacturing workers.""
The EV tax credits would cost $15.6 billion over 10 years and disproportionately benefit Detroit's Big Three automakers - General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) and Chrysler-parent Stellantis NV - which assemble their U.S.-made vehicles in union-represented plants.
The ambassadors that also include Poland, Sweden, Spain, Austria, Netherlands, Belgium, Cyprus, Ireland, Malta, Finland, Romania and Greece said the legislation would harm international automakers.
They said it ""would violate international trade rules, disadvantage hard-working Americans employed by these automakers, and undermine the efforts of these automakers to expand the U.S. EV consumer market to achieve the (Biden) administration’s climate goals."" 
The letter added it ""puts U.S. trading partners at a disadvantage.""

Autoworkers at the foreign automakers in the countries that wrote are nearly all unionized but not in the United States.
""Our governments support workers’ right to organize. It is a fundamental right and should not be used in the framework of tax incentives, setting aside the opportunities for nearly half of America autoworkers,"" they wrote.

The exchange was set up last month in the Chinese capital, complementing two other bourses in the business hub of Shanghai and the southern city of Shenzhen.
Establishing the Beijing Stock Exchange is part of President Xi Jinping's strategic scheme to develop China's capital markets, and will support innovation and small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said on Saturday.
The rules, which were released by the CSRC following a public consultation, aim to regulate public offerings, information disclosure and corporate governance for the Beijing exchange. They will take effect on Nov. 15.
China has stepped up support for SMEs struggling in a slowing economy, while cracking down on tech giants under President Xi's vision of ""common prosperity"", a policy drive to narrow the gap between rich and poor.
Late on Friday, the CSRC published draft guidance that will require higher-quality information disclosure in companies' prospectuses under China's registration-based IPO system, on which the Beijing Stock Exchange will be based.
Shanghai's tech-heavy STAR Market and Shenzhen's start-up board ChiNext have also adopted a U.S.-style registration-based IPO mechanism, which gives the market a bigger role in evaluating and pricing IPOs.

J&J said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday that it reached a settlement in principle in September to resolve ""substantially all"" of the roughly 9,000 cases that the New Brunswick (NYSE:BC), New Jersey-based drugmaker faced over Risperdal.
The company said it reached the agreement with lawyers handling cases including a lawsuit in state court in Philadelphia by Nicholas Murray, a Maryland resident who a jury awarded an $8 billion punitive damage award in 2019 that a judge later reduced to $6.8 million.
J&J said it accrued $800 million in legal expenses in the third quarter related to the settlement.
It was unclear what other cases in the United States were part of the accord. Many of the lawsuits were also pending in Pennsylvania, and the company also faced cases in California and Missouri. 
Lawyers for plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The lawsuits generally accused J&J of failing to warn of the risk of a condition called gynecomastia associated with Risperdal, which they said the company marketed for off-label, unapproved uses with children. J&J denied the allegations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Risperdal in 1993 to treat schizophrenia and bipolar mania in adults, but it was only in 2006 that its use was approved for irritability associated with autism in children.

The company separately agreed in 2013 to pay $2.2 billion to settle U.S. criminal and civil probes into its marketing of Risperdal and two other drugs.
The U.S. Supreme Court in May rejected a bid by Johnson & Johnson to overturn a $70 million jury verdict against the company for its failure to warn about risks associated with off-label uses of Risperdal. The court turned away the J&J's appeal of a 2019 ruling by the Superior Court of Pennsylvania that upheld the verdict in favor of a Tennessee man who was prescribed the drug at age 4 in 2003.

A company spokesperson declined to comment on the report, which cited no sources for the information, and said OMV was working on a new corporate strategy that would be presented in the first quarter of 2022.
Kurier said a task force had been working for four weeks on the project, which still needed to be coordinated with shareholders Mubadala of Abu Dhabi and Austria's state holding company OeBAG.
OMV on Friday reported better-than-expected third-quarter results thanks in part to its chemicals and materials division, centred on its 75% stake in Borealis, whose former boss Alfred Stern is now group chief executive.
Stern has said the new strategy will focus on sustainability.
Under the plan reported by Kurier, Borealis, together with three refineries and petrol stations, would remain central to new OMV as ""OMV Chemicals"".
The group's energy exploration and production operations, as well as renewable energies projects, would be spun off into a separate company that would be delisted. OMV would sell a majority stake, probably to private equity companies, the report said.
According to the newspaper, OMV could raise 6 billion to 8 billion euros ($9.25 billion) in fresh capital for the energy business to invest in petrochemicals.
Johann Pleininger, veteran head of OMV Exploration & Production, could run the energy company, it added.
OMV may buy the remaining 25% of Borealis from Mubadala for an estimated 3 billion-4 billion euros, the paper added.

Both companies in five to six years could be as big as OMV is today. Jobs would be preserved and both head offices would remain in Vienna, Kurier said.

Rogers Communications, Canada's largest telecommunications company, is rocked by a family feud, sparking a bitter public battle for control of the board, just as the company is navigating its biggest-ever acquisition. The two rival factions will face off in the Supreme Court of British Columbia on Monday where the judge will decide the legitimate board.
The spat was triggered after Edward Rogers, son of late founder Ted Rogers, tried to remove Chief Executive Officer Joe Natale in late September, claiming Natale struggled to turn around the business despite more than four years as CEO.
That put Edward at odds with his mother and two sisters, who backed Natale, and resulted in his removal as chairman of Rogers. Edward Rogers retaliated by using his position as chair of the Rogers Control Trust, the family-owned entity that owns the majority of voting shares in the company, to constitute a new board, which recognized him as chairman. 
In an affidavit submitted to the Supreme Court of British Columbia, Loretta Rogers said her decision to move a motion to remove Edward Rogers followed media reports that he was trying to remove five independent directors by written resolution, contrary to Ted Rogers' wishes.
The family dispute playing out in public is a rare occurrence in Canada and has caught analysts and investors by surprise, weighed on the company stock and attracted regulator's attention.
The matriarch of the controlling family of Rogers Communications also said the independent directors had sought to create safeguards to prevent Edwards' meddling from damaging the company.

GameStop did not provide a reason for Owens' departure, which is effective immediately. The company said in a regulatory filing that it and Owens had reached a ""separation agreement,"" which is typically negotiated when companies and their executives do not see eye-to-eye. 
GameStop also used separation agreements when it parted ways with its chief financial officer Jim Bell and chief executive officer George Sherman earlier this year. They were replaced by Furlong as CEO and Mike Recupero as CFO.
Owens will be entitled to a severance package, the filing said. Her duties will be taken up by other senior GameStop managers.
The company declined to comment beyond the filing. Owens could not immediately be reached for comment.
Cohen and two other former Chewy executives joined the GameStop board in January, right before retail investors piled into the company's stock and drove it up more than 2,500%. The shares have given up some of their gains and GameStop is now valued at roughly $14 billion.
Since becoming chairman in June, Cohen has pushed aggressively to improve customers' experience but has not offered a detailed plan about how GameStop will achieve its digital transformation.. 
The Grapevine, Texas-based company's business of selling video games for consoles faces competition from streaming services such as those of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), which allow users to play video games on their TV sets without a console required.
Cohen recruited a number of executives from Amazon, including Furlong and Elliott Wilkie who joined as chief growth officer in March.
Public records and filings show the company has hired dozens of new executives with supply chain and technology backgrounds from companies including Chewy and ecommerce company Zulily.

Cohen and Furlong have also let go several senior employees in recent months who have not fit their system, the two sources said.

377,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2021 09:35PM ET</span>",Apple objects to links to outside payments ahead of Epic Games hearing,"By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Friday outlined its objections to allowing app developers to link to third-party payment options ahead of a hearing next month that could determine whether a set of antitrust court orders is put on pause.
After a lengthy trial earlier this year brought by ""Fortnite"" creator Epic Games, U.S. District Court Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers (NYSE:ROG) issued a ruling that was largely favorable to the iPhone maker and upheld its practice of requiring developers to use its in-app payment system, for which it charges commissions.
But Gonzalez Rogers expressed concern that consumers did not have access to information about other ways to pay for apps. She ordered Apple to stop its ban on ""buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms"" beyond Apple's own payment systems.
Apple has until Dec. 9 to implement the order, but the company has appealed the ruling and asked the order to be put on hold while the appeal plays out, which could take a year or more. A hearing on the request is set for Nov. 9.
Apple on Friday for the first time signaled that its strongest objections are to the requirements to allow buttons and links that provide a ""mechanism"" for outside payments. The filing provided the first suggestion that Apple objects less strongly to allowing developers to provide information about other ways to pay.
The company said that links and buttons harm its ability to require developers to use its in-app payments (IAP), which the court upheld. 

""Restrictions on linking out are inextricably tied to Apple’s requirement that developers use IAP for purchases of digital content—a requirement this Court considered in detail and upheld against Epic’s challenge,"" Apple said.
Apple posed fewer objections to in-app messages about other forms of payment, but said it may want to ""constrain their placement, format, or content"" and that the judge's orders as currently written would not allow it to do so without facing further legal challenges.

(Reuters) - Eleven U.S. states with Republican governors sued the Biden administration on Friday seeking to block a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for federal contractors, arguing it is unconstitutional and violates federal procurement law.
Saying they were necessary to fight COVID-19, President Joe Biden issued a pair of executive orders on Sept. 9 requiring all executive branch federal employees and federal contractors be vaccinated.
A joint lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District Of Missouri by 10 states, Arkansas, Alaska, Missouri, Iowa, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming. Texas filed a separate suit on the same issue, and Florida filed one on Thursday.
The lawsuits on Friday described the mandate as ""sweeping in its scope"" and ""unconstitutional and unlawful,"" citing a constitutional amendment on state powers and federal laws on government procurement. 
The mandate ""is an abuse of power and we won't stand for it,"" Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds said in a video on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). 
""It will only worsen the workforce shortage and supply chain issues that hinder our economic recovery and it furthers the unprecedented government intrusion into our lives,"" Reynolds said.
The White House set a Dec. 8 deadline for employees of federal contractors to be vaccinated. However, it has signaled contractors have flexibility in enforcing that deadline.

U.S. courts have largely upheld vaccination requirements imposed by employers, universities, states and cities. 
About 58% of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated and over 66% have received one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

(Reuters) -The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday authorized the  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) coronavirus vaccine for children aged 5 to 11 years, making it the first COVID-19 shot for young children in the United States.
The shot will not be immediately available to the age group. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still needs to advise on how the shot should be administered, which will be decided after a group of outside advisers discuss the plan on Tuesday.
Pfizer said it will begin shipping pediatric vials of the vaccine on Saturday to pharmacies, pediatricians' offices and other places where the shots may be administered. 
The FDA decision is expected to make the vaccine available to 28 million American children, many of whom are back in school for in-person learning. 
It comes after a panel of advisers to the regulator voted overwhelmingly to recommend the authorization on Tuesday. 
Only a few other countries, including China, Cuba and the United Arab Emirates, have so far cleared COVID-19 vaccines for children in this age group and younger.
The FDA authorized a 10-microgram dose of Pfizer's vaccine in young children, lower than the 30 micrograms in the original vaccine for those age 12 and older.
Advisers on the FDA panel said a lower dose could help mitigate some of the rare side effects after paying close attention to the rate of heart inflammation, or myocarditis, that has been linked to both Pfizer and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) vaccines, especially in young men. 
The regulator said on Friday that known and potential benefits of the Pfizer vaccine in individuals aged between 5 and 11 outweigh the risks.
For the pediatric shots, the FDA has authorized a new version of the vaccine, which uses a new buffer and allows them to be stored in refrigerators for up to 10 weeks.
In the United States, around 58% of the population is fully vaccinated, lagging other nations such as the UK and France. Many adults, who have been hesitant to get a vaccine, may be more cautious about giving the shot to their children.
""We certainly hope that as people see children getting vaccinated, and being protected and being able to participate in activities without concern, that more people will get their kids vaccinated,"" Acting FDA Commissioner Dr. Janet Woodcock said at a press conference.
""And as we accumulate more experience with the vaccine, more comfort with the safety will occur.""
Pfizer and BioNTech said their vaccine showed 90.7% efficacy against the coronavirus in a clinical trial of children aged 5 to 11.
""This is a day so many parents, eager to protect their young children from this virus, have been waiting for,"" Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said in a statement
The United States started administering the vaccine to teens between ages 12 and 17 in May. Vaccination coverage among the age group is lower than in older groups, according to the CDC.

Pfizer's vaccine was the first to be authorized for emergency use in the United States in December last year for those age 16 and older and was granted full U.S. approval in August. 
Earlier this week, Moderna reported interim data showing that its vaccine generated a strong immune response in children ages 6 to 11 years. It is awaiting a U.S. regulatory decision on the authorization for children between ages 12 and 17.

380,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2021 08:35PM ET</span>",U.S. House plan would give electric vehicles boost but faces opposition,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A $1.75 trillion Democratic spending proposal could give a big boost to electric vehicles especially to Detroit's Big Three automakers and the U.S. Postal Service, but it faces opposition from Republicans, foreign automakers, Canada and Mexico.
The House plan boosts electric vehicle credits to up to $12,500 per vehicle, including $4,500 for union-made vehicles and $500 for U.S.-made batteries. Vehicles would have to be made in the United States starting in 2027 to qualify for any credit.
The EV tax credits would cost $15.6 billion over 10 years and disproportionately benefit Detroit's Big Three automakers - General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) and Chrysler-parent Stellantis NV - which assemble their U.S.-made vehicles in union-represented plants.
United Auto Workers (UAW) President Ray Curry said the provision will ""create and preserve tens of thousands of UAW members' jobs"" and ""would be a win for auto manufacturing workers.""
""The framework announced today supports good paying union jobs and stands to benefit our country for decades to come,"" he said.
Foreign automakers, however, have harshly criticized the decision to give union-made vehicles a big leg up. A dozen foreign automakers on Friday urged California's two U.S. senators to oppose it, saying it was unfair to the state's workers.
    The Mexican government criticized the U.S. proposal, according to a letter released on Friday in which Economy Minister Tatiana Clouthier expressed her ""strong concern"" over the provisions, adding that it is ""contrary to the regional value content rules agreed upon"" in the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade pact.
Last week, Canada said the tax credit proposals https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/canada-criticizes-proposed-us-ev-tax-credit-says-could-harm-auto-sector-2021-10-22 could harm the North American auto industry and run afoul of trade agreements.
OPPOSITION BREWING
On Wednesday, the governors of 11 states, including Texas, Florida and Arizona, said they opposed the tax credit arguing it would create a ""discriminatory environment in our states by punishing autoworkers and car companies because the workers in their plants chose not to unionize.""
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and foreign automakers do not have unions representing assembly workers in the United States and many have fought UAW efforts to organize U.S. plants.
Honda said in a letter Friday ""this tax credit plan would pit Americans working for the three 'legacy' companies against the American workers of other automakers.""
The bill would award $6 billion for the U.S. Postal Service to purchase electric delivery vehicles and infrastructure. USPS said Friday it estimates under the bill ""all delivery fleet acquisitions could feasibly be electric by 2028, and a corresponding 70% of our entire delivery fleet by"" 2030.
In February, USPS awarded a 10-year contract to Oshkosh (NYSE:OSK) Defense, a subsidiary of Oshkosh, to build a mix of internal combustion and EV delivery vehicles that could be worth$6 billion.
The EV proposal eliminates phasing out tax credits after automakers hit 200,000 electric vehicles sold, which would make GM eligible, along with Tesla.
Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm defended the decision to exclude Tesla from the higher credit, telling CNBC: ""We want to make sure that we do everything possible to encourage that business and labor really focus on elevating the standards for everyday Americans.""
Earlier this month, over 100 House lawmakers signed a letter urging Speaker Nancy Pelosi to back the tax credit.

The bill would create a new electric bike and three-wheel vehicle tax credit, a 30% credit for commercial electric vehicles and $4,000 used EV tax credit.
It would authorize $3.5 billion for ""domestic manufacturing conversion"" grants for electric and other green vehicles and provide $3 billion to boost a U.S. loan program to retool existing auto plants to build more fuel efficient models and expand it to cover zero-emission trains, airplanes, boats and Hyperloop technology.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks shook off early declines and closed out the last trading day of the month with modest gains on Friday as a rise in Microsoft helped offset declines in Amazon and Apple after disappointing quarterly earnings from the online retailer and iPhone maker.
 Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s shares closed at a record high of $331.62 and ended the session with a market capitalization of $2.49 trillion, surpassing Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s market cap of roughly $2.48 trillion.
Apple lost 1.81% after it warned the impact of supply-chain disruptions will be even worse during the current holiday sales quarter, while Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) declined 2.15% as it forecast downbeat holiday-quarter sales amid labor shortages.
""The takeaway from today is the resilience to the overall index despite 10% of market cap in two companies disappointing and yet the market is flat. It’s the resilience of the marketplace, it suggests to me the trend is still intact,""
said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) in Boston. 
""Maybe the numbers were a surprise to the analyst community but not the reasons for the disappointment so there is still a general view that this is not business lost but business postponed and the trend in the economy and in the market continues to be to the upside.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 89.08 points, or 0.25%, to 35,819.56, the S&P 500 gained 8.96 points, or 0.19%, to 4,605.38 and the Nasdaq Composite added 50.27 points, or 0.33%, to 15,498.39.
The S&P 500 had fallen as much as 0.65% earlier in the day. The benchmark index advanced 1.3% for the week, its fourth straight weekly climb, marking its longest weekly streak of gains since April. For the month, the S&P rose 6.9%, its biggest monthly rise since November 2020. 
The Dow rose 0.4% for the week while the Nasdaq gained 2.7%, also marking four straight weekly gains for each. The Dow climbed 5.8% for October, its best monthly performance since March, while the Nasdaq jumped 7.3% for its biggest monthly percentage gain since November 2020. 
Apple had risen about 2.5% while Amazon gained 1.6% in Thursday's session, helping to send the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to closing record highs. 
With 279 companies in the S&P 500 having reported results through Friday morning, 82.1% have topped earnings expectations, according to Refinitiv data. The current year-over-year earnings growth rate for the third quarter is 39.2%. 
Market participants have been closely attuned to the ability of companies to maneuver through labor shortages, rising price pressures and clogs in the supply chain, and a solid earnings season has helped investors overlook a mixed macroeconomic picture with a Federal Reserve that is poised to begin to trim its massive bond purchases soon.
The central bank's next policy announcement is on Nov. 3. 
Data showed U.S. consumer spending increased solidly in September, while inflation pressures are broadening.
The data indicated the jury is still out on whether the Fed's ""transitory"" view on inflation will hold true. 
 AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV) advanced 4.56% as the U.S. drugmaker raised its 2021 adjusted profit forecast for the third time this year.
 Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) tumbled 6.30% after the coffee chain said it expects fiscal 2022 operating margin to be below its long-term target due to inflation and investments.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.14-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.02-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 50 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 127 new highs and 78 new lows. 
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.12 billion shares, compared with the 10.35 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

(Reuters) -Apple Inc lost its crown as the world's most valuable public company to  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) on Friday, as the iPhone maker's shares fell about 2%.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) took a $6 billion hit to its sales during the fiscal fourth quarter due to persistent global supply chain problems, leading to a miss on Wall Street expectations. Top boss Tim Cook said the impact will be even worse in the current holiday sales quarter.
""Compared to less hardware focused FAANG peers, Apple is also a lot more exposed to supply chain disruption,"" said Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV).
Apple's shares dropped 1.8% to end the session at $149.80, giving the company a market capitalization of $2.48 trillion. By contrast, shares of Windows software maker Microsoft rose 2.2% to a record high of $331.62, ending the session with a market capitalization of $2.49 trillion. 
Apple, which has repurchased $421.7 billion worth of shares over the years, had announced a massive $90 billion share buyback in April. As a result, the outstanding stock pool keeps shrinking, and the company ended its fiscal fourth quarter with 16.4 billion shares.
Microsoft's stock has surged 49% this year, with pandemic-induced demand for its cloud-based services driving sales. Shares of Apple have climbed 13% so far this year.
Apple's stock market value overtook Microsoft's in 2010 as the iPhone made it the world's premier consumer technology company. The companies have taken turns as Wall Street's most valuable business in recent years, with Apple holding the title since mid-2020.

Analysts say Apple has managed the supply chain issue well, but with Cook warning of more pressure, the door is open to a hit to its performance as the holiday season kicks in.
In contrast, Microsoft on Tuesday forecast a strong end to the calendar year. But it also warned that supply-chain woes will continue to dog key units, such as those producing its Surface laptops and Xbox gaming consoles.

386,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2021 05:17PM ET</span>",Wall St Week Ahead: Stocks approach historically strong period but Fed taper looms,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are weighing whether momentum from the stock market's record-breaking rally will continue in the last two months of 2021, a traditionally strong calendar period for equities but a stretch that may carry more risks than usual this year. 
The S&P 500 has rallied 22.6% year-to-date, its best January-through-October performance since 2013, and November and December tend to be among the strongest months for stocks. 
This time around, however, the year-end period may have more than its usual share of pitfalls, as investors brace for the looming unwind of a $120 billion-per-month Federal Reserve government bond buying program that has helped stocks more than double from their March 2020 lows. Many are also keeping a wary eye on ructions in the bond market, as well as worries over looming inflation and a debate over tax legislation in Washington. 
“If the appropriate items fall into place you could continue the seasonality of a year-end rally,"" said Alan Lancz, president of investment advisory firm Alan B. Lancz & Associates in Toledo, Ohio. 
November traditionally has started a bullish period for U.S. equities. Since 1945, the S&P 500 has climbed an average of 6.8% in the November-through-April period, the highest average change for any rolling six-month span, compared with an average 1.7% gain from May through October, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.
In particular, November and December have been the S&P 500's second- and third-best months of the year since 1950, with the index rising an average of 1.7% and 1.5%, respectively, according to the Stock Trader's Almanac. The benchmark index gained 6.9% in October, helped by a better-than-expected start to the earnings season.
One major test for that run will come as the Fed begins to taper its bond buying program, a move the central bank is expected to announce at the end of its monetary policy meeting next week. While officials have telegraphed plans to begin reducing bond buying as early as November, investors will be listening for signals that the recent surge in inflation may force the central bank to taper and eventually raise interest rates faster than expected. 
The Fed's communication about its view on how sustained the recent surge in inflation will be is critical to markets, said Anu Gaggar, global investment strategist at Commonwealth Financial Network.
""So far they have maintained that this is transitory, but if we see a change in the wording around that, that could potentially spook the market a little bit,” Gaggar said.
Investors are tracking volatility in the bond market, which has come as rates for short-term U.S. government bonds soared in response to expectations that surging inflation will force the Fed and other central banks to tighten monetary policy more aggressively. While those recent moves have not weighed on stocks, surges in longer-dated Treasury yields could make equities less attractive for some investors.
In Washington, legislation to increase spending on infrastructure could boost some areas of the market, but investors are also wary of proposals that might create higher levies on corporate profits, income or investments. On Thursday, President Joe Biden was dealt a setback as the House of Representatives abandoned plans for a vote on an infrastructure bill. 
Some high-profile investors see the potential for downside. BofA Global Research this week called for a year-end target on the S&P 500 of 4,250, about 7.5% below current levels. BofA analysts pointed to extended valuations, ""near-euphoric"" sentiment and a bevy of risks to corporate profit margins, including potential tax hikes and labor inflation. 
Lancz said that given the ""phenomenal"" stock gains in October, those returns might be ""borrowing a little bit from what we might see in November and December."" 

Still, market declines have been met with swift buying in 2021. The S&P 500's biggest drop this year - a 5.2% fall from early September to early October - was recouped in just 13 trading days. 
""The market has, at every turn this year, surprised people,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago. ""Every time people leave it for dead, the buy-the-dip mentality has continued to be strong.”

BOSTON (Reuters) -A unit of French advertising company  Publicis Groupe  SA (PA:PUBP) on Friday lost a bid to dismiss a lawsuit by Massachusetts' attorney general claiming it helped OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP fuel the U.S. opioid epidemic.
Publicis Health had called Attorney General Maura Healey's lawsuit an unprecedented attempt to sue an advertising agency over a manufacturer's marketing of its products. It called her allegations conclusory and said she mischaracterized documents.
But Suffolk County Superior Court Judge Brian Davis said Healey brought ""non-speculative"" claims under the state's public nuisance law and consumer protection statute that could move forward.
He pointed to allegations in Healey's complaint, filed in May, that he said showed Publicis ""played an integral part in developing marketing strategies"" to boost opioid sales from 2010 to 2019.
Davis said those marketing campaigns were designed to get doctors ""to use more OxyContin, prescribe higher doses and prescribe it for longer periods of time for patients.""
Healey said she was pleased Davis ""rejected Publicis' attempt to skirt responsibility for its marketing campaigns.""
Publicis said in a statement its work was ""completely lawful"" and that nothing it did was deceptive. Its lawyer, David Anders of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, argued that Purdue, not Publicis, dictated the content of its marketing.
""No advertiser has ever been held responsible in these circumstances,"" he said.
More than 3,300 lawsuits have been filed by largely state and local governments seeking to hold drug companies responsible for an epidemic the U.S. government says led to nearly 500,000 overdose deaths from 1999 to 2019.

A bankruptcy judge in August approved a settlement by Purdue and its wealthy Sackler family owners of the claims against them that the company values at more than $10 billion.
Consulting company McKinsey & Co separately agreed to pay $641 million to resolve claims by various states that it helped Purdue and other drugmakers design marketing plans and boost painkiller sales.

So, let’s look closer at these names.Even though labor shortages, global supply chain constraints, and increased freight and shipping costs could mar the technology industry’s growth in the near term, tech stocks are gaining attention amid the continuing low-interest-rate environment.
Investors’ renewed interest in tech stocks is evidenced by the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF’s (XLK) 6.7% returns over the past month. However, the current, ultra-loose monetary policy, in part, has led to stretched valuations for several tech stocks. Nevertheless, the ongoing digital transformation and increasing use of cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and other advanced technologies should keep driving the technology industry’s growth. According to GoRemotely, the tech industry is expected to reach a $5 trillion market value by the end of 2021.

The resumption of industrial activities and easing of travel restrictions have helped the trucking industry rebound strongly from its pandemic lows this year. With rising consumer demand as the holiday season approaches, the heightened need for the surface transportation of raw materials should benefit the industry. Furthermore, amid ongoing supply chain constraints worldwide, trucking companies' intermodal services and logistics solutions should be in high demand. The global general freight trucking market is expected to grow at an 8% CAGR to $997.35 billion by 2028. So, both JBHT and CHRW should benefit.
While CHRW has gained 4.6% in price year-to-date, JBHT has surged 44.9%. JBHT is a clear winner with 17.2% gains versus CHRW’s 4.8% returns in terms of their past six months’ performance. But which of these stocks is a better pick now? Let’s find out.

391,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2021 04:56PM ET</span>","Global stocks fall, U.S. dollar climbs on inflation worries","By Chibuike Oguh
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Global equity markets dipped on Friday, while the U.S. dollar gained as rising consumer prices bolstered expectations of interest rate hikes even with data showing solid growth in U.S. consumer spending.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.6% in September, the Commerce Department said on Friday, signifying strong consumer confidence as COVID-19 infections fall.
But the data also showed that price pressures remained persistent in September, with the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index climbing 0.2%.
Investors overcame bearish sentiment that had weighed on trading following quarterly earnings from technology giants Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Thursday that both missed Wall Street predictions owing to increased labor costs and operational disruptions that were set to hit their revenues.
""The inflation story slowly morphed into something that we thought to be transitory, and it's turning out to be more persistent,"" said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Investment Management in Minnesota.
The MSCI world equities index, which tracks shares in 50 countries, dipped 0.25% to 745.08. European stocks closed 0.07% higher at 475.51 after rebounding from losses early in the day's session.
On Wall Street, all three major indexes closed higher after trading down for much of the day's session, driven by technology, healthcare, and consumer discretionary stocks.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s shares touched a record high and neared a market capitalization of $2.5 trillion, surpassing Apple's market cap of roughly $2.46 trillion.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.25% to 35,819.56, the S&P 500 gained 0.19% to 4,605.38 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.33% to 15,498.39.
""When you look at the bigger picture in equities, the price makers in an inflation environment can pass it to consumers, but price takers have to absorb those input costs, meaning lower profits,"" Ripley added.
U.S. Treasury yields dipped from earlier gains, dragged down by concerns over rising consumer inflation for September that further stoked expectations of aggressive monetary policy action from the Federal Reserve to combat the surge in prices.
The benchmark U.S. 10-year yield traded down at 1.5539%.
The dollar index continued to rebound from prior-day losses on news that the Fed's preferred inflation measure showed prices continuing to rise faster than its 2% target.
The dollar index rose 0.811%, with the euro down 1.03% to $1.1559.
U.S. crude prices settled higher, turning positive after an early decline, supported by expectations that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and their allies, known as OPEC+, would maintain production cuts.
Brent crude rose 6 cents to settle at $84.38, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose 76 cents, or 0.9%, to $83.57. 

Gold prices fell to their lowest level in more than a week on Friday, weighed down by a stronger dollar and rising U.S. inflation.[
Spot gold dropped 0.9% to $1,782.39 an ounce. U.S. gold futures fell 1.30% to $1,783.00 an ounce.

392,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2021 04:31PM ET</span>","Exxon posts strongest results since 2017, vows to resume share buybacks","By Sabrina Valle and Arathy S Nair
(Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) on Friday pledged to revive its long-dormant share repurchase program next year, bolstered by a jump in profit and improved cash flow in the third quarter as rising global economic activity has caused fossil fuel demand to surge.
The higher profit follows several years of lackluster returns and heavy spending at Exxon, and as agitated shareholders this year voted to put three new directors on the company's board due to dissatisfaction with its direction.
For more than a decade, Exxon had been once the largest U.S. corporate repurchaser of shares before suspending the practice in 2016. 
""The upside surprise was the buyback program, no one was expecting it this soon,"" said equity analyst Paul Sankey at Sankey Research.
The nation's largest oil and gas company reported net income of $6.75 billion, or $1.57 per share, in the third quarter, the highest since the last quarter of 2017. That compared with a loss of $680 million, or 15 cents per share, in the year-earlier period. 
REFINING GAINS 
Exxon's $1.58 a share profit beat the Refinitiv estimate by two cents. Third-quarter results reflected the highest refining profit in at least two years, soaring natural gas prices and energy shortages that pushed oil to a three-year high. Crude prices have continued to climb to near a seven-year high.
Exxon shares finished up 16 cents at $64.49 as some analysts expressed disappointed in the size of buyback program. 
The company's three businesses delivered higher returns from past cost-cutting restructurings and as the global economy emerges from the coronavirus pandemic, Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods said. 
The benefits of those changes ""are manifesting themselves,"" Woods told analysts on a conference call, adding that Exxon expects to ""deliver the same growth in earnings and cash flow as our pre-pandemic plans"" that called for $30 billion in annual profit by 2025.
That outlook will allow the company to resume buybacks starting next year under a plan to spend up to $10 billion on share repurchases through 2023, Exxon said.
""The macro winds are at Exxon's back,"" said Stewart Glickman, energy equity analyst at CFRA Research.
CARBON EMISSIONS CUTS
In 2016, Exxon cut share repurchases amid weak results, saying it would buy shares only to offset dilution from executive pay plans as opposed to returning cash to shareholders.
In the decade prior, Exxon spent $210 billion on its own stock, more than any other U.S. company in that period.
A day after Exxon's Woods appeared before Congress to address the company's previous dismissal of global warming, Exxon said it would increase spending to cut its carbon emissions to $15 billion between 2022 and 2027. 
Profits in oil and gas soared in the third quarter on the strength of international demand, reaching nearly $4 billion compared with a $383 million loss a year ago. Chemical profits slipped from last quarter's high but more than tripled from the same period last year.
The company said it will benefit in the fourth quarter from higher oil and gas volumes, increased European seasonal gas demand and the $1 billion sale of its UK North Sea assets.
Exxon shares are up than 50% this year, as earnings bounced back from last year's historic loss, but remain below where they traded in early 2020. This year's profit has allowed the company to repay about $11 billion in debt taken on last year to cover its dividend. 

Earlier this year, Exxon spent heavily on a proxy battle waged by a hedge fund unhappy with the oil and gas company's strategy. The fund, Engine No. 1, was successful in convincing enough shareholders to vote for three new directors to serve on Exxon's board.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon successfully tested a booster rocket motor on Thursday designed to power a launch vehicle carrying a hypersonic weapon aloft, the Navy said.
The United States and its global rivals have intensified their drive to build hypersonic weapons - the next generation of arms that rob adversaries of reaction time and traditional defeat mechanisms. Defense contractors hope to capitalize as they make the weapons and develop new detection and defeat mechanisms.
This week, the top U.S. military officer confirmed a Chinese hypersonic weapons test that military experts say appears to show Beijing's pursuit of an Earth-orbiting system designed to evade American missile defenses.
""We are on schedule for the upcoming flight test of the full common hypersonic missile,"" said Vice Admiral Johnny Wolfe Jr, Director, Navy's Strategic Systems Programs, lead designer on the program. That flight test, of the combined boost rocket and hypersonic weapon, is slated to happen before autumn 2022.
Last week in Kodiak, Alaska, the U.S. failed a hypersonic weapon test when the booster failed.
U.S. military services will use the common hypersonic missile as a base to develop individual weapon systems and launchers tailored for launch from sea or land.
The common hypersonic missile will consist of the first stage solid rocket motor as part of a new missile booster combined with the Common Hypersonic Glide Body (CHGB).
This static fire test marked the first time the first stage solid rocket motor included a thrust vector control system, the Navy said. Thrust vector control systems allow the rocket motors to be maneuverable in flight.

The U.S. Navy's Strategic Systems Programs conducted two prior tests of the solid rocket motor used in the development of the Navy's Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) offensive hypersonic strike capability and the Army's Long Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW).
Arms makers  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT),  Northrop Grumman  Corp (NYSE:NOC) and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Corp all touted their hypersonic weapons programs at the top of their quarterly earnings calls this week as world focus shifted to the new arms race for an emerging class of weapon.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has raised significant concerns about a plan to use spectrum for 5G wireless networks on aviation safety and is planning to issue a formal warning about the issue, according to sources and a letter seen by Reuters.
The aviation industry has voiced alarm about the plan to use C-Band spectrum for more than a year. Network carriers are expected to begin using the spectrum starting Dec. 5 starting in 46 markets.
FAA Deputy Administrator Bradley Mims in a previously unreported Oct. 6 letter said the agency shares ""the deep concern about the potential impact to aviation safety resulting from interference to radar altimeter performance from 5G network operations in the C band.""
An FAA spokeswoman said Friday it ""continues to engage with other agencies so that aviation and the newest generation of 5G cellular technology can safely coexist.""
The Federal Communications Commission said Friday it remains committed to ensuring air safety as the agency’s successful track record demonstrates, while moving forward with the deployment of new technologies that support American business and consumer needs.""
The FAA held a lengthy Oct. 14 meeting with the aviation industry on the issue. FAA and FCC officials have held numerous discussions about the issue, the sources said.
The FAA is planning to soon issue a Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin and an airworthiness directive about the issue, two officials told Reuters, confirming a Wall Street Journal report.
The aerospace and airline sector met with the FCC in August https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/1081157361951/Aviation%20and%20Aerospace%20Ex%20parte%20Notice%20Aug%206%202021%20w%20OET%20WTB%20IB.pdf, warning without changes ""major disruptions to use of the National Airspace System can be expected from the rollout of 5G"" and added the FAA will be forced to ""drastically reduce aviation operational capacity."" 

Wireless trade group CTIA said Friday 5G networks can safely use C-band spectrum ""without causing harmful interference to aviation equipment,"" and cited numerous active 5G networks using this spectrum band in 40 countries... Any delay in activating this spectrum risks America’s competitiveness.""
One longer-term solution is retrofitting some altimeters with ""out-of-band filters,"" but it would likely take years and ""many thousands of civil aircraft are likely to be impacted, the aviation industry said.

(Reuters) -Regional pharmacy chain operator Giant Eagle Inc on Friday said it had agreed to settle lawsuits accusing it of fueling the opioid epidemic in several Ohio communities, including two counties that had taken it and three larger rivals to trial.
The settlement came during the fourth week of a trial in federal court in Cleveland over claims by the Ohio counties of Lake and Trumbull against Giant Eagle, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) Inc, CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc.
The settlement resolves claims against Giant Eagle in 10 lawsuits by those counties and others in Ohio, the company and the plaintiffs' lawyers said in a joint statement. It operates grocery stores and pharmacies in five states including Ohio.
Financial terms were not disclosed.
""While Giant Eagle denies it was a cause of the opioid crisis, it recognizes the severity of the crisis, its impact on the public and the hard work of the public officials working to address the harms,"" the company said.
The case underway in Ohio is first trial the pharmacy chains have faced in nationwide litigation over an opioid abuse epidemic that U.S. government data shows led to nearly 500,000 overdose deaths from 1999 to 2019.
More than 3,300 cases have been brought largely by state and local governments against pharmacies, drugmakers and drug distributors.
The Ohio counties claim the pharmacies failed to prevent excessive amounts of opioid pills from flooding their communities or identify ""red flags"" of misuse. The companies deny wrongdoing.

The three largest U.S. drug distributors - McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK),  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH) and AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp - and drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) in July proposed paying up to $26 billion to settle cases against them.

So, we think Investors that are looking to benefit from the industry’s solid growth prospects could invest in  Daimler  (OTC:DDAIF), Suzuki Motor (SZKMY), and Isuzu Motors (ISUZY). These stocks possess a solid combination of fundamental qualities. Read on.
Although the COVID-19 pandemic hit the auto manufacturing industry just as badly as to several other industries in the first half of 2020, automakers worldwide have seen a rapid surge in production since the third quarter. People have flocked to dealerships as public health distancing restrictions have been loosened in most areas.
Meanwhile, a global semiconductor chip shortage has made consumer vehicles pricier, thanks to rising demand. However, the auto industry is well-positioned to grow with the gradual resolution of the chip shortage. Chipmakers have pledged more than $700 billion to expand production capacities over the next decade. And the automotive industry is expected to grow at a 4.5% CAGR between 2021 - 2028.
Given this backdrop, we think auto manufacturing stocks of Daimler AG (DE:DAIGn) (DDAIF), Suzuki Motor Corporation (SZKMY), and Isuzu Motors Limited (ISUZY) could be no-brainer bets because of their solid fundamentals and growth prospects.

The S&P 500 rose 0.1% and had climbed to a record of 4,604.3 earlier in the session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.1%, or 50 points, while the Nasdaq was up 0.03% having hit an all-high earlier of 15,472.7.
It what was a disappointing end to the wave of big tech results seen this week, Amazon and Apple both reported quarterly results that fell short on the bottom line.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell more than 3% and was dethroned by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as the most valuable company by market cap after the tech giant’s quarterly revenue missed Wall Street estimates. Apple also warned that the ongoing chip shortage would continue to weigh on sales.
The results led to a slew of price cuts from Wall Street analysts, but Wedbush insisted the slide in Apple is a buying opportunity.
“While the bears will hang their hats on this supply chain issue and a valuation that has re-rated … [we] view any sell off as a buying opportunity given our robust view of Cupertino's product cycle demand story into 2022,” Wedbush said in a note.
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), meanwhile, fell more than 4% amid concerns about rising costs after the e-commerce giant forecast a $4 billion rise in costs to meet demand in the fourth quarter amid labor and materials shortages.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) jumped 3% to provide the sector with some reprieve as its rebranding announcement a day earlier was well received on Wall Street following its underwhelming quarterly report earlier this week.
Facebook said Thursday it would change its name to the ""Meta"" as part of its strategic move to build out and capitalize on the metaverse, where real-world experiences are replicated in the online world, often using virtual reality headsets.  
Industrials also supported the broader market intraday rebound, led by 6% surge in WW Grainger (NYSE:GWW) after the industrial materials supplier reported better-than-expected third-quarter results underpinned by strong demand.
Elsewhere on the earnings front, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) slipped more than 5% after its third-quarter revenue missed analysts estimates amid weaker China demand following a flare up in Covid-19 infections.  
Energy struggled to turn positive even as oil majors  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) and  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) traded higher following quarterly earnings that beat estimates amid surging in oil prices.   "

Investing.com — Shares of consumer goods company Newell Brands Inc (NASDAQ:NWL) rose Friday following the company's third-quarter earnings.
Newell reported a non-GAAP EPS of 54 cents, beating estimates by 4 cents, while revenue was reported at $2.79 billion, above the consensus of $2.78 billion. 
The company's shares have gained around 6.8%, to $23.25.
Chris Peterson, chief financial officer and president, Business Operations, said: ""During the third quarter, strong operational delivery, coupled with financial discipline, enabled us to deliver better than anticipated operating profit and sustained progress on the cash conversion cycle.""
Looking ahead, Newell raised its full-year net sales outlook to $10.38 billion to $10.46 billion from its previous range of $10.1 billion to $10.35 billion. It also increased its full-year outlook for normalized earnings per share to $1.69 to $1.73 from the previous range of $1.63 to $1.73.
""While the external environment remains challenging and volatile, strong year-to-date results give us confidence to raise our top and bottom line outlooks for full year 2021.

Investing.com – AbbVie stock (NYSE:ABBV) climbed more than 4% Friday after the drugmaker raised its dividend, and also lifted its outlook for annual profit for the third time after it narrowly beat sales and profit forecasts in the third quarter.
The company hiked its dividend for 2022 by 8.5%, beginning with a payout in February.
AbbVie now expects 2021 adjusted profit per share of $12.65 at the midpoint, compared to its prior expectation of $12.57 at the center of the range.
The company has been focusing on gaining expanded approvals for Skyrizi and Rinvoq, launched in 2019, as it prepares for competition from lower-cost biosimilar versions of Humira in 2023 after it settled patent disputes with rivals over the drug.
Abbvie would like Skyrizi and Rinvoq to emulate the success of its blockbuster drug Humira over the next few years.
Skyrizi injection is used for treatment of plaque psoriasis and the company wants approval to administer it to patients suffering from Crohn's disease, a type of inflammatory bowel disease.
Rinvoq is given to patients of severe atopic dermatitis and the company is seeking approvals to give it to those suffering from active ulcerative colitis.
Humira, AbbVie's injectable biologic for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, is the world’s largest selling medicine with sales of $19.83 billion in 2020 alone. The drug contributed to over 43% of the company’s revenue in 2020. Sales of the drug in the U.S. alone notched up $16.11 billion in 2020.
Around two months back, the Food and Drug Administration forced Abbvie to carry even sterner warning on Rinvoq.
Skyrizi sales jumped over 83%, to $796 million, in the September quarter. Sales from Rinvoq more than doubled to $453 million.
Total sales at AbbVie rose over 11%, to $14.34 billion. Adjusted profit per share rose about 18%, to $3.33."

Rising food prices due to supply chain disruptions could also raise pricing concerns. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said that global supply chain issues could remain through 2022.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) said Friday it had asked U.S. transit agencies to conduct inspections of wheel gauges on rail cars following the Oct. 12 derailment of a Washington subway train.
FTA said it was requiring state https://www.transit.dot.gov/sites/fta.dot.gov/files/2021-10/FTA-Safety-Advisory-21-1.pdf safety agencies to report out-of-tolerance wheel gauges discovered since October 2020 and advised them to require fleet-wide inspections of wheel gauges in public transportation systems. The Washington subway system said on Thursday it expected to operate sharply reduced service through at least Nov. 15.
FTA says operators must disclose how often they inspect wheel gauges and the number that failed inspections. 
On Oct. 17, the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission ordered the subway system to indefinitely remove about 60% of its railcars following inspections after the derailment. 
The National Transportation Safety said the train had derailed at least three times on Oct. 12.
The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), known as the Metro, serves the U.S. capital and parts of Maryland and Virginia. It has urged commuters to take buses or use other transit modes as train service has been cut back.
Average Metrorail weekday ridership has fallen by about 25%, WMATA said this week.
The commission ordered WMATA's 748 7000-Series trains removed from service after the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) ""identified safety concerns related to the spacing of wheels on 7000-Series railcar axles"".
The NTSB said WMATA had been aware of wheel assembly issues since 2017. It was a 7000-Series train that was involved in the Oct. 12 derailment outside Washington in Arlington, Virginia.

WMATA said on Tuesday it had completed inspections on its 748 7000-Series trains and 20 axles were found to be out of alignment.
The derailment did not injure any of the 187 passengers onboard, but NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy said the incident could have been ""catastrophic.""

411,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2021 12:55PM ET</span>",Retailers reel in delivery deadlines to get Christmas gifts to shoppers on time,"By Arriana McLymore and Lisa Baertlein
NEW YORK, NY (Reuters) - Shoppers hoping to nab holiday gifts online this year may need to prepare well in advance for their purchases. Numerous retailers are setting earlier deadlines for merchandise ordered online to reach customers’ homes before Christmas. 
Frères Branchiaux Candle Press co-founder Celena Gill designated Nov. 30 as the last day for customers to place their orders if they want scented soy candles to arrive before Christmas. “We have already seen a delay in shipping this month and we anticipate that it will be worse as we near Christmas day,” Gill said. She declined to comment on last year's deadline.
State Bags, a New York-based luggage company, is cutting off Christmas shipping three days earlier than last year’s deadline of Dec. 18. It will not offer its annual two-day holiday shipping promotion this year due to supply chain issues, co-founder Jacqueline Tatelman said. 
FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and United States Postal Service set ground shipping deadlines for Dec. 15, identical with last year’s delivery cutoffs - even though there is one day more between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year. UPS is providing delivery deadline estimates on its website based on timing, location and shipping services. 
By some estimates, there may be nearly 5 million more packages per day than delivery drivers can handle during the peak season when unit volumes can double. And, FedEx has already signaled trouble for its ground unit, which handled more than 9.3 million packages a day for customers including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) last quarter. In September, the Memphis-based company warned that employee hiring and retention problems were slowing deliveries. 
UPS, the world’s biggest parcel delivery firm, is dropping low-profit customers – a move that could hit vulnerable retailers. On the other hand, UPS will make nationwide deliveries on Saturdays this year and is taking several other steps to minimize “chaos costs” and improve on-time service, UPS Chief Executive Carol Tome said. 
Retailers typically use delivery cutoff dates as a competitive differentiator, and during normal times, they push them out as far as possible to appeal to last-minute shoppers. But that strategy comes with extra risk this year, particularly for small shops vulnerable to bad customer reviews. And, in a year marked by hurricanes and other severe storms, there’s little wiggle room for other unforeseen disruptions due to factors such as wicked winter weather. 
But this year, retailers large and small are encouraging customers to shop early to shift demand and ease supply chain backups. Some U.S. shoppers are panicked that supply chain snarls will spread to home delivery of Christmas gifts, Tome said on a conference call with analysts on Tuesday.
“In fact, some think that 50% of holiday shopping will be completed by Cyber Monday,” said Tome. “Some of our customers are actually pulling forward promotions,” she said, referring to retailers’ earlier Christmas marketing messages that translated into a bump in demand. 
For example, UPS began working with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), its biggest customer, several months ago. Still, it will again enforce volume limits and not pick up all requested packages if unexpected volume threatens to swamp its system – a move that hit retailers like Gap, Macy’s and  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) last year. 
Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) is encouraging its merchants to update their shipping policy pages to highlight delays and lower expectations. The company is also suggesting that merchants offer earlier Black Friday-Cyber Monday sales and integrate local delivery options and curbside pickup for brick-and-mortar merchants. 
Meanwhile, Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) has improved its estimations of delivery dates to promote sales and reduce uncertainty for its community of homemade or vintage goods sellers. “Nearly every item from a U.S. seller will include an estimated delivery date this holiday season,” Etsy CEO Josh Silverman said in a blog post. 
Larger retailers including Walmart,  Target  (NYSE:TGT), Amazon, Macy’s and Best Buy have not announced their final delivery cutoff dates, but they are promoting options to reduce stress on the system. They’re offering early and extended Black Friday deals and enticing customers to use gig delivery services like DoorDash and Shipt or “buy online, pick up store” options. 

Last year, Walmart announced its delivery deadlines in mid-December, while Amazon notified customers at the end of November that eligible products were available for two-day and one-day shipping on Dec. 23 and Christmas Eve.

Beginning with the sentiment picture, we have to go back more than three years to see a similar level of pessimism as we are seeing currently, with the long-term moving average for silver diving off a cliff and currently sitting near 20% bulls. This is a massive sea change from where sentiment sat just over nine months ago during a poorly orchestrated silver squeeze attempt when bullish sentiment sat near 80% bulls. This means that we have transitioned from a market with four bullish market participants for every one bearish market participant to a market with four bearish market participants for every one that’s bullish. When everyone is a bull, and the sky is the limit for an asset class, the asset class typically corrects sharply, given that everyone is bullish and there’s no one left to buy. Conversely, now that the majority, there is almost no one interested in buying, with significant firepower if prices begin to head higher and investors decide they want to build up exposure.

Thus, the S&P 500 made new highs earlier this week and is hovering near those levels.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department is expected to reduce the size of its upcoming auctions when it announces its funding plan for the coming quarter on Monday, the first step in lowering debt supply as the federal government moves past its emergency-level response to the coronavirus pandemic. 
The move, which is well anticipated on Wall Street, will likely total an $800 billion cut in nominal auction sizes in the 2022 fiscal year compared with the 2021 fiscal year, according to estimates from NatWest. The majority of those cuts will come in securities with a 7-year duration or less, with a $2 billion per month cut in Treasury bonds with durations of 2, 3, and 5 years, and $3 billion per month cuts in 7, 10, and 20-year Treasuries, the bank estimates. 
""After ramping up coupon issuance to fund pandemic spending, it is now time for Treasury to start reducing issuance sizes commensurate with more normal deficits,"" said Meghan Swiber, a rates strategist at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Global Research. 
While the Treasury's expected plans to lower bond supply will increase demand for shorter-duration bonds and steepen the yield curve, the reduction in debt issuance may be short-lived given the likelihood of that Congress will pass a Democrat-led $1 trillion infrastructure bill and a $1.75 trillion bill to address climate measures and social initiatives, said Scott Kimball, co-head of U.S. fixed income at BMO Asset Management. [L1N2RO0ZK] 
""From an issuance standpoint this is likely the calm before the storm,"" he said. 
The Treasury Department's funding plans will also likely reflect the unsettled question of the debt ceiling, which constrains the U.S. government's borrowing limit, said Gennadiy Goldberg, senior rates strategist at TD Securities. 
President Joe Biden signed legislation https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-signs-bill-raising-us-debt-limit-averting-default-2021-10-15 to increase the limit by $480 billion in mid-October, a short-term measure that pushed back the date by which the federal government is expected to exhaust its borrowing power to Dec. 3. 

""Despite the short-term debt ceiling increase, the Treasury is likely to remain heavily constrained by the ceiling. We look for bill supply to remain limited near-term but to ramp up after the ceiling is raised or suspended,"" by Dec. 3, Goldberg noted. 
The Treasury Department will announce its overall refunding plans on Monday and release details such as the size of next month’s auctions on Wednesday, the same day that the Federal Reserve is expected to announce its plans to taper its emergency-level support of the economy.

“Our sector is operating below pre-Covid capacity,” Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber said in an interview on Bloomberg TV. “There’s a lot of talk about costs going up but we’re not seeing it at this point in time.”
While Breber said the oil company does see some tightness in the U.S. truck driver market affecting its downstream operations, the really big-ticket items for Chevron like drill rigs are still experiencing excess capacity.

In contrast, oilfield services companies are feeling the pinch, amid global supply chain snarl-ups and a greater exposure to wage inflation. “The industry will have to pay more to get back the expertise that it has lost,” Clay Williams, chief executive officer for NOV Inc., one of the world’s biggest suppliers of oil gear, said this week on a conference call.

Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, which has a strategic relationship with Rivian, removed a representative from the startup's board earlier this month.
At the end of the third quarter, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) had an equity interest of about 20% in Rivian, according to the filing.
Rivian is also aiming to raise between $5 billion and $8 billion in a stock market debut later this year, and seeking a valuation of about $80 billion, Reuters reported in September.

The company's pre-IPO investors also include T. Rowe Price and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK).

MADRID/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Web Summit, one of the largest tech conference organisers, will open its doors next week in Lisbon for its first in-person event since the pandemic struck, with the likes of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) set to speak.
Hot on the heels of the Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona in June, it will be the next large tech conference to test a return to normal, reuniting entrepreneurs, top executives and major investors after 19 months of video meetings.
About 40,000 attendees are slated to join the summit, which will feature 1,000 speakers ranging from Microsoft Vice Chairman Brad Smith to Apple software boss Craig Federighi, addressing audiences including founders of companies which have only recently emerged.
""It's almost 100% in-person attendees - we don't sell online-only tickets,"" Web Summit co-founder Paddy Cosgrave said. ""Most of these company founders have never been seen in person: they went from nowhere to somewhere exclusively in the last two years of lockdown.""
Investors - who traditionally pride themselves on their ""sixth sense"" for assessing people in person - were forced to rely on virtual encounters. 
""If you've invested 200 million in someone you've only met over Zoom, it's a massive leap of faith,"" Cosgrave said.
Players in the tech sector, which gained unprecedented financial clout and political reach as the coronavirus pandemic accelerated digitalisation worldwide, are set to tackle themes ranging from privacy and regulation to racism and fintech.
While Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) CPO Chris Cox will be talking about the ""metaverse"", on another stage the social media group's newest whistleblower Frances Haugen will discuss the network's grasp over its 3 billion users - or nearly half the planet.
PHYSICAL EVENT 
Joining them at the summit which runs from Nov. 1 to 4 will be executives from more than 70 ""unicorns"" - startups valued at more than $1 billion - while hundreds of startup founders will be seeking attention from venture capitalists to help scale their business.
""As people head to Web Summit - for what will be the first physical event for many - I think everyone will be looking forward to the serendipitous meetings, chats between stage sessions, and bumping into old friends in-person again,"" Harry Nelis, partner at venture capital fund Accel, told Reuters. 
A gathering of this size also brings into focus safety precautions against the spread of the coronavirus and bears the risk of turning into a ""superspreader"" event, though the venue - Portugal - is among the world's most-vaccinated countries. 
""We will have teams across the venue monitoring capacity, ensuring one-way traffic flows,"" Cosgrave said. Numerous outdoor meeting spaces were created for small groups, along with on-site medical staff and isolation rooms in every building, he added.
Describing the summit as the ""biggest event of 2021"" to take place in Portugal, local police said in on Friday several security measures would be in place to ensure the ""immense influx of people and vehicles"" is well-managed.
For conference organisers, a successful event is critical to stay above water. Last year's event cancellation forced MWC to lay off about 40% of its staff, with MWC organiser and telecoms industry association GSMA taking a hard hit.

Cosgrave said Web Summit did not lay off any people because of the pandemic, relying on revenue streams from other products, including hybrid conferencing software, initially designed to complement networking at in-person events and now due to underpin next year's CES in Las Vegas. 
Launched in Dublin in 2010 with just 400 participants and held in Lisbon since 2016, Web Summit hosted about 70,000 attendees in 2019.

The ownership of SMCP, whose brands include Sandro and Maje, has been the subject of speculation after a unit of its Chinese majority owner Shandong Ruyi defaulted on some bonds, which resulted in the bondholders moving in.
Shares in SMCP rose 3% after the company said on Friday the bondholders, represented by a company called GLAS, now owned a 29% stake and 22.3% of voting rights, but were little changed by 1447 GMT. 
""SMCP reminds that this situation does not affect its own financing and operations,"" it said.
SMCP added the GLAS bondholder group would also look to change the board at SMCP.
Shandong Ruyi held around 53% of SMCP capital and 67% of its voting rights through a subsidiary - European TopSoho. 
Following European TopSoho's default on 250 million euros of bonds exchangeable in SMCP shares, the Chinese stake in the French company has fallen to 24% but it still holds 37% of voting rights, according to Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Kathryn Parker. 
Further complicating the situation, European TopSoho this month started legal proceedings against the bondholders, alleging they are trying to take control of SMCP at a low price. 
Shandong Ruyi once harboured ambitions of creating an empire that would rival that of luxury behemoth LVMH. 
It began purchasing labels in 2015, a buying spree that would see it acquire London-based suitmaker Aquascutum, Savile Row tailor Gieves & Hawkes and Paris-based fashion house Cerruti 1881. But it has struggled under the weight of debts resulting from those acquisitions. 
The sprawling Chinese conglomerate's financial difficulties worsened with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and it failed to secure financing for a $600 million deal to purchase Swiss shoe and accessories firm Bally last year.

SMCP said earlier this week it was confident of reaching full-year sales of 1 billion euros, after revenues in the third quarter recovered to close to pre-pandemic levels, following a 24% drop in sales last year.
Shandong Ruyi acquired the group from private equity firm KKR in 2016.

""We are conducting a thorough investigation. We want to ensure we understand what happened and the steps we can take to make sure it doesn’t happen again,"" the company said in a statement.
The refinery is in the middle of a multi-unit turnaround, during which Cenovus employed non-union contractors, according to the local building trades union.
Cenovus did not comment on what unit was affected by the fire or how it started.
Ohio unions had been rallying political support ahead of the turnaround, arguing that Cenovus' decision to use out-of-state contractors cost the union thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in wages, while risking the safety of the project.
Earlier this week the secretary and treasurer of the Ohio State Building and Construction Trades Council, Mike Knisely, said he spoke in support of proposed state legislation that would require more stringent training requirements for contractors employed by high hazard facilities such as refineries.

(Reuters) -U.S. drugmaker  AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV) on Friday raised its 2021 adjusted profit forecast for the third time this year and said it expects its newer drugs to recreate the success of its blockbuster treatment Humira over the next few years. 
The company has been focusing on gaining expanded approvals and driving growth for Skyrizi and Rinvoq, launched in 2019, as it prepares for competition from U.S. rivals to Humira, the world's biggest selling medicine, in 2023. 
One of the new drugs, however, has come under some pressure since the U.S. drug regulator in September asked AbbVie and some rivals to include information about the risk of serious conditions and death from use of drugs that belong to a class of treatments known as JAK inhibitors, including Rinvoq. 
AbbVie executives reiterated they still expect both Skyrizi and Rinvoq to significantly contribute to AbbVie's long-term growth. 
""What we're basically trying to accomplish with the company is build a set of assets that could ultimately significantly replace Humira in the marketplace and be superior to Humira,"" said Chief Executive Richard Gonzalez. 
""Regardless of what happens with Rinvoq's label, I have a high level of confidence we can continue to do that,"" said Gonzalez. 
Sales from Rinvoq more than doubled to $453 million in the quarter ended Sept. 30, beating the average analyst estimate of $436.8 million, according to Refinitiv IBES estimates.
Sales from plaque psoriasis drug Skyrizi jumped 83.3% to $796 million, also above estimates of $765 million. 
Total sales for AbbVie rose 11.2% to $14.34 billion, narrowly beating estimates of $14.32 billion. 

AbbVie now expects full-year adjusted profit of $12.63 to $12.67 per share, compared with prior expectation of $12.52 to $12.62.

At the most optimistic level, Western Digital estimates its gross margin to remain around the first quarter’s level of 34%. Gross margins could also slip to 32%, according to the company’s forecast as it tries to overcome supply chain issues .
The company pegged its December-quarter revenue to come in at $4.8 billion at midpoint, which would be 23% higher than last year's quarter but lower from the September quarter. Adjusted profit per share is seen at $2.10 at midpoint.
First-quarter revenue rose 29%, to $5.1 billion. Cloud revenue soared 72% and contributed 44% of the total revenue. Client revenue increased 6% and consumer revenue rose 10%.

Pent-up demand from consumers and supply chain constraints have led to a rise in prices for many products. This inflation may continue for another year, so investors should consider looking into inflation-resistant stocks such as EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG), Olin Corporation (NYSE:OLN), and Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO).The global economic recovery has been a boon to businesses and stocks. But underneath these gains hides a potential spoiler, inflation. The reopening of the economy, combined with labor shortages and pent-up consumer demand, driven by government stimulus, has led to product shortages and supply chain obstacles. This resulted in higher product prices and inflation.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures the increase in the price of goods over a period of time, rose more than five percent in the twelve months ending in September. Making matters worse, in a recent speech, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that the global supply chain crisis could remain through 2022. Plus, inflation not only harms corporate margins but eats into investor returns as well. 
However, some companies can generate higher profits when prices rise. That’s why investors should consider companies with higher pricing power. This means they can raise prices faster and pass the costs onto consumers. These stocks can be found in sectors and industries such as energy, chemicals, and consumer staple. EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG), Olin Corporation (OLN), and Coca-Cola Company (KO) are three such stocks worth a look.

The company is also struggling to resolve operational inefficiencies. So, with growing challenges in the aviation industry, and given LUV’s negative profit margins, is it worth betting on the stock at its current price level? Let’s find out.Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV), the world’s largest low-cost carrier, operates in the United States and nearby international markets, providing scheduled air transportation services. The Dallas, Tex.-based company operated a fleet of 718 Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 aircraft and serviced 107 destinations in 40 states as of December 31, 2020.

Though the aviation industry is steadily climbing out of its pandemic blues, concerns over air travel's contribution to climate change and rising oil prices threaten to stifle the sector's growth.
In addition, LUV’s operational inefficiencies and poor profitability could cause its share price to retreat further in the near term.

The stock is quite attractive from a variety of perspectives including its drone delivery pilot program. Read on to learn more.Mesa Air Group (MESA) is a regional airliner that operates a fleet of 146 airplanes with nearly 400 daily trips to 102 cities, primarily in the Southern and Western parts of the US and Mexico. Most of its business comes through operating agreements with American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Air (UAL).
Due to the pandemic, airline stocks had been one of the hardest-hit sectors over the past 18 months. Within the airline industry, I believe that investors should favor regional airlines as they should see their revenues bounce back first. This is because business travel and international travel will be the slowest segments to recover, while the fastest are vacations travel and people visiting family and friends.
Despite this massive catalyst, MESA remains quite cheap relative to its peers and the broader market. Further, MESA was able to get through the pandemic without taking on significant amounts of debt or issuing equity that would be dilutive in the coming years. Over the last few months, MESA’s stock price has declined along with other travel stocks as it became clear that case counts were once again on the rise and the Delta Variant was going to impede the economy’s reopening and return to normal.

""As the appetite for ownership and digital assets continues to grow, we believe Cboe can play a guiding role in shaping the trajectory of this revolutionary market.""
The company plans to work with regulators to gain approval for margin futures and other derivatives products for cryptocurrencies, to expand ErisX, executives on the call said. 
In the third quarter, Cboe earned $1.45 per share on an adjusted basis, which was a penny above analysts' expectations, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
While volumes were up nearly across the board, Cboe's proprietary index options and volatility products such as the VIX volatility index stood out.
Average daily volume for VIX futures was up 29% year-over-year, VIX options were up 32%, and SPX options rose 39%. 
Chicago-based Cboe, long established in North America and Europe, recently bought Chi-X Asia, an alternative market operator, to expand into Japan and Australia. 

That deal, which closed in late June, drove a 53% increase in revenue at the company's Europe and Asia Pacific segment. 
Cboe's total revenue, excluding costs, rose 27% to $369.5 million.

(Reuters) - MAANG? MANGA? Or MAMATA? 
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)'s rebranding to Meta Platforms has launched a search for a new name for the high-flying FAANG group that also includes Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
Facebook on Thursday announced it is now called Meta Platforms https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebooks-zuckerberg-kicks-off-its-virtual-reality-event-with-metaverse-vision-2021-10-28 as the social media company shifts to building the ambitious ""metaverse"", a shared virtual environment. The name change comes after a damaging whistleblower report and criticism from lawmakers and regulators over its market power.
The most popular suggestion on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) for the tech-related heavyweight group was MAANG https://twitter.com/AshishB1603/status/1453990861851615232 -- where FAANG's ""F"" is replaced with ""M"". Some users also rearranged the letters to MANGA https://twitter.com/LifeProgressYT/status/1453978060613509128, referring to Japanese comic books.
The elite FAANG stocks have a combined market capitalization of about $7.416 trillion so far this year, up from about $5.8 trillion last year.
Several Twitter users also proposed to reshuffle the group to add  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) - which is competing with Apple for the most valuable U.S.-listed company - as well as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, which joined the elite trillion-dollar market value club just this week.
With the reshuffle, some users came up with MAMATA https://twitter.com/blitzkreigm/status/1453914779039383553 - that would drop Netflix, which has the smallest market cap compared with the rest of the group at $299 billion, and use an ""A"" for Alphabet, whose search engine Google gave the FAANGs their ""G"".
MAMATA - consisting of Microsoft, Apple, Meta, Amazon, Tesla and Alphabet - have a combined market cap of about $10 trillion. They make up a quarter of the S&P 500's weight, compared with the legacy FAANG group's nearly 20%.

""These handful of stocks (FAANG) have reigned for quite some time, and it may be with the beginning of taper, rates slowly rising and inflation... that these tech long duration assets may become less valuable,"" said Tom Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital in New York.
Shares of Meta Platforms rose about 2% in early trading and will get a new ticker, MVRS, on Dec. 1.

BEIJING/SYDNEY (Reuters) - China's three biggest airlines on Friday posted wider third-quarter losses than in the previous quarter as a resurgence of local COVID-19 cases drove a sharp decline in domestic travel and international borders remained closed.
The losses highlighted one of the consequences of the country's policy of seeking to eliminate COVID-19 within its borders. Each time there is an outbreak, flight numbers fall sharply before rebounding once cases are controlled.
The fourth quarter is facing similar though so far less severe issues. This week's scheduled airline capacity in China is 4.8% lower than last week because of minor outbreaks, according to data firm OAG.
Beijing-based Air China (OTC:AIRYY) Ltd, the country's flagship carrier, said its net loss attributable to shareholders rose to 3.5 billion yuan ($547 million) in the third quarter from 578 million yuan in the second quarter, taking the nine-month net loss to 10.3 billion yuan.
China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) saw its net loss grow to 3.0 billion yuan from 1.4 billion yuan in the second quarter. The total loss to shareholders amounted to 8.2 billion yuan in the first three quarters. 
China Southern Airlines widened its loss to 1.4 billion yuan from 682 million yuan in the second quarter for a nine-month total shortfall of 6.1 billion yuan. 
The Guangzhou-based carrier said it aims to replenish its capital by raising up to 4.5 billion yuan via A-share private placement and HK$1.8 billion via H-share private placement. 
A resurgence of COVID-19 cases since late July involving local airports and tour groups has been a substantial setback to the domestic travel market. 
China's air passenger traffic dropped 51.5% in August from a year ago, before recovering to a decline of 24.7% in September, official data showed. The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) has said it is studying more measures to help airlines financially. 
The lacklustre state of the travel market has also led some Chinese airlines to roll out ""all you can fly"" promotional deals in the past few weeks to stimulate demand.
With the Chinese market tepid, there appears to be little urgency for the CAAC to certify Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX planes, which it grounded more than two years ago over two fatal crashes.
Sources told Reuters that chances are growing that Chinese certification will slip to next year.
Boeing executives said in an earnings call on Wednesday that a third of about 370 undelivered MAX airplanes in storage are for Chinese customers and that the company hopes to resume deliveries in China in the first quarter of next year.
Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said on Thursday there had been ""ups and downs"" in deliveries to China depending on the country's COVID-19 situation and willingness of customers to travel to pick up their planes.

""We've had some challenges in September from that perspective,"" he told analysts.

Investing.com – Gilead Sciences stock (NASDAQ:GILD) fell more than 4% Friday as the maker of remdesivir said sales of non-Covid drugs would be lower in 2021 than earlier forecast.
The company said the pandemic is affecting its business longer than it expected to and was thus lowering its expectations from sales of non-Covid drugs. Excluding Veklury, the brand name Gilead uses to market its patented Covid treatment remdesivir, total product sales are seen around $21.5 billion, lower than the midpoint $21.8 billion it saw earlier.
Sales of Veklury are seen higher now, and the company thus raised its overall outlook.
The company now sees total product sales at $26.15 billion compared to the previous forecast of $24.7 billion.
Gilead now expects to repay $4.75 billion of debt this year, significantly exceeding its prior guidance or paying down at least $4 billion.
Robust sales of remdesivir, arguably one of the few drugs effective against the virus, propelled its third-quarter sales by 13%, to $7.4 billion.

441,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2021 10:05AM ET</span>","Banco BPM, BPER shares plunge on fading M&A appeal","By Andrea Mandala and Valentina Za
MILAN (Reuters) -Shares in mid-sized Italian banks Banco BPM and BPER Banca fell sharply on Friday, hit by reduced appeal to potential suitors after Italy proposed to cap tax incentives for mergers at 500 million euros ($581 million).
Shares in both Banco BPM and BPER fell 7%, underperforming Italy's banking sector index which was down 0.8% in afternoon trade due to falling Italian government bond prices.
The two banks have been at the centre of M&A speculation after another mid-tier player, UBI, was snapped up by heavyweight Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) last year.
The M&A allure was further boosted by tax incentives for mergers Italy has introduced to ease a sale of state-owned Monte dei Paschi. 
A draft of next year's budget seen by Reuters on Thursday showed Rome planned to extend the current incentives by six months to mid-2022 but would introduce a new 500 million euro ceiling for the benefit.
The new threshold only fits the need of rescue candidate Banca Carige whose shares rose 2%.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts calculated that the proposed changes reduced by eight times the capital boost in a potential tie-up between UniCredit and Banco BPM.
""A hypothetical deal between UniCredit and Banco BPM would see the biggest reduction in ... benefits among all potential combinations in Italy,"" they wrote.
Seen as the perfect geographical fit for UniCredit thanks to its roots in wealthy Lombardy, Banco BPM has seen its shares gain 51% so far this year, against the sector's 35% rise.
After UniCredit on Sunday walked away from talks with the government to rescue Monte dei Paschi, investors' attention had refocused on Banco BPM as a possible partner for UniCredit.
But UniCredit CEO Andrea Orcel on Thursday said he did not see the tax breaks as a big M&A incentive due to the fee banks pay under the scheme to convert deferred tax assets (DTAs) stemming from past losses into tax credits.
A source close to the matter had said 80% of the DTAs UniCredit could have used under a tie-up with Banco BPM were its own.
Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY) Securities on Friday cut its recommendation on both Banco BPM and BPER Banca to neutral.
""The changes in the budget law would not be favourable for Banco BPM and BPER. With respect to Banco BPM we reckon it could lose its speculative appeal as potential takeover target of UniCredit ... and would see the around 1 billion euro DTA incentive halved in a deal with BPER,"" they said.
Banco and BPER have discussed a tie-up in the past and failed to reach an agreement, with BPER now seen more likely to opt for a merger with Popolare di Sondrio after BPER's top shareholder Unipol bought a stake in Sondrio.

While earnings releases for the third quarter look strong overall, they are not as high as the last two quarters. That is because the first two quarters of this year were being compared to the first two quarters of last year. That was the height of the pandemic.
So, there's no wonder so many companies saw sky-high growth rates. But as we continue to move on from the pandemic, we can't expect that type of growth to continue for so many stocks. Even in the next few quarters, overall earnings growth should slow down compared to quarters where companies have already bounced back. However, some companies are still expected to see sky-high growth in the coming years.

So, let’s discuss these names.The finance and banking sector was hard hit last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Fed’s signal that it will raise benchmark interest rates as soon as 2022 should further drive the financial sector’s growth. With the consumer price index rising 4% year-over-year, the odds of an interest rate hike are good.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mostly lower on Friday, as disappointing results from three market heavyweights cast doubt on the ability of companies to keep on top of rising costs and supply chain problems.
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 20 points or 0.1%, while the S&P 500 was down 0.3% and the NASDAQ composite was down 86 points or 0.6%. 
In early dealings, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock fell 4.5% and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock felt 3.7%, as investors took money off the table in response to figures that fell short of expectations on Thursday evening.
Apple had warned that the supply chain issues which led to a shortfall in sales in the third quarter were, if anything, likely to get worse in the current quarter, its most important of the year. 
Amazon, for its part, was struggling after warning that higher costs, especially for freight and labor, would all but consume its operating profit in the coming quarter.
Starbucks  (NASDAQ:SBUX) stock also fell 7% after warning that it expects a sharp slowdown in same-store sales in its new financial year.
The lack of suitable workers at a time of intense demand is prompting firms to pay up for staff,"" analysts at ING said in a note. ""With labor costs surging the most in years, this will only increase inflation stresses in the economy and heap more pressure on the Fed to accelerate the process of “normalising” monetary policy.""
Figures released earlier by the Commerce Department showed that U.S. personal spending continued to grow in September, though by only 0.6% after a 1.0% rise in August, reflecting what appears likely to be a temporary hit from the Delta variant COVID-19 virus.
Other data showed that inflationary pressures continue to build, with the core personal consumer expenditures basket rising 0.2% on the months, a slight slowdown from 0.3% in August.
Household finances remain in great shape and with household wealth having increased by $26 trillion since 4Q 2019, there is no reason to believe that spending is about to hit the buffers with consumers able to weather a winter storm of higher energy costs,"" ING said.

The smartphone, the product of a $4.5 billion Google investment in Reliance's digital unit last year, will cost 1,999 rupees upfront and users can pay the rest in monthly instalments, Reliance said in a statement.
The device comes with a tweaked Android operating system named Pragati, which means progress, and is aimed at first-time smartphone buyers with features such as quick translations in 10 Indian languages and a voice assistant which can read that text out aloud from the screen.
Google CEO Sundar Pichai said this week that the device partnership with Jio was about investing in local languages, other than English, so that many more Indians can use smartphones.
""So I view it (the phone) as laying the foundation... And, you know, I think over a three- to five-year time frame, it will
end up having a lot of impact,"" Pichai said in Alphabet's third-quarter earnings call. 
The Jio-Google smartphone's pricing will also pose a major challenge to Chinese vendors such as Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) and BBK Electronics, owner of the Realme, Oppo and Vivo brands, which currently dominate an over $2 billion market for sub-$100 smartphones in India, the world's second biggest smartphone market. 
Jio also aims to use the phone to poach 2G users from rivals Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) Idea and Bharti Airtel. 
The smartphone's pricing could, however, push it out of the reach of a significant chunk of users of basic feature phones, said Navkendar Singh of tech researcher IDC India, dampening Reliance boss and tycoon billionaire Mukesh Ambani's ambitious plan to make India ""2G free"".

""This is not affordable... Jio is expecting a feature phone or 2G user to almost quadruple their telco spend per month,"" Singh told Reuters. ""That doesn't mean this won't sell, it will, but this misses the affordability mark by a mile.""

Investing.com – Stocks of  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) each rose by around 2% in Friday’s premarket as surging energy prices in booming economies delivered record third-quarter earnings.
Both the companies had reported losses in the same period a year ago and comfortably beat July through September sales and profit estimates.
High demand, supply chain issues and an OPEC+ bent on not racing to raise production translated into high crude and gas prices in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere.
Crude prices have more than doubled in a year, with U.S prices hitting a high of $76 per barrel in September, mostly trading above $68 through the quarter.
As supplies made their way, refineries also worked at optimum capacities, churning out crude derivatives to meet soaring demand. Integrated energy companies like Exxon and Chevron with both upstream and downstream operations benefited the most. 
Exxon, a larger market cap company of the two, earned $6.8 billion after a $680 million loss in the 2020 September quarter. Revenue rose 60%, to $73.78 billion, in its strongest results since 2017.
All the company's three business delivered higher returns within the backdrop of a recovering global economy, Chief Executive Darren Woods said in prepared remarks. The company plans to spend $10 billion on share repurchases through 2023 and aims to resume the exercise next year.
Robust international performance pushed Chevron's operating profit from oil and gas production to $5.13 billion, from just $235 million a year ago. Total net profit was $6.1 billion. Revenue soared 83%, to $44.7 billion.

Cruise ships have been sailing from U.S. ports again since late June with mostly vaccinated guests and crew, but some onboard cases and a spike in COVID-19 infections have raised worries about the industry's fortunes in the near term.
Regular testing has helped cruise lines ensure isolated cases of the novel coronavirus do not become a full-blown outbreak, even as the response to resumption of U.S. cruising has been mixed.
Royal Caribbean's total revenue was about $457 million in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, versus estimates of $567 million, according to Refinitiv IBES. The Celebrity Cruises parent had recorded a negative revenue of $33.7 million a year earlier as it reversed previously recorded income due to refunds and cancellations.
Adjusted net loss was $4.91 per share, compared with estimates of $4.41. Passenger ticket revenue was $280.2 million, compared with estimates of $498.8 million.
Analysts, however, expect pent-up demand and strong household savings to aid the recovery of the cruise industry. Royal Caribbean said on Friday booking volumes improved after the Delta variant had caused a slowdown during the summer.
Royal Caribbean, which became the first major cruise operator to resume operations from U.S. ports in June, said sailings for 2022 have been booked within historical ranges and pricing remains strong throughout the year.

""As cases have come down, demand has come surging back. Consumers are showing their resilience and desire to vacation,"" Chief Financial Officer Jason Liberty said.
Shares fell 1% in premarket trading.

453,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2021 08:32AM ET</span>",Volkswagen gets reality check after Tesla's week of milestones,"By Christoph Steitz
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - It's been a sobering week for Herbert Diess' electric vehicle ambitions.
While Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) joined the trillion-dollar club, received a landmark order from Hertz and set a new sales record in Europe, the Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) chief presented a sales and deliveries outlook cut and a drop in quarterly profits that drove home one point: dethroning Elon Musk as the king of electric vehicles (EV) has got a lot harder.
""The recent achievements of Tesla are sending a clear message,"" Diess told analysts during a call on third-quarter results on Thursday that ended up being mainly about Tesla.
""We have to prepare for a new phase of competition.""
A long-time admirer of Musk, Diess this year cranked up the pressure and outlined plans - including setting up six large battery factories in Europe - aimed at overtaking VW's U.S. rival as the world's top EV seller by 2025.
But a chronic semiconductor shortage has slowed Volkswagen's progress, laying bare the disadvantage volume car makers have compared with luxury rivals that sell fewer vehicles.
And with Tesla worth almost eight times as much as VW while selling just 5% of the cars, and its Model 3 becoming the first-ever EV to lead monthly European sales, at this stage it's more about keeping up, not catching up.
""They're gapping away in terms of their gross margins. They seem to have a structurally better access to chips. They seem to have a structurally better access to batteries,"" Patrick Hummel, head of European and U.S. Auto & Mobility Research at UBS, said during the call with Diess.
To make matters worse, Musk will soon start producing cars at Tesla's state-of-the-art plant in Gruenheide near Berlin, taking the battle for global car dominance to Germany, where some of the first automobiles were invented.
Diess, 63, who has steered the carmaker out of its Dieselgate emissions cheating scandal, said this will force local heavyweights to significantly raise their game to stop falling further behind.
""Tesla Gruenheide is for us for sure a new reference, setting new benchmarks when it comes to speed, productivity, also lean management and we have to adjust ourselves to that,"" he said during a call with reporters.
KEEP YOUR FRIENDS CLOSE, BUT YOUR ENEMIES CLOSER
Diess, who years ago got an offer to lead Tesla, has repeatedly singled out Musk's success at the EV pioneer which has disrupted the auto industry's established ways and whose $1 trillion valuation dwarfs that of Volkswagen.
Even though Volkswagen's shares are up 28% so far this year, its current valuation of around 121 billion euros ($141 billion) is a long way from the 200 billion Diess believes the company, which includes luxury brands Porsche and Audi, is worth.
Diess, who became Volkswagen's CEO in 2018, even invited Musk to speak to his managers this month, seen as a move to put pressure on senior leadership to move more quickly to catch up with the U.S. carmaker.
A central part of that push will be Volkswagen's Trinity project, under which the carmaker wants to build a flagship EV sedan at its Wolfsburg plant from 2025/26 and turn the factory into a challenger to Tesla's Gruenheide site.
This plan includes cutting the time it takes to assemble EVs to about 10 hours, Volkswagen Chief Financial Officer Arno Antlitz told Reuters, about the same time it takes Tesla to build its Model 3.
It's also clear that this will mean fewer jobs, which carries the risk of lengthy and painful battles with labour representatives, who traditionally have wielded significant power at the world's second biggest carmaker.
""We have to prepare manufacturing for much reduced labour in some of the lines. We have to prepare for less complexity, for more speed, line speed,"" Diess said.
Earlier this week, Volkswagen's new labour boss took Diess to task for being too focused on investors and not invested enough in the workforce, which is concerned that the EV switch will cost tens of thousands of jobs.
CFO Antlitz said that even though both management and workers may agree on the need to overhaul Wolfsburg he acknowledged that finding common ground could be challenging.
""Of course there's the question, as usual, on 'how do we get there' but I'm convinced that we share this same vision with the works council.""
When asked for comment, a spokesperson for Diess referred to his remarks made on Thursday. Spokespeople for Tesla in Germany were not immediately available for comment.

454,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2021 08:26AM ET</span>",UK watchdog to investigate CD&R's $10 billion deal for Morrisons,"LONDON (Reuters) -Supermarket group Morrisons must be run as an independent business while Britain's competition regulator reviews its 7 billion pound ($9.7 billion) takeover by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R), the watchdog said.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) issued an Initial Enforcement Order (IEO) on Friday, prohibiting U.S. private equity group CD&R from integrating Morrisons with its operations or transferring ownership of the company until the deal is cleared. 
Morrisons did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the order, which the CMA said does not prohibit completion of the deal provided that CD&R and Morrisons observe the restrictions it has set out.
CD&R said it looks forward to ""working constructively with the CMA to address any questions they may have"".
The CMA is gathering evidence before formally launching an investigation into the takeover. Once that happens, it will have 40 days to decide whether to clear the deal with or without remedies or move to a longer investigation.
IEOs are routinely used when regulators scrutinise takeovers to ensure that any decision to block a deal or demand remedies is not thwarted by the integration of the companies.
A rare case of non-compliance resulted in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) receiving a $70 million fine this month over its purchase of GIF platform Giphy.
CD&R beat Softbank-owned Fortress Investment Group to buy Morrisons in an auction. Morrisons shareholders have backed the takeover.
There has been speculation that, through the deal, CD&R could combine its 918 Motor Fuel Group (MFG) fuel forecourts with the 339 owned by Morrisons, opening Morrisons convenience stores on the sites. 

The proposed takeover has been the highest profile among a series of transactions where U.S. investment firms have targeted British companies because of relatively low valuations since Brexit.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Packaging and logistics companies may soon be able to cooperate on green projects without any fear of flouting cartel rules, EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said on Friday.
Under EU cartel rules, companies that collude to illegally fix prices or share markets can face fines up to 10% of their global turnover.
Vestager made the comments during an event in Helsinki.
""Consider an established market with some bad environmental habits – maybe to do with packaging or logistics. To break out of that rut, companies in that market might need to cooperate, in order to get to a better, more sustainable equilibrium,"" she said.
""In such cases, the Commission want to provide legal certainty that they will not fall foul of the EU's rules on cartels,"" Vestager said.
Vestager said she would adopt a communication soon on the ongoing reviews and updates of various competition rules.

A Commission spokesperson said the EU antitrust chief will give guidance on EU competition policy tentatively scheduled for Nov. 17.
Vestager will shortly adopt looser state aid rules to allow EU countries to subsidise energy, climate and environment projects in line with the European Commission's goal of greening the bloc's economy.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Volvo Cars shares surged 22% on their Stockholm market debut on Friday after wrapping up Europe's biggest IPO of the year so far, in a boost for new issues markets and carmakers' vision of an electric future. 
The Gothenburg-based company cut the size of its listing and priced it at the bottom of a previously-announced range UPDATE 3-Volvo Cars gives itself $18 bln price tag as cuts IPO size - Reuters News on Monday, valuing it at just over $18 billion and making it Sweden's second largest listing yet.
But the successful deal and strong market reaction - which propels the valuation to about $22 billion - is a lift for a European automotive industry that has embarked on a challenging transition towards electric vehicles (EVs). 
It also shows that while the euphoria over initial public offerings (IPO) in the first half of 2021 is over, the market is open for new listings of big companies with a story to tell.
Volvo Cars Chief Executive Håkan Samuelsson said the listing showed a recognition of its transition plans, adding it would be key for Volvo to demonstrate it is on track to be the ""fastest transformer"".
""There's a much bigger interest in the market to invest in electric car makers than in the conventional ones. So we better do what we said we would,"" he told Reuters in an interview.
Shares in the carmaker, which is majority owned by China's Geely Holding, were trading at 64.70 Swedish crowns ($7.59) at 1057 GMT, after being priced at 53 crowns in the IPO.
POLESTAR
Apart from Volvo's commitment to becoming a purely electric carmaker by 2030, it also has a 49% stake in EV venture Polestar https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/ev-maker-polestar-go-public-20-billion-valuation-via-spac-sources-2021-09-26, which said in September it would go public through a $20 billion deal.
Samuelsson said Polestar had a ""good valuation"". 
""They are already electric... showing in a way what the potential would be for Volvo if this (the transformation) is done in the right way.""
A source familiar with Volvo's transaction said the outcome of this week's IPO was good, even though investors had pushed back and forced Volvo to price at the bottom of the announced range.
""The company had to compromise on size and the governance structure. They were hoping for a read across on Polestar, but they were clearly not getting that,"" the source said, requesting anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to the press. 
Concerns over how much control Geely will retain over Volvo, problems in the global supply chain and worries carmakers could be caught in trade wars involving China also curbed investor enthusiasm.
Samuelsson said the global semiconductor shortage was still problematic, but going in the right direction. 
""In the fourth quarter it looks better, though we will not see the volumes we had last year."" he said, adding the situation would hopefully further normalise next year.
Geely chairman Eric Li said that when Geely acquired Volvo, its goal had been to send ""the tiger back to the mountains"".

""Now our goal is to give that tiger wings and let it soar,"" he said in a pre-recorded video during a webcast opening ceremony on Friday.

Investing.com – Starbucks stock (NASDAQ:SBUX) fell 5.4% in Friday’s premarket trading as the coffee brewer said it expect a significant slowdown in comparable same-store sales growth in the current financial year, after a weak fourth quarter in China, its biggest market outside the U.S.
According to Reuters, the company expects global comparable sales to grow in the high single digits in its current financial year.
Sales in the world’s second largest economy declined 7% in the three months through September as local governments reimposed curbs to contain the spread of a resurgent coronavirus. This affected operations as well as visits to its stores.
The company sees global comparable sales growing by less than 10% in the current financial year, down from 20% in 2021. Operating margin is seen lower at 17% as the company grapples with rising labor costs, higher rentals and costlier raw materials. The company has a target of 18%-19% operating margin by 2023.
Traders ignored the coffee chain’s commitment to a program of $20 billion in share repurchases and dividends over the next three years.
CEO Kevin Johnson told Reuters the company is hiking prices and will continue to in an inflationary environment.
The drop in China sales offset the 22% same-store sales growth in the U.S. Overall, same-store sales rose 17% and revenue rose 31% to $8.1 billion in the fourth quarter but that wasn’t enough to beat estimates.
Adjusted profit of $1 just about met estimates.
The company will start to raise wages in phases from January, it said in a note.
The retail chain will open 2,000 net new locations globally in 2022, up from 1,173 in 2021, about 75% of them outside the U.S.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's biggest airline, ANA Holdings Inc, said it expected to report an operating loss in the current financial year, down from an earlier prediction of a profit, and that it would reduce staff numbers by 20% within five years.
The airline on Friday announced the plans to eliminate 9,000 roles through attrition and retirement as it steps up digital interaction with customers in an investor presentation after reporting a weaker-than-expected first half result due to travel curbs.
The operating loss of 116 billion yen ($1.02 billion) for the six months ended Sept. 30, however, was narrower than a 280.95 billion yen loss a year earlier due to cost-cutting.
ANA, which has reported losses for seven consecutive quarters, said it expected to return to a profit in the fourth quarter due to a forecast recovery in passenger numbers.
But for the 12 months ended March 2022, it expects to report an operating loss of 125 billion yen, down from its earlier guidance for an operating profit of 28 billion.
Before the update, analysts had estimated full-year operating profit of 89.7 billion yen, based on the average of eight forecasts, Refinitiv data showed.
""The revised forecast reflects the findings that projected second-half revenue will not be sufficient to cover lack of revenue during the first half of the fiscal year,"" the airline said in a statement.
Japan lifted a state of emergency at the end of last month that had been in force across much of the country. While domestic tourism is seen slowly recovering, there is no sign that international travel, particularly inbound tourism, will return in a big way anytime soon.
The country is still under strict regulations preventing most non-resident foreigners, including tourists and business travellers, from entering.
ANA expects domestic passenger numbers to recover to 85% of pre-COVID-19 levels by March but international passengers to reach only 30% of pre-pandemic levels by then.
Companies, notably in tourism and travel, lost out as the Tokyo 2020 Olympics were held after a year's delay this past summer with no spectators or international tourists. 
The event had been initially seen as a tourism windfall for Japan, which in recent years had been ramping up efforts to draw more international tourists to help kickstart a moribund domestic economy.

463,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2021 07:07AM ET</span>",How Apple is gaining smartphone customers during a chip shortage,"By Aniruddha Ghosh and Subrat Patnaik
(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is eating into its rivals' smartphone market share as the iPhone maker navigates through a global chip crunch better than other mobile phone makers, according to data providers.
Higher iPhone shipments helped Apple gain at least 3% market share in global smartphones in the third quarter, even as overall shipments shrunk by about 6% due to the chip shortage, according to data from market research firms Counterpoint, IDC and Canalys.
Given how closely tech companies guard smartphone sales data, the shipment figures are the best indication of who customers prefer.
""We are expecting another massive quarter for Apple and our expectation is they'll take a similar 20% shipment share in calendar year Q4,"" Counterpoint analyst Tarun Pathak said.
Apple has weathered the supply crunch better than many other companies due to its massive purchasing power and long-term supply agreements with chip vendors even though iPhone 13 production hit a snag due to factory closures in Asia and high demand in the second half of the year.
""Shortages are worst at the low-end, so Apple is less exposed than many of its competitors because it skews heavily toward premium,"" Ben Stanton, analyst at Canalys, told Reuters.
The shipments of pricier phones drove revenue to a record $100 billion in the third quarter, according to Counterpoint.

The Cupertino, California-based company's supply prowess was displayed in China https://www.reuters.com/technology/huawei-spin-off-brand-honor-enters-top-three-china-shipment-ranking-research-2021-10-28 where it posted a staggering 83% annual sales growth last quarter, remaining one of top choices for big spenders in the world's second-largest economy.
Apple increased shipments in the third quarter, while market leader Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) and rival Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) Corp saw a drop as customers were lured by the price cuts to the iPhone 12 series and the faster processor and bigger camera in the latest iPhone 13 devices.

The group predicted ""slightly"" positive earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) in 2021, after posting a 1.7 billion euro ($1.98 billion) loss last year.
Shares were up nearly 5% in morning trading. Analysts said the quarterly results were a positive surprise, fuelled by strong demand and cost cuts. 
The company aims to cut around 14,000 jobs - nearly a fifth of its workforce - across its French and Dutch arms by the end of next year.
A reopening of U.S. borders to vaccinated Europeans ahead of the Christmas holidays helped it to forecast positive EBITDA for the last three months of 2021, cementing a profit of nearly 800 million euros during the late summer.
The number of passengers booking flights over the quarter nearly doubled from 2020 but remained at about half of pre-pandemic levels. 
Finance chief Steven Zaat said the results were a ""very good signal for the fourth quarter, where we see stronger bookings every week.""
The airline estimated its capacity would reach 70% to 75% of 2019 levels in the final quarter, but did not give guidance for 2022 because of uncertainty on reopenings in China and Japan.
The rebound helped Air France-KLM reduce its net debt to 8.1 billion euros by the end of September, down 2.9 billion euros from the end of 2020.
Last year, the group received 10.4 billion euros in loans backed by France and the Netherlands - its two biggest shareholders - and has for months discussed a recapitalisation plan to lower debts.
It has pledged to repay 500 million euros of a state-backed loan in the coming weeks, and the remaining 3.5 billion euros in three instalments between 2023 and 2025.

The company is also considering another rights issue under good market conditions, six months after an equity raise saw the French government more than double its stake to just under 30%.

469,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2021 06:36AM ET</span>",Trump media deal partner advisers were reprimanded by the SEC,"By Echo Wang and Krystal Hu
(Reuters) - Donald Trump's social media deal partner took advice from a group of China-based businessmen who in the past tried their hand at businesses ranging from Spanish wine to Korean women's fashion, and at one point had their “integrity” questioned by U.S. regulators. 
The financiers - Abraham Cinta, Sergio Camarero, Carlos Lopez and Jesus Emilio Hoyos Quintero - are managing partners of ARC Group Ltd, a Shanghai-based investment bank listed in a regulatory filing as a financial adviser to Digital World Acquisition Corp, the shell company merging with the former U.S. President’s venture. 
The chief executive of Digital World is Patrick Orlando, who has acted as the special purpose acquisition company's (SPAC) public face. Digital World touted ARC in one filing as adviser that had contacts in government, corporate, investment and advisory worlds and would help it ""get access to quality deal pipeline."" 
A review of regulatory filings shows that while ARC has been actively involved in the creation of SPACs, especially over the past two years, its executives ran into trouble with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2017. The regulator sued to block the initial public offerings of three companies where the four men had leading roles, accusing them of misrepresenting their connections, misstating the nature and scope of their businesses and failing to cooperate with regulators. 
The executives did not show up at hearings, and a judge entered default judgment in the regulator's favor, regulatory filings show. The result was a rare so-called stop order, which prohibited the executives from taking their companies – Go EZ Corp, Arc Lifestyle Group Inc and Nova Smart Solutions Inc - public. 
Go EZ sold smartphone accessories, Arc Lifestyle sold products such as designer apparel, Spanish wine and olive oil, and Nova’s business included drone development and corporate staffing service, according to the filing. 
Respondents are in default for failing to file an answer, appear at the hearing, or otherwise defend the proceeding,"" wrote Cameron Elliot, an SEC Administrative Law Judge at the time. Their actions ""call into question management's integrity."" 
Elliot, who is now an administrative law judge at the U.S. International Trade Commission, told Reuters he did not have any additional information about the case. 
Camarero, one of the managing partners of ARC Group, was CEO of Nova Smart. In an email to Reuters, he said he cooperated with regulators, taking their calls and providing them with his email communications. But when they asked him to fly to Washington, he couldn't for ""personal and business reasons."" 
""The process was getting very troublesome and consuming my time,"" he wrote in an email. He said he decided to try to run the company privately but eventually had to liquidate it. ""Obviously, I was a collateral damage,"" he said. 
In the ruling, the judge noted that Camarero had made documents available and participated in phone calls but declined to provide testimony in the United States. Cinta, the CEO of Arc Group, Lopez and Quintero did not respond to requests for comment. An SEC spokesperson also did not respond to a request for comment. 
Reuters could not determine what Trump or his company, Trump Media & Technology Group, knew of the ARC Group bankers' involvement in Digital World or their past troubles with regulators. 
Trump Media & Technology Group and Digital World did not respond to requests for comment. Orlando, who has worked on at least three other special purpose acquisition companies with ARC, also did not respond to requests for comment. 
Stop orders, such as the one against the ARC executives, are extremely rare; only five have been issued by the SEC since the case against the ARC executives four years ago. 
Christina Thoma, a partner at law firm Mayer Brown LLP and former SEC senior adviser who was not involved in the Trump SPAC deal, called the stop order an ""extreme"" step. 
""Most enforcement actions brought against companies for having materially false or misleading disclosure don't result in a stop order, as the SEC has the ability to seek different penalties,"" she said. Perrie Weiner, securities litigation attorney with Baker McKenzie, said the judgment could become an issue if the executives ever became subject to another SEC probe or investor lawsuits. 
However, Weiner noted that the judgment against the four dealmakers was not a finding of fact. ""It’s like if you get a moving violation and don't show up for your court hearing, and they issue a judgment against you for non-appearance and non-cooperation."" 
GLOBAL EXPANSION 
Regulatory filings and investor presentations prepared by ARC Group show that the firm has thrived in recent years, helping clients overcome investment barriers into the United States that Trump erected for Chinese investors. 
It went from one to 15 offices around the world, completing $1.8 billion of deals, according to its website. The firm also said it created and advised more than 30 SPACs, the vast majority of them in the United States, according to an investor presentation. 

Digital World shares are up more than 600% since the deal a week ago, and ARC Group seized on the rally to promote its business in China. It sent a Mandarin translation last week of a Reuters story on the merger to subscribers of its channel on Chinese messaging app WeChat. 
""Trump's company merges with our SPAC, shares jumped 400%!"" it wrote.

470,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2021 06:32AM ET</span>",Airlines to cut int'l passenger flights to and from China for new season,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China will allow 408 scheduled international passenger flights to and from the country per week in the winter season ending in March next year, down from 644 in the summer season, China's aviation regulator said on Friday.
That is down 21.1% from a year ago when international travel remained heavily depressed due to the surging COVID-19 pandemic.
The announcement will likely douse hopes for any immediate reopening of Chinese borders as more and more countries reopen their economies. China has so far adopted a zero-COVID approach towards sporadic domestic outbreaks, which has far-reaching implications for the Chinese economy. 
""The shift of season for international passenger flights will continue to be in line with the relevant requirements from epidemic prevention and control policy and transportation support,"" said the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) in a statement on its website.
It added that scheduled international flights, which could be reduced by later cancellations, for the new season would be 2.2% of pre-COVID levels. 
The CAAC said in August that weekly international flights were about 2% of 2019 levels, as more flights were suspended amid a rising number of imported COVID-19 cases. 
The total number of international flights, mostly cargo flights, stood at 6,172 per week, CAAC said on Friday. 
The CAAC slashed international flights in March 2020 to allay concerns over rising coronavirus infections. A so-called ""Five One"" policy allows mainland carriers to fly just one flight a week on one route to any country and foreign airlines to operate just one flight a week to China.

The CAAC has tweaked the policy with flight suspensions or capacity caps for airlines if a certain number of passengers are found to have been infected with COVID-19, or adding flights if an airline does not import any cases.
Air China (OTC:AIRYY) in September told analysts it expects the CAAC to keep curbs on international passenger flights throughout the first half of 2022.

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) -Investors clamoring for Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) Markets to host shiba inu, a meme-inspired cryptocurrency that has soared in value this month, may need to bide their time as the app-based brokerage says it is in no hurry to list new currencies and analysts expect revenue growth to come from elsewhere. 
Shiba inu is a spinoff of dogecoin, itself born as a satire of a cryptocurrency frenzy in 2013, and has almost no practical use. Yet its price has rocketed by as much as 1,000% this month, leapfrogging dogecoin to become the world's eighth largest cryptocurrency with a $42 billion market cap. 
The currency's eye-watering rally has Robinhood users demanding a piece of the action.
The No. 1 question https://app.saytechnologies.com/robinhood-2021-q3?filter=all&sort=num_upvotes on Robinhood's Say Technology platform, which crowdsources questions from retail investors prior to the brokerage's earnings call earlier this week, asked when it will add new coins such as shiba inu. 
Separately, an online petition https://www.change.org/p/robinhood-convince-robinhood-they-will-prosper-if-they-list-shiba-inu-coin asking Robinhood to list shiba inu has nearly 400,000 signatures, while #SHIB was trending on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) with a barrage of tweets of ""When #shiba"" aimed at Robinhood.
Investors can buy shiba inu on some cryptocurrency trading platforms, such as Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN). Being able to trade it on Robinhood, which generally has lower fees than its competitors, would allow the company's users to move between crypto, stocks and options on one platform.
The brokerage said this week it plans to wait for more regulatory clarity around any new digital currencies it may list.
Regulators globally have been cracking down on the rapidly expanding cryptocurrency market, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which has said it is scrutinizing several aspects of digital currencies, including the offer and sale of crypto tokens.
Robinhood currently lists seven cryptocurrencies including dogecoin, which made up 62% of its cryptocurrency transaction volume in the second quarter, boosting its results.
The listing of the trendy shiba inu coin could lead to a similar volume spike, but catering to client demands on crypto may come with its own set of risks.
If investors continue seeking out newer coins for the prospect of faster returns, crypto platforms will need to stay on their toes to keep their clients happy, said Mati Greenspan, CEO of crypto advisory and analysis at Quantum (NASDAQ:QMCO) Capital.
""For an exchange that might mean ... relaxing their pathway to acceptance by reducing due diligence and eventually they could end up accidentally listing useless coins, or even scams,"" he said.
At the same time, as a brokerage ""you never want to be the last ... to list a coin, because that's the point at which price typically collapses,"" said Joseph Edwards, head of research at crypto broker Enigma Securities in London. ""So there's something of a game of chicken between these exchanges as a result.""
""Brokers will always chase the trends with regards to facilitating market access to whatever the flavor of the month is ... for the sake of their short-term profitability,"" he said.
Robinhood's revenues from crypto trading have grown by 860% over the last year, as retail investor interest in cryptocurrencies boomed, bring the brokerage millions of new customers. 
But those revenues plunged 78% from the second quarter, the company said earlier this week, far more than the around 35% industry-wide drop in crypto trading volumes. 
Shares of Robinhood tumbled this week after the retail broker reported softer revenue than expected.

Robinhood, which was founded in 2013 with a commission-free model that has become the industry norm, surged in popularity during COVID-19 lockdowns, when sports and most other forms of entertainment were put on hold, and trading in so-called meme stocks became a national pastime among young investors.
Robinhood recently said it will launch crypto wallets early next year, which allow its users to transfer cryptocurrencies to and from their Robinhood accounts, and on Tuesday said more than 1 million people have signed up for the service. Unless dogecoin's price spikes again, and absent the listing of new coins, a successful launch of the crypto wallets is essential to Robinhood's crypto revenues returning to anywhere near their second quarter levels, said Piper Sandler's O'Neill.

472,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2021 06:31AM ET</span>",Evergrande makes coupon payment before Friday deadline - sources,"By Clare Jim, Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Andrew Galbraith
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Developer China Evergrande Group has made an interest payment for an offshore bond before a grace period expired on Friday, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said, narrowly averting a catastrophic default for the second time in a week.
Evergrande, once China's top-selling developer, is reeling under more than $300 billion in liabilities, fuelling worries about the impact of its fate on the world's second-largest economy as well as on global markets.
The property developer, which staved off a default last week by securing $83.5 million for the last-minute payment of interest on a bond, needed to make $47.5 million in coupon payments to bondholders by Friday.
A failure to pay by the Friday deadline would have triggered cross-defaults on all of the company's $19 billion worth of bonds in international capital markets, in what would have been the world's second-largest emerging market corporate debt default.
Evergrande did not respond to Reuters' request for comment. The people declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.
Reuters was not able to determine the source of the funds used to make the interest payments. Bloomberg News reported earlier this week that Chinese authorities had urged Evergrande's founder, Hui Ka Yan, to pay the developer's debts out of his personal wealth.
Shares of Evergrande gave up early gains to fall about 0.8% by late morning on Friday, versus a 0.3% decline in the Hang Seng Index. The Hang Seng Mainland Properties Index fell about 0.9%, while an index of developers' mainland A-shares dropped 3.6%.
Prices of the developer's bonds jumped higher on Friday, with its 11.5% January 2023 bond surging more than 9%, and its 12% January 2024 bond up nearly 8% on the day, data from Duration Finance showed.
That still left them trading at discounts of more than 75% from their face value, with the 2023 bond yielding nearly 190%.
One bondholder said he maintained a negative outlook for the developer despite it making the coupon payment.
""I only think they are buying time at this point,"" the bondholder said.
Evergrande missed coupon payments totalling nearly $280 million on its dollar bonds on Sept. 23, Sept. 29 and Oct. 11, beginning 30-day grace periods for each.
It still has nearly $338 million in other offshore coupon payments coming due in November and December.
The New York Times earlier reported https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/10/28/business/news-business-stock-market that the developer made an interest payment, citing a person speaking on condition of anonymity.
""Evergrande has tried its best to solve liquidity problems, but it's a little bit difficult to gather enough capital to pay all the debt,"" said Cliff Zhao, chief strategist at China Construction Bank (OTC:CICHF) International in Hong Kong.
""I think there (will) be some negotiations between Evergrande and its lenders, so some sort of haircut is still possible. The market still needs some time to digest and to price this in.""
DEBT CRISIS
Evergrande's woes have snowballed for months and its dwindling resources set against its vast liabilities have wiped out 80% of its value, leading some analysts to consider default at some point inevitable.
Even as Evergrande secures funds to make payments, other Chinese developers whose fortunes have been hit by market concerns over Evergrande's debt crisis have slid into formal default.
Fantasia Holdings Group Co Ltd, Sinic Holdings (Group) Co Ltd, China Properties Group Ltd and Modern Land (China) Co Ltd have all defaulted on dollar debt obligations this month.
Other developers with significant dollar debt have proposed extending offshore bond maturities or undertaking debt restructuring in a meeting with regulators, sources have said.
In a meeting with developers this week, China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the State Administration for Foreign Exchange told developers facing large offshore debt maturities to evaluate repayment risk and report difficulties.
The NDRC also implored developers to meet offshore debt obligations, and maintain their reputations and market order.
""Selective defaults in the offshore market are emphatically not acceptable for the authorities, and the NDRC clarification this week should reassure offshore investors that they will be treated fairly alongside onshore investors,"" DBS strategist Wei Liang Chang said in a client note.
Even developers who have not defaulted have seen their share and bond prices walloped. On Friday, Chinese Estates Holdings Ltd said it would book an aggregate loss of HK$1.36 billion in the current fiscal year from the sale of all of its bonds issued by peer Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd.
Concerns over the systemic impact of a default by Evergrande have widened spreads on Chinese high-yield dollar debt to record levels as investors demand higher risk premiums.
Investor worries have also kept the cost of insuring against default on China's sovereign debt elevated. That cost earlier this month touched its highest level since the height of the pandemic in 2020.
BANK EXPOSURE
Founded in Guangzhou in 1996, Evergrande epitomised a freewheeling era of borrowing and building. But that business model has been scuttled by hundreds of new rules designed to curb developers' debt frenzy and promote affordable housing.
Any prospect of Evergrande's demise raises questions over the fate of more than 1,300 real estate projects it has ongoing in some 280 cities.

Bank exposure to developers is also extensive.
A leaked 2020 document, branded fake by Evergrande but taken seriously by analysts, showed the developer's liabilities extended to more than 128 banks and over 121 non-banking institutions.

Illumina announced on Aug 18 that it had completed its acquisition of Grail even though the Commission, which oversees EU competition policy, had not completed its investigation into the merger. That review is currently set to run until Feb. 4.
The EU order, initially reported by Reuters on Sept 20, is the first imposition of interim measures following an unprecedented early implementation of a takeover, the Commission said. 
The measures provide that Grail be kept separate from Illumina and run by independent managers, that the two companies do not share confidential information, the interactions be kept at arms length and that Grail work on alternative options in case the Commission rejected the merger.

The companies can be fined if they do not comply.
The Commission said the measures were designed to prevent the ""potentially irreparable detrimental impact"" of the transaction on competition and possible irreversible integration of companies, pending the outcome of its investigation.

Investing.com – Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock fell nearly 5% in Friday’s premarket trading as the online retail giant warned it could end up making nothing in operating profit in the current quarter as the company grapples unprecedented costs to meet demand in a busy holiday season.
Operating income in the third quarter was $4.9 billion.
CEO Andy Jassy said the company expects to incur several billion dollars of additional costs in its consumer business as it grapples with labor shortages, higher wages, global supply chain issues and costlier freight and shipping costs.
The company’s dire forecast comes even as it predicted at least $130 billion of sales during the period.
Sales could touch $140 billion while operating profit would hit not more than $3 billion, less than half 2020 quarter’s $6.9 billion, according to the company’s projections for the October-December quarter.
Just about every section of the company has benefited from the pandemic-driven demand as more consumers shopped online for clothes, gadgets and books and corporates sought its Cloud services to run their operations in a world scared to step outside. That scorching growth was going to slow at some point, but before it does the company is struggling with labor and supply challenges, both at its own end and at its customers.
Net sales in the third quarter rose 15% to $110.8 billion in the third quarter. Net profit of $3.2 billion was about half of last time’s. Both fell short of estimates.
Amazon's Cloud computing division, where it competes with other giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), grew 39% to $16.11 billion.

476,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2021 06:22AM ET</span>",UK mortgage approvals hit 14-month low as tax break ends,"By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) -British banks and building societies granted the fewest new mortgages for house purchase in more than a year last month as the government prepared to end a tax break on home purchases, Bank of England data showed on Friday.
Consumer lending also slowed more sharply than expected, which is likely to strengthen some analysts' concerns that Britain's rapid economic recovery from COVID-19 lockdowns is levelling off, just as the BoE considers raising interest rates. 
The number of mortgage approvals fell to 72,645 in September from 74,214 the month before, the lowest since July 2020 when the government cut stamp duty land tax for most home purchases to boost sales after a slump at the start of the pandemic.
This tax break was reduced in July and stopped in full at the end of September - before property purchases funded by mortgages approved that month would have time to complete.
However, net mortgage lending for transactions that completed in September surged to 9.524 billion pounds ($13.13 billion), its highest since June, the month before the tax break began to be reduced in England and Northern Ireland.
""The stamp duty holiday has been highly distortionary, causing transactions to be brought forwards and being a major factor behind the frothiness in prices over the past year,"" said Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club.
Official data shows house prices in the United Kingdom in August were almost 15% higher than before the pandemic. The United States, Germany and other countries where demand for living space rose through the pandemic have also seen big rises. 
Mortgage approvals and net mortgage lending in the UK were both higher than economists had forecast in a Reuters poll, but September's increase in net consumer lending was barely half economists' average forecast at 234 million pounds.
Lending rose by 0.1% from August - the smallest monthly rise since March - and was 1.8% below its level a year earlier.
Britain's longest-running consumer confidence survey showed morale sank to an eight-month low in October against a backdrop of sharply rising inflation, higher COVID-19 cases and shortages of fuel at many petrol stations.

""Consumer recovery will become increasingly reliant on households' appetite for borrowing increasing, and on some of the 'excess' savings accumulated over the past 18 months being spent,"" Beck said.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening lower Friday, weighed by disappointing earnings results from tech giants Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), ahead of key inflation data.
At 6:40 AM ET (1040 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 62 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 Futures traded 25 points, or 0.5%, lower, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 149 points, or 0.9%.
The major indices all closed sharply higher on Wall Street Thursday, with the broad-based S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ending at record highs. 
All three averages are on course to post winning weeks, while the S&P 500 is up 6.7% in October, the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained 5.6% and the Nasdaq has rallied 6.9%.
Solid earnings have been behind these strong gains, but the tone turned negative after the close Thursday when weaker than expected quarterly numbers from both Apple and Amazon raised fears about the impact of global supply chain issues on future earnings.
Apple stock slumped 3.5% in premarket trading after Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook warned of a $6 billion hit in the upcoming holiday quarter. Amazon stock dropped nearly 5% after the e-commerce giant commented on higher costs in order to attract workers, severely eating into profits in its most important quarter of the year.
The earnings deluge continues Friday, with big oil in the spotlight.  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) and  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) are due to report third quarter numbers, and should offer up strong revenue gains given the elevated crude prices.
The main economic release Friday is the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, which excludes food and energy costs. This is due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), and is expected to have risen 0.2% month-on-month in September, slightly slower than August’s 0.3%. 
Crude prices edged higher Friday, but were on course for their first weekly drop in months as a near two-month rally prompted by record high gas prices in Europe and China peters out.
Attention now turns to next Thursday’s meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies including Russia, a group called OPEC+. These top producers are expected to stick to their plan to add 400,000 barrels a day of supply each month until April 2022.
By 6:20 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded largely flat at $82.81 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $83.70. Both benchmarks were on track to fall about 1% for the week - the first weekly drop in 10 weeks for WTI and the first in eight weeks for Brent.

479,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2021 06:06AM ET</span>",Third Point set to play long game in pressuring Shell,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
(Reuters) - When investors saw Daniel Loeb's Third Point (NYSE:SPNT) LLC unveil a stake in Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), some were quick to make the comparison to  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM), whose board was challenged this year by another hedge fund, Engine No. 1.
Both oil majors have been under pressure https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/us-congress-puts-big-oil-hot-seat-climate-deception-probe-2021-10-28 to improve financial performance and accelerate their transition away from fossil fuels. Exxon saw three directors unseated when Engine No. 1 won a proxy contest in May.
Yet Third Point plans to follow a different tack, according to people familiar with its plans. It has not put forward any board nominees or threatened the chief executive's job and there are no immediate plans to do so, the sources said.
Instead, the $19 billion fund outlined its suggestions to Shell in a letter to its own investors, making for a low-key introduction of its hopes for the $190 billion oil company.
Third Point's founder, billionaire investor Daniel Loeb, wants the Anglo-Dutch company to separate its oil and gas business from its renewable-energy and liquefied-natural-gas operations. His team has had conversations with the company and Shell was given a heads up on Third Point's announcement, sources familiar with the matter said.
When Shell pushed back on Loeb on Thursday, he did not follow up with a white paper detailing company missteps, as activists often do. He did not unveil a website with videos laying out his case or go on television to discuss the matter.
The strategy echoes the playbook employed at other companies where Third Point pushed for changes, including food company Nestle and entertainment company Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS).
Third Point goes activist on one or maybe two companies a year, largely avoiding the threat of proxy contests in favor of long-term engagement. On Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) Loeb has been known to send encouraging and complimentary messages to CEOs.
This is a dramatic change for Loeb, whose sharp-tongued letters sent to executives years ago have been memorialized on blogs. Despite today's less brash public tactics, Third Point and Loeb often make inroads.
Chip maker  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) named a new CEO in January 2021 after Third Point's investment became public a month earlier. British insurer Prudential (NYSE:PUK) Plc said in January that it would spin off its U.S. business, less than a year after Third Point pushed for such a move in early 2020.
A representative said Loeb was not available for an interview and declined to comment on next steps.
Loeb, who pursues a rigorous yoga routine, founded the firm 25 years ago, a lifetime in the hedge fund industry, and came close to going out of business during the financial crisis. He is one of few founders of older hedge funds who is still firmly in charge, several investors said.

Activism is only one of the firm's strategies, allowing for a longer-term approach, if needed, for results. 
This year, Third Point's roughly 30% gains were largely fueled by its venture-capital investments, and has made money during the pandemic through its structured credit investments.

UDANGUDI, India/TOKYO (Reuters) - On the coastline near India's southern tip, workers toil on a pier carrying a conveyor belt that cuts a mile into the Indian Ocean where the azure waters are deep enough for ships to berth and unload huge cargoes of coal.
The belt will carry millions of tonnes of coal each year to a giant power plant several kilometres inland that will burn the fuel for at least 30 years to generate power for the more than 70 million people that live in India's Tamil Nadu state.
The Udangudi plant is one of nearly 200 coal-fired power stations under construction in Asia, including 95 in China, 28 in India and 23 in Indonesia, according to data from U.S. nonprofit Global Energy Monitor (GEM).
This new fleet will produce planet-warming emissions for decades and is a measure of the challenge world leaders face when they meet for climate talks in Glasgow, where they hope to sound the death knell for coal as a source of power.
Coal use is one of the many issues dividing industrialised and developing countries as they seek to tackle climate change.
Many industrialised countries have been shutting down coal plants for years to reduce emissions. The United States alone has retired 301 plants since 2000. 
But in Asia, home to 60% of the world's population and about half of global manufacturing, coal's use is growing rather than shrinking as rapidly developing countries seek to meet booming demand for power.
More than 90% of the 195 coal plants being built around the world are in Asia, according to data from GEM.
Tamil Nadu is India's second-most industrialised state and is one of the country's top renewable energy producers. But it is also building the most coal-fired plants in the country.
""We cannot depend on just solar and wind,"" a senior official at Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corp told Reuters. 
""You can have the cake of coal and an icing of solar,"" he said, declining to be named as he was not authorised to speak to media.

HOOKED ON COAL
Despite dramatic jumps in renewable energy output, the global economy remains hooked on coal for electricity. In Asia, coal's share of the generation mix is twice the global average - especially in surging economies such as India.
In 2020, more than 35% of the world's power came from coal, according to the BP (NYSE:BP) Statistical Review of World Energy. Roughly 25% came from natural gas, 16% from hydro dams, 10% from nuclear and 12% from renewables like solar and wind. 
This year, coal demand is set for a new record, driving prices to all-time highs and contributing to a worldwide scramble for fuel.
Record coal demand is contributing to a rapid rise in emissions in 2021 after a fall last year, when restrictions on movement for billions of people to slow the pandemic caused fuel use to plummet.
While some of the new coal plants under construction will replace older, more polluting stations, together they will add to total emissions.
""The completion of the capacity that is already under construction in these countries will drive up coal demand and emissions,"" said Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst with the Centre for Research on Energy and Clear Air.
The carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the new plants alone will be close to 28 billion tonnes over their 30-year lifespans, according to GEM. 
That's not far off the 32 billion tonnes of total worldwide CO2 emissions from all sources in 2020, according to BP, highlighting how tough it will be for leaders gathering in Glasgow - including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi - to make meaningful progress on climate change.
India's Environment Secretary Rameshwar Prasad Gupta told Reuters in a recent interview that India was on track to reach its target of cutting back the country's carbon footprint, and with that coal, too, would fall - but it cannot be abolished.
""Look, every country has its strengths. We have coal, we have to depend on it,"" Gupta said.
""Our position is once you take up targets of reducing carbon intensity, that will have impact ... Leave it to us whether we do it in coal, or somewhere else.""
Anil Swarup, a former Coal Secretary, took the same line in an interview. ""Renewable energy expansion is critical, but coal will remain India's main energy source for the next 15 years at least, and production needs to be ramped up to address our energy needs,"" he said.

CHINA CRUNCH
Across India, 281 coal plants are operating and beyond the 28 being built another 23 are in pre-construction phases, GEM data show. 
These numbers are dwarfed by China, the top global coal miner, consumer and emitter, whose leader, President Xi Jinping, is not expected to attend COP26. More than 1,000 coal plants are in operation, almost 240 planned or already under construction.
Together, coal plants in the world's second-largest economy will emit 170 billion tonnes of carbon in their lifetime - more than all global CO2 emissions between 2016 and 2020, BP data show. 
Graphic: Lifetime CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants by region and stage of development https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/xmvjolegxpr/LifetimeCO2CoalPlantsRegion.png 
Despite also boasting the world's largest renewables capacity, China is now suffering a major energy crunch and has urged coal miners to raise output.
That's likely to boost coal consumption in the near term, even though China plans to reduce coal use from 2026.
Even so, total global coal consumption looks set to rise, driven by accelerating use in South and Southeast Asia, where projects under construction will raise coal-burning capacity by 17% and 26% respectively.

AFTERLIFE
Even in economies committed to slashing emissions, coal's grip remains strong.
Japan, with its nuclear power industry in crisis since the Fukushima disaster, has turned to coal to fill the gap and is building seven large new coal-fired power stations.
Leading generator JERA plans to add clean-burning ammonia to be used with coal to help meet its target to be carbon neutral by 2050, and potentially keep old units operating longer.
On a bay near Nagoya, JERA's 30-year-old, 4,100 megawatt Hekinan station - once Asia's largest - supplies electricity to the likes of auto giant  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp. 
Like many power plants, Hekinan's boilers rely on fuel from top exporters such as Australia, where coal is both a vital source of revenue - $18 billion in the current financial year - and a bone of contention with allies urging ambitious emissions cuts.
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison is set to attend the Glasgow talks. But resources minister Keith Pitt has said there would be demand for coal for decades and made it clear the country would not be swayed by pressure from banks, regulators and investors to hobble the industry.

""While the market exists, Australia will look to fill it,"" Pitt said.

LONDON (Reuters) -Daimler AG reported a higher quarterly profit on Friday despite a 30% drop in Mercedes-Benz unit sales due to a global semiconductor chip shortage, as it focused on more profitable luxury cars and cut costs, and said it should meet its 2021 profit targets.
The German premium carmaker said it expects chip supplies to improve in the fourth quarter. It said the shortage should continue in 2022 but should improve compared to 2021. 
The company has previously warned the global chip crunch could last into 2023.
""This (chip) issue will continue to be a top priority for us moving forward,"" Chief Financial Officer Harald Wilhelm told analysts during a conference call.
Wilhelm also told analysts Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) is transferring development and manufacturing activities for compact and midsized combustion-engine transmissions to contract manufacturer and auto parts supplier Magna, so the German carmaker can focus on electrifying its model range. 
""The future of Mercedes is all electric,"" he said. 
Daimler shares are up 45% year to date, the strongest gain among German carmakers. 
The chip crunch has pummeled the auto industry this year. Carmakers, which shuttered plants as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold last year, have found themselves competing against the sprawling consumer electronics industry for chip supplies.
Supply chain snarls from a fire at a chip-making plant in Japan to coronavirus lockdowns in Malaysia, central to global chip supplies, have only compounded the problems.
The shortage of chips, used in everything from brake sensors to power steering to entertainment systems, has led automakers around the world to cut or suspend production, pushing up both new and used vehicle prices amid robust demand from consumers.
This week world No. 2 carmaker Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) cut its outlook for deliveries, toned down sales expectations and warned of cost cuts as it reported a lower-than-expected quarterly operating profit. 
Other major carmakers, including Stellantis, General Motors (NYSE:GM) and  Renault  (PA:RENA), have also seen their quarterly results hurt. 
Daimler said it had kept a ""tight grip"" on costs during the third quarter as it focused on more profitable models including in its Maybach and performance AMG brands. 
""In light of historically low wholesale volume... this is a very remarkable earnings level and it proves the point that
management is on track to lowering the break-even point at Mercedes Cars,"" Bernstein analyst Arndt Ellinghorst wrote in a client note. 
Daimler said it now expects Mercedes-Benz to post slightly lower sales in 2021, but maintained its forecast of an adjusted margin of between 10% and 12%. 
It also maintained its forecast of a margin of 6% to 8% for its Daimler Trucks unit, which is due to be spun off in December. 

The German carmaker posted a quarterly operating profit of 2.6 billion euros ($3 billion), up 18% from 2.2 billion euros for the same period in 2020. Analysts had expected a profit of 2.3 billion euros, Refinitiv estimates showed.
Its revenue slipped to 40.1 billion euros from 40.3 billion a year earlier.

Under the procedure, also known as a ""rolling review"", the European Medicines Agency (EMA) would assess data as soon as it becomes available, instead of waiting for a formal application when all required information has been gathered.
While vaccines are the main weapons against COVID-19, Merck's experimental pill molnupiravir could be a game-changer after studies showed it could halve the chances of dying or being hospitalised for those most at risk of contracting severe illness.
Merck, which is developing molnupiravir with partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, filed for U.S. emergency use authorization for the drug on Oct. 11. A panel of outside advisers to the U.S. health regulator are now slated to meet late in November to discuss whether to authorize the experimental antiviral pill.
Molnupiravir if approved by regulators, would be the first COVID-19 drug administered orally and also the first treatment for mildly ailing patients, whereas existing drugs are mostly used to treat the critically ill.

The drugmaker has a contract with the U.S. government to supply 1.7 million courses of the drug at a price of $700 per course. It also recently signed supply deals with countries including Britain, Malaysia and Singapore.
An EU official told Reuters earlier in the month that the bloc too was also considering signing a supply agreement for the antiviral pill, but would do so only after the company started the process of seeking approval.

PARIS (Reuters) - French engine maker  Safran  (PA:SAF) expressed renewed concerns on Friday over Airbus proposals to almost double jet production, as a battered aerospace industry remains split on how to share an emerging recovery supporting shares in both companies.
The world's third largest aerospace contractor, which co-produces engines for Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA) with  General Electric  (NYSE:GE), stuck to a cautious view despite assurances from Airbus https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/airbus-raises-targets-rejigs-near-term-production-goals-2021-10-28 on Thursday about the pace of demand once the pandemic is over.
The European planemaker plans to lift output to 65 A320-family jets a month by 2023 from recent rates of 40 a month and is exploring rates as high as 75 a month, triggering fears of overproduction from engine makers and leasing firms.
Safran Chief Executive Olivier Andries, speaking as the company reported quarterly results, said he saw little difficulty in producing enough engines to meet Airbus' firm target of 65 a month, not far above pre-crisis rates of 60.
But he signalled little progress had been made in agreeing on increases beyond that, with both Airbus and key suppliers standing their ground in quarterly earnings calls this week.
""On the exploration of rates above 65, it is obviously a challenge, and for us the question remains the same - whether such rates can be sustained over the medium term. It is still an open question,"" Andries told reporters.
""Sure, we have already seen production increases in the past, before the crisis. But the supply chain has been greatly weakened during the crisis.""
German engine maker MTU Aero Engines (OTC:MTUAY), which supplies parts for the GE-Safran consortium's main rival, Pratt & Whitney, was more supportive of Airbus' plans.
Andries noted suppliers were experiencing global labour shortages, a recurring theme in the latest earnings worldwide.
Despite this, Safran raised its full-year cashflow target and reaffirmed other goals as it reported a 10.4% increase in quarterly revenues. Its shares rose more than 3%.
Third-quarter revenue of 3.734 billion euros ($4.4 billion) was also up 5.7% compared to the second quarter of this year, after strong summer traffic in Europe and the United States.
The partial recovery from the pandemic boosted sales of spare parts for older engines as well as parts for other equipment like brakes and cabins.

Engine makers and lessors make most of their money over the life of an aircraft, while planemakers get paid for new jets.
Safran's widely watched civil aftermarket revenue rose 43.8% in dollar terms in the third quarter, compared to the year-ago period, and by 24% compared to the second quarter this year.

Investing.com – Apple stock (NASDAQ:AAPL) traded 3.3% lower in Friday’s premarket as the company warned of even more severe supply chain challenges in the busy holiday season following a $6 billion hit to sales in the three months through September.
The world’s most valuable company had managed to keep semiconductor shortages and supply chain bottlenecks, issues hurting just about every maker of cars and gadgets, at bay for a long time. But they finally came to hurt the company. Sales of older models as well as the new iPhones, Macs, watches and iPads it launched earlier this year couldn’t reach customers in time. Buyers have been told to wait for 3-4 weeks to get their new device.
The company’s fourth-quarter revenue of $83.36 billion fell short of expectations, a rare miss for a company. Net profit rose 62% to $20.55 and beat expectations. Profit was higher partly because the company managed to keep a lid on operating expenses.
Sales of iPhones rose about 14% to $38.86 billion.
CEO Tim Cook told Reuters the chip shortage has persisted and is now affecting ""most of our products”.
The accessories segment, comprising AirPods wireless headphones and watches, grew over 11% to $8.8 billion. Accessories are a key growth area for the company as it tries to broaden its portfolio. The company still depends on the iPhone for around 47% of revenue.
Revenue from iPhones and accessories fell short of expectations, according to analysts polled by Reuters.
Sales for iPads and Macs were $8.3 billion and $9.2 billion, respectively.
The company's services segment -- a work-in-progress for the company known for its devices -- had sales of $18.3 billion, up 26%. It comprises the App Store and Apple Music businesses.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Major Australian iron ore companies say they are increasing security measures at remote mine sites and improving training to try to change an industry culture that has seen high rates of sexual assault.
Measures will also include cutting down on excess drinking of alcohol at the fly in, fly out ""FIFO"" camps, mining executives told a Western Australian state inquiry. 
Sexual harassment is rife at mining camps in the state, which provides more than half of the world's supply of iron ore, submissions to the government inquiry showed in August.
The inquiry, which will report its findings next year, was initiated after high-profile cases of sexual assault by miners emerged.
Women make up roughly one in five workers at the camps and critics have said recreation facilities have become hubs for drinking alcohol and created poor camp cultures that miners need to address.
The companies are improving lighting at camps, adding security such as staff, CCTV and new locks, as well as revamping training to focus on respect and cutting down access to alcohol, executives from Fortsecue Metals Group and Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) said this week, adding to BHP Group (NYSE:BHP)'s comments earlier this month.
Fortescue Chief Executive Elisabeth Gaines told the inquiry this week that as well as improving physical safety features at its camps it was revising training around workplace culture, behaviour and leadership.
It will also limit the purchase of alcohol across all of its sites to four mid-strength drinks in a 24-hour period, similar to measures introduced by BHP and Rio Tinto this year. 
Rio iron ore boss Simon Trott told the inquiry it had started a leadership program to improve inclusivity in its culture and was strengthening preventative strategies including bystander training and encouraging people to report unacceptable behaviour.
""We are committed to changing the culture of our organisation to make safety and respect the lived reality for our people,"" he said. 
The mining companies jointly said they would set up education programmes in schools and training centres in the state aimed at preventing sexual harassment, racism and bullying.
BHP iron ore boss Brandon Craig said earlier this month it was investing A$300 million to improving the safety and security of its facilities. BHP has fired 48 workers in two years for incidents related to sexual harassment, it said in its submission. 

Owen Whittle, a spokesperson for UnionsWA, which represents 30 workers groups, said the unions welcomed the commitments to improve facilities and security. It wants to see these changes taken up by contractors who employ much of the remote mine workforce. 
""While there has been some preliminary announcements, we are yet to see a real turn in the culture and that is not done overnight, that's a long term commitment,"" Whittle told Reuters.

By Maki Shiraki
TOKYO (Reuters) -Toyota Motor Corp disclosed on Friday the driving range and other specifications of its bZ4X sport utility vehicle (SUV), the first in a series of EV-only models it plans to launch globally to catch up in the zero-emissions market.
The world's top-selling carmaker has said it will launch 15 battery EV (BEV) models worldwide by 2025, but so far its plans seem modest https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/toyota-exec-not-everyone-should-drive-battery-electric-vehicle-2021-10-21 compared with those of U.S. automakers such as General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co.
Toyota did not announce a price range or sales target for the bZ4X but said joint development and procurement of core components with affiliate Subaru (OTC:FUJHY) Corp would help rein in the normally high cost of producing BEVs.
The model would also initially be built on a mixed line with gasoline-engine cars, both in Japan and China. It will be sold in Japan, North America, China and Europe starting in mid-2022, the company said.
The car will be offered in front-wheel and four-wheel drive versions, with a driving range of about 500 km (310 miles) for the former. An optional roof-mounted solar panel can be used to charge the battery in the absence of a charging station or in disaster conditions, Toyota said.

A latecomer to the mass BEV market, Toyota has long touted the merits of hybrid vehicles, a category it has dominated for more than 20 years, for their lower price and accessibility and by extension, a greater role in cutting CO2 emissions. 
As governments tighten zero-emissions regulations, Toyota has said it would invest $13.5 billion through 2030 on EV batteries and introduce seven bZ series models by 2025.

LONDON (Reuters) -NatWest's profit tripled in the third quarter as Britain's resurgent economy buoyed its finances, but its margins contracted in a sign of potentially tougher times ahead.
State-backed NatWest reported a pre-tax profit for the July-September period of 1.1 billion pounds ($1.52 billion), up from 355 million pounds a year ago.
The profit came despite a 294 million pound litigation and conduct charge, which includes a provision for a fine after NatWest pleaded guilty this month to failing to prevent money laundering.
NatWest's profits were flattered by a release of bad loan reserves totalling 242 million pounds, following similar moves this month by rivals  Barclays  (LON:BARC), HSBC and Lloyds (LON:LLOY). 
Shares in NatWest fell more than 5%, however, as investors looked past the headline profit figure to a shrinking net interest margin, a core measure of profitability, that highlights its biggest headache.
Without the investment banking business of Barclays or the exposure to faster-growing Asian markets of HSBC, NatWest is among the most exposed to the British economy.
A contraction in its net interest margin to 1.54%, from 1.65% a year ago, shows how rock-bottom central bank rates have squeezed the income it can make from lending, leaving it reliant on hoped-for benchmark rate hikes. 
NatWest, Britain's biggest business bank, said while the economic outlook had improved, risks remained.
""Although we are seeing challenges in the economy and for our customers - especially around supply chains and the cost of living - a number of key indicators remain positive; growth is good, unemployment is low and there are limited signs of default across our book,"" Chief Executive Alison Rose said. 
DEEP REGRET
NatWest became the first lender to admit criminal offences under a 2007 money laundering law, in an embarrassing setback to Rose's attempts to clean up its image, including a rebrand from the scandal-tainted Royal Bank of Scotland (NYSE:RBS_old_old) name. 
The Financial Conduct Authority said NatWest failed to monitor suspect activity by a client that deposited about 365 million pounds over five years, including 264 million in cash.
NatWest said it would not disclose the exact provision for the fine, which will ultimately be determined at a sentencing expected in December, as court proceedings are ongoing. 
A lawyer for the FCA told Westminster Magistrates' Court earlier this month the bank could face a potential penalty of around 340 million pounds. 
In a call with reporters, Rose said it was a ""historic case affecting one of our customers"", adding ""We deeply regret what happened."" The offences took place between 2012 and 2016, predating her tenure as CEO. 

The FCA's decision not to act against current or former bank employees was questioned by lawmakers.

SHENZHEN, China (Reuters) - Revenue of China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd plummeted 38% in the third quarter compared to the same period a year earlier, with U.S. sanctions having hobbled its smartphone business and new potential growth areas still in their infancy.
The Chinese telecoms giant posted revenue of 455.8 billion yuan ($71.32 billion) for the first three quarters on Friday, down by almost a third on the same period a year earlier, with a profit margin of 10.2%.
Revenue for the third quarter alone came to 135.4 billion yuan, based on Reuters calculations.
Performance was ""in line with forecast"", said rotating Chairman Guo Ping.
Former U.S. President Donald Trump put Huawei on an export blacklist in 2019 and barred it from accessing critical U.S.-origin technology, impeding its ability to design its own chips and source components from outside vendors.
The restrictions have badly hurt Huawei's handset business, with rotating Chairman Eric Xu saying in September that revenue from smartphones would dip by around $30 billion to $40 billion this year.
While Huawei did not break down its third quarter figures by business segment, the company said that the decline is mainly attributable to its consumer business.
Huawei occupied 8% of China's smartphone market share in the third quarter, down from 30% a year earlier when it was the market leader, according to Counterpoint Research.
On the other hand, Honor, formerly a sub-brand which Huawei sold to keep it alive last November, sold 96% more phones in the same quarter compared to a year earlier, grabbing a 15% share of the China market, Counterpoint said.
Huawei is looking to develop new growth revenue streams outside of base station infrastructure and handsets, with a cloud business, and smart ports, mining and smart electric vehicles businesses.
In June it launched its Harmony operating system on smartphones, and is looking to supply software to autos companies.
But these new lines will take some time to bear fruit, executives said.

The company, however, has received a boost from the return of its chief financial officer and daughter of its founder Ren Zhengfei. Meng Wanzhou returned to work at its headquarters on Monday after almost three years fighting extradition to the U.S. in Canada, with Chinese officials signalling the case against her had been dropped to help to end a diplomatic stalemate.

At 4:10 AM ET (0810 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.6% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.3% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.2%.
European stocks are set for strong gains in October, boosted by a swathe of positive earnings, but the week is set to end on a negative note after weaker than expected quarterly earnings from both Apple and Amazon raised fears about the impact of global supply chain issues coming into the holiday season.
Apple, in particular, noted that supply chain problems cost it $6 billion in sales during the company's fiscal fourth quarter, and Chief Executive Tim Cook said the impact will be even worse during the current holiday sales quarter.
Back in Europe, BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) stock rose 0.3% after the French bank, the largest in Europe, launched a share buyback program for a maximum total of 900 million euros ($1 billion). It posted a strong rise in third-quarter profit on lower provisions for pandemic-related loan losses and a sharp rise in equity trading.
Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) stock rose 2.5% after the German carmaker reported a higher quarterly net profit despite the global semiconductor chip shortage, as it focused on higher-margin cars and on cost cutting. 
Air France KLM (OTC:AFLYY) stock rose 3% on returning to profit in the third quarter, after a loss in the same period in 2020. Passenger numbers almost doubled thanks to the easing of coronavirus travel curbs.
Turning to economic data, French GDP grew 3.0% in the third quarter, more than expected, while German GDP grew by 1.8% during the same period, which was less than the 2.2% expected.
However, the main focus will be on the October inflation data for the region, especially after ECB President Lagarde's comments at her press conference, which struck some as signalling an important change in outlook on interest rates.
Crude prices stabilized Friday, but were on course for their first weekly drop in months as the heat comes out of a near two-month rally prompted by record high gas prices in Europe and China.
Attention now turns to next Thursday’s meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies including Russia, a group called OPEC+. These top producers are expected to stick to their plan to add 400,000 barrels a day of supply each month until April 2022.
By 4:10 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% higher at $82.95 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.3% to $83.89. Both benchmarks were on track to fall about 1% for the week - the first weekly drop in 10 weeks for WTI and the first in eight weeks for Brent.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.4% to $1,795.75/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1665.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Shares in Danske Bank fell more than 5% on Friday after the lender reduced its 2023 profitability target, citing significant challenges such as compliance costs.
Danske, which also pointed to increased competition and margin pressure, now expects to report a return on equity (RoE) of between 8.5% and 9% in 2023, compared with a previous target range of 9-10%.
""We have had to adapt to significant challenges over the past two years,"" Chief Executive Carsten Egeriis said. 
Denmark's largest bank has been dogged by a money laundering scandal since 2018, with more negative client cases uncovered since. 
""We now have more line of sight of our commercial challenges within retail banking, and the prolonged investments in strengthening our compliance and remediation efforts, leading us to adjust our financial targets for 2023,"" Egeriis added.
Shares in Danske were down 5% at 0704 GMT, having risen by more than 9% this year, underperforming a gain of about 38% by the European banking index. 
Danske said in July that it would stick to its profitability target of 9-10% RoE in 2023, prompting scepticism from analysts who said that further measures were needed, such as more cost cutting or divestments. 
""A smaller downward adjustment than expected, but at the same time also a plan that lacks a little more detail for how it should be fulfilled,"" Sydbank analyst Mikkel Jensen told Reuters, referring to the profitability target.
""I still think the market will be sceptical about whether they can deliver that. If they can, it will be better than the market expects.""
For the first nine months of the year Danske reported RoE of 7.3%, well below Nordic peers Nordea and Handelsbanken's 10.9% and 11.5% respectively over the same period. 
Danske also said it expects a cost-to-income ratio in the mid-50s in 2023, slightly worse than its previous target of ""low 50s"". 

The Danish lender reported net profit of 3.3 billion Danish crowns ($517.90 million) in the third quarter, above an average forecast of 3 billion crowns in a company-compiled poll of analysts.

OSLO (Reuters) - Wideroe, the Nordics' largest regional airline, is setting up a subsidiary to help it develop an emissions-free airline business, its chief executive told Reuters.
Privately-owned Wideroe serves short-haul routes in a sparsely populated region with few train lines and challenging geography. It has 40 Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF) Dash 8 propeller planes and 3 Embraer E190-E2 jets. 
Wideroe plans to have its first zero-emissions plane flying in 2026 and aims to replace its 26 Dash 8-100 and -200, which will be obsolete between 2030 and 2035, with zero-emissions planes, either electric or using hydrogen as fuel. 
Called Wideroe Zero and launching on Friday, the new company would help Wideroe achieve its aim of a zero-, or near-zero, emissions fleet, Chief Executive Stein Nilsen said in an interview. 
""To be free to think outside the box we decided to establish a new company with the main target of finding this path to find a more sustainable (business),"" he said. 
Wideroe Zero would also try to find new market opportunities, he added, when the airline industry, which accounts for 2.5% of global CO2 emissions in 2018, according to Our World in Data, is under pressure to be more sustainable.
New technologies are disrupting the industry too, Nilsen said, citing the emergence of electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft (eVTOL) as an example of the rapid change that Wideroe wants to take advantage of.

""As a short-haul airline, this is very interesting for us,"" said Nilsen. ""We need to be prepared for something more disruptive in the market place for our niche.""
The planned switch coincides with upheaval in the Nordic airlines industry, with major carriers Norwegian Air and SAS restructuring operations and newcomers such as Flyr and Play launching following the disruption caused by the pandemic.

High prices for coal and other commodities are helping miners despite lower production in some cases, while volatile prices have offered trading opportunities. 
Glencore reported a 9% drop in coal production for the first nine months of the year due to its Prodeco mines in Colombia being suspended and lower domestic production in South Africa.
CEO Gary Nagle said Glencore has recovered from market-driven production cuts in its Australian coal assets last year, thanks to an improvement in energy market demand and prices.
Coal prices have surged to all-time highs this year due to a squeeze in supply.
Ferrochrome production jumped 65% year on year to 1,071,000 tonnes as South African mines ramped back up after a COVID-19 lockdown. 
Glencore's own-sourced nickel production was down 13% year to date to 71,100 tonnes due to planned maintenance at Australian mine Murrin Murrin and operating issues at its Koniambo mine in New Caledonia.

Copper production fell 4% to 895,500 tonnes because of lower grades.
Cobalt production from Glencore's African mines jumped 11% to 20,900 tonnes of cobalt in hydroxide helped by a 2,100-tonne contribution from the Mutanda mine in Democratic Republic of Congo, which the company is restarting.

496,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2021 03:10AM ET</span>","Exclusive-China's Kaisa plans to sell property management unit, Hong Kong sites - sources","By Clare Jim and Kane Wu
HONG KONG (Reuters) -Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd is seeking buyers for its Hong Kong-listed property management unit and two residential sites in the city, people with knowledge of the matter said, as it scrambles to meet a wall of debt repayments.
Kaisa plans to sell its entire 67.18% stake in Kaisa Prosperity Holdings Ltd, a company with a market value of around HK$2.4 billion ($310 million), two sources said.
No clear buyers have emerged, one source said.
The Shenzhen-based developer is also putting up for sale two residential project sites in Hong Kong it acquired last year, according to another source and sale presentation documents seen by Reuters.
Kaisa bought the land in Tuen Mun for HK$3.5 billion, and it said in its interim report published in September that it owns a 50% interest in a Kai Tak site worth HK$7 billion.
Kaisa did not comment on the plans to divest its stake in the property management unit and did not immediately respond to a query about the residential site sales.
The sources asked to be named as the company's divestment plans were not public.
Kaisa has the most offshore debt coming due over the next one year of any Chinese developer, after embattled China Evergrande Group, which - with more than $300 billion in liabilities - is at the centre of a stifling liquidity crisis in China's $5 trillion property sector.
Evergrande made an interest payment for an offshore bond before a grace period expired on Friday, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said, narrowly averting catastrophic default for the second time in a week.
'ASSET DISPOSALS'
Kaisa's share price was down 2.5% in late afternoon trading, while Kaisa Prosperity jumped over 7% after the news.
The stock has plunged almost 70% this year. Its dollar bond due June 2022 traded at 33.784 cents on the dollar on Friday, yielding over 270%.
Kaisa in 2015 became the first Chinese developer to default on its dollar bonds, though its business has recovered in recent years.
Its borrowings totalled 123.8 billion yuan ($19.37 billion) at the end of June, up from 121.5 billion yuan at the end of 2020, the interim report showed. Of that debt, 71.7 billion yuan was dollar senior notes.
The developer has around $3.2 billion in offshore senior notes due in the next 12 months, according to credit rating company S&P, with the next maturity worth $400 million falling on Dec. 7. 
Kaisa also has around $1 billion in offshore interest to pay every year, analysts said.
Rating firms S&P and Fitch downgraded Kaisa again on Wednesday, both to ""CCC+"", citing its weakening liquidity, sending its shares to their lowest since their debut in December 2009.
""In our view, the company will need to rely on asset disposals and successfully improving its capital structure to avoid defaulting on its debt commitments,"" S&P said, citing disposals in project in the mainland and Hong Kong.
Kaisa's asset sale plan comes as bigger rival Evergrande teeters on the brink of collapse. A few of their peers have defaulted on offshore debt obligations in recent weeks, roiling equities and bond markets. 
Scrambling to raise cash as a result of Chinese regulators reining in debt accumulation in the sector, some Chinese developers have turned to their property management units to raise funds.
Once China's top-selling developer, Evergrande tried to sell 50.1% of its property services unit to Chinese peer Hopson Development for $2.6 billion but this month scrapped the deal.
Acquisitions targeting Chinese real estate companies totalled $33.3 billion in 297 deals so far this year, according to Refinitiv data, up 10% from the same period last year.

497,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2021 03:02AM ET</span>",Facebook changes name to Meta as it refocuses on virtual reality,"By Elizabeth Culliford and Sheila Dang
(Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) is now called Meta, the company said on Thursday, in a rebrand that focuses on building the ""metaverse,"" a shared virtual environment that it bets will be the successor to the mobile internet.
The name change comes as the world's largest social media company battles criticisms from lawmakers and regulators over its market power, algorithmic decisions and the policing of abuses on its services.
CEO Mark Zuckerberg, speaking at the company's live-streamed virtual and augmented reality conference, said the new name reflected its work investing in the metaverse, rather than its namesake social media service, which will continue to be called Facebook. 
The metaverse is a term coined in the dystopian novel ""Snow Crash"" three decades ago and now attracting buzz in Silicon Valley. It refers broadly to the idea of a shared virtual realm which can be accessed by people using different devices.
""Right now, our brand is so tightly linked to one product that it can't possibly represent everything that we're doing today, let alone in the future,"" said Zuckerberg. 
The company, which has invested heavily in augmented and virtual reality, said the change would bring together its different apps and technologies under one new brand. It said it would not change its corporate structure.
The tech giant, which reports about 2.9 billion monthly users, has faced increasing scrutiny in recent years from global lawmakers and regulators. 
In the latest controversy, whistleblower and former Facebook employee Frances Haugen leaked documents which she said showed the company chose profit over user safety. Haugen has in recent weeks testified before a U.S. Senate subcommittee and lawmakers in the UK's Parliament. Zuckerberg earlier this week said the documents were being used to paint a ""false picture.""
The company said in a blog post that it intends to start trading under the new stock ticker it has reserved, MVRS, on Dec. 1. On Thursday, it unveiled a new sign at its headquarters in Menlo Park, California, replacing its thumbs-up ""Like"" logo with a blue infinity shape.
Facebook shares closed 1.5% higher at $316.92 on Thursday.
TARNISHED REPUTATION 
Facebook said this week that its hardware division Facebook Reality Labs, which is responsible for AR and VR efforts, would become a separate reporting unit and that its investment in it would reduce this year's total operating profit by about $10 billion. 
This year, the company created a product team in this unit focused on the metaverse and it recently announced plans to hire 10,000 employees in Europe over the next five years to work on the effort.
In an interview with tech publication the Information, Zuckerberg said he has not considered stepping down as CEO, and has not thought ""very seriously yet"" about spinning off this unit. 
The division will now be called Reality Labs, its head Andrew ""Boz"" Bosworth said on Thursday. The company will also stop using the Oculus branding for its VR headsets, instead calling them ""Meta"" products. 
The name change, the plan for which was first reported by the Verge, is a significant rebrand for Facebook, but not its first. In 2019 it launched a new logo to create a distinction between the company and its social app. 
The company's reputation has taken multiple hits in recent years, including over its handling of user data and its policing of abuses such as health misinformation, violent rhetoric and hate speech. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has also filed an antitrust lawsuit alleging anticompetitive practices. 
""While it'll help alleviate confusion by distinguishing Facebook's parent company from its founding app, a name change doesn't suddenly erase the systemic issues plaguing the company,"" said Mike Proulx, research director at market research firm Forrester.
The plans to phase out the Facebook name even from products like video calling device Portal show the company is eager to prevent the unprecedented scrutiny from hurting the rest of its apps, said Prashant Malaviya, a marketing professor at Georgetown University McDonough School of Business.
""Without a doubt, (the Facebook name) is definitely damaged and toxic,"" he said.
Zuckerberg said the new name, coming from the Greek word for ""beyond,"" symbolized there was always more to build.  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) CEO Jack Dorsey on Thursday tweeted out a different definition ""referring to itself or to the conventions of its genre; self-referential.""
Zuckerberg said the new name also reflects that over time, users will not need to use Facebook to use the company's other services.
In 2015, Google reorganized to create a new holding company called Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, as the popular search engine broke into new fields such as self-driving cars, high-speed broadband and expanded its cloud business. Snapchat also rebranded to  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) in 2016, the same year it launched its first pair of smart glasses.

Facebook, which this year launched its own pair of smart glasses https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-unveils-its-first-smart-glasses-2021-09-09 with Ray-Ban, announced a slew of new AR and VR product updates during Connect. These included a way for people using its Oculus VR headset to call friends using Facebook Messenger and for people to invite others to a social version of their home, dubbed ""Horizon Home.""
Zuckerberg also showed video demos of what the metaverse could look like, with people connecting as avatars and being transported to digital versions of various places and time periods. He said that the metaverse would need to be built with safety and privacy in mind.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to weaken at the open Friday, weighed by disappointing results from U.S. tech giants Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), bucking the recent positive trend of corporate results.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.6% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.5% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.4%.
European stocks are set for strong gains in October, boosted by a swathe of positive earnings, but the week is set to end on a negative note after weaker than expected quarterly earnings from both Apple and Amazon raised fears about the impact of global supply chain issues coming into the holiday season.
Apple, in particular, noted that supply chain problems cost it $6 billion in sales during the company's fiscal fourth quarter, and Chief Executive Tim Cook said the impact will be even worse during the current holiday sales quarter.
The earnings season continues in Europe Friday, with BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) in the spotlight after the French bank, the largest in Europe, launched a share buyback program for a maximum total of 900 million euros ($1 billion) after posting a 79% jump in equities trading in the quarter.
German carmaker Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) reported a higher quarterly net profit despite the global semiconductor chip shortage, as it focused on higher-margin cars and cost cutting. 
Air France KLM (PA:AIRF) posted a profit of almost 800 million euros in the third quarter, after a loss in the same period in 2020, beating the Franco-Dutch airline group's own expectations, as passenger numbers almost doubled thanks to easing coronavirus travel curbs.
Turning to economic data, French GDP grew 3.0% in the third quarter, more than expected, raising expectations of a good number for the Eurozone as a whole later in the session. 
However, the main focus will be on the October inflation data for the region, especially after the European Central Bank decided Thursday to keep its monetary policy stance unchanged despite increased inflationary pressures.
Crude prices stabilized Friday, but were on course for their first weekly drop in months as the heat comes out of a near two-month rally prompted by record high gas prices in Europe and China.
Attention now turns to next Thursday’s meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies including Russia, a group called OPEC+. These top producers are expected to stick to their plan to add 400,000 barrels a day of supply each month until April 2022.
By 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% lower at $82.75 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.2% to $83.81. Both benchmarks were on track to fall about 1% for the week - the first weekly drop in 10 weeks for WTI and the first in eight weeks for Brent.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.4% to $1,796.15/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1668.

501,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2021 01:57AM ET</span>","Apple results hit by supply chain woes, Cook says holiday quarter impact will be worse","By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) -Supply chain woes cost Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) $6 billion in sales during the company's fiscal fourth quarter, which missed Wall Street expectations, and Chief Executive Tim Cook said that the impact will be even worse during the current holiday sales quarter.
Cook told Reuters on Thursday the quarter ended Sept. 25 had ""larger than expected supply constraints"" as well as pandemic-related manufacturing disruptions in Southeast Asia. While Apple had seen ""significant improvement"" by late October in those Southeast Asian facilities, the chip shortage has persisted and is now affecting ""most of our products,"" Cook said. 
""We're doing everything we can do to get more (chips) and also everything we can do operationally to make sure we're moving just as fast as possible,"" Cook said.
Cook said the company expects year-over-growth for its quarter ending in December. Analysts expect growth of 7.4% to $119.7 billion.
""We're projecting very solid demand growth year over year. But we are also predicting that we're going to be short of demand by larger than $6 billion,"" Cook said.
Shares of the Cupertino, California-based company, which had risen nearly 15% this year, fell 3.4% in extended trading on Thursday. The dip could make  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) the world's most valuable company after a run-up in Microsoft shares on the strength of its cloud computing business.
Apple's results were mixed in a fiscal fourth quarter seen as a lull before the high-sales holiday end of year. 
Apple said revenues and profits for the fiscal fourth quarter were $83.4 billion and $1.24 per share, compared with analyst estimates of $84.8 billion and $1.24 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The results were a rocky end to a fiscal year of above-expectations sales led by its iPhone 12 models and strong sales of Mac computers and iPads for working and learning from home during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Apple told investors in July that chip constraints would start to hit its iPhone and iPad lineups for the first time in the fourth quarter.
Apple posted its results shortly after retailer Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) forecast holiday-quarter sales well below Wall Street expectations, citing labor supply shortages and global supply chain issues in part.
Apple has ""managed to navigate the problems fairly well, but hasn’t escaped unscathed, and an extended duration of these problems will spell trouble, especially because the market is unforgiving when it comes to Apple’s performance,"" said Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV).
MISSES
Apple missed expectations in two key categories.
Apple said fourth-quarter iPhone sales were $38.9 billion, short of estimates of $41.5 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
Cook said that chips made with older technology remain the key supply constraint. He said that Apple remains unsure whether the shortages will ease after the holiday shopping season.
""It's very difficult to call,"" Cook told Reuters.
The company's accessories segment, which contains fast-growing categories like its AirPods wireless headphones, came in at $8.8 billion, half a billion dollars lower than analyst expectations of $9.3 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
Other segments fared better. Sales for iPads and Macs were $8.3 billion and $9.2 billion, compared with analyst estimates of $7.2 billion and $9.2 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
The company's services segment - which contains its App Store business - had sales of $18.3 billion in revenue, up 26%, compared with analyst expectations of $17.6 billion. Cook told Reuters that Apple now has 745 million paid subscribers to its platform, up from the 700 million it disclosed a quarter ago.
""Services were strong, and it shows the beauty and durability of software and services, as there are better margins and no supply issues, since software doesn't arrive on a container ship,"" said Hal Eddins, chief economist at Apple shareholder Capital Investment Companies.

Another bright spot in the company's results were its sales in China, which were up 83% to $14.6 billion.
The company said it returned $24 billion to shareholders during the quarter.

By Byron Kaye
SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australian billionaire James Packer on Friday acknowledged ""many oversights"" running the casino company he founded, Crown Resorts Ltd, and failing the licence requirements for one of its resorts by missing four years of board meetings.
Packer quit all corporate roles at the A$7 billion ($5.3 billion) company in 2018, but set its strategy as its executive chairman and top shareholder for more than a decade. Once a fixture of the Australian corporate landscape, his evidence at a commission of inquiry was his first public appearance in a year.
Like similar inquiries into Crown's resorts in Sydney and Melbourne, the hearing on Friday was about its handling of money-laundering risks in West Coast city Perth, which generates a quarter of its profit.
""Looking back, there are many oversights and things that should have been done differently,"" said Packer, 54, via videolink.
Before the inquiries, no Crown directors had expertise preventing money laundering, which was an oversight, he said.
""I did not believe at that point in time that Crown Perth was engaged in money laundering,"" he added.
Packer, who still owns 37% of the company, said he left Australia in 2013 and missed board meetings of Crown's Perth casino from then until 2016, despite being the subsidiary's chairman. He said he should have resigned or attended.
When the former judge running the inquiry suggested Packer's non-attendance was inconsistent with Crown's licence requirements, he said ""I accept that"".
The inquiries into Crown began after media reports accused the company of turning a blind eye to organised crime and disregarding the safety of 19 employees arrested in China in 2016 for violating that country's anti-gambling laws.
The Sydney inquiry, where Packer testified a year earlier, ultimately froze Crown's gambling licence in Australia's biggest city. Another probe resulted this week in a supervisor being tasked with overseeing the company's flagship casino in Melbourne.
Packer has since withdrawn his associates from the Crown board to prevent a perception of interference. The company has also replaced its chairman, CEO and most directors and managers in the past year.
He told the inquiry on Friday the company was once named ""employer of the year"" by the Western Australia state government, but ""I think at some point the culture slipped"".

Asked if he put that down to his absence, Packer replied, ""Potentially"".

That was up sharply from a 28.5% annual rise in sales a year ago, which did not include the sale of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s first 5G enabled smartphone iPhone 12.
The jump also easily outstripped the 29% overall sales growth https://www.reuters.com/article/apple-results-idUSKBN2HI2TE at Apple, which said on Thursday that production took a drubbing due to the ongoing global chip crisis and supply chain bottlenecks in Southeast Asia.
""Apple's strong performance with its iPhone was related to Huawei's decline in the high-end segment,"" said Will Wong, an analyst at market research firm IDC. ""Other key Chinese vendors still need time to build their high-end image.""
Most of Apple's competition in China now comes from Chinese phone maker Honor, a brand that Huawei sold earlier this year after it was hit by U.S. sanctions that prevented it from sourcing chips. 
Honor mostly sells low-and-mid-range phones, but in August it released its Magic 3 high-end line that sells for as much as 7,999 yuan ($1,251). The cheapest iPhone 13 variant sells for 5,199 yuan.
Honor climbed to number three in terms of market share in the July-September period, according to market research firms Canalys and Counterpoint Research. 
Apple took fifth spot, with its market share up at 11% from 6% a year earlier, said Canalys. Counterpoint Research put Apple's share at 13%.
Chinese budget phonemakers Vivo and Oppo retained first and second spots even as overall smartphone sales in the country fell by 5%-9%, according to the two firms.
The iPhone 13, launched five days before Apple's fiscal quarter ended on Sept 25., ""is doing quite well in October"" in China, said Canalys analyst Nicole Peng.

""I believe demand will still surpass supply in the short term, which means some customers might instead purchase their upgrade during Chinese new year sales,"" said Peng, referring to the busy February shopping season.

Scrutiny of Australian lenders and financial institutions has ramped up significantly since a Royal Commission inquiry in 2018 found widespread shortcomings in the sector, forcing companies and regulators to take swift action.
Last month, the securities regulator said CBA had promoted and sold certain policies as an add-on insurance product to 165 customers by telephone and online.
""The bank is no longer selling the products and the 165 customers affected had been compensated,"" a CBA spokesperson in an emailed statement said, adding that the company had fully cooperated with the ASIC during its investigation.
The news follows a similar civil lawsuit by ASIC against Australia's no.2 lender  Westpac Banking  (NYSE:WBK) Corp in April for selling consumer credit insurance to customers who had not agreed to buy it.

ASIC is conducting a wider review into consumer credit insurance sales between 2018 and 2019 by as many as 11 banks, and has slapped Australia and New Zealand Banking Group and National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) with similar lawsuits and scrutiny.
CBA has also been hit by multiple lawsuits this year, after having been sued for underpaying its staff earlier this month.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea said on Friday it will drop all operating-hour curbs on restaurants and cafes and implement its first vaccine passport for high-risk venues such as gyms, saunas and bars, as it tries to ""live with COVID-19"". 
The first phase will go into effect on Monday and last for a month, officials said, with plans calling for all restrictions to be scrapped by February.
""Beginning November 1, our community will take the first step of resuming our normal life,"" Prime Minister Kim Boo-kyum said at a televised government meeting. ""However, we must be aware that this doesn't mean the fight against coronavirus is over, but a new beginning.""
The push comes as South Korea grapples with high daily case numbers, though they remain far below many of the worst hit countries, and serious infections and deaths are low.
Last week, South Korea met its goal of vaccinating 70% of its 52 million people, paving the way for the planned return to normal. It has now fully vaccinated about 72% of the population, and has given at least one dose of a vaccine to more than 79.8%.
While never under lockdown, South Korea has been battling the fourth wave of infections since July when the government imposed tight gatherings and social distancing restrictions. 
Outdoor sports events are allowed to take up to 50% of spectators and up to 100 people can attend musicals or concerts regardless of vaccination status. Inoculated people will be allowed to consume popcorn and soda inside movie theatres.
Visits to high-risk venues such as bars and night clubs, indoor gyms, saunas and karaoke bars will require proof of vaccination, or a negative COVID-19 test result from within 48 hours.
South Korea has launched its own vaccine app that it says protects user privacy through blockchain technology.
While private gatherings will be allowed with up to 10 people nationwide regardless of vaccination status, restaurants and cafes will keep a cap on up to four unvaccinated people per group.
Authorities have said they will focus on hospitalisation and mortality rates rather than daily mitigation and expand self-treatment for those with only mild COVID-19 symptoms.

The Korean Medical Association (KMA) and experts have warned that the timing of the switch to the new strategy, with a relatively high number of cases and as winter approaches, may fuel a rise in COVID-19 cases.
South Korea reported 2,124 new COVID-19 cases for Thursday, bringing its cumulative tally to 360,536 infections with 2,817 deaths.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S State Department said late Thursday the Russian government has approved U.S. air carriers' requests for overflights even as some cargo and passenger airlines seek additional flights.
This month, a trade group representing major U.S. passenger and cargo carriers had asked the State Department to ""act urgently"" to address the needs of airlines to secure rights to overfly Russian airspace, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
Airlines for America, which represents American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Airlines (NYSE:DAL), United Airlines, FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX),  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS) and others, in an Oct. 14 letter asked Secretary of State Antony Blinken for his intervention, warning that without action they could be forced to halt some flights.
""Many U.S. airlines urgently need additional rights to overfly Russian airspace to meet market demands,"" the letter said, adding without additional rights ""U.S. airlines will be forced to operate on alternate, inefficient routes resulting in time penalties, technical stops, excess CO2 emissions and loss of historic slot rights.""
The State Department confirmed it received the letter and said ""Russia approved U.S. carriers’ applications for overflights last week. The Department of State continues to engage with the relevant Russian authorities to secure expanded air services opportunities for U.S. carriers.""
The department declined to say how many overflights had been approved.
United said Thursday it ""has received the necessary overflight approvals from Russian authorities to continue operating our nonstop flights to India this winter without interruption.""
The State Department held a meeting with airlines to discuss the issue last week, airline officials said. Some carriers are pursuing additional overflight rights.
The Russian Embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment. The airline group did not comment.
The airline group's chief executive, Nicholas Calio, in the letter said ""U.S. passenger airlines need additional Russian overflights to operate efficiently from the U.S. to destinations in Asia, India, and the Middle East.""
He added that ""U.S. all-cargo carriers need restoration of overflight rights on all-cargo routes between points in Europe and Asia that were mutually agreed upon but were unilaterally stripped away by the Russian government.""

With ties already at post-Cold War lows, Russia and the United States are in a dispute over the number of diplomats they can post to each other's capitals, and failed to make progress at talks this month.
Calio warned that without action ""U.S. carriers may need to consider mitigation measures, including schedule reductions. This outcome would make U.S. carriers far less competitive globally ... and will exacerbate the growing backlog of cargo and express shipments needed to reduce the pressure on the supply chain.""

(Reuters) -New York's $268 billion state pension fund on Thursday became the latest to restrict its holdings in Unilever (NYSE:UL) Plc in response to sales limits imposed by the company's Ben & Jerry's ice cream brand in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories.
In a statement sent by a spokesman, New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli said a review found the company and its subsidiary ""engaged in BDS activities,"" referring to the ""Boycott Divestment Sanctions"" movement that seeks to isolate Israel over its treatment of the Palestinians.
The New York State Common Retirement Fund has total Unilever equity of $111 million, the spokesman said. The fund is the third-largest U.S. public pension fund. 
Pension officials in other states including New Jersey, Arizona and Florida have also moved to sell shares in Unilever or restricted the purchase of new stock for similar reasons. 
Unilever representatives did not immediately comment. 
Ben & Jerry's moved in July to end a license for its ice cream to be sold in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, saying sales there were ""inconsistent with its values."" Most countries consider Israeli settlements on occupied Palestinian land to be illegal. Israel disputes this.
Some American Jewish groups such as the liberal-leaning J Street have also raised concerns about Israel's settlements and opposed calls for actions against Ben & Jerry's or Unilever.
Unilever had said the decision was made by Ben & Jerry's independent social mission board, and said it does not support the BDS movement. 

In a letter to DiNapoli's office in August, Unilever CEO Alan Jope said Unilever is committed to its business in Israel, where it employs nearly 2,000 people, and said the Ben & Jerry's brand will remain in Israel. 
""We have welcomed this decision to stay in Israel emphatically, and have been seeking to handle this matter in as respectful and sensitive way as possible,"" Jope wrote.

A lack of chips for automakers has disrupted vehicle production around the world, with suppliers relying almost exclusively on chips from only a few manufacturers in Asia and the United States.
The largest part of Bosch's budget will be spent on a faster expansion of its Dresden, Germany factory for 300-millimeter wafers, which the group inaugurated in June, it said in a statement on Friday.
About 50 million euros will be invested at a site in Reutlingen near Stuttgart making 200-millimeter wafers, said the company, which also makes car parts and factory automation systems.
Another project to be funded will be the construction of a semiconductor testing facility in Penang, Malaysia, it added, without specifying the level of investment.

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), the biggest maker of processor chips for PCs and data centres, said last month it could invest up to 80 billion euros in Europe over the next decade.

SEOUL (Reuters) - SK Innovation Co Ltd, owner of South Korea's top refiner SK Energy, said on Friday that it expects steady fourth-quarter growth in refining margins as the COVID-19 pandemic recedes and demand returns.
The company posted an operating profit of 619 billion won ($528.95 million) in the July-September quarter, swinging from an operating loss of 54 billion won in the same period a year earlier.
Revenues rose 48% to 12.3 trillion won from a year earlier. That compares with the 12.6 trillion won forecast of analysts in the Refinitiv SmartEstimate. 
""The third quarter operating profit of petrochemical business edged up marginally as upward swing in crude prices and key product crack concentrated mostly in September,"" SK Innovation said in a statement.
SK Innovation, which has a total refining capacity of 1.115 million barrels per day (bpd) at plants in Ulsan and Incheon, said it operated 68% of its capacity on average in the third quarter, down from 72% a year earlier.
Peer S-Oil Corp, whose main shareholder is  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222), on Thursday predicted a continued uptrend in Asia's refining margins in the fourth quarter as demand grows ahead of winter and COVID-19 restrictions ease.
SK Innovation's wholly-owned battery subsidiary SK On, which was split off on Oct. 1 https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/sk-innovation-shareholders-approve-plan-split-off-battery-business-2021-09-16, accounted for nearly 7% of the company's revenue in the third quarter. 
The battery unit, which counts Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Kia Corp among its customers, aims to turn profitable next year. 
SK On said it has an order backlog of about 1.6 terawatt hours (TWh)of batteries worth about 220 trillion won, reflecting the battery joint venture with Ford https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/ford-sk-invest-114-bln-add-electric-f-150-plant-three-battery-factories-2021-09-27, which could power about 23 million electric vehicles. 
In July, the company said its battery order backlog would be worth about 130 trillion won.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Friday morning as investors continued to digest the latest, disappointing U.S. GDP. Disappointing earnings, as well as bond-market gyrations over continued inflation and monetary tightening concerns, also contributed to the end-of-week and month downward trend.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 inched down 0.01% by 10:15 PM ET (2:15 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.55%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 fell 0.62% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.58%
China’s Shanghai Composite edged down 0.18% while the Shrenzhen Component edged up 0.13%. China  Evergrande  Group's (HK:3333) debt woes remain in the spotlight, with payment for a dollar-denominated bond due on Friday. China will also release data, including the manufacturing and non-manufacturing purchasing managers indexes (PMI) as well as the Caixin manufacturing and service PMIs, in the following week.
In the U.S., data released on Thursday showed that the GDP grew a smaller-than-expected 2% quarter-on-quarter, while the GDP price index grew 5.7% quarter-on-quarter, in the third quarter of 2021. Separately, 281,000 initial jobless claims were filed throughout the week.
Disappointing results from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) also set the stage for a more than $200 billion drop in combined market value when U.S. markets open on Friday.
The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield fell, with the curve between 20- and 30-years inverted for the first time since the U.S. government reintroduced a two-decade maturity in 2020. In Asia Pacific, Australian debt was under pressure after the Reserve Bank of Australia opted not to defend its 0.1% yield target.
In Europe, the European Central Bank handed down its policy decision on Thursday and renewed a pledge to conduct emergency bond-buying at a “moderately” slower pace.
Although a generally positive earnings season has helped underspin global shares, inflation risks from supply-chain bottlenecks and costlier raw materials have increased expectations of interest rate hikes.
“If we’re going on the right path, but at a slower pace, which means the policy support persists for longer,” then that’s “still positive for markets,” State Street’s head of North America multi-asset strategy Lee Ferridge told Bloomberg.
Meanwhile, G20 joint finance and health ministers will meet later in the day, with a leaders’ summit to take place over the weekend."

The move comes after a panel of outside advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration voted on Tuesday to recommend its authorization for the vaccine in children aged 5 to 11. The agency's decision on the vaccine for the age group is awaited.
If authorized and subsequently recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) advisory panel, the companies said they expect to then begin shipping the vaccine immediately, in 10 microgram pediatric doses, as directed by the U.S. government.

The U.S. government has so far secured 600 million doses of the vaccine for use within the country and additional 1 billion doses for donation to low- and lower-middle-income countries.
The drugmakers said they expect initial clinical trial data on the vaccine's use in children -- aged 2 to less than 5 years, and 6 months to less than 2 years -- is expected in the fourth quarter this year or early first quarter of 2022.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Labor shortages have cut into Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s plan to make one-day delivery standard for members of its Prime loyalty club, delaying its bid to cement its lead in e-commerce and sending costs surging ahead of the all-important holiday season. 
The comments from the world's biggest online retailer come as staffing emerges as a significant pain point for U.S. retailers, already battling supply-chain snarls, product shortages, rising inflation and rocketing transportation costs. 
Seattle-based Amazon said it anticipates $4 billion in additional labor and related expenses during the fourth quarter, amid pandemic-fueled shortages that made it harder to hire warehouse workers and drivers, and forcing it to route packages to out-of-the-way warehouses with sufficient staffing. 
In April 2019, Amazon announced it would roll out one-day delivery for Prime subscribers, and it said that would cost the company $800 million in the second quarter of 2019 alone. Its race to faster shipping forced Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and other retailers to speed up delivery and invest in e-commerce offerings, bolstering competition. 
Amazon continues to charge $119 a year for a U.S. Prime membership, which includes shipping.
On Thursday, Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said, ""we have unfinished business on the one-day-promise side. We were ramping that up nicely in 2019 and in the first quarter of 2020 before the pandemic,"" he said, referring to one-day shipping. ""We're still not back to levels that we saw pre-pandemic.""
Olsavsky said labor constraints have ""not helped us close the gap"" in offering Prime customers default one-day shipping, but the company hoped for an improvement next year.
'CAN'T CONTROL IT' 
As shoppers resume spending on entertainment and travel, Amazon is grappling with stiff competition not only for share of wallet, but for employees. 
Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said Amazon had little choice but to pay up for workers because it needs warehouses near high-cost urban centers to speed goods in a day to nearby customers. 
""Their sales are in population centers, which by and large means they're having to pay competitive wages,"" he said. ""They really can't control it. The model is, order on Amazon and you're going to get it soon.""
Companies across the retail landscape also are struggling to find workers to do physically demanding warehouse work – especially as restaurants, stores and entertainment venues rehire. In New York City, some Amazon warehouse workers https://www.reuters.com/business/amazons-staten-island-warehouse-workers-file-petition-union-election-nlrb-2021-10-25 are pushing for more pay and protections through a potential union vote. 
Drivers are also in demand. 

Three Amazon delivery service partner (DSP) drivers this week told Reuters they successfully won higher pay. Two used offers from FedEx (NYSE:FDX) to squeeze their existing DSP employers for more. Another driver jumped to  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS), a union shop known for having some of the industry's best pay and benefits. 
Amazon previously said it plans to add 150,000 seasonal jobs in the United States, where lures for warehouse workers and other roles include average starting pay of more than $18 per hour and sign-on bonuses of up to $3,000.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) on Thursday sent a message to hundreds of union workers locked out of their jobs at its Beaumont, Texas, refinery saying that pay is greater at non-union sites. 
""We are not allowed to make promises, and we will not do so. We can report that non-represented employees at comparable sites are paid 5% to 7% more and have similar benefits,"" Exxon said in the message called a ""decertification update.""
The message comes about two weeks before the 585 locked-out workers begin voting on removing United Steelworkers (USW) union Local 13-243 from the 369,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery and adjoining lubricant oil plant.
An official with the United Steelworkers union 13-243 had no immediate comment about the company message.
The workers are scheduled to vote by mail between Nov. 12 and Dec. 22 in a decertification election overseen by the U.S. National Labor Relations Board that, if successful, will remove the USW. 
Last week, Exxon laid down two conditions for ending the lockout: Adoption of its proposed contract, or decertification of USW 13-243. 
A majority of union members rejected the contract proposal in a secret-ballot vote on Oct. 19. 
Exxon locked out the workers on May 1 after the union did not accept a proposal during four months of talks that eliminates job seniority, which gives employees a say over job assignments, assuring the most experienced workers operate refinery units, the USW has said.

Exxon has said ending job seniority and other changes are needed to ensure the refinery can be competitive in even low-margin environments. 
Exxon continues to operate the refinery at about 60% of its capacity with managers and supervisors as well as temporary operators.

While Vale's net income fell by almost half from the previous quarter, it surged 34% when compared with a year-ago period. 
Vale, one of the world's biggest iron ore miners, said its quarterly numbers were dented by iron ore prices that plunged 31% in the reported period, as well as a labor disruption at its Sudbury nickel mine in Canada that led to a hit in production.

LONDON (Reuters) - The world's largest aluminium recycler, Novelis, will invest $375 million in its Zhenjiang operation in China to expand recycling and production for aluminium products used in the auto industry, the company said on Friday.
Metal recycling will play an important role in the energy transition, which includes a switch to electric vehicles from internal combustion engine cars. 
Novelis, a subsidiary of India's Hindalco, expects to complete the expansion project by the middle of 2024.
""The investment will create a fully integrated supply chain for the automotive market in China between our Zhenjiang rolling and recycling facility and Changzhou automotive finishing plant,"" Novelis said.
Novelis, the world's largest supplier of automotive sheet, processes more than two million tonnes of aluminium scrap a year, resulting in an average of 61% recycled content in its products.
Recycling aluminum uses 95% less energy than producing primary aluminum.
""Recycling is a key component of our commitment to be carbon neutral by 2050 or sooner and we are committed to reducing our CO2 footprint by 30% by 2026,"" Novelis Chief Strategy and Sustainability Officer Pierre Labat told Reuters.
Labat said that 15% of Novelis's CO2 emissions are classed as Scope 1 and 2, with 85% in the Scope 3 category.
Scope 1 emissions are those from a company's direct operations, Scope 2 relates to power a company uses for its operations and Scope 3 emissions are from the products it sells.
""For us, the main thing will be to expand our recycling facilities to reduce our Scope 3 emissions; to recycle as much as we can instead of buying primary aluminium,"" Labat said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A U.S. House committee will subpoena major oil company executives for documents on what company scientists have said about climate change and any funds spent to mislead the public on global warming, the head of the panel said on Thursday.
Democrat Carolyn Maloney, chairwoman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, announced the subpoenas at the close of a hearing in which energy industry chiefs were grilled over climate.
""We need to get to the bottom of the oil industry's disinformation campaign with these subpoenas,"" said Maloney, who plans to go after documents from the companies and their trade groups about funding of ""shadow groups,"" public relations firms and social media companies.
The hearing was the first time members of Congress concerned about climate change questioned executives of top oil majors and trade groups under oath. Lawmakers said they had received some documents but not enough, and the committee expects its probe to last a year.
Appearing virtually before the panel were CEOs Darren Woods of ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Gretchen Watkins of Shell (LON:RDSa) Oil, David Lawler of BP (NYSE:BP) America and Mike Wirth of  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX). The panel also heard from officials at BP America and the heads of the American Petroleum Institute (API) and Chamber of Commerce. 
Representative Ro Khanna, a Democrat, told Reuters this week that the panel got some documents https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/big-oil-hearing-kick-off-us-probe-into-climate-disinformation-lawmaker-2021-10-27 from former Exxon lobbyist, Keith McCoy, who was secretly recorded by environmental group Greenpeace, saying the company's support of a carbon tax was a ruse, since the company believed the idea would never become law. 
The six-hour hearing focused on what Democrats called Big Oil's ""disinformation campaign"" to block climate action. It covered the period from the 1970s, when companies ignored their own research on climate risks of fossil fuels, to current advertising campaigns aimed at brandishing their green image.
Khanna said that while oil companies have started to improve their talking points, they have undermined these public statements by supporting lobbying groups that deny climate science or fight proposals to fight climate change.
""I don't believe that you purposely want to be out there spreading climate misinformation but you're out there funding these groups,"" Khanna said.
The energy executives said more time is needed for a transition to cleaner energy. None of them said yes when Khanna asked if they would commit to an independent audit to verify that none of their funds were going to groups that deny climate science, or whether they would commit to pulling their memberships from API if the oil lobby group keeps fighting policies such as electric vehicle credits and methane fees.
RESPONDING ACCORDINGLY
Oil executives and trade group officials at the hearing tried to distance themselves from previous efforts to dismiss climate science, saying their views have evolved.
Woods said Exxon ""responded accordingly"" when the ""scientific community's understanding of climate change developed"" and insisted that oil and gas are still needed to meet growing global energy demand.
Woods and Chevron's Wirth played up oil and gas as essential for operation of hospitals, schools and offices. 
BP America's Lawler and Shell's Watkins talked about their recognition that climate change was a problem in the 1990s and about their current efforts to adapt their business models to add more renewable energy and cut emissions. 
Representative James Comer, the panel's top Republican, did not mention climate in his opening remarks. He and other Republicans sought to link the current energy supply crunch to President Joe Biden's environmental policies, like cancelling the Keystone XL oil pipeline. 
""The purpose of this hearing is clear: to deliver partisan theater for prime-time news,"" Comer said. 
The lone Republican witness, Neal Crabtree, a welder who lost his job after Biden canceled Keystone, said his main crisis was not climate change but paying his mortgage and food bills.
'SETTING THE FUTURE ON FIRE'
Democrats said Big Oil's opposition to strong climate action leaves future generations at risk.
""One thing that often gets lost in these conversations is some of us have to actually live in the future that you all are setting on fire for us,"" Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 32, told the executives, all older than 50. 
The United Nations this summer released a report saying immediate and large-scale action is needed to reduce emissions or the average global temperature is likely to reach or cross the 1.5-degree Celsius (2.7 degrees F) warming threshold within 20 years. 
The committee contrasted the industry's advertising claims of support for the 2015 Paris climate agreement with the scant funding they have given. 
It released an analysis that showed Exxon's lobbying disclosures since 2015 have only one instance of lobbying on the Paris Agreement, and none on any of the 28 bills related to the pact. 
""Only 0.06% of Exxon's 1,543 total instances of legislative lobbying since 2015 has been devoted to the Paris Agreement or related legislation,"" the analysis said.
Woods emphasized Exxon's investments in carbon capture, a technology to capture emissions for burial underground or to pump them into aging oilfields to squeeze out more crude.
On the requested documents, Chevron said the company has been working to collect and produce them.

Exxon said it has produced nearly 130,000 pages of documents including internal emails. API said has been working with the committee ""consistent with our right to associate and engage in free speech"". 
The other companies and the Chamber did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

(Reuters) -Amazon.com Inc on Thursday reported a slump in profit that it expects will continue through the holiday quarter, as higher pay to attract workers and other operational disruptions diminish the company's windfall from online shopping. 
Shares fell 4% in after-hours trade.
After a year of blockbuster results, the world's largest online retailer is facing a tougher outlook. In a tight labor market, it has boosted average U.S. warehouse pay to $18 per hour and marketed ever bigger signing bonuses to attract blue-collar staff it needs to keep its high-turnover operation humming.
The company meanwhile is contending with global supply chain challenges. It has doubled its container processing ability, expanded its delivery partner program and has ramped up its warehouse investments - all at a noteworthy cost.
The company said it expects operating profit for the current quarter to be between $0 and $3.0 billion, short of $6.9 billion Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) posted the year prior. In the just-ended third quarter, net income fell by about 50% to $3.16 billion, a first since the start of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States.
Andy Jassy, who became CEO in July, in a statement said Amazon was confronting higher shipping costs, increased wages and worker shortages. These labor challenges, plus lost productivity and cost inflation, added $2 billion to Amazon's expenses in the quarter, an amount that's expected to double in the holiday period.
Amazon is ""doing whatever it takes to minimize the impact on customers and selling partners this holiday season,"" he said. ""It'll be expensive for us in the short term, but it's the right prioritization for our customers and partners.""
The retailer has strived to prevent a repeat of the 2013 season when delays left some without presents on Christmas Day.
Amazon's struggle to staff its warehouses spells challenges for rivals this holiday season. Retailers already have faced difficulty stocking their shelves with popular toys, gadgets and sneakers.
Supply chain woes are also costing Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) - $6 billion in sales during the company's fiscal fourth quarter according to results released on Thursday. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said that the impact will be even worse during the holiday sales quarter.
Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said Amazon's supply chain challenge surprised him because he believed the company had plenty of products on its shelves to swap for those stuck on container ships.
""I thought they would be fine because of selection,"" he said. ""Apparently that’s not true.""
LABOR SHORTAGE
Some analysts like Nicholas Hyett of  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) gave Amazon a pass. They say the company's track record of high spending to deliver for customers has paid off in the long run.
""Amazon has never been overly focused on the bottom line,"" Hyett said.
Still, Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said on a call with analysts that some costs were here to say. While the price tag for steel needed for warehouse construction had gone up, and while the company would look to procure such items more cheaply in the future, he said Amazon's base wage increases might be permanent.
He told reporters that Amazon had faced inconsistent staffing levels and that workers, not physical space, had become its primary capacity constraint in the third quarter. It wants to hire 150,000 more workers to meet U.S. seasonal demand this holiday.
This constraint has had a ripple effect.
""Inventory placement is frequently redirected to fulfillment centers that have labor to receive this product, which results in less optimal placement, which leads to longer and more expensive transportation routes,"" he said.
Staff are pushing for more, too. Around 2,000 workers in New York City petitioned this week for a vote on whether to make their warehouse the company's first unionized facility in the United States.
Olsavsky said Amazon had no announcement on whether to charge more for its loyalty club Prime subscriptions but added that the company always looks at that option.
To juice revenue, the company began encouraging customers to shop holiday deals as early as Oct. 4 this year. Consumers have begun returning to pre-pandemic shopping levels, spending more on travel and services, Olsavsky said.
The company forecast fourth-quarter sales to be between $130 billion and $140 billion. Analysts were expecting $142.05 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. It missed expectations for third-quarter sales as well, witnessing its slowest growth since the COVID-19 outbreak.

Amazon's cloud computing division was a bright spot. Olsavsky said revenue growth re-accelerated for that business, and the company beat analysts' expectations with net sales of $16.1 billion in the quarter. Amazon Web Services has seen sales rise with demand for gaming and remote work during the pandemic.
Amazon's total net sales rose to $110.8 billion in the third quarter; analysts had predicted $111.6 billion.

519,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2021 08:05PM ET</span>","Billionaire Leon Black sues rape accuser and law firm, alleging defamation and racketeering","By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Leon Black has escalated his battle against a former model who accused him of rape, filing a lawsuit on Thursday accusing her and her law firm of defamation and racketeering conspiracy.
In the complaint, lawyers for the former Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc chief executive accused Guzel Ganieva and the Wigdor law firm of engaging in a ""criminal enterprise,"" including by falsely linking Black to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
""Knowing that to him, and in his world, reputation matters, they set about to destroy him and make him pay anything to make them stop,"" the complaint filed in Manhattan federal court said. ""They are planning to line their own pockets with the results.""
Ganieva sued Black in a New York state court in June, accusing him of rape and other abuse, forcing her to sign a 2015 nondisclosure agreement about their 6-1/2-year relationship, and defaming her by claiming she tried to extort him.
""This is an obvious act of retaliation,"" Ganieva's lawyer Jeanne Christensen said in an email about Thursday's lawsuit. ""We look forward to defending ourselves against these ludicrous allegations.""
Black, 70, has forcefully denied https://www.reuters.com/world/us/leon-black-rejects-russian-womans-claims-violent-behavior-files-countersuit-2021-07-19 the claims of Ganieva, with whom he had what he now calls a ""regrettable"" consensual relationship from 2008 to 2014.
Those claims included that Black tried to arrange for Ganieva, now in her late 30s, to have sex with Epstein https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/leon-black-says-accuser-eyeing-payday-made-up-jeffrey-epstein-claims-2021-09-08 in 2008.
Black has said he paid Ganieva $100,000 a month for several years not to discuss their relationship after she tried to extort him of $100 million. Those payments stopped after Ganieva tweeted about Black in March.
In the state case, Black countersued Ganieva for defamation but dropped that claim, with his lawyer saying he wanted to focus on his defense.
Black recently bolstered his legal team, adding John Quinn, a name partner at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, and Susan Estrich, whose clients have included former Fox News chairman Roger Ailes.
""There is really no reason Mr. Black should be defending himself,"" Estrich, who said she has known Black since they studied at Dartmouth College in the 1970s, said in an interview. ""Private consensual adult conduct is not the law's business. Extortion and defamation are the business of the law.""

Black has publicly regretted his involvement with Epstein, who killed himself in a Manhattan jail in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.
Earlier this year, Black stepped down https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-apollo-global-ceo/leon-black-step-downs-as-apollo-ceo-after-review-of-epstein-ties-idUKKBN29U2LK from Apollo after an outside independent review found he had paid Epstein $158 million for tax and estate planning, though was not involved in Epstein's criminal activities.

Certain holders of the 9.5% U.S. dollar-denominated note maturing in 2024 received notification that they had been paid on Thursday, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private payments. Evergrande skipped an interest payment due Sept. 29, starting the clock on a 30-day grace period before investors could declare a default. 
The latest payment to international bondholders comes after Evergrande pulled back from the brink of default last week by meeting another delayed coupon before that grace period ended. While that payment surprised some investors, the firm’s dollar notes remain at distressed levels as creditors brace for an eventual debt restructuring that could rank among the largest ever in China.
Advisers to Evergrande and its bondholders earlier this week signed non-disclosure agreements in preparation for potential talks about managing developer’s debt load, Bloomberg earlier reported. The ad hoc bondholder group’s advisers are seeking to exchange information with the company in what’s often a first step toward negotiations for an overall restructuring deal. 
The payment buys more time for Evergrande as it tries to raise funds through asset sales. Chinese authorities have already begun laying the groundwork for a potential restructuring, assembling accounting and legal experts to examine the finances of the group.
Authorities have told Evergrande’s billionaire founder to use his personal wealth to alleviate the property giant’s debt woes. The directive adds to signs that Beijing is reluctant to orchestrate a government rescue even as crisis spreads to other developers, sours sentiment in the real estate market and threatens to roil the world’s second-largest economy. A top Chinese regulator this week called on companies to make “active preparations” to meet payments on their offshore bonds
The New York Times earlier reported on the coupon payment.

The company said settling the lawsuit https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crown-resorts-lawsuit-idUSKBN1DY028 for A$125 million ($94.25 million) was a ""commercial decision"" and comes days after Crown was found unsuitable to hold a gambling licence in Melbourne but was allowed to continue running it under supervision.
Shares of Crown dived 14% on Oct. 17, 2016 after it confirmed that some of its staff in China had been detained for illegally promoting gambling.
The settlement was without an admission of liability and Crown expects to recover a large portion of it from its insurers, which it cautioned was still subject to negotiations. 

Crown has been plagued by many damaging allegations, including of enabling money laundering and misleading regulators, which a Royal Commission called ""disgraceful"" in a report published on Tuesday.

522,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2021 07:01PM ET</span>",Starbucks sales miss as COVID-19 resurgence hits China,"By Praveen Paramasivam and Hilary Russ
(Reuters) -  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) missed market estimates for quarterly same-store sales on Thursday, as a COVID-19 resurgence in China closed stores in several major cities and overshadowed a strong performance by its U.S. business.
Fresh lockdowns to curb the spread of the Delta variant in Starbucks' largest growth market of China have also hit businesses of several other restaurant chains, including Yum China Holdings (NYSE:YUMC) Inc.
The coffee chain posted a 7% decline in China comparable sales in its fourth quarter, missing its forecast of roughly flat growth and offsetting a 22% jump in the United States.
The company forecast global comparable sales growth in the high single digits in its current fiscal year 2022. 
Shares fell more than 4% in aftermarket trading.
But Chief Executive Officer Kevin Johnson also said higher prices, higher wages, new unit development, automation in stores, speedier cooking equipment and other investments will help it beat rivals and push its operating margin to its ongoing target of 18% to 19% in fiscal 2023.
""This is the time to take that market share that we know we can take, and that market share gain is permanent,"" Johnson said in an earnings call. 
The company said it would open 2,000 net new locations globally in fiscal 2022 versus 1,173 in 2021, about 75% of them outside of the United States.
Johnson declined to say how much Starbucks would raise prices on Pumpkin Spice Lattes and other menu items. 
But he said that ""we are taking price and we will continue to take price in an inflationary environment.""
The chain will also invest in equipment - like warming ovens and cold brew systems - to speed up operations and let workers perform other tasks.
On Wednesday, Starbucks said it would raise pay for U.S. workers with at least two years of employment and offer $200 referral bonuses, as it grapples with a nationwide labor shortage.
Starbucks is also closing some locations early in order to redeploy staff to other stores, Chief Operating Officer John Culver said during the call.
The coffee chain also committed to $20 billion of share repurchases and dividends over the next three years.
Analysts say the pressure in China should be temporary as restrictions ease and Seattle-based Starbucks opens more stores in the world's second-largest economy to boost growth.

Global comparable sales rose 17% in the quarter ended Oct. 3, compared with analysts' average estimate of 18.5% growth, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Starbucks earned $1 per share on an adjusted basis - narrowly beating estimates of 99 cents.

(Reuters) -Gilead Sciences Inc on Thursday posted higher-than-expected third-quarter earnings on strong demand for its COVID-19 antiviral treatment, but said 2021 sales of its other drugs will fall short of earlier estimates.
Without Veklury, also known as remdesivir, Gilead (NASDAQ:GILD) said it now expects sales for the full year of around $21.5 billion. That is down from its previous mid-point estimate of $21.8 billion, reflecting the longer than expected impact of the pandemic on its business.
Gilead has said that sales, particularly of its flagship HIV drugs, have been hurt during the pandemic as many people avoided healthcare settings.
The biotechnology company also said results from a key trial of its drug Trodelvy in patients with a specific type of breast cancer have been delayed from this year until at least late January. The medication was the main driver of Gilead's $21 billion purchase of  Immunomedics  (NASDAQ:IMMU) last year.
""Nothing has changed in regard to our confidence"", Chief Executive Daniel O'Day said about the trial, on a conference call.
The company's shares, which closed at $67.34, were down 2.1% at $65.95 in extended trading.
Gilead reported adjusted quarterly earnings of $2.65 per share, soundly beating Wall Street estimates of $1.75 per share, as compiled by Refinitiv.
Revenue for the quarter rose 13% from a year earlier to $7.4 billion, ahead of the average analyst estimate of $6.26 billion.
But the outperformance was almost entirely driven by sales of Veklury, which more than doubled to $1.9 billion for the quarter.
Gilead's results were described as ""mixed"" by Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Michael Yee. Aside from Veklury, ""key product line items were generally flattish to lower,"" he said in a research note.
Use of Veklury, given intravenously to people hospitalized with COVID-19, is driven by pandemic hospitalization rates, which peaked in August and have been falling ever since, Gilead Chief Commercial Officer Johanna Mercier said.
Third-quarter sales of Gilead's HIV medicines dropped 8% to $4.2 billion as some drugs lost a patent protection and the pandemic continued to limit visits to doctors.
Sales of Trodelvy came in at $101 million for the quarter, in line with analyst estimates. 

Gilead raised its full-year adjusted earnings forecast to $7.90 to $8.10 per share from its prior projection of $6.90 to $7.25.
Including Veklury, the company said it now expects product sales for the year of $26 billion to $26.3 billion, up from a previous estimate of $24.4 billion to $25 billion.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Global equities moved toward record highs on Thursday and U.S. Treasury yields rose as investors discounted weak U.S. economic growth data to retain their focus on strong corporate results and interest rate expectations amid rising inflation.
U.S. gross domestic product increased at a 2% annualized rate last quarter, the slowest since the second quarter of 2020 when the economy was beset by COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, the Commerce Department said in its advance GDP estimate on Thursday. 
The weak GDP figure was offset by continued improvement in U.S. jobless claims, which dropped 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 281,000 last week, remaining below the 300,000 threshold for the third straight week.
""The GDP numbers are not a surprise since we've come off a bottom and it's going to slow to the normal pre-COVID pace,"" said Dan Genter, chief investment officer at RNC Genter Capital Management in Los Angeles. 
All three major U.S. stock indexes ended the day's session higher, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq boasting record closing levels thanks partly to gains by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc. Both companies posted results after the close that missed expectations, however.
The MSCI All World Stock Index rose 0.71% to 746.98 points, barely below its lifetime high of 749.16 points hit last month. 
In Europe, the STOXX index of 600 companies pared back earlier losses and rose 0.24% to 475.16 after the European Central Bank left its monetary policy unchanged, as widely expected.
The yield on the U.S. 20-year bond on Thursday rose slightly above the 30-year bond yield for the first time, according to traders, a move that garners attention because of investor sensitivity to inverted yield curves that can be a harbinger of recession.
Another key yield curve showing the spread between 2-year and 10-year yields was also flatter on the day.
The benchmark U.S. 10-year yield was trading up at 1.577%.
""With what we're seeing with PCE run rate, there's a feeling at some point in time the Feds are going to raise rates,"" Genter added.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.68% to 35,730.48, the S&P 500 gained 0.98% to 4,596.42 and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.39% to 15,448.12.
The U.S. dollar held losses to the euro and British pound late, as currency traders digested moves in interest rate markets, comments by the ECB President Christine Lagarde and a weaker-than-expected U.S. economic report.
The dollar index of major currencies lost nearly 0.6% to 93.349, with the euro up 0.67% to $1.1682.

Gold prices rose as demand for the safe-haven asset was lifted by a softer dollar and data showing the U.S. economy grew at its slowest pace in more than a year.
Spot gold rose 0.11% to $1,798.64 per ounce. U.S. gold futures settled up 0.2% at $1,802.6.

ROME (Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi presented his first budget on Thursday, aiming to lower the public deficit next year while cutting income and corporate tax.
Draghi, who took office in February at the head of a national unity government, said the tax reductions would amount to 12 billion euros ($14 billion), exceeding a figure of eight billion which circulated in earlier drafts of the budget.
The 2022 public deficit is targeted to fall to 5.6% of national output from 9.4% this year, reflecting strong economic growth and the end of stimulus measures introduced at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.
""This is an expansionary budget which will help the recovery,"" Draghi told reporters after a 3-hour cabinet meeting that approved the package.
""We are cutting taxes, stimulating investments and improving social spending with particular attention to women and young people,"" he said, adding that he expected economic growth this year to be ""well above"" Rome's official 6% forecast.
Draghi said the projected tax cuts would amount to 40 billion euros between 2022 and 2024, helping to reduce the heavy fiscal burden placed on Italian workers.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) estimates that in 2020 the average employee in Italy lost 46% of their gross salary in taxes and social contributions, the fifth-highest ratio out of a group of 37 advanced nations.
The new budget also increased the retirement age next year, stipulating that Italians will be able to draw a pension from the age of 64 provided they have paid in at least 38 years of contributions.
The new stopgap regime increases the retirement age by two years compared with the so-called ""quota 100"" system in place for the last three years, by which retirement was possible from the age of 62, with 38 years of contributions.
The issue has created tensions in Draghi's fractious coalition but the co-ruling, rightwing League party -- the main supporter of the quota 100 scheme -- said it was satisfied with the new arrangement for next year.
Draghi is continuing to negotiate with the ruling parties and trade unions over a longer-term solution.
With one of the world's oldest populations, Italy spends more than any other European country on pensions except Greece, Eurostat data shows. According to the Treasury, Rome's pension bill reached 17% of national output in 2020, an all-time record.
Draghi, whose government can only stay in office until 2023 at the latest, said he aimed to ensure that future pension pay-outs are based entirely on how much people have paid into the system.
Another thorny issue within Draghi's coalition is the so-called ""citizens' income"" poverty relief scheme championed by the 5-Star Movement, which Draghi said would be revised ""to prevent abuses"".
The government will increase checks on fraudulent claims of the welfare benefit, which will be withdrawn if a recipient refuses two job offers and gradually reduced after six months for people fit to work, Draghi said.

New taxes on plastics and sugary drinks, originally due to be applied at the start of 2020, will be delayed for a fifth time to 2023. [nL8N2RH5AL]

(Reuters) -  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) on Thursday said it plans to work with community colleges across the United States to fill 250,000 cybersecurity jobs over the next four years.
Microsoft said it will provide scholarships or assistance to about 25,000 students and will provide training for new and existing teachers at 150 community colleges across the country. The company also said that it will provide curriculum materials for free to all community colleges, as well as four-year schools, in the country.
""Over the next three years, we'll put many tens of millions of dollars behind this effort,"" Microsoft President Brad Smith said in a press briefing. ""This is an opportunity for us to get started. This is not the ceiling on what we'll do.""
Microsoft's efforts come as the United States has faced some of the broadest and most sophisticated hacks it has ever seen, including the SolarWinds attack that U.S. officials say hit scores of entities, including many in the federal government. President Joe Biden held a meeting https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-cyber-biden-idAFL1N2PW1YR with Microsoft and other large technology companies in August aimed at improving technology supply chain security.
Jobs emerged as a key concern from the White House meeting, with officials saying half a million jobs remain unfilled. 
Smith said many of the customers that Microsoft works with that have suffered hacks could have prevented or mitigated hacks by putting better practices in place, but many lack the cybersecurity personnel to do so.

""We clearly need to move quickly to train people to fill what are, frankly, great jobs in our view,"" Smith said, noting the jobs had average pay of more than $105,000 and that for every two jobs that are filled, one remains open.

(Reuters) -Shares of GlobalFoundries Inc, which is owned by Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment Co, opened flat on the Nasdaq on Thursday, giving the chipmaker a market capitalization of about $26 billion.
GlobalFoundries finished its first day of trading at $46.40, slightly lower than the $47 per share it priced in the initial public offering (IPO). The chip maker raised $2.6 billion in the third-largest IPO in the United States so far this year, trailing South Korean e-commerce giant Coupang Inc and ride hailing company Didi Global Inc .
GlobalFoundries, which disclosed revenue growth of 13% for the six months ended June 30, has benefited from surging demand for chips, due to a global shortage that has forced automakers and other electronics firms to cut production.
But the company's gross margins remain markedly lower than other chipmakers at 10.8% in the six months ended June 30, well below the margins of 40% or more enjoyed by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co or  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC).
In an interview with Reuters, Chief Executive Thomas Caulfield said margins have already risen to 17% in the third quarter and are likely to rise more as the company invests $6.5 billion - some of which comes from Thursday's IPO - in its factories.
He said those investments will help GlobalFoundries take advantage of brisk demand and that margins will keep improving ""in the future quarters as we continue to build our capacity with these investments.""
Caulfield said demand is likely to remain high for years, with acute shortages lasting into next year. ""I think it starts to get better in 2023,"" he said.
Caulfield declined to comment on reported takeover interest from Intel earlier this year, saying the company is focusing on being ""a standalone business"" with a focus on developing radio-frequency (RF) and low-power technologies.
Despite the lukewarm stock market reception for GlobalFoundries on Thursday, the IPO market in the United States has never been stronger. Numerous other big names such as Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) Global Inc,  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) and gaming platform Roblox have already gone public this year. 
Electric-vehicle maker Rivian is also expected to list its shares in the coming weeks.
U.S. IPOs, including those of special-purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), have raised an all-time record of over $250 billion so far this year, according to data from Dealogic. 
RIDING ON CHIP DEMAND
GlobalFoundries was created when Mubadala bought Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc's manufacturing facilities in 2009 and later merged it with Singapore's Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing Ltd.
The company, which makes radio-frequency communications chips for 5G, automotive, and other specialized semiconductors, counts AMD and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Inc among its customers.
GlobalFoundries is the world's third-largest foundry by revenue behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd and Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd, but ranks second when stripping out Samsung (KS:005930)'s foundry business that makes chips for other elements of the South Korean firm.
Mubadala, which has a majority stake in GlobalFoundries, will hold 89.4% of the company's shares and voting power after the offering.

Funds affiliated with Silver Lake have bought nearly $75 million worth of shares as part of a so-called private placement held alongside the IPO.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), BofA Securities, J.P. Morgan,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) were the lead underwriters for the IPO.

533,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2021 04:39PM ET</span>",U.S. congresswoman Greene bought Trump SPAC shares,"By Anirban Sen
(Reuters) -U.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, an ally of Donald Trump, bought as much as $50,000 worth of shares in the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) that has agreed to merge with the former president's new social media venture. 
Greene bought shares worth between $15,001 and $50,000 on Oct. 22, the day they rose in value by as much as 1,650% from what they were worth before the deal, as amateur traders and Trump supporters snapped them up, according to a regulatory filing published on Wednesday. 
The shares of the SPAC, Digital World Acquisition Corp, have given up most of their gains since Greene invested on Friday. 
“This transaction was reported in compliance with House rules and provides all required details about the transaction,"" said a spokesperson for Greene's congressional office. 
There is no suggestion that Greene broke any rules with her investment. Members of Congress are allowed to trade shares as long as they are not using non-public information. 
A firebrand Republican, Greene has often been criticized for provocative comments and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) has on occasions blocked her social media account. In June, the 47-year-old congresswoman from Georgia publicly apologized for comparing COVID-19 mask requirements and vaccinations to the Nazi Holocaust that killed 6 million Jews.
Digital World shares were up 73% on Thursday afternoon since the deal announcement, giving Trump's company, Trump Media & Technology Group, a valuation of about $6.3 billion. The company's social media app has not yet launched even on a trial basis, yet it has big ambitions given Trump's previous social media following.

He had 89 million followers on Twitter, 33 million on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and 24.5 million on Instagram, before he was banned for encouraging his supporters to participate in the U.S. Capital attack on Jan. 6.
Trump and other Trump Media & Technology Group shareholders will initially own 69% of the combined company after the merger with the SPAC, a regulatory filing showed this week. Their ownership could reach 77% if the company's stock meets certain price milestones.

535,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2021 04:37PM ET</span>",Shell says break-up of group would not work in real life,"By Shadia Nasralla
LONDON (Reuters) -Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) hit back on Thursday against an activist fund's call for the company to break up, with top executives saying its businesses operate better together than apart.
Hedge fund Third Point (NYSE:SPNT), which has built a large stake in Shell, on Wednesday called for the oil major to split into multiple companies to improve its performance. 
The push was the latest broadside against global oil and gas giants, who have faced calls from governments and climate-conscious investors to shift to renewable energy while still meeting current high levels of fossil fuel demand.
Shell, along with other European oil majors, has set targets to slowly move away from oil production while investing in non-fossil energy sources like solar and wind power. 
Billionaire Daniel Loeb, who runs Third Point, said on Wednesday that the company is being pushed in ""too many different directions,"" and that it should consider separating its legacy energy production from renewables and liquefied natural gas (LNG) businesses, a notion company officials rejected.
""If you were to split that into component pieces, I think that can sound really interesting from a financial perspective,"" finance chief Jessica Uhl told reporters on Thursday.
""But in terms of real solutions, I think that breaks down and our ability to integrate and bring these different pieces of the puzzle together will be how we uniquely make a difference in the energy transition.""
Shell Chief Executive Ben van Beurden told reporters that Shell's strategy is coherent and well understood by a majority of its shareholders.
Loeb did not respond to a request for comment Thursday.
Over the past two years, Shell shares have posted a total return of negative 16%, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. Those returns lag U.S. majors  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX), though over a longer period, Shell and other European companies have outperformed their U.S. counterparts, who have focused less on emissions reduction and renewable investments. 
""If nothing else, the move by Third Point signals that Shell has not convinced the investment community that there is value in keeping all of these businesses in-house,"" said Andrew Logan, senior director of oil and gas at Ceres, a nonprofit organization that works with institutional investors and companies. 
Shell reported third-quarter profit of $4.13 billion on Thursday, below analyst forecasts. Shares fell 3.2% on Thursday. 
Loeb, in his letter on Wednesday, said Shell would benefit from a different structure that would let it cut costs and invest more aggressively in decarbonization. 
However, Iain Pyle, investment director at UK-based Abrdn, one of Shell's top 10 largest shareholders according to Refinitiv Eikon data, said while breaking the company into faster- and slower-growing pieces has a certain ""spreadsheet logic"" to it, he would probably not support Loeb's campaign.
""There are few companies out there where I would imagine the divisions are as kind of interlocked and interwoven as they are at Shell,"" Pyle said. ""The upstream feeds the trading business feeds the refinery, feeds the chemicals plant, feeds the retail arm, and breaking it apart is quite tough."" 
(GRAPHIC: Shell returns over time: https://tmsnrt.rs/3EoIGwb)
Shell set itself a tougher emissions-cutting targets for its direct emissions, aiming to halve them by 2030 in absolute terms rather than just cutting intensity-based emissions, which leaves open the possibility of an overall increase. 
Shell's direct emissions are dwarfed by the emissions caused by the combustion of its products through its customers, known as Scope 3. 
The company has pledged to become a net-zero emissions company by 2050, but is under pressure to make faster progress, with a Dutch court https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/dutch-court-orders-shell-set-tougher-climate-targets-2021-05-26 ordering it in May to cut all of its emissions - including Scope 3 - by 45% by 2030.
Shell is appealing the court ruling, with van Beurden saying earlier this year that ""a court ordering one energy company to reduce its emissions – and the emissions of its customers – is not the answer"" to reducing global emissions. 

Coal and natural gas demand has already reached new peaks, surpassing pre-pandemic levels, with oil not far behind. Gas and power prices surged this autumn as tight gas supplies have collided with strong demand in economies recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Shell's cash flow from operations in the quarter rose by around 54% on the year to $16 billion, which in turn helped it to reduce net debt to $57.5 billion, compared with $65.7 billion in the previous quarter.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. banks will not be required to report additional information about certain accounts to the Internal Revenue Service after Democrats removed the proposal from a sweeping government spending package.
The exclusion of the provision, originally sought by some Democratic lawmakers as a way to identify people underreporting income on their taxes, marks a major victory for banks and credit unions that had vigorously opposed the provision.
U.S. President Joe Biden unveiled https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-give-update-democrats-spending-plans-before-europe-trip-source-2021-10-28 the framework for a $1.75 trillion economic and climate change plan on Thursday, his latest attempt to unify Democrats in Congress behind a comprehensive bill pursuing many of his top policy priorities.
Earlier versions of the package, which reached as high as $3 trillion in new investments, also included language requiring banks to report to the IRS any bank accounts that had $600 in money in or out every year. That proposal was not included in the framework outlined by the White House on Thursday. 
Proponents, including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, argued that the information would make it easier for tax collectors to identify accounts that experienced significantly higher activity than reported on taxes, and also raise large amounts of revenue to help pay for the new spending proposals.

The banking industry, calling the provision onerous and intrusive, launched an all-out lobbying battle against it. Democrats attempted to temper the provision by raising the reporting threshold to $10,000, but intense industry opposition, alongside concerns from moderate Democrats, helped push it out of the revamped package.
""The last thing Americans want right now is the government snooping on their accounts,"" said Jim Nussle, head of the Credit Union National Association. ""Safeguarding consumer privacy and data security is a key part of promoting financial well-being for all, and it's encouraging that Congress recognizes this credit union priority.""

Economically sensitive cyclical sectors, meanwhile, pared some losses from a day earlier despite data showing a third-quarter slowdown in the economy.
Third-quarter GDP rose 2.0% on an annualized basis in the third quarter, well below the 2.6% gain expected.
That was the weakest pace in five quarters as the impact of the Delta variant of coronavirus ""slowed consumer demand, and higher prices which eroded real demand across all sectors,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
Bets on economic growth nearing the end, however, are misplaced as the consumers continue to spend and monetary policy remains accommodative.

""There is a wall of money, interest rates are still close to zero, people are coming out of the second wave of the pandemic because of increased vaccination rates and that's driving extreme growth,"" Conzo added.

It operates The Home Depot stores that sell various building materials, home improvement products, lawn and garden products, and décor products.
U.S. retail sales rose 0.7% in September, and several companies have been reporting strong third-quarter earnings. Nevertheless, concerns surrounding the economic recovery, due to the continuing spread of COVID-19, rising inflation, and a supply chain crisis, have raised questions about the sustainability of the market’s uptrend. Amid this environment, we think it could be wise to invest in mega-cap retailer stocks because of their market dominance and solid long-term growth prospects. Both WMT and HD could generate steady returns in the long run.
HD’s shares have gained 9% in price over the past month, while WMT has returned 3.7%. Also, HD’s 16.1% gains over the past six months are significantly higher than WMT’s 6.6% returns. Furthermore, HD is the clear winner with 40.2% gains versus WMT’s 2.3% returns in terms of year-to-date performance.

MILAN (Reuters) -Telecom Italia (TIM) will press ahead with plans to attract new investors and get greater value from its assets, its CEO said on Thursday, after the group further cut its 2021 core profit guidance on the back of worsening conditions in its domestic market. 
The fresh downward revision, announced late on Wednesday, follows a cut in July and heaps investor pressure on Luigi Gubitosi, CEO of Italy's biggest telecoms group, who won a second term in February.
A source close to TIM's top investor Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY), which backed Gubitosi's reappointment in February, said late on Wednesday that the French media company remained committed to TIM despite the group's disappointing results.
However, a person with knowledge of the matter said Vivendi had written to TIM Chairman Salvatore Rossi on Thursday asking that an extraordinary board meeting is convened to discuss the reorganisation.
TIM shares closed down 5.7% at 0.3175 euros on Thursday after earlier hitting a low of 0.31 euros, a level last seen in early November 2020. The stock has lost 12% since the beginning of the year against a 21% rise in Milan's blue-chip index.
Debt-laden TIM is grappling with aggressive price competition in its key home market, with revenue and margins shrinking as the group faces the costs of upgrading its network and revamping its business.
Banca Akros analysts said in a note the guidance cut, while not completely unexpected, ""signals a difficult scenario and will trigger further estimates' downgrades."" 
TIM said its board had discussed on Wednesday a possible reorganisation of the group's business to get greater value from the group's assets and had asked Gubitosi to continue to study options.
""What I got yesterday was an encouragement to continue the exploration and then to report back the opportunities that we have,"" Gubitosi told analysts in a conference call on Thursday.
TIM has previously planned to tackle some of the domestic challenges by developing fast-growing adjacent business units, such as cloud, cybersecurity and Internet of Things ventures.
A sale of a minority stake in its cloud unit Noovle could be carried out in the second half of next year, Gubitosi said, adding that an upcoming business plan would be ""more stringent"" on costs.
Other parts of TIM's business could be carved out to allow the entrance of new partners, following similar deals the group secured for its mobile and fixed-network assets.

""We are very committed on extracting value from our portfolio"", Gubitosi said.

549,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2021 03:26PM ET</span>","Bombardier, Textron business jet backlogs swell but supply chain headwinds loom","By Allison Lampert and Sanjana Shivdas
(Reuters) -Bombardier Inc and rival  Textron Inc  (NYSE:TXT) on Thursday reported growing backlogs for corporate aircraft as demand for private flights soars, but executives warned of supply chain headaches. 
Executives from both companies told analysts they see corporate aircraft activity picking up in Europe, adding to strong demand in the United States that is filling seats and boosting plane prices after orders slipped last year due to COVID-19.
Cessna business jet maker Textron raised its full-year earnings per share and cash guidance, after General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD) said on Wednesday its Gulfstream business jet backlog reached a six-year high.
Corporate planemakers, eager to take advantage of strong demand, are taking steps to mitigate the impact of global supply chain disruptions, including supply and pricing of raw materials, logistics and labor shortages among smaller suppliers.
European planemaker Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) also flagged supply chain issues on Thursday.
While Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF) has not faced any assembly line interruptions, the business jet maker is taking steps to deploy more staff to suppliers’ sites ""to maintain clear visibility,” Chief Executive Eric Martel said.
Montreal-based Bombardier posted a smaller third-quarter loss largely in line with analysts' estimates and generated $100 million in free cash from operations, a metric closely watched by investors, reversing negative usage from last year.
Bombardier's backlog increased by about $500 million to $11.2 billion, while Textron Aviation reported a backlog of $3.5 billion at quarter-end, up $1.9 billion year to date.
Textron said the company is ramping up business aircraft manufacturing toward a goal of hitting 2019 production levels. Bombardier has not announced any changes to rates as it balances supply chain capacity, demand and pricing.
Bombardier recently unveiled an upscale variant of its Challenger 350 business jet as it vies to protect its dominant midsized market share.
Martel said two new large-cabin models announced recently by Gulfstream would not threaten the Challenger family.
""I think our competitor now just positioned themselves right at the top of that segment, leaving a lot of room in the midsized segment for us,"" he said.
Martel told reporters later in the day that Bombardier is still looking at the segment below its largest-cabin Global jets as an area for potential updates.

""We have a major market segment right now that has not been fully leveraged and exploited,"" he said.
Bombardier posted an adjusted net loss of 4 cents per share in the quarter, compared with a loss of 9 cents per share a year earlier. Analysts were expecting a loss of 5 cents per share, according to Refinitiv.

LONDON (Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)'s https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebooks-zuckerberg-kicks-off-its-virtual-reality-event-with-metaverse-vision-2021-10-28 algorithms demote rather than promote polarising content, its global head of safety told British lawmakers on Thursday, adding that the U.S. company would welcome effective government regulation.
Governments in Europe and the United States are grappling with regulating social media platforms to reduce the spread of harmful content, particularly for young users.
Britain is leading the charge by bringing forward laws that could fine social media companies up to 10% of their turnover if they fail to remove or limit the spread of illegal content. 
Secondary legislation that would make company directors liable could be proposed if the measures do not work.
Facebook https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-asks-employees-preserve-internal-documents-legal-inquiries-2021-10-27 whistleblower Frances Haugen https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-sees-safety-cost-whistleblower-says-2021-10-25 told the same committee of lawmakers on Monday that Facebook's algorithms pushed extreme and divisive content to users.
Facebook's Antigone Davis denied the charge.
""I don't agree that we are amplifying hate,"" Davis told the committee on Thursday, adding: ""I think we try to take in signals to ensure that we demote content that is divisive for example, or polarising.""
She said she could not guarantee a user would not be recommended hateful content, but Facebook was using AI to reduce its prevalence to 0.05%.
""We have zero interest in amplifying hate on our platform and creating a bad experience for people, they won't come back,"" she said. ""Our advertisers won't let it happen either.""
Davis said Facebook, which announced on Thursday it would rebrand as Meta, wanted regulators to contribute to making social media platforms safer, for example in research into eating disorders or body image.

""Many of these are societal issues and we would like a regulator to play a role,"" she said, adding Facebook would welcome a regulator with ""proportionate and effective enforcement powers"". 
""I think criminal liability for directors is a pretty serious step and I'm not sure we need it to take action.""

One big announcement: Facebook will change its corporate name to Meta while preserving its various brands. The company will start trading under the ticker MVRS in December. 
The moves come amid renewed scrutiny of Facebook, not only for its size but also for its handing of misinformation on its platforms. A former employee who turned whistleblower recently testified to Congress that the company puts profit ahead of safety.
In a video to kick off the even Thursday, Zuckerberg said, ""I know that some people will say that this isn't a time to focus on the future, and I want to acknowledge that there are important issues to work on in the present. There always will be,"" 
He continued: ""So for many people, I'm just not sure there ever will be a good time to focus on the future. But I also know that there are a lot of you who feel the same way that I do.""
The company's Connect event was its eighth, where it revealed new innovations and products designed for augmented and virtual reality as part of its plans to help build a metaverse. 
In his keynote speech, Zuckerberg said that the metaverse is ""a ways off"" but that it is ""starting to take shape.""
Some of the new products mentioned were: The Horizon Marketplace where Facebook said the company will have a virtual marketplace for users to buy and sell virtual goods, Messenger calling in VR, a fitness accessories pack for Oculus, educational tools and experiences for VR, high-end VR headset codenamed Cambria, and hand and body tracking for self-expression through AR.
Facebook's shares rose 3.5% to over $323.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -American Airlines Chief Executive Doug Parker on Thursday sounded the alarm about disruptive and violent incidents onboard U.S. airplanes after a flight attendant was physically assaulted, prompting a flight diversion.
""This type of behavior has to stop,"" Parker said in a video posted on Instagram https://www.instagram.com/p/CVlEKgSD-F-. ""American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) will not tolerate airport or inflight misconduct of any kind."" 
American said a New York to Santa Ana, California, flight on Wednesday diverted to Denver after a passenger assaulted a flight attendant.
U.S. airlines have reported a record number of violent incidents this year and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) pledged a ""zero tolerance"" approach.
Parker called the latest incident ""one of the worst displays of unruly behavior we’ve ever witnessed."" 
A passenger on the flight told CBS https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2021/10/28/aa-flight-from-new-yorks-jfk-to-john-wayne-airport-diverts-to-denver-after-flight-attendant-attacked-by-passenger Los Angeles that the flight attendant had blood splattered on her mask after she had been punched. The passenger was arrested when the plane made its unplanned stop in Denver.
On Oct. 8, President Joe Biden said he instructed the Justice Department to ""deal"" with https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-says-us-will-deal-with-violence-airplanes-2021-10-07 the rising number of violent incidents onboard planes.
FAA Administrator Steve Dickson imposed the zero-tolerance order on passenger disturbances aboard airplanes after supporters of former U.S. President Donald Trump were disruptive on flights around the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol attack. He has said the zero-tolerance order will last until least mid-January.
Through Monday, there have been 4,941 reports of unruly passenger incidents, including 3,580 related to pandemic face covering regulations.
The FAA has initiated enforcement actions in 216 cases, issuing more than $1 million in proposed fines.
Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin told U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland at a hearing on Wednesday that flight attendants were facing thousands of confrontations over wearing masks on aircraft. ""This has to be taken seriously. These assaults in the so-called name of liberty are unacceptable,"" Durbin said.
In June, a group representing major U.S. airlines such as American, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and United Airlines as well as aviation unions asked Garland to prosecute violent air passengers.
A union representing Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) workers said in May that a flight attendant ""was seriously assaulted, resulting in injuries to the face and a loss of two teeth.""

Delta in September called on other U.S. airlines to share lists of passengers who have been banned during the COVID-19 pandemic for disruptive behavior to help deter the rising number of incidents. Delta said since the pandemic began it has put more than 1,600 people on its ""no fly"" list.
Parker said the passenger who assaulted the flight attendant would be banned from the airline.

Investing.com – The Nasdaq climbed to record highs Thursday, as investors piled into big tech ahead of the final wave of big tech earnings from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).
The Nasdaq  rallied 1.2%, and had earlier notched a record of 15,425.6 The S&P 500 rose 0.16% to remain close to its all-time high of 4,598.36. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.52%, or 186 points.
Apple and Amazon led the gains for big tech as investors increased their bullish bets on the stocks ahead of the duo’s quarterly reports due after the market close.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), meanwhile, announced it would change its name to Meta. The news came out at its virtual reality conference, where it showcased a preview of its ambitions to build the metaverse as it seeks to diversify beyond social media. The company will trade under the ticker ""MVRS"" starting Dec. 1.
eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) shares slipped about 6% after its fourth-quarter revenue guidance fell short of estimates, stoking worries about its sales ahead of the holidays.
Economically sensitive cyclical sectors, meanwhile, pared some losses from a day earlier despite data showing a third-quarter slowdown in the economy.
Third-quarter GDP rose 2.0% on an annualized basis in the third quarter, well below the 2.6% gain expected.
That was the weakest pace in five quarters as the impact of the Delta variant of coronavirus ""slowed consumer demand, and higher prices which eroded real demand across all sectors,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
Bets on economic growth nearing the end, however, are misplaced as the consumers continue to spend and monetary policy remains accommodative.
""I don't see the growth story ending anytime soon,"" Robert Conzo, CEO of Wealth Alliance told Investing.com in an interview on Thursday.
""There is a wall of money, interest rates are still close to zero, people are coming out of the second wave of the pandemic because of increased vaccination rates and that's driving extreme growth,"" Conzo added.
U.S. Treasury yields shrugged off the weaker data, helping bank stocks climb higher, boosting financials.
Cincinnati Financial (NASDAQ:CINF), Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK),  First Republic Bank  (NYSE:FRC) were more than 1% higher.
Consumer discretionary stocks were also in the ascendency, led by gains in Smith AO (NYSE:AOS) and  United Rentals  (NYSE:URI) following better-than-expected quarterly results.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Ford also supported the sector, with latter surging following blowout quarterly results.
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) reported earnings of 51 cents that markedly topped Wall Street’s forecasts, and raised its full-year guidance, sending its shares up more than 10%.
Energy lagged the broader market move higher as oil prices added to losses from a day earlier amid concerns about demand outlook.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Washington-area subway system said on Thursday subway service will stay sharply reduced through at least Nov. 15 as it works on restoring railcars to service after a derailment on Oct. 12.
On Oct. 17, the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission ordered the subway system to indefinitely remove about 60% of its railcars following inspections after the derailment. 
The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), known as the Metro, serves the U.S. capital and parts of Maryland and Virginia. It has urged commuters to take buses or use other transit modes. WMATA said it was working to boost the number of trains available for daily service from 31 to 50.
WMATA general manager Paul Wiedefeld said he did not want to put out a date for improving service. ""That's going to be ready when it's safe,"" Wiedefeld said on Thursday.
Average Metrorail weekday ridership fell about 25% in the days after the reduced service began, WMATA said last week.
The commission ordered WMATA's 748 7000-Series trains removed from service after the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) ""identified safety concerns related to the spacing of wheels on 7000-Series railcar axles.""
The NTSB said WMATA had been aware of wheel assembly issues since 2017. It was a 7000-Series train that was involved in the derailment two weeks ago outside Washington in Arlington, Virginia.
The derailment did not injure any of the 187 passengers onboard, but NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy said the incident could have been ""catastrophic.""

WMATA has had sharply lower ridership during the pandemic. It said on Thursday it estimates in the 2023 budget year it will see total ridership at about 53-55% and total revenue at 47-48% of pre-pandemic levels.
WMATA predicts current year ridership will be about one-third of pre-COVID levels and forecast usage returning to pre-pandemic levels by 2025.

(Reuters) -Canadian e-commerce giant Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) Inc reported a 46% rise in quarterly revenue as consumer spending ""normalizes"" after a year of a pandemic-fueled online shopping frenzy, sending its shares up 9%.
The widespread shift to e-commerce at the height of the pandemic had brought a wave of new business to Shopify, which provides infrastructure for retailers to set up their stores online and generates revenue mainly through subscriptions and merchant services.
However, on a call with analysts, Shopify executives flagged ""pressures in supply chain"" for the key holiday shopping season.
Companies across the globe have sounded alarm bells on supply issues that have pushed costs higher and made some products scarce.
Shopify raked in billions of dollars over the past year, growing quarterly revenue by over 90% in four of the last six quarters.
It has been able to maintain a healthy growth rate even as people stepped out of their homes and bigger rivals like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) bolster their offerings to retain customers.
""The strength of Shopify's flywheel was on display within the more normalized spending environment we saw this past quarter, as more merchants used more of our platform to start and grow their businesses,"" said Shopify's finance chief, Amy Shapero.
The company's subscription solutions revenue jumped by 37% to $336.2 million in the quarter ended Sept. 30.
Analysts are optimistic about Shopify's business model, which is driven primarily by mom-and-pop stores.

""Shopify was a high-growth company long before COVID, and it's going to be a high-growth company after the pandemic tailwinds fade,"" said Samad Samana, analyst at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF).

(Reuters) - Taco Bell owner Yum Brands Inc beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly revenue and profit on Thursday, as strong demand for its fried chicken and tacos cushioned the blow from a slowdown in sales at its Pizza Hut chain. 
The company also benefited from customers returning to its restaurants in the United States, Canada and Europe following vaccinations, even as rising concerns over the Delta variant of the coronavirus kept consumers away from its chains in other markets.
Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) and McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) have also delivered a strong beat in the third quarter, aided by product price hikes and the reopening of seating areas in their restaurants.
""We did see a return to dine-in, yet we saw digital sales go up ... that is still something that is going to continue to grow for us,"" Yum Brands Chief Executive Officer David Gibbs said on a call with analysts.
Taco Bell, which reintroduced its breakfast menu in the quarter, delivered an 8% jump in system sales - which excludes the impact of foreign currency translation - while KFC's sales were up 3% in the United States.
However, Yum Brands' Pizza Hut division saw its U.S. system sales drop 2% in the quarter, as pizza chains grapple with a slowdown in delivery demand following a surge during last year's lockdowns.
Shares of the company were down 1% at $124.81.
Earlier this month, rival Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) Inc posted its first drop in U.S. same-store sales in over a decade amid a tight labor market that created a shortage of drivers. 

Yum Brands said it was well-positioned to tackle rising industry-wide inflation and growing labor shortages.

LONDON (Reuters) -The global semiconductor chip shortage cost Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Stellantis a combined 1.4 million vehicles in lost production in the third quarter, Europe's two biggest carmakers said on Thursday, though both reported some early signs of improvement. 
Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), Europe's top car company and also the world's No. 2, cut its outlook for deliveries, toned down sales expectations and warned of cost cuts as it reported lower-than-expected quarterly operating profit.
The German company said it had made around 800,000 fewer cars, or about 35% less than in the same quarter in 2020. 
Stellantis, the world's fourth largest automaker, posted a 14% fall in pro-forma quarterly revenue after chip shortages cut planned quarterly production by 30%, or 600,000 vehicles.
Stellantis finance chief Richard Palmer reported a ""moderate"" improvement in chip supply in October, and expected that to continue through the fourth quarter.
But he added supply chain problems meant it was hard to make predictions about the scarcity of automotive semiconductors, which has plagued the industry for most of the year. 
""Visibility on semiconductors continues to be a difficult subject for the industry,"" Palmer said.
Carmakers, which shuttered plants as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold last year, have found themselves competing against the sprawling consumer electronics industry for chip supplies.
Supply chain snarls from a fire at a chip-making plant in Japan to coronavirus lockdowns in Malaysia, central to global chip supplies, have only compounded the industry's problems. 
The shortage of chips, used in everything from brake sensors to power steering to entertainment systems, has led automakers around the world to cut or suspend production, pushing up both new and used vehicle prices amid robust demand from consumers.
Stellantis' new vehicle inventories were down more than 42% year-on-year at the end of September. 
Palmer told analysts that, ""given the volatility of the market,"" Stellantis was not currently expecting large production increases in 2022, but would focus more on maintaining price levels while battling rising raw material costs.
He said lost production could push Stellantis' 2021 revenue ""a touch lower"" than its previous forecast.
Volkswagen finance chief Arno Antlitz said chip shortages ""made it abundantly clear to us that we are not yet resilient enough to fluctuations in capacity utilization."" 
""Even though the visibility of the situation still remains difficult to forecast, we see the start of stabilisation of the chip supply and expect"" key financials to improve in the fourth quarter, Antlitz told journalists. 
Volkswagen's made a third-quarter operating profit of 2.8 billion euros ($3.3 billion), down 12% on last year and lower than the 2.99 billion Refinitiv forecast.

562,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2021 01:14PM ET</span>","Asia reopening boosts travel, fashion brands; pandemic winners take backseat","By Sayantani Ghosh and Byron Kaye
SINGAPORE/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Fashion brands and airlines are creeping back into investors' good graces in Asia as lockdowns ease and vaccination rises, boosting travel and leisure activities, taking some shine off pandemic stalwarts such as supermarkets and gadget makers.
Earnings report cards show that people are spending less time watching TV or shopping online for groceries as they resume dining out or plan vacations after emerging from coronavirus curbs. Luxury purchases from China's big spenders, still unable to travel abroad, are also rebounding.
Asia-Pacific airlines are offering more flights as some countries resume domestic travel, and some like Singapore allow quarantine-free travel for select vaccinated visitors. Australia's planned reopening of state and international borders has led to a surge in bookings.
""There is massive demand for loved ones wanting to get together for Christmas,"" Alan Joyce, CEO of Australia's Qantas Airways said last week. ""There is demand for people wanting to take that holiday that they have been looking forward to for nearly two years.""
To be sure, a recovery in the tourism sector in Asia is months away and China's huge domestic travel market remains in flux. As well, businesses including McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) are still struggling with frequent and temporary curbs that countries impose to control outbreaks.
But airline stocks in the Asia Pacific region climbed nearly 5% over the last three months while global airlines slipped 6% due to a slower-than-expected return of corporate travel. 
The broader MSCI All Country Asia Pacific Price Index rose roughly 2% in the same period.
European fashion houses like LVMH and  Kering  (PA:PRTP) have signaled ongoing strong demand in China as appetite for luxury items remains largely undimmed, despite power shortages and a property sector crisis hurting the economy.
""China's population and its middle classes are increasing and their appetite for beauty is not satisfied,"" L'Oreal CEO Nicolas Hieronimus said last week.
Hieronimus expects a recent shift in Chinese government policy to narrow the gap between rich and poor to boost the middle class, a sentiment echoed by LVMH.
Japan's Fast Retailing reported record profits in China last quarter, where it will open its first flagship store next month. Japanese cosmetics giant Shiseido Co believes next summer will be a ""turning point"" as inbound tourists from China return.
EARLY WINNERS
Companies globally are struggling with severe labour shortages, supply bottlenecks and marine logjams as economies bounce back from pandemic lows, resulting in a steep rise in costs. A long-running chip shortage has disrupted the auto industry and slammed production at the biggest car makers around the world.
For supermarkets, among the early winners of the pandemic when people scrambled to stockpile food and toilet paper, the rising inflation is likely to offset some of the post-pandemic slowdown.
Australian grocer Woolworths said on Wednesday that food sales started to slow in October. Its shares have fallen 10% since mid-August when the pace of vaccinations started picking up. The stock rose nearly 40% during the 17 months prior, when coronavirus restrictions were in place.
""The big question now is how many people will return to the offices, how will that play out in terms of at-home consumption?"", said Morningstar retail analyst Johannes Faul. 
Pandemic winners are unlikely to turn losers overnight, though, said Jason Teh, chief investment officer at Vertium Asset Management in Sydney. But work-from-home trends that benefitted companies like Australian electronics retailer JB Hi-Fi were waning as vaccination surged, he said.
China's smartphone sales in the third quarter fell 9% from a year earlier, according to Counterpoint Research.

While pent up demand from supply bottlenecks is likely to support a seasonally strong holiday quarter, sales are starting to slow at chipmakers and component suppliers such as South Korea's Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) and LG Display (NYSE:LPL).
""LCD panels for televisions are expected to see further drops in the fourth quarter as vaccinated people have begun to spend less time in front of screens,"" said Park Sung-soon, Seoul-based analyst at Cape Investment & Securities.

It is also a significant theme as earnings reports continue to file in. One of the biggest questions ahead of earnings season was how supply chain challenges and inflation would affect corporate margins. The answer is, so far, so good. But should we be concerned with inflation and its effect on the S&P 500 (SPY) going forward? I’ll discuss this and more below….(Please enjoy this updated version of my weekly commentary published October 27, 2021 from the POWR Value newsletter).
As markets continue to hit new heights, one concern lurking in the shadows is inflation. Last year, many market ""gurus"" predicted that inflation wouldn't be an issue. But it is undoubtedly a reality now. While it may be transitory, I do expect it to last into next year.
The question right now is how long does transitory really mean. Fed Chair Powell has even recently noted that inflation might be stickier than previously forecasted. In fact, he recently commented, ""Supply-side constraints have gotten worse. The risks are clearly now to longer and more-persistent bottlenecks, and thus to higher inflation.""

567,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2021 12:46PM ET</span>",Second to none: fashion resalers bulk up to capitalize on booming sales,"By Uday Sampath Kumar
(Reuters) - Second-hand clothing firms are fighting to snap up smaller rivals and lock in investment as demand for thriftwear booms on the back of supply chain snarl-ups for traditional retailers ahead of the peak holiday shopping period.
Newly listed companies such as Poshmark Inc and ThredUp Inc are starting to scoop up smaller firms to fend off competition from deep-pocketed apparel brands such as  Levi Strauss & Co  (NYSE:LEVI) and Urban Outfitters Inc (NASDAQ:URBN), which have launched their own thrifting businesses.
Volume growth is essential for second-hand clothing companies to turn in steady profits in an industry notorious for tight margins and inconsistent inventory, analysts say. 
""Companies like ThredUp and Poshmark have to demonstrate growth, and one of the things that they will probably do in the next few years is acquire other players, maybe in foreign countries,"" Neil Saunders, managing director of research firm GlobalData, said.
The resale industry is expected to grow 11 times faster than the broader retail clothing sector in the period to 2025, according to GlobalData, driven also by a growing awareness of fast fashion's environmental toll. 
That could make the industry a magnet for deals as companies look to grow quickly to capitalize on a boom that industry estimates suggest could more than double the size of the U.S. second-hand apparel market to $76.4 billion by 2025. 
(GRAPHIC: Thrifting boom - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-RETAIL/egvbkmgexpq/chart.png) 
Poshmark, a platform for peer-to-peer sales that takes a 20% cut of each transaction, made its first acquisition earlier this month, of a company that authenticates sneakers. 
It is eyeing more takeover deals, especially in overseas markets, as it looks to put more than $500 million in cash on its balance sheet to work. 
""So far, the four countries we've entered - U.S., Canada, Australia and India - have all been organic, but there certainly are opportunities for inorganic growth there as well,"" CEO Manish Chandra told Reuters.
Rival ThredUp bought European thrift site Remix Global in July in a bid to expand beyond U.S. shores, an acquisition it said would ""springboard"" further expansion in Europe. It declined to comment on prospects for further deals.
Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) Inc has also bought British secondhand fashion app Depop for $1.6 billion. More consolidation, Julie Wainwright, CEO of luxury reseller The RealReal (NASDAQ:REAL) Inc, said earlier this year, ""is going to happen"". 
(GRAPHIC: Secondhand apparel gaining market share - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-RETAIL/gdpzywggkvw/chart.png) 
FRESH STYLES
The supply-chain disruptions making it hard for retailers to get fresh styles on their shelves - apparel had the highest online out-of-stock levels among U.S. retail sectors in the run-up to the holiday season, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Analytics said - are benefiting second-hand sellers.
Richard Branson-backed resale marketplace Tradesy, which raised $67 million in a funding round earlier this year, expects shortages of new apparel to translate into strong holiday sales.
CEO Tracy DiNunzio told Reuters the company favored independent growth, but was open to ""other possibilities"".
Other firms have found themselves ripe for investment from more established players. High-end thrift platform Vestiaire Collective raised $215 million this year as part of a financing round that included French luxury group  Kering  (PA:PRTP) taking a 5% stake in the company.
""I can't imagine any large clothing or fashion player not either partnering with or investing in or acquiring a successful (second-hand apparel) startup platform,"" said Jon Copestake, a senior analyst at EY's Global Consumer group.
Levi Strauss launched its own thrift website ""Levi's Secondhand"" last year where it sells authenticated used denim it sources in large part from its own customers. 
Other apparel companies such as Urban Outfitters are opting for a peer-to-peer marketplace, where the company connects buyers and sellers of used clothes and collects a 20% commission on sales.

With margins slim, beefing up sales volume counts. Urban Outfitters says focusing on a peer-to-peer model, in which a company provides a platform for deals between individuals rather than involving itself directly in sales, is key to making its business model work.
""This is a volume play. In a peer-to-peer marketplace model, scale is much more possible and there's much more potential to do it quickly, because the platform is not the arbiter of supply,"" its Chief Technology Officer David Hayne said.

568,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 28, 2021 12:45PM ET</span>",Why Hedge-Fund Bulls and Bears Are Crowding Into the Same Tech Stocks,"(Bloomberg) -- Hedge funds are betting against each other when it comes to internet and software stocks, with an unusually large number of companies targeted by both bulls and bears.
A dozen or so technology firms appeared on Morgan Stanley’s list of the 50 “crowded longs” at the end of last month. The same companies, whose names the bank didn’t disclose, also made the prime brokerage’s list of “crowded shorts.” That’s an extreme overlap not seen since 2010 and illustrates the growing divergence in opinions on where the market’s one-time darlings will go from here. 
The split also speaks to the challenge of picking the right stocks at a time when the economic outlook remains murky and the Federal Reserve mulls rolling back its pandemic support. While tech innovations point to better growth prospects in the long run, stretched valuations put the industry in the crosshairs of a raging debate about inflation and interest rates.
“Either growth is scarce and I should own growth, which is the long side of the trade,” said Benjamin Dunn, president at Alpha Theory Advisors LLC. “Or growth is not so scarce, inflation is going higher, and the Fed is going to have to act more aggressively. Then I don’t want that exposure, and so I might want to be short.”
The divergence came right before the start of the third-quarter earnings season. Supply-chain disruptions and headwinds from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).’s new limits on consumer data collection hurt profits at companies like  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP). and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR). Meanwhile,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT).’s cloud-based software helped drive robust sales and profit growth, and Google’s parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. reported revenue that topped Wall Street estimates.
It’s possible that some money managers have sussed out the brewing trouble, while others are willing to look past one or two bad quarters, said Dunn.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) noted that tech shares have seen the biggest increase in short sales among major industries this year -- accounting for about half of their clients’ total additions. Partly driving the bearish tilt was the managers’ failure to deliver on the long side. 
The firm also said that the extreme overlap in the crowded longs and shorts is a sign of diversification that helped the hedge-fund industry fare better during the latest stock rout. The alpha, or above-market return, from the top-crowding stocks was a loss of less than 1% in the week through Oct. 4. That compares with a drop of almost 3% over a similar period of selloff in May.

569,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2021 12:41PM ET</span>",Duty free retailer Dufry expects cash inflow to pick up in 2022,"By Aida Pelaez-Fernandez
(Reuters) - Swiss duty free retailer Dufry raised its 2021 free cash flow guidance for the second time this year and said it expects a further pick-up in 2022, citing a recovery in travel from the pandemic-related slump.
The retailer, which operates more than 2,300 shops at airports, on cruise liners, in seaports, and other tourist locations, is seeing signs of recovery after being severely hit over the last year and a half by the travel restrictions imposed to tackle the coronavirus pandemic.
That has been chiefly driven by its main sector, the Americas, which made for 499 million Swiss francs ($543.2 million) of its 1.3 billion Swiss franc third-quarter turnover. The total was down nearly 45% from the third quarter of 2019. 
""We have seen continued progress in the U.S. and Central America, including the Caribbean Islands,"" Chief Executive Julian Diaz said in a statement.
The Basel-based company notched up its free cash flow targets for 2021, now expecting a monthly cash inflow of 13 million Swiss francs if turnover is 40% below 2019 levels, versus previous expectations to break even. 
With turnover 55% below 2019 levels, it sees a 13 million Swiss franc cash burn, against a 30 million franc burn previously forecast.
Next year it sees a cash inflow of almost 100 million Swiss francs in a conservative sales scenario, Chief Financial Officer Yves Gerster said on a conference call, with sales 25% below 2019 levels. 
The group also expects to achieve up to 1.87 billion Swiss francs in savings in personnel and other expenses this year versus pre-pandemic levels, up from 1.2 billion Swiss francs forecast in August and the 1.3 billion Swiss francs recorded in 2020.
Looking at current global supply chain issues, which have affected products from pallets to electrical components, the company said there had been issues securing some supplies, mainly of tobacco and spirits, but that it is coping. 

""The out-of-stock situation is not relevant enough to justify any kind of disruption in sales. We are protected so far,"" Diaz said.

Shares of T Rowe were up as much as 6% at $216, their highest in over a month.
The deal comes at a time when asset managers are exploring ways to bolster their profitability amid fierce competition and lower fees from the switch towards more passive investing by investors.
Some asset managers are seeking greater scale in existing areas and others are branching out into new spaces such as alternatives, which generate higher returns.
The trend may trigger more potential tie-ups between other mutual fund managers and private equity firms. Generally, the steady stream of consolidation in the asset management space is expected to continue, according to a report from accounting and consulting firm PwC.
""OHA meets the high bar we have set for inorganic opportunities, and their proven private credit expertise will help us meet our clients' demand for alternative credit,"" T Rowe Chief Executive Officer Bill Stromberg said.
As of July end, New York-based OHA manages $53 billion of capital across its asset classes. Since January last year, it has raised $19.4 billion of capital.
T Rowe, which offers a suite of mutual funds, account management and other advisory services, manages $1.61 trillion in assets as of Sept. 30.

The total deal value includes $3.3 billion payable at closing, through 74% of cash and the rest in T Rowe's common stock, and an additional $900 million if certain business milestones are met in the beginning of 2025, the company said.
Evercore was the financial adviser to T Rowe Price, while J.P. Morgan Securities and M. Klein & Company advised OHA.

RIYADH (Reuters) - Qatar Energy, one of the world's top liquefied natural gas (LNG) suppliers, is working on a plan to reinvent itself as environmentally responsible for investors via a framework that will pave the way for it to sell ""green"" bonds in a deal likely to be worth several billion dollars, three sources with knowledge of the matter said.
Qatar Energy is working on establishing an Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) framework that would allow it to issue green bonds - debt earmarked for environmentally friendly uses, the sources said.
If completed, it would be the first sale of green bonds by a national oil company in the hydrocarbon-rich Gulf.
Qatar Energy in a statement on Thursday denied the Reuters report.
A consultancy is working on the framework and QE sent a request for proposals to banks about two weeks ago, one of the sources said, without naming the consulting firm.
Once the ESG framework is established, Qatar Energy plans to structure a green bond deal, though the debt sale is unlikely to happen this year, the source said. 
It was not immediately clear what proceeds from the expected sale of green bonds would be used for. 
There is a lack of clear definitions or standards for what constitutes a green bond globally, with some regions and countries setting out their own guidelines, including the European Commission announcing a European Green Bond Standard https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/eu-throws-weight-behind-new-standard-green-bonds-2021-07-06 in July.
Previously named Qatar Petroleum before recently rebranding, the state-owned energy giant, which supplies one in five LNG cargoes globally, raised $12.5 billion in its debut jumbo bond issuance in late June - 2021's biggest out of emerging markets.
The rebranding to Qatar Energy was part of the company's new shift towards ESG considerations, another of the sources said.
The company signed a contract in February for the first phase of its North Field LNG expansion project, which aims to boost Qatar's LNG output to 126 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) by 2027 from 77 mtpa currently.
Global watchdog the International Energy Agency has cautioned that investors should not fund new oil, gas and coal supply projects if the world wants to reach net zero emissions by the middle of the century.
Capital expenditure by the company, its subsidiaries and joint ventures through 2025 is projected at 300 billion riyals ($79.99 billion), the prospectus for the June bond sale said.
World leaders will gather at the COP26 United Nations climate summit https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/sticking-points-un-climate-conference-2021-10-18 from Sunday to try to agree on steeper emissions cuts at an event billed as the last big chance to slow rising global temperatures.
Interest in ESG-related initiatives and deals has surged in the hydrocarbon-rich Gulf amid growing awareness among global investors about ESG risks and stark warnings about the dangers of global warming.
Both the Saudi government and its sovereign wealth fund have hired advisers this year to help structure similar ESG frameworks. The governor of the sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund, said it would sell green bonds soon.

Saudi Arabia on Saturday became the second Gulf country to announce a net-zero emissions target - 2060 - after the United Arab Emirates earlier this month set 2050 as its goal for achieving carbon neutrality.

The most significant — revealed on Wednesday — is a $478 million contract for systems engineering and integration services. 
BAE shares were trading flat in Thursday's session.
The five-year contract, awarded in September, has BAE supporting the U.S. Navy Strategic Systems Programs.
Meanwhile, the U.K.-based defense business told investors today that it has received a $26 million contract to equip the U.S. Navy's Constellation class frigates with the fully-automatic 57mm Mk 110 naval gun.
The contract, awarded earlier this month, includes engineering support and calls for 2 Mk 110s for the USS Constellation and USS Congress.
In mid-October, analyst Aymeric Poulain at financial research firm Kepler Cheuvreux initiated coverage of BAE with a buy rating at 670p price target. The company's shares are currently trading around the 555p level."

And given the market’s current uptrend, we believe betting on mid-cap basic materials stocks Reliance Steel & (RS) and Ternium (TX) could be rewarding. They both have the potential to become large-cap stocks soon. Let’s discuss these names.
The basic material sector faced challenges amid the pandemic, with restrictions hampering the operations of industries that use its products. However, several companies in this space are recovering with the reopening of industries this year, thanks to solid progress on the vaccination front. The basic material sector experienced 24.4% year-over-year growth in the third quarter of 2021.
The S&P Midcap 400 index has gained 41.2% over the past year, outperforming the 34.2% returns delivered by the benchmark S&P 500 index, which represents large-cap stocks. Given the impressive start to the third-quarter earnings season and the consequent market rally, several mid-cap stocks could become large caps in the near term.
We think fundamentally sound mid-cap basic materials stocks Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co. (RS) and Ternium S.A. (TX), which currently possess market capitalizations of more than $8 billion, have the potential to become large-cap stocks soon. So, it could be wise to bet on them now.

Therefore, we think it is better to bet on Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM), Papa John’s (PZZA), and Rave Restaurant Group (RAVE), which are well-positioned to capitalize on the industry tailwinds. Read on.The largest pizza restaurant chain operator, Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (DPZ), which is headquartered in Ann Arbor, Mich., boasts roughly 18,300 stores across more than 90 markets. Its shares have gained 27.4% in price over the past nine months to close yesterday’s trading session at $480.27. However, the stock is currently trading 12.5% below its 52-week high of $548.72, which it hit on July 22, 2021. Also, the stock has lost 10.7% in price over the past three months.
DPZ’s revenue increased 3.1% year-over-year to $997.99 million for its fiscal third quarter, ended September 12, 2021, and its net income came in at $120.40 million, up 21.5% year-over-year. However, its same-store sales fell for the first time in more than a decade. The stock is also trading at an expensive valuation. In terms of forward EV/S, DPZ’s 4.99x is 248.2% higher than the 1.43x industry average. In addition, the stock’s 3.97x forward P/S is 226.9% higher than the 1.22x industry average. So, it could be wise to wait for a better entry point in the stock.
Nevertheless, the rapid rate of vaccinations and an increase in consumer discretionary spending should drive the demand for pizza restaurants. According to a Business Wire research report, the global pizza market is expected to reach $233 billion in 2023. Therefore, instead of betting on DPZ, we think it could be wise to bet on better-positioned pizza stocks Yum! Brands, Inc. (YUM), Papa John’s International, Inc. (PZZA), and Rave Restaurant Group, Inc. (RAVE). They are well-positioned to capitalize on the industry tailwinds.

The COVID-19 pandemic has crippled companies' ability to send and receive product parts and supplies across the world. Mexico's Cemex warned earlier this month that those snags coupled with inflation and foreign exchange effects could hit its full-year earnings by about $100 million.
Within minutes of market opening, Cemex's shares were down more than 4% to 13.25 pesos, their lowest level since late March. By 10:25 am Eastern Time, shares had pared losses slightly to 13.45 pesos to trade down 2.96%.
The company's net loss came even as Cemex reported a 10% rise in quarterly sales, helped by strong demand in the United States and Mexico.
In the United States, Cemex's biggest market, net sales rose 10% to $1.12 billion in the third quarter, while Mexico sales rose 20% to $868 million. 
Cemex said it had implemented a second round of price increases in the reported quarter for its cement and ready-mix businesses in the United States, with prices up 2% from the prior three months.
""We are confident that our pricing strategy will more than compensate for the sudden runup in input cost inflation we have experienced,"" said Cemex's Chief Executive Fernando Gonzalez in a statement accompanying the earnings report.

ROME (Reuters) -Italy's government plans to extend by six months tax breaks aimed at spurring tie-ups among the country's banks, while also reducing their amount, a draft of the 2022 budget seen by Reuters showed.
The scheme, which applies to all companies but mostly benefits banks, was a key plank of the incentive package the Treasury had put together to sell ailing bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS) to bigger rival UniCredit.
However, talks over the potential merger deal collapsed on Sunday, marking a major setback to Italy's efforts to re-privatise MPS..
The end of the negotiations created uncertainty over whether the incentives would be renewed, as had previously been indicated by government officials.
The draft showed the government plans to extend the scheme to end-June 2022 from Dec. 31 2021, with a new cap of 500 million euros ($583.75 million) as a maximum benefit.
The cap currently stands at 2% of the assets of the smaller company involved in the merger. This will remain the cap if the 2% figure is below 500 million euros.
Banks will also be able to tap the incentives and complete the merger procedures within two years of having bought a controlling stake, the draft said, rather than within one year as currently established.
Analysts have seen the tax breaks as a significant driver of consolidation for the Italian market, where more tie-ups are expected to follow Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY)'s takeover of UBI, the healthiest second-tier player.
Other mid-sized banks like Banco BPM and BPER Banca are weighing their options, bankers say, as is Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) Italia which recently bought small bank Creval after upping its offer to factor in the tax incentives.

On the other hand, UniCredit CEO Andrea Orcel on Thursday said his view on the tax scheme differed from that of the market and he did not consider it an M&A catalyst because of the fee banks had to pay to tap into it.

(Reuters) - An estimated 30 million to 50 million doses of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s COVID-19 vaccine made early this year sits idle in Emergent BioSolutions Inc's plant in Baltimore awaiting a green light from U.S. regulators to ship, two sources familiar with the matter said. 
Emergent, a contract drug manufacturer, is waiting for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to approve release of those doses. The agency must still inspect and authorize the plant before Emergent can ship newly manufactured drug substance, one of the sources said.
The exact number of doses sitting idle cannot be determined, the source said, because Emergent only makes raw vaccine substance and does not fill vials with finished product.
Emergent shares opened nearly 1% higher following the Reuters report. 
The FDA in April halted operations at Emergent's production facility after J&J's vaccine was found to be contaminated with material from AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s COVID-19 shots, which were also being manufactured there at the time. 
The contamination ruined about 15 million J&J doses and set back its U.S. vaccine rollout by weeks.
Material manufactured for the J&J vaccine at the Baltimore plant prior to the April shutdown and awaiting FDA approval could be enough to produce as many as 50 million shots, the two sources said. They asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the issue. 
Of the 100 million doses worth of vaccine material Emergent described in an April Congressional hearing as being sidelined, the FDA has so far cleared nine batches of J&J's vaccine and three batches of AstraZeneca's. It has not disclosed how many doses were in those batches. 
Emergent in late July said it would resume production of J&J's vaccine at the plant following additional FDA reviews, but has not provided updates on production or timing of potential shipments. [L1N2P535Q]
Emergent has begun making new vaccine substance, but the FDA has yet to provide guidance on when it plans to inspect the Baltimore facility, one of the sources said. 
The FDA said in a statement that it conducted a limited inspection of Emergent's facility in July to confirm it had conducted corrective actions following the April production pause. A previous inspection had turned up a raft of sanitary, safety and bad manufacturing practice issues at the plant.
The agency said it has not yet authorized the facility to ship doses and continues to review batches made prior to the production halt. It has based its batch approvals on reviews of facility records and quality testing conducted by the manufacturer. 
The FDA typically waits for a drug manufacturing facility to produce multiple batches of its product before conducting an inspection, according to a former FDA official who asked not to be named because she was not authorized to speak with the media.
Following the Emergent plant shutdown, J&J lowered its production target for 2021 to between 500 million and 600 million doses from around 1 billion. It expects to be able to make 1 billion doses annually starting next year.
J&J has not specified whether it needs Emergent to restart production to hit its 2022 target. It has another manufacturing facility in Leiden, Netherlands, and production agreements with other contract manufacturers, including Catalent (NYSE:CTLT) Inc and India's Biological E. 
The United States contracted with J&J for 100 million shots in 2020.

Last week, the FDA authorized J&J's vaccine as a booster for people who are already vaccinated but desire additional protection against COVID-19, including anyone over age 18 who originally received the company's single-dose shot. 
Use of J&J's vaccine fell sharply in the United States after it was linked to a rare but potentially lethal blood clotting disorder.

RIYADH (Reuters) - U.S.-based energy investor EIG has been shortlisted as a potential buyer of  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222)'s gas pipelines, part of a sale that could exceed $17 billion and is likely to be completed later this year, three sources familiar with the matter said.
Aramco is looking to sell a significant minority stake in its gas pipelines, other sources have previously said.
In addition to EIG, private equity firms such Apollo could also be potential buyers, two of the sources said.
EIG, Aramco and Apollo did not immediately respond to requests from Reuters for comment.
Aramco has approached investors including those involved in buying a stake in Abu Dhabi National Oil Co's gas pipelines.
This was bought by a consortium including Brookfield, Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC and European gas infrastructure owner and operator SNAM.
GIP told Reuters this week it will not bid for the Aramco gas pipelines but was looking at other assets in the region, where other oil-producing nations are looking to monetise assets as they transition to a post-oil era.
Aramco is talking to banks for a financing package, equivalent to roughly 80% of the final price, which will likely be underwritten by a small group of banks and will be offered to the bidders to back their purchase, sources have said.
Earlier this year, Aramco, like Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC), used a lease-back agreement to sell a 49% stake of newly formed Aramco Oil Pipelines Co to a consortium led by EIG which also included investors from China, Saudi Arabia, Korea and the United Arab Emirates.

The buyers gained rights to 25 years of tariff payments for oil carried on its pipelines.
Aramco's planned gas pipeline deal would be based on a similar structure, sources have previously said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Italian luxury sports car maker Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) on Thursday won its dispute with a German car design company after Europe's top court agreed with its arguments that it owns the design right to the appearance of its race track car Ferrari FXX K.
The case has implications for a wide swathe of industries, in particular luxury brands seeking to protect their designs from knock-offs, and manufacturers of complex products made up of numerous components.
The ruling from the Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) came after a German court sought guidance in a design spat between Ferrari and German car design company Mansory Design over certain elements of the Ferrari FXX K's bodywork.
At issue is the V-shaped section of the bonnet and the front bumper which distinguish the Ferrari FXX K from other cars.
Ferrari had sued Mansory Design in the German court for making and selling these accessories designed to make the Ferrari 488 GTB, which is priced at around $250,000, look like the $2.6 million Ferrari FXX K, saying the company had violated its rights to the unregistered designs.

The CJEU said a component can be considered to be an individual part with design rights if it is ""a visible section of the product or complex product, clearly defined by particular lines, contours, colours, shapes or texture"".
The case is C-123/20 Ferrari.

(Reuters) -Northrop Grumman Corp on Thursday reported quarterly revenues that fell short of Wall Street expectations, pushing its shares down nearly 7 percent and making it the latest big U.S. defense contractor to disappoint investors with lackluster results.
 Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) on Tuesday dramatically lowered its sales expectations for this year and next as the COVID-19 pandemic hobbled the top U.S. defense contractor's supply chain, sending its shares down 11%.
Northrup, the maker of bombers and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), also reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, driven by strong demand in its fast-growing space unit, prompting the company to raise its full-year adjusted profit forecast.
Company Chair Kathy Warden acknowledged ""some labor-related and supply-chain challenges stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations"" in the earnings release.
Northrop (NYSE:NOC) shares fell $26.40 to $361.75 by Thursday midday trading.
Northrop said it now expects full-year adjusted earnings per share of $25.20 to $25.60, up from its prior range of $24.40 to $24.80.
The pandemic has hurt companies around the globe by reducing their ability to send or receive components, thereby creating shortages and reducing sales.
Northrop said it completed a flight test for its Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) with Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) in the third quarter.
This comes as defense contractors quicken their pace to build hypersonic weapons - the next generation of arms that deprive adversaries of reaction time and traditional defeat mechanisms.
The missile, built by Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) and equipped with a Northrop scramjet (supersonic combustion ramjet) engine, is capable of achieving speeds faster than five times the speed of sound, marking the first successful test of the class of weapon since 2013.
Northrop's space unit, which makes satellites and missile systems, reported a 22% jump in sales to $2.68 billion for the third quarter ended Sept. 30.

Excluding items, Northrop earned $6.63 per share, topping Wall Street estimates of $5.99, according to Refinitiv IBES.
The company's total sales, however, fell 4% to $8.72 billion, missing estimates $8.94 billion.

Investing.com – Merck stock (NYSE:MRK) gained more than 4% Thursday as the drug maker raised its annual forecast after its earnings shot past estimates in the third quarter.
Boosting the stock were also hopes that Merck may have a blockbuster in molnupiravir, an oral anti-Covid drug currently awaiting regulatory approval. The comany said if the emergency use approval comes through in December, the drug offers an opportunity of up to $7 billion in sales in 2022 including $1 billion in revenue this year.
Chief Financial Officer Caroline Litchfield has projected at least $5 billion in sales by the end of next year, assuming a December clearance.
Merck now expects 2021 sales to be $47.65 billion at midpoint, up from its prior guidance of $46.9 billion at center of the range. Adjusted profit per share is also seen rising by 25.5% compared to the previous forecast of a 22% growth at midpoint.
Molnupiravir has boosted the stock given it will be the world’s first proven anti-Covid oral drug. It is relatively cheap to make and easy to transport and the company has already signed up orders with governments. Several manufacturing tie ups are also in place even as more companies remain in contention to make the drug on a contractual basis for the company.
Adjusted profit per share was $1.75, beating analysts’ estimates by 20 cents, and revenue was 19% higher at $13.2 billion, this too surpassing Wall Street expectations.
Sales were boosted by Merck’s cancer vaccines, Keytruda and Gardasil."

(Reuters) -Merck & Co Inc on Thursday said its experimental COVID-19 drug could bring in between $5 billion and $7 billion in sales through the end of next year, assuming it gains U.S. authorization in December.
Merck's shares rose more than 4% to $84.88 in early trading.
The antiviral drug, molnupiravir, has been closely watched since Merck earlier this month reported data https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/mercks-covid-19-pill-cuts-risk-death-hospitalization-by-50-study-2021-10-01 that showed it could halve the chances of dying or being hospitalized for those most at risk of developing severe COVID-19 when given early in the illness. 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisers will meet in November to vote on whether the drug should be authorized. If cleared by the FDA, the medicine developed with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics will become the first oral antiviral treatment for COVID-19. 
Merck Chief Executive Robert Davis said in an interview the $5 billion to $7 billion forecast for the pill is based on signed contracts and regions where the company has high confidence that they will reach a deal, and that the estimate could move higher.
""We will have more courses available than what we have sales for right now,"" Davis said. He noted that demand could spike if the drug is found to also be effective in preventing COVID-19 after exposure to the virus. 
""That upside is not in these numbers,"" he said.
While vaccines remain the main weapons against COVID-19, Merck's experimental pill could be a game-changer as other treatments for the disease are given as infusions or injections, primarily in a hospital setting. Molnupiravir is taken twice a day for five days.
Merck said it expects between $500 million and $1 billion in sales of the drug this year. Profits will be shared equally with Ridgeback. 
The U.S. drugmaker in June agreed to provide 1.7 million doses of molnupiravir to the U.S. government for around $1.2 billion, once it is cleared by regulators. Other countries have rushed to sign deals for the drug since its data was announced. 
Merck has also signed pacts https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-signs-pact-broaden-generic-manufacturing-covid-19-pill-2021-10-27/#:~:text=WASHINGTON%2C%20Oct%2027%20(Reuters),and%20the%20organization%20announced%20on with generic drugmakers to produce the drug for low- and middle-income countries.
It expects to produce 10 million courses of the drug this year, and sees that number more than doubling in 2022. Its production targets do not include the licensing deals for generic versions. 
Also on Thursday, Merck raised its full-year adjusted profit forecast following strong third-quarter demand for blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda, and a 68% spike in sales of Gardasil, its vaccine to prevent cancers caused by the human papillomavirus.

Sales of Keytruda, which is on track to become the world's biggest-selling medicine by 2023, rose 22% to $4.53 billion in the quarter, topping analysts' lofty estimates of $4.31 billion. 
Merck now expects full-year adjusted profit of $5.65 to $5.70 per share, up from its prior view of $5.47 to $5.57. The forecasts did not include any potential contribution from molnupiravir.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Chinese telecoms giant Huawei paid Democratic lobbyist Tony Podesta $1 million to lobby the Biden administration on its behalf, double what the lobbyist has revealed publicly, according to two people familiar with the matter. 
This month, the prominent Washington lobbyist disclosed a $500,000 payment from Huawei in a third-quarter lobbying report. But Podesta actually received $1 million total in separate installments in June and September, the people said, declining to be named since the information was not public. 
One of the people said the additional undisclosed $500,000 payment is slated to be included in Podesta's fourth-quarter filing in January for lobbying activities during the October - December period.
Huawei declined to comment.
Podesta is the brother of John Podesta, who served as chairman of the presidential campaign of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, and as a senior White House adviser to former President Barack Obama, also a Democrat.
He lobbied the White House on Huawei's behalf as negotiations between the Justice Department and Huawei CFO Meng heated up over the summer, resulting in a deal last month to end a bank fraud case against her.
Lawyers consulted by Reuters said the Lobbying Disclosure Act requires the payment to be disclosed for the quarter in which the work was done, meaning if Podesta lobbies for Huawei in the last three months of the year he will be in compliance. 
However, they added that it was unusual for a company to pre-pay an outside lobbyist for future work, as Huawei would have in this case.
Huawei has drawn ire in Washington over fears it can spy on U.S. users, allegations of trade secrets theft and sanctions violations. Huawei has denied wrongdoing. Former President Donald Trump's Republican administration placed the company on a trade blacklist, making it more difficult for it to get advanced technology from U.S. suppliers. 
Podesta stepped down from his lobbying firm Podesta Group as investigators' examined his company's ties to Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, who was convicted of bank and tax fraud but later pardoned. Podesta was ultimately cleared of wrongdoing. 

In his third quarter lobbying report for Huawei, Podesta listed ""issues related to telecommunication services and impacted trade issues"" as subjects he focused on in talks with the White House.
Huawei has spent roughly $3.42 million on internal and external lobbyists thus far this year, according to federal disclosures.

(Reuters) -  Hershey Co  (NYSE:HSY) raised its annual forecasts for sales and profit on Thursday after posting better-than expected results, benefiting from strong demand for its chocolates and candies during its ""biggest ever"" Halloween season.
Demand for the company's products such as Reese's Peanut Butter Cups and KitKat chocolates strengthened around the October holiday after the pandemic curtailed trick-or-treating events last year.
""As we head into the final days of Halloween, sales and sell through are both looking strong... We expect this strength to flow into the holiday season as more family gatherings occur this year,"" Chief Executive Officer Michele Buck said. 
The company said category sales in early and mid-season rose 18% compared with last year, and 12% versus 2019, with trick-or-treat participation also expected to rebound to pre-pandemic levels.
Consumer spending on Halloween-related items is anticipated to reach an all-time high of $10.14 billion this year, versus the $8.05 billion in 2020, according to a National Retail Federation survey.
Like other packaged food makers, Hershey has been raising prices in recent months to offset rising costs for raw materials and freight due to global supply chain disruptions triggered by the pandemic.
The chocolate maker said elevated consumer demand was expected to offset the higher costs.
Hershey forecast 2021 net sales to grow 8% to 9%, higher than its previous range of growth between 6% and 8%.
It also expects adjusted earnings per share to range between $6.98 and $7.11, higher than the prior $6.79-$6.92 outlook. 

Net sales rose about 6.3% to $2.34 billion in the third quarter, compared with estimates of $2.33 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
On an adjusted basis, Hershey earned $2.10 per share, beating estimates of $2.00.

In his confirmation hearing, Kanter pledged to enforce antitrust law in agriculture, pharmaceuticals and the labor market, as well as in Big Tech.
Senator Amy Klobuchar, chair of the panel's antitrust subcommittee, supported Kanter, saying he has a deep understanding of the issues.
In a sign of tougher enforcement, the Biden administration previously chose two antitrust progressives with tech expertise, Tim Wu for the National Economic Council and Lina Khan to be chair of the Federal Trade Commission.

If confirmed by the full Senate as expected, Kanter will take the reins of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division amid calls for tougher enforcement overall, with special criticism aimed at Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google,  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). The companies have vigorously denied any wrongdoing.
Kanter has spent years representing rivals of Google, which the Justice Department sued last year alleging that it broke antitrust law in seeking to hobble rivals. The department is also investigating Apple for alleged violations of antitrust law.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Belgian chemicals group  Solvay  (BR:SOLB) said on Thursday it aimed to invest $2 billion to become a carbon-neutral company by 2050 and increased its 2030 goal for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
Solvay also reported higher-than-expected third quarter sales and a 10th consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow.
It said it would invest up to 1 billion euro ($1.16 billion) so that all operations other than soda ash become carbon-neutral by 2040. It would invest a further 1 billion euros to ensure soda ash was carbon-neutral by 2050 and it also increased its goal for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 to 30% from a previous 26%.
The company, which also makes lithium derivatives for batteries, said the investments would generate returns well in excess of the group's cost of capital and would represent on average some 10% of annual capital expenditure. 
The group also raised its internal carbon price to 100 euros per metric ton of CO2, from 50 euros.
In 2016 Solvay introduced an internal price for its CO2 emissions of 25 euros per metric ton to help it take into account ""climate challenges in its long term economic decisions"".
“We now have 36 projects representing 2.4 megatons of CO2 annually — the equivalent to cutting emissions of 1.3 million carbon fuel vehicles each year,"" CEO Ilham Kadri told a news conference.
Solvay, whose products range from base chemicals such as soda ash to speciality polymers, reported third-quarter sales of 2.57 billion euros, beating a company-compiled consensus of 2.41 billion euros.

ING analyst Stijn Demeester said in a note that Solvay's third-quarter results were strong, with record sales for the company's specialty polymers division, which makes industrial and protective coatings and linings, and solutions, for the aerospace and automotive sectors.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia's supermarket industry has formed a task force to fix a shortage of delivery pallets that could impact availability of some goods, another knot in the global supply chain that is putting the brakes on economic recovery from the pandemic.
Woolworths Group Ltd and  Coles Group  (OTC:CLEGF) Ltd, the top two grocers, joined pallet makers and smaller chains to address a scarcity of the wooden crates resulting from COVID-19 lockdowns and timber shortages, said the Australian Food and Grocery Council (AFGC), which is running the project.
Pallets join a growing list of products suffering raw material shortages. Consumer goods manufacturers and retailers have also flagged short supplies of plastics and other packaging material such as cans and glass, while a lack of computer chips is hurting carmakers around the world.
Though the two grocers said they would avoid empty shelves in the end-of-year holiday period, the coordinated measure shows how a mix of unusual factors stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic has put strain on the A$120 billion ($90 billion) industry.
Without pallets, manufacturers cannot ship goods into warehouses, potentially leading to production stoppages and fewer goods for sale. There are signs that some businesses are hanging on to pallets rather than recycling them.
Brambles Ltd, one of the world's largest pallet providers, said earlier this year that labor and transportation constraints, coupled with restricted access to manufacturing sites due to COVID, were deterring some manufacturers and retailers from returning pallets.
Robust housing construction and renovation markets, particularly in the United States, have also sapped lumber supplies and driven up prices.
PALLET GATE 
Earlier this month, Corona beer maker Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) said increased raw material costs in the third quarter were predominantly driven by pallets, cartons and aluminum. 
Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) said on Wednesday it was facing ""tight"" supplies of cans, while its rival  Pepsico  (NASDAQ:PEP) flagged difficulties in securing bottles for its Gatorade sports drink. 
""Across the nation there is a bit of a 'pallet-gate' going on,"" said Coles Chief Executive Steven Cain on an earnings call. ""The lack of wood means not many new ones are being produced.""
A Woolworths spokesman said the company was working with suppliers to ""help them get access to pallets and minimise any impacts within their distribution networks"".
At an earnings call a day earlier, Woolworths CEO Brad Banducci said his company, which together with Coles accounts for two-thirds of Australian supermarket sales, may have to swap out some brands of certain items due to supply problems, although it would not drop entire product categories.

""They're probably feeling this bullwhip effect, where there's a shock in one node of the supply chain and that causes amplified reactions in every other node,"" said Shanaka Jayasinghe, director of GRA Supply Chain, a logistics consulting firm.

Investing.com – Stanley Black & Decker stock (NYSE:SWK) fell more than 4% Thursday after rising costs and wages forced it to cut its annual sales and profit forecast.
The company also delivered short of expectations on the revenue front in the third quarter. Earnings per share of $2.56 beat estimates.
The company had raised the forecast in July after second-quarter revenue soared 37% but that growth tempered to 11% in the third quarter to hit $4.3 billion, leading the company to revise its numbers one more time.
Stanley Black now sees an adjusted profit per share of $11 at the midpoint compared to $11.5 at the center of the previous range. Similarly, organic revenue growth is expected to be 16.5% at the midpoint compared to 17% at the center of the range given earlier.
Higher volume and price hikes were mostly behind the rise in revenue but it was more than offset by accelerated commodity, transportation and labor inflation required to meet strong demand, the company said. Gross margin eroded by 310 basis points to around 33%. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percent.
Sales growth was strongest in the company’s mainstay of tools and storage, as demand came from both retail and commercial segments.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Volkswagen cut its outlook for deliveries, toned down sales expectations and warned of job cuts as a shortage of computer chips caused Europe's largest carmaker to report lower-than-expected operating profit for the third quarter.
The earnings showed the pressure that Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) is facing as it tries to switch more of its production to electric vehicles and as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) prepares to move on its home territory with a new plant close to Berlin.
At the same time, a lack of automotive semiconductors has plagued the industry for most of the year and also ate into quarterly results of key rivals Stellantis and General Motors (NYSE:GM).
As a result of the shortage, Volkswagen, which has outlined an ambitious plan to become the world leader in electric vehicle (EV) sales, now expects deliveries in 2021 to be only in line with the previous year, having previously forecast a rise.
""These results underscore once again the need for further productivity improvements and fixed cost reductions in the volume group in order to remain competitive,"" Chief Executive Herbert Diess told reporters.
Revenues at Europe's largest carmaker are now expected to be considerably higher in 2021. Volkswagen had previously expected a significant increase from the 223 billion euros achieved last year, wording that had indicated stronger growth.
Volkswagen was now assuming sales growth of up to 10% rather than up to 15% previously, Chief Financial Officer Arno Antlitz said.
Shares in the world's second-largest carmaker fell as much as 4% to the bottom of Germany's blue-chip index.
THE TESLA THREAT
Volkswagen, which aims to overtake Tesla as the world's largest seller of EVs by the middle of the decade, confirmed its operating profit margin target of 6.0-7.5% for 2021.
Diess on Thursday said he was confident that Volkswagen could keep up with Tesla, but added this would require further cost cuts, including headcount reductions at its Wolfsburg headquarters in western Germany.
""For sure we need some headcount reduction, to be as competitive,"" Diess said.
Tesla is planning to open a plant in Gruenheide near Berlin, its first gigafactory in Europe, this year although no final approval has been given by authorities.
Diess said the Tesla site was setting a new benchmark in terms of productivity, speed and lean management.
Third-quarter operating profit came in at 2.8 billion euros ($3.25 billion), down 12% versus last year and lower than the 2.99 billion Refinitiv forecast. The profit margin for the July-September period fell to 4.9% from 5.4% last year.
""The results of the third quarter show once again that we must now systematically drive forward the improvement in productivity in the volume sector,"" Diess said.

Volkswagen's luxury division Porsche AG, which sources have said is being evaluated for a possible stock market listing, separately said the fourth-quarter would be challenging with regard to chip supply.
Asked about a possible listing, Diess said there were no plans currently for further asset sales following the initial public offering of trucks unit Traton and plans to bring in investors to fund six battery factories by 2030.

Several nations have already set goals to phase-out coal. And recently, China’s intervention to temper rising coal prices has caused coal futures to fall sharply. Hence, we think it could be wise to now avoid weak coal stocks of CNX Resources (NYSE:CNX), Peabody Energy (BTU), Arch Resources (ARCH), and Warrior Met Coal (NYSE:HCC). Let's discuss.Coal generates large quantities of greenhouse gases when burnt, making it one of the most polluting substances used for energy generation. Michelle Manook, the Chief Executive of the World Coal Association (WCA), believes the industry is not doing enough to demonstrate how the adoption of cleaner technologies can reduce carbon emissions, which is making it harder to integrate coal into a decarbonized future.
In June, G7 country leaders pledged to transition away from coal, with the goal of completely phasing it out by 2040. The commitment includes Japan, the second-largest overseas coal power financier in the world. Recently, China, the world’s largest coal producer, intervened to tame surging coal prices as part of an effort to address power shortages. As a result, last Friday, China's thermal coal futures fell 13%, with the most-traded contract on Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange settling at 1,408.4 yuan ($220) per ton, representing a 30% decline from its record high on Tuesday and its largest weekly decline since May.
Given this backdrop, we think it could be wise to avoid fundamentally weak coal stocks of CNX Resources Corporation (CNX), Peabody Energy Corporation (BTU), Arch Resources, Inc. (ARCH), and Warrior Met Coal, Inc. (HCC).

PARIS (Reuters) -Airbus overcame new snags in its global supply chain to maintain a widely watched forecast for 600 jet deliveries this year, pushing its shares higher despite signs of labour shortages as the economy exits COVID-19 ""hibernation"".
The world's largest planemaker lifted full-year profit and cash targets after profits held up better than expected in the third quarter, and refused to bow to industry critics who have questioned its bullish forecasts for jet production.
Airbus shares opened up around 3%, ignoring a retreat in global stocks after a series of supply chain warnings, before easing back to stand 1% higher.
Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said the recovery towards pre-crisis output levels was under way after 15 months in which the European group kept its foot on the brake to avoid adding to a glut of aircraft during the airline industry's worst crisis.
""We observe labour shortages around the world impacting all sectors,"" Faury told reporters.
""We are now in the ramp-up and we see all the difficulties of going from a sort of hibernation, and back to business in a world where many commodities and sectors are ramping up again.""
Airbus said it was facing some problems in receiving parts on time, leading to rework on jets and contributing to a recent flattening of deliveries, but said none appeared systemic.
""We think these can be managed in the last months of the year,"" Faury said.
Analysts said that after years of turmoil in aerospace, with Boeing (NYSE:BA) in particular still facing industrial problems, the decision to maintain deliveries provided a boost.
""It's essentially back to 'deliver, make profit, repeat,' said Agency Partners analyst Sash Tusa.
Airbus reported a 19% drop in third-quarter operating profit to 666 million euros ($772.7 million) as revenues slipped 6% to 10.518 billion. It said it was looking for full-year operating profit of 4.5 billion euros and free cashflow of 2.5 billion, up from previous targets of 4 billion and 2 billion respectively.
Analysts were on average expecting operating profit of 623 million euros, based on a company-compiled consensus.
STICKING TO OUTPUT VIEWS
Airbus rounded up its main A320-family production target to 65 a month by summer 2023, carving out some room for slippage in the timetable. In May, it had said it was planning a firm rate of 64 a month by second-quarter 2023.
Airbus insisted it remained on the same overall trajectory. It sees a rebound in air travel demand, especially in the busy A320 category where Boeing's 737 competes.
But it remains locked in a dispute with suppliers and leasing companies over its ambitions to raise rates as high as 75 a month by 2025.
Engine makers and lessors have protested, saying the proposal risks overheating the market and damaging their own businesses, which depend heavily on the life of older planes. 
Some in the industry privately accuse Airbus of dumping jets to snatch market share from troubled Boeing - something Airbus denies, saying its output decisions are fully underpinned by demand.
Boeing, whose rates are capped at lower levels as it also recovers from an overlapping safety crisis, implicitly weighed in on Wednesday when Chief Executive Dave Calhoun warned of a ""supply-constrained world"" from second-half 2022 through 2023. 
""We know that there are a lot of views on this but we have our own views, and our own view is that the demand supports rate 75, but we need to look at the supply chain situation,"" Airbus' Faury said.
He did not say whether Airbus still aimed to reach that level by 2025, but later told analysts: ""We are considering 70, 75 moving forward because we see the very strong demand for the 320 moving far away in the second half of the decade"".
Sources say the clash between leasing companies or suppliers and Airbus reflects contrasting interests, pushed to boiling point by the crisis. Planemakers make money on new sales rather than relying on older jets to generate repairs and rent.

Lessors step in when times are hard and they fear jets being devalued by overproduction. Some critics accuse them of hoarding future production slots, even when they say there is no demand.
In large-jet programmes, Airbus said it would lift depressed A330 output from two a month to almost three at end-2022. It reiterated it would raise flagship A350 output from five to six a month but delayed this to early 2023 from autumn 2022.

MILAN (Reuters) - UniCredit raised its 2021 profit and revenue goals on Thursday, strengthening the hand of its new CEO after he walked out of talks to buy troubled rival Monte dei Paschi (MPS).
Italy's only bank that regulators deem of global systemic relevance, UniCredit last year lost its domestic leadership to Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY), which snapped up rival UBI to secure a fifth of the market - twice the share of UniCredit.
The arrival of Andrea Orcel, UBS' former investment banking chief, at the helm of UniCredit in April has stoked expectations he will use his dealmaking skills to expand the bank.
But Orcel said he saw more value in internal growth, though it remained ""his duty"" to pursue deals if terms were right - as he sought to do with MPS.
""If a deal could be executed quickly ... it could fit in our agenda. That window has closed for us ... I know windows close and open but for the time being it has closed,"" he added.
""Timing is everything at times. And I'd say we have recovered our total focus on our standalone strategy.""
Orcel will present a new three-year plan for UniCredit on Dec. 9, with significant investments in digital areas, whose cost the CEO said he was trying to offset through other cuts.
Orcel acknowledged UniCredit's ""natural"" footprint in several markets was higher than what it currently had, following a restructuring under predecessor Jean Pierre Mustier.
However, he added, ""UniCredit is demonstrating ... it can grow profitably in Italy."" 
The bank posted a third-quarter net profit of 1.06 billion euros ($1.2 billion), above analysts' average forecast of 838 million euros, thanks to shrinking loan losses and rising revenues.
""Do we need M&A? ... We do not,"" Orcel told analysts, adding he would only consider it if it ""strengthened the franchise and created even more value for investors.""
In entering exclusive talks over MPS in July, Orcel set strict terms, including a 10% lift to earnings per share. Talks collapsed when the parties could not agree on the bits of MPS that UniCredit would buy and their value - with sources pointing to a valuation gap of up to 3.5 billion euros. 
Orcel said he did not believe in tie-ups between banks and insurers, indirectly addressing market speculation about a potential deal with Generali (MI:GASI). 
He also dismissed the importance of existing tax breaks for mergers, which analysts have described as an incentive for a possible merger between UniCredit and Banco BPM.
'START OF OUR JOURNEY'
UniCredit's revenues totalled 4.44 billion euros in July-September, a surprise 1.9% annual rise and also unexpectedly up 0.8% on the previous quarter, when easing COVID-19 restrictions had driven an exceptional rebound in fees.
While down from the previous quarter, fees rose 12.5% year-on-year, helped by accelerating payment and card services over the summer.
Net interest income, UniCredit's Achilles' heel amid negative interest rates, rose 3.1% from March-June, helped by one-off items but also growing volumes, especially in eastern Europe, despite ongoing competitive pressure driving down rates.
""This is phenomenal progress in our performance, but we are only at the start of our journey,"" Orcel said.
After Mustier sold the crown jewels to raise cash to fix its balance sheet, UniCredit has suffered more than Intesa due to negative rates because it lacks the rival's fee-earning businesses like asset management and insurance.
Orcel said he did not believe in full ownership of such businesses for UniCredit, though he was ""very, very focused on improving our fee income generation.""
Orcel is reviewing UniCredit's partnerships, which include a 10-year accord with France's Amundi, Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY)'s asset manager which in 2017 bought UniCredit's Pioneer unit.
He said partnership terms should reflect UniCredit's privileged position as a distributor across markets spanning Italy, Germany, Austria and eastern Europe. 
UniCredit raised its 2021 underlying net profit projection above 3.7 billion euros, versus a previous forecast of more than 3 billion, on revenues of around 17.5 billion euros, from around 17.1 billion three months ago.
It also further reduced its forecast for loan losses this year after provisions in the quarter fell a larger-than-expected 60% from a year earlier to 297 million euros.
UniCredit had made hefty provisions against future pandemic-driven credit losses under Mustier, who was ousted after clashing with the board over strategy.

Shares rose 0.63% in early-afternoon trade, outperforming a flat sector.

Investing.com –  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) stock traded nearly 2% higher in Thursday’s premarket as strong demand for its construction and mining equipment and higher commodity prices took the company’s third-quarter numbers past analysts’ expectations.
Lower inventories at dealers’ end also helped the company.
Booming economies spurred manufacturing, mining and construction activities the world over which translated into higher margins for the company. Operating margins thus expanded by 340 basis points to 13.4%. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percent.
The company grew its revenue across business segments in double digits on an overall basis and across geographies.
Sales from Caterpillar's construction industries business, its largest unit, rose 30% while sales at its energy & transportation unit jumped 22%.
Sales and profit at its financial services subsidiary Caterpillar Financial were robust too.
Revenue rose 6% to $634 million. Profit more than doubled to $101 million.
As markets improved, the financial unit managed to improve collections from its customers. It closed the September quarter with past dues at 2.4% compared to 3.8% at the end of the same period in 2020.
Caterpillar’s total third-quarter revenue rose more than 25% to $12.4 billion. Inflation in commodities, metals and non-metals, showed up in nearly 25% higher cost of products sold.
Adjusted profit per share was 75% higher at $2.66, boosted by foreign currency gains.

The company has also secured several contract awards during this period. But the question is, is it wise to bet on the stock now even though the company's third-quarter revenue fell short of analysts’ expectations? Let’s discuss.Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) in Houston, Tex., is one of the world's largest providers of products and services to the energy industry. Soaring oil prices, higher cementing activity in the Middle East/Asia region, increased well intervention services in the Europe/Africa/CIS region, and improved drilling-related services have helped the company prosper. 
The stock has gained 13.5% in price over the past month to close yesterday’s trading session at $25.12. However, it is currently trading 6.1% below its 52-week high of $26.75, which it hit on October 25, 2021. According to Refinitiv IBES, even though HAL’s third-quarter profit was in line with analysts' estimates, its $3.86 billion in revenue was slightly below consensus expectations of $3.91 billion. 
Also, the U.S. Well Services, Inc. (USWS) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against HAL in April 2021, alleging that it infringed its electric fracking patents. Furthermore, Murry Gerber, a HAL board member, sold 44,590 shares last month. So, the stock’s near-term prospects look uncertain.

Investing.com -- Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) stock dropped 3.5% premarket as the e-commerce software provider missed estimates on both top and bottom lines, with concerns of a post-pandemic hangover rearing their head.
The Canadian company reported $0.81 in adjusted net income per share (adjusting out a big equity gain), and revenues of $1.12 billion, off from estimates of $1.24/share and $1.15 billion. The company’s outlook for Q4 was imprecise, but maintained the theme of moderating growth from 2020. “We continue to expect the fourth quarter to contribute the largest share of full-year revenue, and that the revenue spread will be more evenly distributed across the four quarters than it has been historically,” they said, while nodding to the challenges around the supply chain in retail more broadly. Shopify’s Q4 has accounted for 32-33% of yearly revenue the last two years, and current estimates are for 1.37B in Q4 revenue, which would amount to 30% of this year’s revenue.
Shopify crossed a notable milestone at $400 billion in cumulative gross merchandise value, doubling that figure in the last 16 months.
The company’s shares are trading hands at $1300 premarket, up 15% from the start of the year but down 3.8% from yesterday’s close and 21% from this year’s highs. The company of course was a huge 2020 winner, returning over 180% for shareholders.
This sets a tone for today’s post-market report from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), the leading e-commerce retailer, which missed revenue expectations in Q2 and has been off their highs as well."

OSLO (Reuters) -Telenor on Thursday posted quarterly earnings that lagged estimates, citing the unexpected persistence of the COVID-19 pandemic in Asia, and said it was still awaiting authorities' approval for the sale of its Myanmar business.
Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) for July-September fell 2% to 12.86 billion crowns ($1.52 billion), below the 13.19 billion analysts expected in a poll compiled by Telenor.
The group, half of whose revenue comes from Asia, said lockdowns and restrictions hit demand for telecoms services and slowed down recovery in Asia. 
""This has taken longer than we thought at the start of the year,"" Chief Executive Sigve Brekke said, adding there were now signs of improvement in the Asian markets in spite of the restrictions.
""The low level of international travel and roaming volumes will likely remain until restrictions are eased and mass-vaccination has gained traction,"" Telenor said in a statement earlier.
Subscription and traffic revenue dropped to 20.7 billion crowns from 21.5 billion in the third quarter of 2020. Telenor's Myanmar business, which is being held for sale, was not included in the numbers.
MYANMAR
Telenor wrote off the value of its Myanmar operations earlier this year following a military coup in February, and in July agreed to sell its business in the Southeast Asian nation to Lebanese investment firm M1 Group for $105 million. 
It has since cited pressure from the junta to activate intercept surveillance technology as the primary reason for its exit. Myanmar accounted for 7% of Telenor's earnings last year.
The current status of the process of getting the deal approved by Myanmar authorities in up in the air, Brekke said.

""Now it's just the decision process that remains. What we do now is we sit and wait, and meanwhile we have to run the operations on a daily basis,"" he told Reuters.
Myanmar's military rulers have asked Telenor executives not to leave the country pending regulatory approval.

Miners have been hard hit by the pandemic-led rise in expenses as they implement COVID-19 prevention measures to ensure the safety of workers and surrounding communities, and from supply chain issues due to global restrictions on movement. 
The company said its Tanami mine in Australia was placed under care and maintenance due to COVID-19 restrictions, while Canadian sites witnessed pandemic-related absenteeism and a tightening of the labor market, pushing production lower in both the countries. 
Newmont also said its Boddington mine in Australia was hit by severe weather and operational delays, while production at its Nevada gold mines was expected to be at the lower end of its annual forecast ranges. 
The company raised its forecast for all-in sustaining costs (AISC) to $1,050 per ounce, $80 higher than its previous outlook, citing lower production and increased royalties and taxes.
Newmont now expects annual attributable gold production of about 6 million ounces, compared with 6.5 million ounces forecast earlier. 
The company's third-quarter adjusted profit fell 30% to $483 million, or 60 cents per share, as bullion prices and sales declined.
Average prices for Newmont's gold was $1,778, down $135 per ounce from a year earlier, while attributable gold production fell 6% to 1.45 million ounces. 

Gold AISC for the quarter rose 10% to $1,120 per ounce, due to lower sales, higher diesel costs and increased capital spend. 
Newmont said it now expects an investment decision on its Yanacocha Sulfides project to expand gold production in Peru in the second half of 2022, a month after the company said the project had been delayed.

The company will expand its stock buyback program to $7 billion from $5 billion.

615,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2021 08:06AM ET</span>",China warns unlicensed online brokerages they are breaking the law,"By Samuel Shen and Andrew Galbraith
SHANGHAI (Reuters) -A Chinese central banker warned that online brokerages not licensed in China are acting illegally if they serve Chinese clients via the Internet, sending New York-listed shares of  Futu Holdings  (NASDAQ:FUTU) Ltd and UP Fintech Holding sharply lower.
""Cross-border online brokerages are driving in China without a driver's license. They're conducting illegal financial activities,"" Sun Tianqi, head of the Financial Stability Department of the People's Bank of China (PBOC), said in a speech, according to a transcript released on Wednesday.
Futu and UP Fintech shares slumped more than 20% in premarket trade on Thursday on Sun's remarks, the first official comments following recent media reports flagging regulatory risks facing online brokers.
Shares of the two firms had already tumbled since Oct. 14, when the official People's Daily said in an analysis on its website that Futu and UP Fintech face regulatory risks as China's new personal data privacy law takes effect on Nov. 1.
Investors are concerned that the sector will be next in Beijing's regulatory crosshairs, after China launched a flurry of crackdowns targeting sectors ranging from technology to cryptocurrency and real estate.
Investors need to see whether the Chinese government will restrict domestic individuals from opening an account at an offshore bank, and whether they can use this account to open a trading account with offshore brokers like Futu, Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note. 
SUFFICIENT CAPITAL 
Jefferies added that many Chinese securities firms have set up their offshore subsidiaries to provide Hong Kong or U.S. trading services to domestic individuals, and foreign brokers including Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR) Group Inc also accept mainland Chinese clients, so ""we need to wait for more guidelines from the regulators"".
Futu Chairman and CEO Hua Li said in a posting on Thursday that the company has business licenses in Hong Kong, enjoys a good track record, has sufficient capital and ""there are no bankruptcy issues."" 
The speech by the PBOC official threatens to further dent foreign investors' confidence in Chinese tech firms, said an institutional investor in UP Fintech, who declined to be named. 
Speaking at the Bund Summit in Shanghai over the weekend, PBOC's Sun said that some online brokerages, with only overseas licenses, serve mainly mainland Chinese investors, allowing them to trade U.S. and Hong Kong stocks.
Without identifying the firms, Sun said that 80% of accounts of a brokerage registered in the Cayman Islands were opened by mainland clients, while the ratio is 55% for another Hong Kong-registered brokerage. 
""Financial licenses have national boundaries,"" Sun said. ""Overseas institutions with only overseas licenses conducting business in mainland China is illegal financial activity.""
The transcript of Sun's speech was released on the website of the Finance 40 Forum, which organised the summit.

Futu, which has licenses in Hong Kong, Singapore and the United States, said in its 2020 annual report that it primarily serves the emerging affluent Chinese population and a large number of its clients are mainland Chinese citizens.
Futu said it does not believe it engages in securities brokerage business in China by redirecting users and clients to open accounts and make transactions outside China, but said there were regulatory risks.

Mastercard announced earnings per share of $2.37 on revenue of $4.99B, beating Investing.com analyst estimates of $2.18 and $4.95B. “Our performance was driven by the execution of our strategy, healthy domestic spending and solid growth in cross-border spending which has recently returned to pre-pandemic levels,” said Michael Miebach, Mastercard CEO, which ran counter to the view expressed by Visa that cross-border volume was still below pre-pandemic levels and would need until 2023 to get back to full levels.
Net revenue grew 30% on a year over year basis to $5B, while operating income grew 29%.

Anheuser Busch suspended its interim dividend during the pandemic as it focused on handling uncertainty and on deleveraging. The company said that its proposal about a full year 2021 dividend will be announced with the Q4 results in February.
The company’s current guidance for 2021 is for 10-12% EBITDA growth with faster revenue growth, vs. 8-12% EBITDA growth guidance on their previous call.

Panasonic raised its profit forecast for the year to March 31 to 370 billion yen ($3.25 billion) from 330 billion yen. The prediction is higher than a mean 368.1 billion yen profit based on forecasts from 20 analysts, Refinitiv data shows.
That improved outlook was largely the result of a 58.3 billion yen gain in the value of the company's 20% stake in Blue Yonder after it bought https://www.reuters.com/business/panasonic-says-it-will-buy-us-supply-chain-software-firm-blue-yonder-2021-04-23 the rest of U.S. software company for $7.1 billion in September.

Panasonic sold https://www.reuters.com/business/panasonic-sold-its-entire-stake-tesla-last-fiscal-year-nikkei-2021-06-24 its stake in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc for about 400 billion yen to help fund the acquisition of Blue Yonder, which uses machine learning to help companies manage supply chains by connecting factories to warehouses and retailers. 
Despite the sale of Tesla shares, it is increasing sales of auto batteries to the U.S. company as global demand for electric vehicles surge https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/major-carmakers-electric-vehicle-investment-production-goals-2021-10-26 amid stricter limits on carbon emissions.
Panasonic on Monday unveiled https://www.reuters.com/technology/panasonic-unveils-prototype-battery-tesla-2021-10-25 a new large prototype battery that will help Tesla lower production costs. Tesla claims the power unit will halve battery costs and help it ramp up battery production 100-fold by 2030.
For the three-months ending Sept. 30, Panasonic posted a profit of 96.8 billion yen, compared with a profit of 92.8 billion yen a year ago, worse than an estimated mean 105.9 billion yen profit from nine analyst surveyed by Refinitiv.
Component supply disruptions and higher material costs as a result of the pandemic hurt profits at some units, including appliances. A semiconductor shortage that forced carmakers to cut production also squeezed sales of automotive components, such as dashboard displays.

That chip shortage should begin easing in the remainder of the business year and improve after that, Chief Financial Officer Hirokazu Umeda told a press briefing.

Investing.com – Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDSa) ADRs traded 4.3% lower in Thursday’s premarket after the oil and gas major reported third-quarter sales and profit that fell short of expectations.
It also set aggressive targets to cut its carbon footprint though more was possible, raising the specter of higher spending on greener technologies and processes.
The company’s third-quarter profit more than quadrupled to $4.13 billion on revenue of $60.04 billion. The company is in the throes of tackling active investor Third Point's (NYSE:SPNT) demand that the company split its legacy and renewables businesses into two. The company's first reaction has been cold to the idea.
Shell took a hit of around $400 million on its adjusted earnings due to the damage caused by Hurricane Ida. It had flagged a hit to earnings earlier this month due to the hurricane that shut its operations for at least a fortnight in the Gulf of Mexico in August.
Shell aims to halve its direct emissions by 2030 in absolute terms, compared with 2016 levels, a more aggressive approach than its previous targets. The new goal covers Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, which are directly under Shell’s operational control.
While ambitious, it still leaves out Scope 3 emissions caused by users of Shell products. The company has pledged to become a net-zero emissions company by 2050."

631,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2021 06:51AM ET</span>",Volvo Cars hopes downsized IPO can rev up investors' electric dreams,"By Abhinav Ramnarayan and Helena Soderpalm
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Volvo Cars is hoping investors will buy into its long-term electric vehicle strategy and see past supply chain worries and questions about its shift to battery power as it gears up to make its market debut in Europe's biggest IPO so far this year. 
Shares in the Swedish carmaker, owned by China's Zhejiang Geely Holding, are due to start trading on Friday, a day later than initially planned after it cut the size of its listing and priced it at the bottom of a previously-announced range, valuing the firm at just over $18 billion.
The listing comes at a time when investor appetite for the electric vehicle (EV) sector is robust, with Elon Musk's Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) seeing its market value cross $1 trillion for the first time this week.
But concerns over how much control Geely would retain over the listed business, problems in the global supply chain and worries Volvo could be caught in trade wars involving China have curbed investor enthusiasm. 
Geely agreed last week to give up enhanced voting rights that would have given it 98% of any shareholder vote after listing, despite its stake dropping to around 84% 
Volvo Cars, whose models include the high-end XC-90 SUV, is in the midst of transforming to become a fully electric carmaker by 2030. Its Recharge electric models comprised 24.9% of its global sales in the first nine months of 2021, and it has a 49% stake in EV maker Polestar. 
Faith in that transition could be key to the IPO's success. 
""It's easier for a new company like Tesla or Polestar to start manufacturing electric vehicles, but for someone like Volvo transforming the old infrastructure and firing people and so on, it's a challenge,"" said NordLB automotive analyst Frank Schwope. 
""But even if it's not priced as expected it's encouraging for other companies as well. The COVID-19 pandemic was an inflection point for electric mobility,"" he added. 
So far, investors have only given partial approval. Volvo had sought a valuation of $18-$23 billion, before pricing the shares at 53 Swedish crowns apiece, at the bottom of that range. 
""The owner needed the deal to work this time round, so there was a real willingness to engage with investors,"" said a source familiar with the transaction.
""It has been a really tricky IPO market over the last few months, so it made sense to downsize the deal and price it sensibly. That's how the price discovery process works - this is good,"" he added. 
Expectations that rising inflation will lead to higher interest rates around the world have hurt stock market confidence and prompted a raft of IPO cancellations in Europe and the United States in recent weeks. 
Many deals that did go through over the past year are now in the red, with the FTSE Renaissance IPO Index of recently-listed companies down 10.6% this year.
A flotation attempt by Volvo Cars in 2018 was postponed due to trade tensions and a downturn in automotive stocks.

UniCredit on July 29 entered exclusive talks with the Italian Treasury to buy selected parts of Monte dei Paschi. The parties announced on Sunday talks had collapsed.
Orcel said UniCredit, which will present a new three-year plan in December, was working on a number of initiatives that it could have extended to MPS branches it planned to buy.

""We thought if we executed a deal quickly we could apply those initiatives to the combined franchise. Now that window has closed for us ... I know windows close and open but for the time being it has closed,"" he added.

 Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) said on Thursday it saw global output slump 39.1% in September from a year earlier to 512,765 units, marking the second straight month of falls.
Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor's global output fell for the third straight month by 27.9% in September, while that of Honda Motor dropped for a four month in a row, by 30%, data released by the automakers showed.
The output cuts by the automakers are starting to affect suppliers including Hitachi (OTC:HTHIY), which on Wednesday slightly slashed its consolidated operating profit forecast for the current fiscal year ending in March 2022.
""The impact of (chips shortages) likely was stronger in the third quarter than in the second quarter,"" Hitachi's chief financial officer Yoshihiko Kawamura told a news conference.
Electric equipment maker Canon Inc also cut its 2021 operating profit estimate by 11 billion yen ($97 million) to 272 billion yen as the cost of procuring parts rose and as factory disruptions in Southeast Asia, caused by COVID-19, hit sales.
With many Asian countries seeing infection numbers fall, some analysts expect supply constraints to ease in coming months. Toyota expects global output to recover to around 850,000-900,000 units in November.
But the output disruptions may deal a severe blow to Japan's economy, which has relied on exports to offset the weakness in consumption as the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic lingers.
The Bank of Japan cut this year's economic growth forecast in a quarterly report on Thursday, citing weak consumption and supply constraints.
But it raised its growth forecast for next fiscal year and described the slowdown in exports and output as ""temporary.""

Still, the central bank warned of the risk the economy could ""worsen further"" if supply bottlenecks last longer than expected or if the damage they cause grows.

Investing.com – Volkswagen stock (DE:VOWG) traded 3.6% lower in Europe as the chip shortage severely hampered production and sales in the third quarter, prompting Europe's largest carmaker cut its delivery outlook for the year.
The group now anticipates deliveries to be in line with the previous year’s 9.30 million units. It has delivered 6.95 million vehicles in the first nine months of the financial year.
At the same time, it expects revenue to be considerably higher than the prior-year’s 222.84 billion euros (around $259 billion). Volkswagen’s revenue for the first nine months stands at 186.59 billion euro.
Third-quarter production, deliveries and sales at the German carmaker were all lower from the year-ago period, falling 35%, around 24% and 30%, respectively, on a year-on-year basis.
The volume brands were affected most in this period, recording operating losses in spite of having full order books. The China business was disproportionately affected by the semiconductor shortage, the company said, and the high level of customer demand in China could also not be met.

637,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2021 06:22AM ET</span>",First reality check launched for corporate climate claims,"By Shadia Nasralla
LONDON (Reuters) -A U.N.-backed body launched a scheme to verify corporates' net zero strategies on Thursday that is likely to become a standard for regulators and investors to measure companies' climate ambitions.
With rising investor and societal pressure on companies to reduce emissions to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7°Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels, firms have come up with multiple ways to express climate strategies.
The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), a collaboration between the United Nations and commodities- and climate-focused non-governmental bodies, aims make corporate climate pledges comparable and, ultimately, more credible.
""For the first time, the SBTi Net-Zero Standard offers companies robust certification to demonstrate to consumers, investors and regulators that their net-zero targets are reducing emissions at the pace and scale required,"" Alberto Carrillo Pineda, Managing Director of the SBTi, said.
""We’re now inviting all companies with net-zero targets and ambitions to show stakeholders that their decarbonisation pathway is aligned with science.""
Large companies must convince the SBTi that they have a credible plan to halve their emissions before 2030 and eliminate 90-95% of emissions before 2050 compared with a base year after 2015.
Reductions have to cover greenhouse gas emissions from a company's direct operations and use of electricity, also known as Scope 1 and 2, as well as from the suppliers and end-users of its products, or Scope 3.
Many companies have signalled they would rely heavily on carbon offsets https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/carbon-offsets-gird-lift-off-big-money-gets-close-nature-2021-02-25 to get to net zero, which means buying or creating carbon offsets in an as-yet small and unregulated market for such certificates.
But to get the SBTi seal of approval, companies can only use offsets to cover a maximum of 10% of their emissions.
Of the up to 10%, only carbon removal projects, such as direct air carbon capture or reforestation will be counted.
Avoided deforestation or capturing carbon from smokestacks and sequestering it (carbon capture and storage), which merely prevents additional emissions from reaching the atmosphere, will be excluded.

Taking part in a pilot scheme, Danish renewable power company Orsted (OTC:DOGEF), U.S. companies CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) and real estate group JLL, public relations company Dentsu International, Swiss building material company  Holcim  (SIX:HOLN), pharma group AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and Indian digital service provider  Wipro  (NYSE:WIT) met the requirements.
Some sectors, such as forestry and agriculture and oil and gas will have to wait until next year to submit their strategies for verification.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) Inc said on Thursday its third-quarter distributable earnings jumped nearly fivefold, driven by record asset sales mostly in its private equity portfolio.
Distributable earnings reached a record $731 million, up from $152 million a year earlier. Carlyle reported after-tax distributable earnings per share of $1.54, which exceeded the average Wall Street analyst forecast of $1.02, according to Refinitiv.
The economic rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic and low interest rates have allowed many private equity firms like Carlyle to sell investments for top dollar and pushed merger and acquisition activity to new highs.
Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc, the world's largest private equity firm, reported last week that its distributable earnings more than doubled to an all-time high in the third quarter, owing to strong asset sales.
Washington, D.C.-based Carlyle said it generated a record $14 billion from selling assets in the quarter, including its minority stake in supplement maker The Bountiful Company to Nestle SA (SIX:NESN) and analytics firm Novetta Solutions to Accenture (NYSE:ACN) Plc.
Carlyle said it invested $6.3 billion to buy stakes in companies, including Texas-based software provider Abrigo and two subsidiaries of energy and environment firm Japan Asia Group.
""By any measure, it was a record quarter for us,"" Carlyle Chief Executive Kewsong Lee said in an interview. ""It's a factor of the environment and also we've been investing well in our companies."" 
Carlyle said its corporate private equity funds appreciated by 4%, while its real estate funds gained 9%. Funds managed under its secondaries business rose 10% during the quarter. By contrast, Blackstone reported a 9.9% appreciation in its private equity funds, while core real estate funds rose 7.6%.

Carlyle reported net income under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) of $533 million, up 80% from a year ago, driven by growth in investment income.

Net profit rose to 64.4 billion yuan ($10.07 billion) for the July-September quarter from 56.5 billion a year earlier, it said in an exchange filing on Thursday.
The bank reported a 1.48% non-performing loan ratio at the end of the third quarter, compared with 1.5% at the end of the previous quarter.
Net interest margin - a key indicator of bank profitability - was 2.12% at the end of the third quarter, the same as the level at the end of the second quarter before.
Bank of China, one of the big four state lenders, said in a recent research note that China's commercial banks are likely to post quarterly profit growth of about 3% in the June-September quarter, reflecting a steady recovery from the pandemic.
Most big state lenders recorded their worst ever first-half performance as the coronavirus pandemic got underway early last year, before they managed to eke out a small profit increase for 2020 and stabilised further in the first two quarters of 2021.
But the sector will nonetheless come under pressure from declining loan rates, requirements to set aside more loan-loss provisions, and challenges faced by non-interest earning businesses, according to the Bank of China report.

China's banking sector saw its bad-loan ratio rise to 1.87% at end-September versus 1.86% three months earlier as the impact of the pandemic lingered, the sector's regulator said.
While China's biggest banks will not give a breakdown of lending to the property sector in their third-quarter reports, as fears of contagion from any default by China Evergrande Group have mounted, some banks, insurers, and shadow banks stopped offering new credit to property developers, and ran urgent checks on their exposure to the sector.

Net profit for the July-September quarter rose to 5.45 billion yuan ($851.8 million) from 3.74 billion yuan a year earlier, CITIC said in a stock exchange filing on Thursday. 
It marked the company's best quarterly profit growth since the second quarter in 2020, when net profit jumped 121.7%.
Revenue of the commission fees from investment banking and asset management businesses rose 25.6% and 59%, respectively, in the first nine months of this year, the filing showed.
China in 2018 adopted a U.S-style, registration-based IPO system on Shanghai’s Nasdaq-style STAR Market, and later in Shenzhen’s start-up board ChiNext, in a bold reform designed to give the market a bigger role in evaluating IPO candidates.
The reforms are encouraging more companies to plan mainland listings, benefiting leading brokerages' investment banking and securities underwriting businesses.

CITIC had dominated the underwriting business for the IPO projects in the STAR Market and ChiNext, according to a research note of Zheshang Securities.
The brokerage's investment in the property sector declined 7.3% to 983 million yuan at the end of September, compared to the end of 2020, while the total investment increased 15% to 1.2 billion yuan, the filing showed.

Skanska, the Nordic region's largest builder and one of the biggest in the United States, said operating profit for the July-September quarter came in at 1.5 billion crowns ($179 million), mostly unchanged from a year earlier. It noted that while sales had slowed, profit margins had improved.
""The negative impact from the pandemic is still present in our markets but the activity is picking up as uncertainty is starting to decrease,"" it said in its 12-month outlook. 
CEO Anders Danielsson told Reuters that Skanska's projects had been little delayed by global supply chain bottlenecks, and margins had not been too affected by higher prices for steel, wood products and other building materials. 
To tackle shortages in land transport capacity, and in the case of Britain lengthier administration processes due to Brexit, Skanska has been making purchases earlier and has secured some storage facilities of its own to ensure vital materials are readily at hand, Danielsson said.
""We've had to work harder to get materials to the construction sites on time.""
To minimize the blow from higher prices for materials, Skanska tries to ink those costs before bidding for a project, he added.
Skanska generates roughy half of its profits from property development. While investor demand to buy Skanska's commercial properties has held up, the leasing market stalled as the use of offices slumped. 
Danielsson said the number of office showings to potential tenants had increased dramatically after the summer.
""Offices are summoning their employees back to the offices - it's very clear in the United states and Britain. I'm personally convinced that offices will continue to play an important role,"" he said.

Investing.com – Ford (NYSE:F) stock climbed more than 10% in Thursday’s premarket after the automaker raised its annual profit forecast for the second time in as many months while deciding to resume paying its dividend.
The company said semiconductor availability remains a challenge, but it was markedly improved from the second quarter, propelling sequential increases in wholesale shipments and revenue of 32% and 33%, respectively.
The company now expects its adjusted earnings before interest and taxes to be $11 billion at midpoint. Ford will pay its quarterly dividend of 10 cents a share on December 1. It had suspended the payout in March 2020 at the time of the pandemic.
While Ford sees the chip shortage easing, Bloomberg quoted Chief Financial Officer John Lawler as saying that it could still extend into 2023. Ford’s factories won’t run at full tilt until the end of next year, he said. “We are seeing about 10%” sales growth in 2021, Lawler said.
Lawler warned of a hit from rising commodity prices. They are expected to be up $3 billion to $3.5 billion for 2021, and could increase another $1.5 billion in 2022, a note by the company quoted him as saying.
North America was the bright spot for the company as the economies there reopened quicker than most and more people went back to work and began to lead normal lives. Improvement in semiconductor supplies in North America in the third quarter helped lift regional product shipments 67% from the second quarter. That increased volume pushed the business unit’s EBIT margin to 10.1%.
In China, retail sales of luxury Lincoln-brand vehicles were up 24% year-over-year. Last week, Ford began local production of its all-electric Mustang Mach-E in Chongqing.
At $35.7 billion, Ford’s total third-quarter revenue was down moderately from the same quarter a year ago and also behind expectations. Adjusted profit per share of 51 cents was less than 65 cents of 2020 September quarter’s but well ahead or analysts’ estimates this time.
According to CFO John Lawler, the company expects to invest $40 billion to $45 billion in strategic capital expenditures between 2020 and 2025 – including one-half of the more than $30 billion it plans to devote exclusively to battery electric vehicles during that same period.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Some airlines risk failure if they do not cut carbon emissions quicker in the next three to five years due to a mismatch between short-term corporate travel targets and the airline industry's 2050 net zero target, an industry report said.
Airlines are also at a rising risk of shareholder activism at a time when major fund managers such as BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), Vanguard Group Inc and  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT) have publicly expressed concerns about climate change, the report from CAPA Centre for Aviation and Envest Global released on Wednesday said.
""The pressure from customers and governments and investors is going to probably demand an acceleration of the journey to net zero, which is clearly going to put pressure on airlines,"" said David Wills, advisory executive director at Australian carbon reduction strategy firm Envest.
""The conditions are right for airlines who get it wrong to find themselves in a potential failure situation,"" he added.
Several companies, such as HSBC Holdings (NYSE:HSBC) plc, Zurich Insurance Group (OTC:ZFSVF) Ltd, Bain & Company and S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Inc, have already announced plans to quickly cut business travel emissions https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/corporate-business-travel-carbon-budgets-loom-airlines-2021-10-10 by as much as 70%.
Qantas Airways Chief Executive Alan Joyce said last week that his airline was developing a 2030 emissions target.
""Our view is that smart airlines will pivot to reinforcing not only 2050 but enhancing their definitive views on 2030, because they will be looking to engage with their corporate customers more,"" said Brett Mitsch, Envest's executive director of investment.
The CAPA/Envest report found the top quartile of 52 global airlines examined emitted an average of 30% less per passenger kilometre flown in 2019 than those in the bottom quartile. 
Low-cost carriers like Wizz Air, Ryanair and AirAsia with newer fleets and higher load factors were among the best performers, while the worst included Turkish Airlines, Japan Airlines Co Ltd (JAL) and British Airways.

JAL said it was introducing more fuel efficient planes and looking to secure more sustainable aviation fuel to meet a target of lowering absolute emissions by at least 10% from its 2019 levels by 2030.
The CAPA/Envest report said JAL was able to break even with a carbon price of more than $160 per tonne based on 2019 earnings, whereas many airlines with lower profit margins would have reported a loss at a carbon price of $30 per tonne.

MADRID (Reuters) -Spain's Banco Sabadell has no plans to sell TSB for now after recently rejecting an unsolicited offer from Co-op Bank, it said on Thursday, as the British unit helped the group beat third-quarter net profit forecasts. 
Sabadell more than doubled its net profit in the quarter to 149 million euros ($173 million) from the same period a year ago thanks also to a rise in lending income, buoyed by new mortgage loans in Spain.
Analysts polled by Reuters expected a net profit of 115 million euros. However, the outcome was below the 251 million euros in the third quarter of 2019, before the pandemic. 
Sabadell's 1.7 billion pounds ($2.3 billion) acquisition of TSB in 2015 backfired when IT glitches sent costs spiralling in 2018. It has for now frozen its plans to sell TSB until it completely turns around its business. 
""We are not considering any corporate transaction in the near future,"" Sabadell's Chief Executive Officer Cesar Gonzalez-Bueno told analysts on Thursday.
On a standalone basis, TSB booked a 47 million pounds net profit in the quarter, compared to a loss of 76 million pounds in the same period last year, driven by higher lending volumes and lower funding costs.
Gonzalez-Bueno expected an increase in loans to boost TSB's lending further through 2022 after net interest income (earnings from loans minus deposit costs) rose 20.7% year on year in the quarter.
Sabadell shares were 0.7% up, compared to a 0.2% decline in Spain's blue-chip index, as brokerages such as  Barclays  (LON:BARC) welcomed a good set of results, though highlighted that costs came in higher than expected.
COST SAVINGS
Facing ultra-low interest rates, European banks are under pressure to cut costs, either on their own or through tie-ups.
In the quarter, Sabadell booked a charge of 331 million euros as part of its process to lay off up to 1,605 employees in Spain, which it now expects to generate annual cost savings of 130 million euros, up from 100 million originally, including other cost measures.
Around 85% of those savings would be achieved in 2022, and the rest in 2023. 
Sabadell also said it was on track to meet its overall strategic plan targets for the year-end, which foresees low single-digit growth in net interest income.
Net interest income rose 4.3% in the third quarter from the same quarter a year ago to 877 million euros, above analysts' average forecast of 856 million.

SABIC reported a post-tax profit of 5.6 billion riyals ($1.5 billion), up from 1.1 billion riyals a year earlier but missing a 6.1 billion riyal consensus from estimates by four analysts compiled by Refinitiv.
Revenue increased 49% to 43.7 billion riyals.
Net income was helped not only by higher average selling prices but also by an increase in its share of results from joint ventures and associates, SABIC said. Unlike the third quarter of last year, there were also no material impairments.
Despite the increase in average sales prices, there was a moderation in margins due to rise in feedstock costs, it said.
“SABIC’s healthy financial performance during the third quarter of 2021 marked a continuation of our recovery from the impact of COVID-19, albeit at a lower level than our exceptionally strong performance during the second quarter,"" CEO Yousef Abdullah Al-Benyan said in a statement.

PARIS (Reuters) -TotalEnergies said high gas prices in Europe and Asia could last into spring as the French energy group reported a sharp rise in third quarter earnings on Thursday on surging power prices.
The company's third-quarter adjusted net profit soared to $4.8 billion, from just $848 million last year, from core earnings that more than doubled to $11.2 billion.
CEO Patrick Pouyanne told reporters that low supplies and sustained strong demand would likely keep gas prices high in Europe and Asia until next spring, though they should start to ease off after the winter.
The group, which is aggressively expanding into electricity and renewable energy, estimated its production of gas and crude oil would reach their highest levels since the second quarter of 2020.
It said it should produce between 2.85 and 2.9 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (mboepd) in the last three months of 2021, after it reached 2.814 mboepd in the third quarter.
TotalEnergies also predicted its average sales price for liquefied natural gas (LNG) would rise to more than $12 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in the last quarter, from $9.10 in the previous three months.
The company confirmed plans to buy back $1.5 billion worth of shares over the final three months of the year, which it had announced in late September on the back of the high power prices.
WIND IN THE SAILS
Buoyed by high gas prices, TotalEnergies said its net investments this year should reach close to $13 billion, at the top of a range it announced earlier in the year.
The company, which rebranded last spring, aims to be one of the world's top five renewable power producers by 2030, though meanwhile it continues to dedicate some three-quarters of its investments to oil and gas.
Like its rivals, TotalEnergies has come under pressure from climate campaigners and some shareholders to speed up the shift from fossil fuels to cleaner sources of energy.

Pouyanne said he had ""no doubt"" the company would reach its 2030 target of 100 GW in renewable energy production capacity, as it looks to add a further 6 GW next year.
He said the company could grow quickly in offshore wind, and would consider buying smaller renewable energy developers.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's largest brewer, upgraded its forecast for 2021 earnings growth on Thursday after posting a surprise increase in third-quarter profit, buoyed by beer sales in Brazil.
The maker of Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois said it expects core profit or EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) to grow between 10% and 12% in 2021, compared with an 8%-12% growth forecast earlier.
The Belgium-based company's shares were up 7.3% at 52.94 euros at 0800 GMT, making them clearly the strongest performers in the FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading European shares, although they are still 20% down from a mid-June peak.
Some analysts had raised concerns about AB InBev even meeting its original guidance. Broker Nomura noted the new guidance was the brewer's first upgrade in several years after it outperformed expectations in every region in the third quarter.
AB InBev said core profit rose 3.0% on a like-for-like basis in the July-Sept period, against an expected 2.3% drop, according to a company-compiled poll.
It said revenue grew 15.3% in Brazil as consumers drank more and purchased higher-priced beers.
Revenue and profits were also higher in Colombia and South Africa, reflecting easing of COVID-19 restrictions, and in Europe as vaccination rates increased.
However, they declined in the United States, where there were supply chain disruptions, as well as in Mexico, a year on from post-lockdown inventory replenishment, and in China, where COVID-19 restrictions disproportionately hit its key regions.
AB InBev's results follow mixed earnings reported by its rivals on Wednesday.

Carlsberg (OTC:CABGY), the world's number three brewer, raised its 2021 profit forecast after higher-than-expected third-quarter revenue, helped by recovery in Europe and China.

HELSINKI/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Nokia (NYSE:NOK) reported a stronger-than-expected third-quarter operating profit on Thursday on higher demand for 5G gear, but warned the global shortage of semiconductors would hit its supply chain.
Shares of the Finland-based company were up 5% as investors lauded its efforts to get back on track following product missteps last year by riding on 5G demand and taking market share away from rivals, particularly in China.
Any problem in supplying to customers on time might dent those ambitions.
""At the moment, we are limited by semiconductor availability, that will affect Q4 and it's quite possible that this challenge will get bigger before it starts getting better,"" Chief Executive Officer Pekka Lundmark said in an interview.
Global producers of goods from televisions to cars have faced a host of supply chain issues ranging from a shortage of vital components, manpower, logistics snarls, and delays at plants because of power cuts in China.
Rival Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) https://www.reuters.com/technology/ericsson-profit-beats-expectations-5g-demand-despite-china-setback-2021-10-19 last week also warned of supply chain issues.
""We are working every single day with the suppliers on all levels of the organisation and I have also been personally involved in these discussions,"" Lundmark said.
Nokia's quarterly net sales rose 2% to 5.4 billion euros ($6.27 billion) from 5.3 billion a year ago, in line with analysts' expectations.
The company expects comparable operating profit margin to be towards the upper end of the target range of 10% to 12%.
Comparable operating profit during July-September surged to 633 million euros from 486 million last year, beating the 488 million euros forecast by 11 analysts polled by Refinitiv.
While its mainstay mobile network business suffered from lost business in the United States, network infrastructure grew 6% in constant currency and cloud and network services rose 12%.
""The 5G market is still growing and we expect that it will still take a couple of years before it reaches its peak,"" Lundmark said
In July, Nokia won its first 5G radio https://www.reuters.com/technology/nokia-wins-first-5g-radio-contract-china-2021-07-19/#:~:text=STOCKHOLM%2C%20July%2019%20(Reuters),up%20in%20a%20political%20spat contract in China, while rival Ericsson lost market share after Sweden last year decided to ban Chinese vendors from their 5G networks.

The budget airline, Europe's largest, said refunds would be processed into a new online wallet function within 24 hours of a flight being cancelled, allowing customers to book new flights immediately or opt to get the funds back within five working days.
Ryanair was one of a number of airlines criticised during the pandemic for resisting issuing cash refunds to people who could not take their flights due to COVID-19 restrictions, which the airlines said were outside of their control. 
Some customers also complained of delays to refunds for cancelled flights and unwieldy refund request processes. 
Britain's competition authority in June launched enforcement action against Ryanair over a failure to offer refunds rather than rebooking to passengers who were barred from taking flights under lockdown rules. But earlier this month it withdrew the action. 
Ryanair said it had paid refunds in justified cases after reviewing each case. 
In September Ryanair joined a group of European airlines in agreeing to refund passengers whose flights were cancelled during the pandemic, and committed to provide better information on passengers' rights in future.
Ryanair said it was making a fresh customer service push to build on its 2014 'Always Getting Better' campaign when Chief Executive Michael O'Leary vowed to stop doing things that ""unnecessarily piss people off"".

A new feature of its app promised real time push notifications and videos from its operations centre to inform customers of their flight status and any disruptions.
It also said customers would be able to makes changes to flights or passengers' names via the app rather than calling a customer service agent.

The Swiss company is the latest to warn about shortages as suppliers struggled to keep pace with resurgent post-pandemic demand.
Clariant, whose products range from catalysts for chemical production and fuel processing to chemicals for personal care products and paints, said its costs had leapt by 25% in the third quarter. 
Some products like ethylene and propylene derivatives had seen increases of 50%.
Chief Executive Konrad Keijzer told reporters Clariant had responded by lifting prices by 9% and was confident that would be accepted by customers.
""The company hasn't had such a significant price increase in one quarter, year on year, in its history. We are also seeing an unprecedented environment in terms of raw material inflation.
""We do expect to pass this on to our clients, we are confident. Right now we are about two thirds of the way in terms of passing it through.""
German chemicals company BASF on Wednesday said higher procurement costs were weighing on its businesses making farming pesticides, coatings and nutritional supplements, where margins and earnings slipped.
Clariant improved its profit margins during the third quarter while its sales beat analyst forecasts, boosting its shares 4% in early trading.
""The company is doing well in the difficult situation,"" said Vontobel analyst Sibylle Bischofberger.
Sales rose 23% to 1.10 billion Swiss francs ($1.20 billion) in the three months to the end of September, better than the 1.05 billion francs expected by analysts. 
Core earnings (EBITDA) increased by 42% to 180 million francs at a margin of 16.4%, up from 14.2% a year previously.

Clariant now expects full-year sales, in local currencies, to rise 9-11%, up from previous guidance of 7-9%. It confirmed previous guidance for a full-year EBITDA margin of 16-17%.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Group Corp on Thursday squeezed out a surprise 1% rise in operating profit for its second quarter though costs from growing sales of its PlayStation 5 (PS5) console pressed on margins.
Weaker profitability in the key games segment could also not stop the group hiking its full-year operating forecast by 6% to 1 trillion yen ($8.81 billion) from its August forecast, driven by expected profit growth in movies, music and electronics. 
Sony said it has sold a cumulative 13.4 million units PS5 units since launch last November. That contributed to a 27% year-on-year jump in sales at its gaming unit, though profit was less robust as the conglomerate sold hardware below cost.
Manufacturers frequently sell new consoles at a loss as they build an install base for software sales, with component shortages providing extra pain for makers of the latest generation of devices.
Chief Financial Officer Hiroki Totoki said Sony is on track to sell 14.8 million PS5 consoles this financial year - a target that takes into account the global shortages. Sales of first-party titles fell, though sales from other developers grew.
Gaming firms' earnings were flattered last year by stay-at-home demand during the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, sliding PlayStation user numbers have stabilised, Totoki said, as the company approaches the year-end shopping season. 
Sony also said it is considering partnering Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd in its plans to build a chip plant in Japan without confirming further details, amid a corporate scramble to secure long-term stable semiconductor supply.
Sony reported group profit of 318.5 billion yen for July-September, beating the 222 billion yen average of six analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv. 
The conglomerate - spanning areas such as entertainment, sensors and financial services - switched to IFRS accounting standards from U.S. GAAP in the current financial year.
Across its business, Sony is enmeshed in a global battle for consumer attention as entertainment giants look beyond the United States for growth and mine non-English-language creators for content.
In a blow to Sony's pop culture credentials, South Korea's top cultural export, boy band BTS, said last week it has dropped its Columbia Records label for a deal with Universal Music Group (AS:UMG) NV.

Other challenges include an investor attempt to oust the management of India's Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd, casting a shadow over merger talks with Sony's local unit.

660,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2021 04:01AM ET</span>","Global green bond issuance could pass $1 trln next year, survey says","By Nina Chestney
LONDON (Reuters) - Investors expect global green bond investment to double and reach $1 trillion for the first time in a single year by the end of 2022, a survey by the Climate Bonds Initiative showed on Thursday.
The Climate Bonds Initiative, a London-based non-profit body that promotes investment in the low-carbon economy, forecasts that green bond issuance will reach a record high of $500 billion this year, up from $297 billion recorded last year.
Corporations and financial institutions are under growing pressure from investors to improve their environment, social and governance (ESG) activities, with the issuance of so-called green bonds to raise money for low-carbon projects becoming increasingly popular.
Although they make up a small fraction of the overall debt market, green bonds are attracting attention because trillions of dollars of capital is required from the public and private sectors to meet emissions-reduction targets.
The survey was conducted based on 353 responses from companies, asset owners and investment managers, development banks and regulators, as well as ratings and verification service providers.
It showed that the largest group of respondents, accounting for a quarter of responses, said the fourth quarter of next year was when green bond investment would pass $1 trillion.
Some 13% of respondents thought the $1 trillion milestone would be passed in the fourth quarter of 2023, 12% said it would be passed in the second quarter of 2023 and 10% predicted the third quarter of 2023. The rest thought the milestone would be reached further out.

""The long-awaited $1 trillion milestone is now a market reality, whether at the end of 2022 or during 2023,"" said Sean Kidney, chief executive of the Climate Bonds Initiative.
""But the climate crisis grows. It’s time to lift our sights and aim higher. $5 trillion in annual green investment by 2025 must be the new mark for policymakers and global finance to achieve,"" he added.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - From engineers to pilots, Thailand's aviation industry is gearing up for a grand reopening on Monday when the tourism-reliant country will welcome vaccinated arrivals without quarantine, ending nearly 19 months of strict entry rules.
""It's something everybody's waiting for,"" said Puttipong Prasarttong-Osoth, president of the Thai airline association, which has seven members, including Thai Smile Airways, Thai AirAsia and Thai VietJet Air.
Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha announced this month that vaccinated arrivals from 46 countries would be allowed entry without quarantine from November.
Airlines have responded quickly, bringing back jets from hibernation, or long-term parking, where they have been kept with their engines covered for protection and systems wound down.
""It is in our DNA, it's easy to come back and reinstate,"" said Thai AirAsia Head of Engineering Banyat Hansakul, referring to the routine of preparing the planes. ""It's like riding a bicycle.""
Already, Thai AirAsia had been using 10 jets from its fleet of 60, while Bangkok Airways was flying 13 planes of a total 38, mostly for domestic travel after a pilot project that reopened Phuket and Samui islands in July.
Both airlines expect to use more planes in the months ahead anticipating greater travel with passengers from neighbouring Cambodia, Singapore and Malaysia as restrictions ease.
Flag carrier Thai Airways International Pcl has rolled out a winter schedule with Bangkok routes to London, Munich, Sydney and Tokyo. 
Though optimism about initial tourist arrival numbers is tempered, with other countries still observing quarantine measures, Thai AirAsia pilot Wirote Teerawattananon, 30, said he was content.
""I'm happy to go back to flying again, tourists are coming back, so we get to come back to work,"" he said. 
Thailand welcomed about 40 million foreign arrivals in 2019. This year the government is targeting just 100,000.
COVID-19 has cost Thailand, one of Asia's most popular destinations, an estimated $50 billion a year in tourism revenue. Its airlines have also suffered heavy losses.

Thai Airways and low-cost affiliate Nok Air Pcl are undergoing bankruptcy-protected restructuring. Another airline, NokScoot, entered liquidation last year. 
""I'm really looking forward to the return of foreigners,"" said Thai AirAsia crew member, Kohchamon Pithayapipat. ""Foreign spending can provide income to even small and medium businesses.""

Operating profit rose 61% to 346 billion yen ($3.05 billion) in the six months through Sept. 30 from a year ago, driven by strong sales of mainstay drugs, the company said. Takeda reiterated its full-year operating profit forecast at 488 billion yen. That compares with a consensus forecast of 509.2 billion yen, according to a Refinitiv poll of 13 analysts.
Takeda, Japan's biggest drugmaker and among the top 10 globally after its 2019 takeover of  Shire  Plc (LON:SHP), has traditionally depended on sales of cancer and gastrointestinal treatments.
But the company is also involved in vaccines, developing an innoculation for dengue fever and helping to bring into Japan the COVID-19 shots developed by  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc and  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) Inc.
The Shire purchase increased Takeda's debt load, prompting it to sell off https://www.reuters.com/article/us-takeda-pharma-m-a-blackstone-group/takeda-to-sell-japan-consumer-health-unit-valued-at-2-3-billion-to-blackstone-idUSKBN25K0P3 more than $10 billion in over-the-counter assets to focus on prescription drugs.
With some of its main brands due to lose patent protection in the coming years, Takeda is betting on a pipeline of more than 10 drugs in late-stage development. 
It has, however, met obstacles. Takeda said in September a blood cancer treatment known as Pevonedistat failed in its study, while trials of narcolepsy drug TAK-994 were halted this month because of safety concerns. (nFWN2Q30XK)
Takeda's shares have fallen 13% this year, compared with a 5.1% gain in the benchmark Nikkei 225 index. The company said it would purchase up to 2.23% of shares worth 100 billion yen.

The shares trade at a ""substantial discount to what we perceive is their underlying value,"" CFO Costa Saroukos said in a statement.

 Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico  SAB De CV ADR (NYSE:PAC) reported on Thursday third quarter earnings  that beat analysts' forecasts and revenue that topped expectations.
GAP ADR announced earnings per ADS share of $1.71 on revenue of $262.14M. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $1.3 on revenue of $252.96M.
The growth was unsurprisingly high from 2020, as aeronautical and non-aeronautical services revenue increased 121% on a peso basis from the year prior, and total revenue increased 72.5%. A bigger sign of the recovery is that total revenue was 22.6% from Q3 2019, with EBITDA up 27% from 2019 and EBITDA margin up to 71.3% from 69.5% in 2019, suggesting pent-up demand after 2020's travel restrictions.
Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacífico pointed out that passenger traffic is still down 16.1% from 2019 as there are continued restrictions to international travel, but cited Canada reopening to non-essential travel in September and the U.S.A. “gradually reopening land-border crossings to fully vaccinated individuals,” which could help the company’s cross-border Tijuana airport.
The company bought back Ps 1,151.3M of shares in Q3, paid down Ps 1.5B in debt from proceeds of a debt offering in Q2, and paid a capital reduction dividend of ps 7.8/share, equivalent to $3.82/share on the US-traded ADS shares.
Other publicly-traded Mexican airport companies reported earnings this week as well, including Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste SAB de CV ADR (NYSE:ASR) and Grupo Aeroportuario del Centro Norte SAB de CV (NASDAQ:OMAB). ASR, which like PAC is more exposed to tourism, saw passenger traffic down only 1.4% from Q3 2019 as air traffic to/from their San Juan, Puerto Rico airport grew 16.3% from those pre-pandemic levels. ASR’s revenue rose 18.5% vs. 2019, or 11.2% if excluding construction revenues, and the company’s EBITDA rose 17.7% from 2019. ASR has traded mostly flat since its earnings.
OMAB, which is more exposed to the industrial sector and inter-Americas trade, saw revenues rise 10.3% from Q3 2019, or .2% when excluding construction revenues. OMAB’s earnings per ADS were $.81/share, down from $.89 in 2019, though EBITDA was up 1.6%. OMAB’s shares traded down .5% yesterday after the report.
Aena SME SA (MC:AENA), a 5% owner of GAP, reports earnings on Friday at 13:00 Central European time. Analysts polled by investing.com expect earnings of .57/share with revenue of 870.58M. Aena has beaten revenue expectations through the pandemic, and beat earnings numbers last quarter."

The German company plans to offset rising costs of raw materials by increasing prices and cutting costs, targeting a small increase in its operating margin in 2022, finance chief Astrid Hermann told analysts on Thursday.
Beiersdorf made the forecasts after reporting third-quarter sales rose an underlying 4.3% to 1.9 billion euros ($2.2 billion), shy of some analysts' forecasts.
Beauty specialist L'Oreal last week posted third-quarter organic revenue growth of 13.1%, fuelled by demand for its luxury lines and growth in China. [nL1N2RH1TG[
Beiersdorf shares, about to re-enter Germany's blue-chip index, opened down 1.5%.
Its consumer business saw third-quarter organic sales rise 4.1%, driven by a strong performance of Eucerin and Aquaphor creams, as well as premium brand La Prairie, which had been hit by the halt to global travel due to the coronavirus pandemic.
As people returned to beaches, the Nivea brand saw a strong recovery of sun creams as well as shower gels and deodorants. Beiersdorf said it planned to launch its Eucerin Sun line in the United States at the start of 2022.
Chief Executive Vincent Warnery told analysts that Eucerin was benefiting from the expertise of the U.S. sun care brand Coppertone it bought in 2019, adding retailers were already showing strong interest in the new line.
The Tesa adhesives unit, which accounts for about a fifth of sales, reported third-quarter organic sales growth of 4.6%, helped by growth in the Chinese electronics business.

Beiersdorf increased its 2021 outlook for Tesa's organic sales growth to 11-13% from a previous ""high single digit range"" and said it expected the automotive business - that has been hit by shortages of computer chips - to recover in 2022.

The British company said its overall financial performance was in line with expectations and it witnessed growth in markets including the United States and Southern Europe.
Shares in DS Smith were up 2.3% at 388.4 pence in early trading as investors overlooked the London-listed company's warning of an increase in costs, mainly driven by higher paper and logistical expenses. 
The paper industry, like many others, was hit by shutdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic which led to supply and price pressures. However, an online shopping boom and DS Smith's plan to tap growing demand for recyclable boxes have helped the firm.

""Whilst the macro-economic environment remains uncertain, sustainability and the circular economy, together with e-commerce and digital enablement, remain more relevant than ever and are strong structural drivers of growth,"" Chief Executive Officer Miles Roberts said.

LONDON (Reuters) -Lloyds Banking Group upgraded its outlook after posting better than expected quarterly profit on Thursday in CEO Charlie Nunn's first set of earnings at the bellwether bank.
Britain's biggest mortgage lender posted pretax profit of 2 billion pounds ($2.2 billion) for the July-September period, double the figure in the same period last year and better than analyst expectations for 1.3 billion pounds.
Like rivals  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and HSBC, Lloyds' results were boosted by the release of cash - 84 million pounds - it had set aside for bad loans last year when the economic outlook looked gloomier.
The bank now expects loan impairments to be a net credit for the year and its return on tangible equity - a key measure of profitability - to be more than 10%, up from 5-7% at the end of 2020.
The bank's shares rose 2.5% in early trading, the second-best performer on the benchmark FTSE 100 index.
Former HSBC veteran Nunn took the helm at Lloyds in August, replacing long-standing boss Antonio Horta-Osorio after he left to chair crisis-hit  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).
Nunn inherits a bank placed on an even keel by his predecessor but faces a challenge to improve returns amid near-zero benchmark interest rates and intensifying competition from digital rivals.
""There are clearly significant opportunities for Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY) to further develop its platforms and capabilities and grow,"" Nunn said. 
The bank’s core capital ratio – a measure of a bank’s financial strength – increased to 17.2%, well above its target of 12.5%.
""The capital position is much stronger than expected, which bodes well for future shareholder distributions, and we continue to think a sizeable share buyback will be announced alongside the full-year results in February,"" analysts at Shore Capital said in a note.
Costs for past misdeeds continued to dent profit, however, with the bank setting aside a further 100 million pounds for remediation charges, including compensation for victims of historic fraud at its HBOS Reading branch.

Lloyds has tried to trim costs under Nunn and this month axed a further 48 branches across England and Wales as banks across the sector cut back their high street presence in response to growing use of digital banking.

Zhongyuan Bank, created in 2014 with the merger of 13 smaller banks in Henan, will acquire Bank of Luoyang, Bank of Pingdingshan and Bank of Jiaozuo China Travel Services Co, according to the company's filing with the Hong Kong exchange on Wednesday.
Bank of Luoyang was listed as one of 20 main banks for embattled property giant China Evergrande Group，according to the developer's interim report released in September. 
Bank of Luoyang has not elaborated on its loan exposure to Evergrande. At the end of 2020, 9.15% of its outstanding loans were lent to the property sector, according to its annual report. 
After the completion of the potential merger, Zhongyuan Bank will continue to expand its business and ""enhance the ability of financial services for the economic and social development of the province"", it said.
Zhongyuan did not elaborate how it will settle assets and liabilities of the three small banks, and cautioned the deal had yet to be finalised.
In September, China's northeastern province of Liaoning set up Bank of Liaoshen, a new provincial level commercial bank formed by merging local banks, amid a deteriorating economy in the rustbelt province.
The local economy in Henan was disrupted by COVID-19 pandemic, and heavy flooding in July killed more than 300 people, heightening the pressure on the local banking system.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) also wants to limit Google's ability to pay Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to have its search engine installed as the default option on the smartphone maker's devices, the regulator said in a report on Thursday.
The measures would put Australia roughly in line with Europe, which has forced Google to offer a choice of search engine on phones using its Android operating system. Google has 94% of the Australian search engine market, which makes money by selling advertisements.
""We are concerned that Google's dominance and its ability to use its financial resources to fund arrangements to be the default search engine on many devices and other means through which consumers access search, such as browsers, is harming competition and consumers,"" said ACCC Chair Rod Sims in a statement.
""Google pays billions of dollars each year for these placements, which illustrates how being the default search engine is extremely valuable to Google's business model.""
The search engine report was part of the ACCC's wider examination of large internet companies, which led this year to laws making Google and social media giant  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) pay media companies for content on their websites.
A Google spokesperson said the company was reviewing the report and looked forward to discussing it with the ACCC and government.

""Android gives people choice by allowing them to customise their device, from the apps they download to the default services for those apps,"" the spokesperson said.

It increased its sales to $6.5 billion from $5.1 billion a year earlier as it cashed in on higher grain prices while it tackled what it called a worsening supply chain situation.
Syngenta said it was ""actively managing"" its supply chain to offset global market constraints, a situation made worse in China by energy shortages hitting pesticide and crop nutrition manufacturing during the third quarter. 
Procurement, logistics and other operating cost increases were partially offset by higher selling prices across all businesses, Syngenta added. 
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 13% to $800 million, the company said. 
Syngenta was seeing particularly strong demand for products which help farmers overcome extreme weather conditions such as a spray made from seaweed which helps grape vines deal with temperature extremes. 

Syngenta, which competes with Germany's Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) and U.S. agrochemicals company  Corteva  (NYSE:CTVA), was bought by state-owned ChemChinafor $43 billion in 2017, and is now poised for a flotation.
The Shanghai stock exchange this month resumed a review of the flotation, after the process was temporarily suspended when the company needed to provide updated financial reports.

RIYADH (Reuters) -  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) wants to pursue a banking license in Saudi Arabia to further boost its business in the kingdom by expanding into trade finance and treasury solutions, a senior executive said.
Citi was awarded a Saudi capital markets licence in 2017, allowing it to return to the kingdom in 2018 after a 13-year absence. 
It advised  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) on its $29.4 billion listing in 2019, in what was the world's biggest initial public offering, as well as on several sovereign and corporate bond deals.
""We have seen significant growth during this time and we're still very interested in making further investments locally in the market,"" Ebru Pakcan, Citi's head of EMEA emerging markets business, told Reuters on the sidelines of Saudi Arabia's FII investment conference.
""As our clients make more investments across multiple growth potential sectors, we are interested in expanding our capabilities and services locally over time by pursuing a banking license.""
Citigroup's client business model is built around serving multinational companies globally, as well as bringing global investors opportunities in a local market. 
""When we work with those global corporates, especially in cash management and trade finance and other treasury solutions, actually being a deposit taking institution with local payments and collections capabilities becomes important,"" she said.
Western financial institutions have been expanding in Saudi Arabia since the government unveiled plans to privatise state assets and adopted reforms as part of an economic strategy to cut dependence on oil.
Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) this year began offering banking services through its branch in Saudi Arabia after it was granted a banking licence in 2019.
Pakcan said Citigroup plans to hire more people in Saudi Arabia, potentially doubling or tripling the team over the next few years.

She also said UAE will be one of its global wealth management centres, focusing on the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and emerging markets.
In the other parts of emerging markets, she said Citigroup is ""watching closely"" markets such as Ghana in Africa and Uzbekistan in Central Asia, as the markets evolve and continue to attract more multinational companies.

OSLO (Reuters) -Norwegian Air reported a 68% rise in third-quarter revenue on Thursday, as European travel gradually recovers from the pandemic, and the airline said it would continue to scale up following a brush with bankruptcy that slashed its business. 
The budget carrier's sales for July-September amounted to 1.52 billion Norwegian crowns ($180 million), up from 905 million crowns a year ago when travel remained severely restricted by COVID-19 lockdowns.
The pandemic sent the indebted airline into bankruptcy proceedings https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/norwegian-air-saved-collapse-reinvents-regional-carrier-2021-05-26 last year, forcing it to terminate its transatlantic network before emerging in a slimmed-down version in May 2021.
""We are now in a strong financial position going into the traditionally more challenging winter months,"" Chief Executive Geir Karlsen said in a statement.
""We have seen a positive trend in forward bookings month on month and an increasing number of passengers are choosing to fly Norwegian across our European network,"" he added.
Bookings have risen in response to vaccinations and the relaxation of travel restrictions, and the company said it expected its available seat kilometres (ASK), a key capacity metric, to rise to 29 billion in 2022 from 18.2 billion in 2020.
Year-to-date for 2021, ASK stood at just 4.8 billion kilometres.
Norwegian's court-ordered restructuring, which was also supported by Norway's government, cut the airline's fleet to 51 aircraft from around 160, but the company said on Wednesday it had agreed to lease a further 13 planes to support growing demand. [L8N2RN6LR]
""Supported by the positive development in demand and strong booking curve, the company intends to continue the ramp-up plans in the fourth quarter, increasing the fleet to a peak of 50 short-haul aircraft in operation before the end of 2021 and ramp-up to around 70 short-haul aircraft in 2022,"" it said on Thursday.

Norwegian's debt was reduced by around 80% during reconstruction as creditors took control, but the company now faces fresh competition from Flyr on domestic routes in Norway and some foreign destinations.
The company has cash and cash equivalents of 7.6 billion crowns, and said cash burn would be low during the traditionally loss-making winter season.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - In wealthy Singapore, where new vehicle registration is tightly controlled to manage the city state's traffic and pollution, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc is having a moment: surging sales are gobbling up rivals' market share.
The buying frenzy in one of the world's most expensive places to own a vehicle - Tesla's most basic Model 3 costs nearly S$200,000 ($148,300) in Singapore, largely due to an ownership levy, compared with less than $40,000 in the United States - underscores the U.S. firm's ascent in the global auto industry.
This week, Tesla surpassed $1 trillion in market value, overshadowing the combined value of five of its biggest rivals,  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY),  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and General Motors (NYSE:GM).
The number of new Teslas on Singapore roads has risen more than ten-fold to 487 in the third quarter, from just 30 in the first half, data from Singapore's Land Transport Authority (LTA) showed.
""I bought the car because I'm a supporter and shareholder of the company,"" said software engineer Tim Shim, who reserved a Model 3 five years ago but received just recently as sales began this year in the city-state.
Helped by Tesla fans like Shim, the company became Singapore's sixth-most popular car brand in September, outselling Nissan (OTC:NSANY), Audi and Kia. 
Experts say there is no single cause for the surge, although Singapore did announce this year up to S$45,000 subsidy for buyers of electric cars. Because Tesla seems to have fared better than other companies at weathering supply chain issues, it may simply be able to deliver more cars than competitors.
""Pent up demand is relatively large. Now the supply is in place and Tesla is most likely working through a large backlog,"" said Niels de Boer, an electromobility expert at Nanyang Technological University (NTU).
There were 314 Teslas registered last month in Singapore, almost on par with Hyundai and trailing top brands Toyota Motor Corp's 778 and Honda Motor's 466.
Tesla declined to comment on its performance in Singapore.
Its website shows new buyers still have to wait 4-12 weeks to get their cars.
TESLA'S GAIN IS OTHERS' LOSS
Singapore's strict limits on car registrations until early 2025 mean Tesla's market share gain comes at the cost of its rivals in the tiny and competitive country, which runs 50 km (31 miles) from east to west and 27 km from north to south. 
Daimler (OTC:DDAIF)'s Mercedes-Benz and Nissan saw a average monthly new car registrations decline in the third quarter, down 45% and 27% respectively from the first half of this year, according to a Reuters calculation.
Although monthly car registration dropped 15.8% on average last quarter from the first half, only Tesla and Korean car makers Hyundai and Kia bucked the trend among major vendors. Hyundai and Kia reported 13.6% and 25% sales rises respectively.
Analysts and industry experts said factory disruptions caused by a global chip shortage also probably affected deliveries and sales in recent months. Hyundai and Tesla are among a handful of carmakers that fared better than rivals in managing disruptions. 
(For graphic on Top brands vs Tesla's performance in 2021 - https://graphics.reuters.com/TESLA-SINGAPORE/gdpzywlwdvw/chart.png) 
""A Tesla car is cheaper to own when compared to equivalent class sedans from other famous Western brands like Mercedes and BMW,"" said Andy Seo, who switched to Tesla from a Volvo. He said it costs about S$20-S$30 to fully charge a Model 3 near his home.
NTU's de Boer expects the Tesla frenzy to fade longer term as competition heats up, but said it could help broaden adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). 
""I think Tesla will help with the shift: this is buying an EV while being cool and trendy,"" he said. 
(For graphic on Top three car brands in Singapore vs Tesla (Jan-Sept 2021)- https://graphics.reuters.com/TESLA-SINGAPORE/egvbkmxmwpq/chart.png) 
Tesla made up 1.4% of 36,629 new car registrations in Singapore this year, compared with top player Toyota's 20.4%.
Singapore, which Tesla CEO Elon Musk once criticised for not being supportive of EVs, plans to phase out all internal combustion engine vehicles https://www.reuters.com/article/us-singapore-economy-budget-autos-idUSKBN20C15D by 2040 and is encouraging drivers to switch to EVs through a range of measures, including more tax breaks and subsidies.

Investing.com - The dollar edged higher in early European hours Thursday, with policy decisions by central bankers in Australia, Japan and Europe jolting trading.
At 2:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.1% higher at 93.835, with movements seen limited ahead of next week’s policy-setting meeting by the Federal Reserve.
USD/JPY traded 0.2% lower at 113.56 after the Bank of Japan kept its interest rates and asset buying plans unchanged Thursday. The central bank also cut its projection for economic growth this fiscal year and also reduced its inflation forecast to zero for the year ending in March 2022 from 0.6%, suggesting it will lag other central banks in reining in its accommodative monetary policies. 
Earlier in the day Australia’s central bank decided against buying a government bond central to its stimulus program even though yields were well above its target of 0.1%. This fuelled market expectation that the Reserve Bank of Australia will lift its 0.1% benchmark interest rate much sooner than the previous guidance of 2024, perhaps even by mid-2022.
AUD/USD traded 0.1% lower at 0.7504, still near its three month high.
Additionally, USD/CAD rose 0.2% to 1.2374 after the Bank of Canada ended its bond-buying stimulus on Wednesday, suggesting it could hike interest rates as soon as April 2022 as it seeks to tackle elevated inflation levels. 
EUR/USD traded flat at 1.1604, just above its 15-month low of 1.1523 hit earlier this month ahead of the European Central Bank’s policy-setting meeting later Thursday.
The ECB is widely expected to use its December meeting to announce key decisions about its emergency stimulus policies, but the strong rise in inflationary pressures has lifted rate-hike expectations.
“It still seems rather far-fetched that the ECB will move its benchmark rates as early as next year,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note, “and [ECB President Christine] Lagarde will probably seek to tone down current market pricing.”  
Elsewhere, GBP/USD edged lower to 1.3742 the day after U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak delivered his annual budget, committing to real-term increases in spending on the back of upgraded forecasts to economic growth and tax revenues.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd said on Thursday it expects component shortages to affect chip demand from some customers in the final three months of the year, after reporting its highest quarterly profit in three years.
The warning comes as producers of goods from televisions to cars have faced a host of supply chain issues ranging from a shortage of logic chip parts, manpower shortages, logistics snarls, and delays at parts plants due to power cuts in China. 
""A longer-than-expected component supply issue may need to be monitored"" for potential impact on devices that use memory chips, Samsung (KS:005930) said, although it added there was ""strong fundamental demand"" for server chips. 
""There is much uncertainty due to various macro issues including the effect of 'back-to-normal', component supply and raw material price hikes,"" said Han Jin-man, executive vice president of memory business. 
""But... component supply issues seem to stem more from mismatches in supply chain management rather than from an absolute lack of supply... So the situation may improve from the second half of next year."" 
Samsung said demand for server DRAM chips, which temporarily save data, and NAND flash chips that serve the data storage market, is expected to stay robust in the fourth quarter due to expansion of data centre investments, while personal computer manufacturing growth is expected to hold in line with the previous quarter. 
Although supply chain issues could limit demand from some mobile chip customers in the fourth quarter, demand for server and personal computer chips is expected to be robust in 2022 despite uncertainties, it said. 
Samsung said falling memory chip prices were not a huge cause of concern because the chips are now used in a wider variety of devices than just personal computers, making cyclical price fluctuations weaker and shorter than in the past. Chipmakers were also carrying lean inventory levels, leaving room for a build-up without being forced to sell at a low price. 
Falling memory prices have weighed on the company's shares as investors expect prices to have peaked in the third quarter before falling until mid-2022. 
""There seems to be a clear gap in memory price outlook between chipmakers and the market. Companies are expressing a firm will to not sell chips at low prices,"" said Park Sung-soon, analyst at Cape Investment & Securities. 
""However, even server chip demand is not guaranteed at this point as the component supply issues are also affecting them."" 
Analysts expect Samsung's fourth quarter earnings to be level or below its third quarter result, largely depending on memory chip prices. 
Smaller rival SK Hynix on Tuesday struck a more bullish note than U.S. peers and forecast steady demand for memory chips. Earlier, chipmakers Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Micron (NASDAQ:MU) had said shortages of some components were stopping their customers from shipping PCs. 
THREE-YEAR HIGH
The world's top maker of memory chips and smartphones posted a 28% jump in operating profit in the July-September quarter to 15.8 trillion won ($13.48 billion) on the back of an 82% on-year profit surge in its chip business, where earnings rose to 10.1 trillion won. 
Rising memory chip prices, plus a jump in profitability at Samsung's chip-contract manufacturing business boosted the chip business' operating profit. 
Operating profit at Samsung's mobile division slid about 24% on-year to 3.36 trillion won on the third quarter, as sales of Samsung's new foldable smartphones were tempered by marketing costs. 
Net profit rose 31% to 12.3 trillion won. Revenue rose 10% to a record 74 trillion won. 

Samsung's shares rose 0.3% in afternoon trade on Thursday, compared with the wider market's 0.2% rise. It shares have fallen about 13% year-to-date.

Global leaders will gather in Glasgow, Scotland, from Sunday for a United Nations climate summit, when negotiators will seek to set rules on how carbon markets can be used under the Paris accord.
Just 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) are covered by a regulated price, and the schemes that exist establish prices often too low to effect real change, a report by the GFMA and Boston Consulting Group said.
""Effective carbon pricing in the economy is one of the strongest tools to drive changed outcomes, treating GHG emissions as a time-limited resource,"" Steve Ashley, Chairman of GFMA and Head of Wholesale Division at Nomura, said.
An emissions trading system (ETS) sets a cap on the amount of emissions that a sector, or group of sectors, can produce. It creates ""carbon permits"" for those emissions that companies can buy for each tonne of carbon dioxide (CO2) they emit.
The average cost of a tonne of CO2 in existing schemes is less than $5 and needs rise to $50-150 a tonne by 2030 to meet the Paris goals, the report said.
Carbon prices in Europe’s ETS, the world's most established scheme, trade around 60 euros ($69.83) a tonne, while China’s ETS, which launched earlier this year, prices carbon at around 43 yuan ($6.73).
A global carbon price of $100 per tonne or more is needed by 2050 to meet climate goals, a Reuters poll of climate economists found earlier this month.

Biden is expected to leave on Thursday for a meeting of G20 leaders in Rome and then the U.N. Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland. The Glasgow conference was expected to be a showcase for Biden to demonstrate U.S. efforts to tackle climate change and ask other countries to adopt similar measures.
The U.S. president was likely to delay his departure to Europe by a few hours as he was expected to attend the House Democratic Caucus meeting on Thursday morning, CNN and NBC News reported late on Wednesday, in what would likely be an attempt to secure the backing of progressive lawmakers for his agenda.
Biden's $1.5 trillion-$2 trillion spending plan aimed at curbing climate change and expanding the social safety net remained mired in intraparty squabbles on Wednesday, as did a linked $1 trillion infrastructure bill that also includes climate-related measures.
Time has simply run out for anything to be finalized before Biden leaves, a key Democrat indicated. 
""I think a framework deal is likely in the next 24 to 36 hours,"" House of Representatives Democratic Conference Chairman Hakeem Jeffries told reporters after a meeting with Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
Others agreed it seemed unlikely there would be an agreement on Wednesday, and suggested fundamental issues, like how to pay for it, remain. 
""I don't know,"" said Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats. ""But I don't think so. I'm not quite clear in terms of the revenue package. Every sensible revenue option seems to be destroyed."" 
The White House sought earlier on Wednesday to portray it as still ""realistic"" that Biden's signature spending plan could get congressional support by Thursday, but conceded that he might need to depart for Europe without a final deal in hand. 
""Of course he would like to head on this trip with a deal,” White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters. She added, however, that world leaders are “looking at the president’s commitment” on infrastructure and climate, not what is being passed in Congress. 
""They’re seeing we’re on the verge of making a deal,"" she said. 

Biden would need to sign any passed bill into law. He would not push back his trip substantially to advocate for it further, Psaki said earlier on Wednesday.
""There's some flexibility in the morning, but I'm not going to suggest he's going to delay his trip.""

The South Korean battery maker, which supplies electric car batteries to carmakers including Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Hyundai Motor Co, will buy shares in Decarbonization Plus Acquisition Corporation III, a shell company through which Solid Power plans to go public through a merger that will value the combined firm at about $1.2 billion.

Solid-state batteries are a potential game changer for electric vehicles (EV) because they can store more energy, charge faster and are safer than liquid lithium-ion batteries.
They are, however, more difficult and expensive to mass produce and more prone to cracking.
Manufacturers could use existing plants make solid-state batteries, Doug Campbell, the CEO of Solid State told Reuters. The company wanted to commercialise the technology by 2026, he added.

689,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2021 09:31PM ET</span>","Boeing shares down slightly on 787, Starliner costs","By Sanjana Shivdas and Eric M. Johnson
(Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co reported a quarterly net loss after fresh charges on its problem-plagued 787 and Starliner spacecraft programs, masking a small underlying profit as air travel recovers from the pandemic.
The 737 MAX and 787 are integral to Boeing's ability to rebound from the pandemic and a safety scandal caused by two fatal crashes, while its Starliner has fallen behind dominating space rival Elon Musk's SpaceX.
Boeing shares were down 1.6% to $206.40 in midday trading, against a fractionally lower Dow Jones Industrial Average.
""We have a clear line of sight to the steps ahead"" on resuming 787 deliveries, Chief Executive Dave Calhoun told analysts on a conference call but gave no specific timeline pending regulatory approvals.
Boeing said the price tag for inspections and repairs due to 787 structural defects amassed over the last two years would be roughly $1 billion - or $183 million in the quarter, confirming for the first time estimates reported by Reuters in February.
It has twice halted 787 deliveries, with the latest stoppage ongoing since May and resulting in an inventory of more than 100 jets worth $9 billion cash.
Boeing also booked a charge of $185 million on its long-delayed Starliner astronaut capsule for NASA's Commercial Crew Program, due to delays and repairs from faulty fuel valves that sidelined the spacecraft after its August flight attempt.
Meanwhile, SpaceX's Dragon capsule has ferried astronauts and supplies to orbit four times.
Revenue rose 8% to about $15.3 billion, fueled by 737 MAX deliveries and growth in Boeing's services unit as it sees recovery in the air travel market.
Boeing delivered 62 of its 737s in the quarter, with some 370 of its 737 MAX jets in inventory, a third of which were for customers in China, executives said.
It is meanwhile building 19 of the jets monthly, up from 16 in last quarter, with ongoing plans to push to 31 per month in early 2022.
On the prospect of ramping to 50 or more jets monthly, Calhoun said, ""The wild card in this one isn't demand. It's all about the supply chain. Whether it's two, three or four years, I'm not sure. I do think we get there.""
Rival Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) is charging forward with planned production increases to a record 64 per month by second-quarter 2023, with possible further increases beyond that. Its plans have produced a backlash from suppliers and leasing companies.
Calhoun struck a cautious note, telling analysts the whole industry would face narrowbody supply constraints from the second half of 2022 and lasting through 2023. 
Boeing has been producing about two 787 jets monthly at its South Carolina factory with plans to go back to an already slow rate of five a month at some future point - analysts expect that to take a year. 
On forthcoming jets, Boeing began engine performance flight tests earlier this month on its already years-delayed 777X mini-jumbo, and still expects a first delivery in late 2023, and is evaluating the launch timing of a freighter version, Calhoun said. 
Chicago-based Boeing reported a net loss of $132 million, compared with a loss of $466 million a year ago, but a core operating profit of $59 million. 
An adjusted loss of 60 cents per share compared with analysts' average estimate of 20 cents per share, according to Refinitiv data.

Quarterly free cash flow of negative $507 million compared with negative $5 billion a year ago, while Boeing's mountain of debt fell to $62.4 billion from $63.6 billion.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Nasdaq ended little changed on Wednesday, boosted by gains in Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) on the heels of their quarterly results, but a drop in oil prices and a pullback in Treasury yields weighed on cyclical sectors and pulled the S&P 500 lower.
 Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) gained 4.21% to close at a record high after forecasting a strong end to the calendar year, fueled in part by its booming cloud business. Alphabet Inc jumped 4.96% after reporting a record quarterly profit on a surge in ad sales. 
The gains in the two stocks accounted for nearly 90 points to the upside in the tech-heavy Nasdaq while Microsoft was the biggest boost to the Dow Industrials, S&P 500 and Nasdaq. 
A pullback in longer-term U.S. Treasury bond yields and a flattening of the yield curve also helped support growth names such as those in consumer discretionary and communications services, which were the only advancing S&P sectors on the day.
The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield declined for a fourth straight day, dropping more than 6 basis points to put it on track for its biggest one-day decline since Aug. 13.
""The growthy names will get a boost not just from some of the earnings stuff but because interest rates are lower,"" said Megan Horneman, director of portfolio strategy at Verdence Capital Advisors in Hunt Valley, Maryland.
""Interest rates are temporarily lower because of the fact that there is some uncertainty from the tax perspective and what that might do. We do know the Fed is going to taper, that has pretty much been priced in but now you have a lot of talk about what the future of the Federal Reserve may look like.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 266.19 points, or 0.74%, to 35,490.69, the S&P 500 lost 23.11 points, or 0.51%, to 4,551.68 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.12 point, or unchanged, to 15,235.84.
In contrast, the flattening curve served to weaken financials, while a drop in crude prices after data on U.S. stockpiles pulled energy names lower, with both sectors suffering their biggest one-day percentage decline in five weeks. JP Morgan shares fell 2.08% and  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) declined 2.60%. 
A solid start to earnings season has helped push the S&P 500 and the Dow to all-time highs this week, as investor concerns over the ability of companies to navigate supply-chain bottlenecks, labor shortages and rising price pressures have been allayed for now. The Nasdaq sits less than 1% away from Sept. 7 closing record. 
""While we are not out of the woods by any means, companies are adjusting quicker than we had anticipated,"" said Horneman. 
Profits for S&P 500 companies are expected to grow 37.6% year-on-year in the third quarter. Out of the 192 companies that have reported earnings, 82.8% have topped analyst expectations, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
The move into the growth names like technology stocks was also triggered after some U.S. Senate Democrats proposed taxing billionaires' unrealized gains from their assets, while concerns around the timing of rate hikes resurfaced ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting next week. 
The S&P 500 growth index climbed about 0.28% while its value counterpart fell 1.44%. 
 Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) tumbled 10.44% after the retail broker reported downbeat third-quarter revenue as trading levels declined for cryptocurrencies including dogecoin.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.43-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.29-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 36 new 52-week highs and 5 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 72 new highs and 133 new lows. 
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.74 billion shares, compared with the 10.43 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

692,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2021 07:15PM ET</span>","Exclusive-Lloyd's of London ups climate pledge, to push members on net zero","By Simon Jessop and Carolyn Cohn
LONDON (Reuters) - Lloyd's of London said on Thursday it would join peers in scaling up efforts to cut carbon emissions and push members of the commercial insurance market to do the same, days before international climate talks get underway in Scotland.
Lloyd's has long been seen as a laggard on climate action, leaving decisions on whether to underwrite activities in a range of heavy-emitting sectors to its 100-odd syndicate members amid sharp criticism from activists. 
As pressure builds on financial companies to act on climate, Lloyd's said it had joined the United Nations-convened Net Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA), a body aiming to reduce the sector's emissions and help cap global warming.
By joining, Lloyd's said it was committing to moving all of its operational and attributable greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050 at the latest. It will also set, publish and report against interim science-based targets every five years to ensure action in the near term.
Part of that effort would see it move its 3 billion-pound ($4.12 billion) Central Fund, which backstops members' liabilities, to net zero by switching to green investments.
""(We) are fully committed to working collaboratively across the financial sector to achieve its net zero ambition,"" Lloyd's Chief Executive John Neal said in a statement.
On the more contentious issue of its members' activities, Lloyd's last week wrote a 'Dear CEO' letter to its insurers to warn them they would need to come up with an environmental, social and governance plan in the second half of 2022.
This follows the launch of Lloyd's' own inaugural ESG strategy last year, years behind many of the top European insurers and reinsurers.
""Lloyd’s will advocate and support all market participants to introduce and implement their own net zero plans in order to reach a net zero underwriting position for the market by 2050 at the latest,"" it said in the statement.
""These new formal expectations will be embedded into the Lloyd’s market oversight framework, putting climate action at the heart of annual business planning cycles with syndicates.""
Lloyd's members' ESG commitments would form a key part of the risk assessment process when Lloyd's signs off their annual business plans for 2023, it said, which in turn can affect the members' ability to write business in the market. 
""Achieving net-zero emissions will require transformation across the entire economy,"" said Nigel Topping, UN High-level Climate Action Champion at the COP26 climate talks starting in Glasgow on Sunday. 
""Insurance will be absolutely critical to enabling that transition and to building resilience to climate shocks.

""I welcome the ambition from Lloyd’s in leading the Lloyd’s marketplace to a net zero underwriting position by using their influence with market participants to full effect.”

693,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2021 07:05PM ET</span>",White House signals flexibility over Dec. 8 vaccine deadline,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Biden administration's COVID-19 vaccination deadline will not require immediate action on the part of employers against unvaccinated employees when it comes into force on Dec. 8, the White House coronavirus response coordinator said on Wednesday.
Some lawyers previously interpreted President Joe Biden's Sept. 9 executive order and subsequent White House guidance requiring all covered federal contractor employees to be vaccinated by Dec. 8 unless they got a religious or medical exemption.
The White House comments suggest federal contractors employing millions of U.S. workers have significant flexibility in enforcing COVID-19 rules and will not be required to immediate lay-off workers, but will have time for education, counseling and other measures before potentially ending employment.
Jeff Zients said he expects federal agencies and contractors ""will follow their standard HR processes and that for any of the probably relatively small percent of employees that are not in compliance they'll go through education, counseling, accommodations and then enforcement.""
Zients said he does not expect any disruptions to the U.S. economy as a result of the mandate.
""We’re creating flexibility within the system … There is not a cliff here,"" Zients said, emphasizing the goal is to get people vaccinated ""not to punish them so we do not expect any disruptions.""
He added: ""These processes play out across weeks not days.""
His comments were more explicit than those https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-airlines-white-house-say-vaccine-mandate-will-not-impact-holiday-travel-2021-10-21 last week.
Zients also said a new emergency measure will soon be finalized to ensure private sector workers at companies with 100 or more employees are fully vaccinated or tested for COVID-19 at least weekly.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) said last Thursday they did not think the Dec. 8 deadline would impact holiday travel or result in employees leaving. 
Some airlines and industry-watchers initially feared an exodus of unvaccinated airline or government employees involved in travel just before the Christmas season.
Southwest Airlines Chief Executive Gary Kelly said last week: ""We want our employees to know that nobody is going to lose their job on December 9 if we're not perfectly in compliance... ""We're not going to fire anybody who doesn't get vaccinated.""
American Airlines Chief Executive Doug Parker said last week he did not expect any employees to leave as a result of the vaccine mandate.
A group representing FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX),  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) and other cargo carriers told the White House last week it would be virtually impossible to have 100% of their respective work forces vaccinated by Dec. 8.

Many federal contractors have told employees that they risk losing their jobs if they are not vaccinated by Dec. 8. Raytheon Technologies' (NYSE:RTX.N) Chief Executive Greg Hayes warned in a CNBC interview Tuesday the U.S. aerospace and defense firm will lose 'several thousand' employees who refuse to take COVID-19 vaccines, as it prepares to meet the Dec. 8 deadline.
Republican Senator Roger Wicker on Wednesday urged Biden to abandon the plan, saying ""we cannot afford to gut our transportation network of tens and perhaps hundreds of thousands of essential, good-paying jobs.""

694,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2021 06:56PM ET</span>","Ford, GM juggle high prices, supply chain pressure in Tesla's shadow","DETROIT (Reuters) -Detroit automakers Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) both took advantage of insatiable demand from U.S. consumers for trucks and SUVs to offset the pain caused by supply chain bottlenecks.
But both automakers warned investors that the cost pressures created by disruptions in the global semiconductor supply chain and price spikes for other commodities will continue well into next year.
For the Detroit automakers, that means sustaining a complex juggling act: Pushing the price envelope on popular vehicles such as the Ford F-150 or Cadillac Escalade while scrambling to stabilize flows of semiconductors and keeping a lid on the costs of raw materials from steel to aluminum to magnesium.
How much higher prices https://www.reuters.com/business/us-companies-keep-prices-high-supply-chain-headaches-persist-2021-10-27 can go is a key question. The average GM vehicle sold for more than $47,000 during the third quarter. Ford raised prices on vehicles sold in North America by nearly $3,500 each, on average. Both companies said the higher prices offset higher raw material costs in the quarter.
The results Ford and GM reported on Wednesday show managing the supply chain pressure will not be easy, and that investors are watching the companies closely and critically. 
GM shares tumbled 5.2% on Wednesday even though the company said its full-year 2021 operating profits would be at the high end of a range between $11.5 billion to $13.5 billion. 
Both of the once-dominant Detroit automakers are now overshadowed by electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, which last week reported stronger profit margins and earlier this week achieved a market capitalization of $1 trillion, more than its top five rival automakers combined. 
While relying almost entirely for now on profits from petroleum-fueled trucks, both GM and Ford executives talked up their ambitions to challenge Tesla in the EV market.
GM Chief Executive Mary Barra told CNBC the company could ""absolutely"" catch up to Tesla in U.S. sales of EVs by 2025. Ford executives said they will invest $30 billion in battery electric vehicle development from 2020-2025.
Ford Chief Executive Jim Farley said the automaker has orders for 160,000 of its electric F-150 Lightning pickups, and its electric Transit commercial van is ""completely sold out.""
Ford reported a stronger-than-expected third-quarter profit https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/ford-motor-posts-stronger-than-expected-profit-raises-full-year-forecast-2021-10-27 and raised its full-year earnings forecast as strong demand for its trucks helped offset the hit from a global semiconductor shortage.
However, Ford cautioned that higher steel and aluminum prices could cost it $1.5 billion next year, and warned of ""inflationary pressure impacting a broad range of costs"" in 2022.
Ford reported revenues of $35.7 billion for the latest quarter - more than GM, long the larger company by vehicle unit sales and overall revenue. GM earlier on Wednesday reported quarterly revenue https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/gm-upbeat-full-year-earnings-despite-quarterly-profit-drop-2021-10-27 of $26.8 billion.
Barra said the company was hit by pandemic-related shutdowns of semiconductor factories in Malaysia. Ford executives said their supplies of chips improved.
Ford's net income fell to $1.8 billion, from $2.4 billion a year earlier. Still, Ford said it will restore a quarterly dividend, paying shareholders 10 cents a share or $400 million in total in the fourth quarter.
Ford's Farley said the automaker expects a rapid recovery as the pandemic and supply chain snarls ease. 
Another challenge GM and Ford will share if supply chain pressures do ease in the second half of 2022 is finding a new sweet spot for prices, production volumes and inventories of vehicles at dealerships.

Ford officials said the company wants to aim for 50 days of vehicles in stock, not the 75 that was normal before the pandemic. Barra said GM also wants to keep inventories in tighter check.
""As availability does improve … the very strong pricing will mitigate some,"" Barra said. ""But we will be very disciplined.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Workers at the leading U.S. meatpacking plants experienced cases and death from COVID-19 that were up to three times previous estimates, according to a report by the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis seen by Reuters.
The U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee surveyed major meatpackers  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN), JBS USA, Cargill, National Beef and Smithfield Foods, which together control over 80% of the beef market and 60% of the pork market in the United States. 
At those companies’ plants, worker cases of COVID-19 totaled 59,147 and deaths totaled 269, based on counts through January of this year, according to the report which was released on Wednesday ahead of the subcommittee hearing on the pandemic's impact on meatpacking workers.
That is far higher than a previous estimate by the Food and Environment Reporting Network (FERN), which had been used by government agencies and media throughout the pandemic, according to the report. FERN had counted 22,694 cases and 88 deaths among workers at the five companies as of Sept. 8, primarily drawing on data from news reports and public health agencies. 
""Until now, we have not had a full sense of how hard meatpacking workers were hit,"" U.S. Representative James Clyburn, chairman of the subcommittee, said in his opening statement at the hearing. 
The meatpacking industry was especially hard hit by COVID-19 in part because its workers tend to be in close proximity for long hours in often messy conditions.
The new data comes from company calculations of worker cases primarily based on testing done within company facilities, meaning some infections identified through other health providers could have been excluded. 
Cases were especially high at certain plants, including JBS’s Hyrum, Utah, beef plant and Tyson’s Amarillo, Texas, beef plant, where around 50% of workers contracted the virus, according to the report. 
The subcommittee's findings also included new details of lax safety protocols at some of the plants.
In May 2020 at Tyson's Amarillo plant, for instance, workers wore masks “saturated” with fluids, were not socially distanced, and were separated by “plastic bags on frames” instead of CDC-compliant barriers, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) memo obtained by the subcommittee.
Both Tyson and JBS said in statements on Wednesday that they have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on COVID-19 health and safety efforts. 
Cargill said in a statement that it was ""saddened by the tragic impacts of this virus on our colleagues and the communities in which we operate.""
Smithfield said in a statement that it implemented safety measures to protect employees and tested its workers frequently, uncovering asymptomatic cases. 
Officials from National Beef were not immediately available for comment.
The subcommittee report also suggested that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) had not done enough to protect workers in the meat industry from the virus.
OSHA staff told the subcommittee that under former President Donald Trump, the agency’s leadership made a political decision not to issue an emergency temporary standard (ETS) that would have required meatpackers to take certain safety precautions, the report said.
“Without being held to any specific standard, meatpacking companies were left with largely unchecked discretion to determine how to respond to the coronavirus pandemic, to the detriment of meatpacking workers,” the report said.
Debbie Berkowitz, a fellow with Georgetown University's Kalmanovitz Initiative for Labor and the Working Poor, said at the hearing that OSHA had ""abandoned their responsibility to protect workers in the last administration."" 

Advocates testified that OSHA should issue an ETS similar to the one issued for healthcare workers, and ensure it responds to worker complaints.
Martin Rosas, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 2, said those steps are necessary ""to protect those who bring food to our tables.""

Both Coles and bigger rival Woolworths Group have benefited from on-and-off lockdowns over the year sending people into a buying frenzy, with big cities such as Melbourne forced into some of the world's longest COVID-19 curbs.
""As a result of the lockdowns, there was a return to local shopping at the expense of shopping centres, as well as increased demand for ecommerce,"" Coles said in a statement. 
The over 100-year-old grocery chain reported total sales of A$9.76 billion ($7.33 billion) in the quarter, up from A$9.61 billion last year and beating a UBS estimate of A$9.65 billion. 
Woolworths had pointed to sales starting to slow down in October on easing restrictions, but Coles said comparable sales for its supermarket business in the early stages of the second quarter were broadly in-line with the prior quarter.

Coles' supermarket business sales, which accounts for most of the group's earnings, rose 1.8% from a year earlier to A$8.62 billion.

The Dow Jones rose for the third straight day to hit a new high on October 26. Also that day, the S&P 500 hit a fresh high. Roughly 38% of the S&P 500 members have so far reported third-quarter earnings. Of these companies, 83% have surpassed consensus EPS estimates, while 79% have beaten revenue estimates.
While the robust earnings reports and declining jobless claims are driving the markets higher, factors including surging COVID-19 cases, intensifying supply chain issues, and increasing inflation could soon precipitate a market correction. As such, we think it could be wise to follow a buy-and-hold strategy now.
With a wide market reach, expanding customer base, and impressive day-to-date developments, mega-cap stocks—which possess a market capitalization of more than $200 billion—have the potential to dodge the short-term fluctuations and deliver substantial returns in the long run.

The prices of aluminum stocks Aluminum Corporation of China (ACH),  Alcoa  Corporation (NYSE:AA), and Constellium (NYSE:CSTM) have slumped recently, but they could bounce back in the near term on their fundamental strength and rising aluminum prices. So, we think these stocks could be solid bets now. Let’s discuss.
In addition to being essential to the construction industry, aluminum’s capacity to conduct heat and electricity makes it a popular choice for the electrical and electronics industries. While the demand for aluminum is rising with the reopening of industrial sectors worldwide, China, the world's biggest manufacturer of base metals, reduced its production to comply with its climate policies. As a result, aluminum prices rose to 13-year highs in September.
Earlier this month, aluminum prices reached $3,064 per ton on the London Metal Exchange, registering its highest price since July 2008. Furthermore, the aluminum market is expected to increase at a 5% CAGR between 2021-2026.

The company was a big corporate winner in 2020 when lockdowns forced people to shop on its online marketplace, but growth has slowed since then as vaccinations encourage consumers to step out.
EBay said it expected fourth-quarter revenue between $2.57 billion and $2.62 billion, well below analysts' average estimate of $2.65 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
The company also reported a 5% decline in the number of active buyers on its marketplace in the third quarter.
Gross merchandise volume, the total dollar value of sales on eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) from which the company takes a percentage, fell 10%.
But a strong showing by its payment services and the expansion of its advertising portfolio drove a 11% jump in revenue that was better expectations.
The company has doubled down on its core auction and e-commerce business in recent years through deals in a bid to fend off rising competition from industry behemoth Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and upstarts such as Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) Inc.

It earned 90 cents per share on an adjusted basis, a cent above estimates.
For the current quarter, it expects adjusted profit between 97 cents and $1.01 per share. Analysts expected $1 per share.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) suffered a setback on Wednesday as EU antitrust regulators opened a full-scale investigation into its $54 billion bid for British chip designer ARM on concerns the deal could lead to higher prices, less choice and reduced innovation.
Britain's competition agency is also probing the deal for the country's most important technology company, warning that it could damage competition and weaken rivals.
Reuters reported the European Commission viewed as insufficient concessions offered by Nvidia, the world's biggest maker of graphics and artificial intelligence (AI) chips during its preliminary review..
Nvidia has not disclosed what these are but it has previously said it would maintain ARM as a neutral technology supplier to sooth concerns from customers such as Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc, Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).
""We are working closely with the European Commission through the regulatory process. We look forward to the opportunity to address their initial concerns and continue demonstrating that the transaction will help to accelerate Arm and boost competition and innovation, including in the EU,"" a Nvidia spokesperson said.
The Commission said it would decide by March 15 whether to clear or block the deal.
""Whilst Arm and Nvidia do not directly compete, Arm's IP is an important input in products competing with those of Nvidia, for example in datacentres, automotive and in Internet of Things,"" EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.

""Our analysis shows that the acquisition of Arm by Nvidia could lead to restricted or degraded access to Arm's IP, with distortive effects in many markets where semiconductors are used,"" she continued.
ARM customers Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), MediaTek and Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) are backers of the deal.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - With U.S. restaurants nationwide struggling to find enough waiters and cashiers to serve customers,  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) on Wednesday said it will give pay raises to workers in the United States with at least two years of employment and offer $200 referral bonuses.
Workers with at least two years of employment could get up to a 5% raise and those with at least five years could receive a 10% pay boost in late January, Starbucks said.
Average pay for all U.S. workers will range between $15 and $23 an hour, averaging nearly $17 an hour, by summer of 2022, the Seattle-based company said. 
Many chains are lifting wages to try to attract more workers. 
Restaurants are struggling to recruit and retain enough labor to keep stores open at full capacity amid a widespread staffing shortage. 
McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) reported on Wednesday that some of its locations have had to close early or seen their service times slow down because of labor shortages.
In December, Starbucks raised pay by 10% or more for existing staff and said it would boost starting pay to at least $15 an hour over the next couple years.

The changes over the last two years will total $1 billion worth of investments in wages and benefits, it said.
Shares of the global coffee chain, which reports quarterly earnings on Thursday, are up about 7 percent since the start of the year.

707,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2021 04:33PM ET</span>","U.S. consumer watchdog to review Big Tech data, promote lending competition","By Katanga Johnson and Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Chief consumer finance watchdog Rohit Chopra told U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday his agency will review Big Tech's impact on the flow of money in the economy as leading technology firms use real-time consumer payments systems that collect huge amounts of personal data.
Chopra, head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), said Big Tech's entrance into the payment sector raises questions, including: ""How will these firms harvest and monetize data they collect on our transactions? What criteria will they use to decide who is removed from the platform? How will they ensure that payment systems adhere to consumer protections?""
The agency will also aim to minimize foreclosures on struggling American homeowners and make consumer lending more competitive, he said.
And, it will sharpen its enforcement focus on companies that repeatedly violate consumer finance laws.
Chopra, a longtime consumer advocate tapped by Democratic President Joe Biden, outlined an ambitious agenda during his first of two congressional hearings this week as CFPB director. Wednesday's hearing before members of the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee will be followed by a Thursday sitting to testify before the Senate Banking panel.
""Many families continue to struggle to afford their mortgage and rent payments. Many small businesses are facing severe challenges to make ends meet,"" Chopra told the panel on Wednesday. 
Chopra's hearing will likely reinvigorate the CFPB's status as a political lightning rod. Republicans have sought to handcuff the agency since its creation, calling it overpowerful and unaccountable.
Sworn in as the CFPB's full-time director earlier this month, Chopra built his name as a fierce defender of middle-class Americans at the Federal Trade Commission, and previously helped Senator Elizabeth Warren set up the CFPB after it was created in 2010.
""This hearing should serve as a reminder of both the bureau’s broad authority and Director Chopra’s capacity to effectively use the bureau’s toolbox,"" said Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research for financial firm BTIG.
Just a few weeks into the job, Chopra made his mark when the CFPB ordered https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-consumer-watchdog-orders-tech-giants-turn-over-information-payment-systems-2021-10-21 Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) to hand over information about how they gather and use consumer payment data.
""There are many places where regulators should be promoting competition and innovation in ways that are good for small businesses and families -- and not in a way that allows dominant firms to control more and more about our lives through our data,"" Chopra said.
That push for clarity is part of a growing interest among regulators and lawmakers about the rapid adoption of technology in various financial products, ranging from cryptocurrency to new ""buy now, pay later"" lending products.
While Republican members of the panel applauded Chopra's decision to look into practices that might impede lending competition, they added that they were against a ""heavy handed"" approach to enforcement.
'OPEN BANKING'
Democrats' top policy priorities include boosting competition in the consumer finance sector by requiring financial companies to give consumers more control over their financial data -- a concept known as ""open banking https://www.reuters.com/business/exclusive-white-house-target-bank-mergers-financial-data-with-competition-order-2021-07-09.""
Analysts have said they expected the CFPB to move ahead with an open-banking rule first proposed by the agency under the former Trump administration in coming months.
Chopra said on Wednesday that he is studying such regulations in other countries and is eager to review the comments the CFPB has received on the proposal. 
""At the same time, we're going to need to make sure we're protecting privacy, security and other things that are critical,"" he added.

The agency head said that while he wants to ensure payments platforms operate ""fairly, transparently and competitively,"" he does not intend to ban or limit the use of cryptocurrency or blockchain technology that also lean on payment systems.
Chopra's expansive agenda at the CFPB will also include revisiting https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/how-bidens-agencies-are-picking-apart-trumps-wall-street-friendly-measures-2021-04-12 several major rule easings ushered through under Republican leadership, particularly around debt collection and payday lending.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 slipped Wednesday, as a decline in cyclical sectors including financial and energy offset and an intraday rally in tech ran out of steam. 
The S&P 500 fell 0.5% to end the day below its closing record of 4,574.79. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.74%, or 265 points, while the Nasdaq was up 0.12%.
Energy fell more than 1% as oil prices were pressured by expectations for a jump in global crude supplies from Iran as Tehran and European Union agreed to resume talks on to revive the 2015 nuclear deal before month-end.
Oil prices were also pushed lower by data showing a larger than expected build in the U.S. weekly crude stockpiles.
Crude inventories rose by 4.3 million barrels for the week ended Oct. 24, well above analysts' expectations for a build of 1.9 million barrels.
Still, there are some who suggest that energy, which up about 16% year to date, likely has further room to run.
“I'm bullish on energy as underinvestment in energy projects should continue to support the supply and demand imbalance, substantially pushing crude prices higher,” Aptus Capital Advisors portfolio manager David Wagner told Investing.com in a recent interview.
“When you couple that with energy firms’ plans of returning capital shareholders, I just don’t see energy as being an underperformer,” Wagner added.
Financials were dragged lower by falling bank stocks as Treasury yields slipped, with the 10-year yield dropping below 1.6%, and the 30-year yield dipping below 3%. 
As well as weaker bank stocks, a 7% slump in  Capital One  Financial (NYSE:COF) also weighed on the sector after the company's better-than-expected results were offset by concerns about rising expenses amid a ramp-up in marketing costs.
Wall Street analysts, however, remained constructive on Capital One, forecasting the ramp-up in marketing to lead to further growth.
""We view [higher marketing expenses] as positive driver future growth and a sign that management is becoming more confident in the outlook, though it is a near-term expense headwind,"" RBC said in a note.
Technology sold off late into the close, shrugging off a falling Treasury yields and a climb in Microsoft and Alphabet.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s third-quarter earnings beat was driven by strong performance in its digital advertising search business, which was less vulnerable to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s privacy changes. Its share price closed up about 5% higher.
""Search [was] the clear beneficiary from Apple's ATT [App Tracking Transparency], and the least exposed to mobile tracking and measurement issues,"" Wedbush said in a note.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) delivered fourth-quarter guidance that topped expectations as its cloud business Azure continued to impress, growing more than 50% in the third quarter. Its shares gained nearly 5%.
Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) plunged more than 10% after reporting third-quarter earnings that fell short of Wall Street estimates.
Boeing (NYSE:BA), meanwhile, fell more than 1% after third-quarter results fell short estimates as the rebound in 737 Max demand was offset by production delays of its 787 Dreamliner jets as the aircraft manufacturing continues to address manufacturing flaws.

With the continuing spread of the virus, and an aging population, the demand for healthcare services is expected to remain robust. Therefore, we think healthcare stocks Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Abbott (ABT), Anthem (ANTM), and Biogen (BIIB), which have each recently reported better-than-expected earnings results, could be ideal bets now. Read on.The benchmark stock indices have of late registered solid gains on the back of solid third-quarter corporate earnings. The Dow Jones rose for the third straight day to claim another record on October 26. The S&P 500 also rose to fresh highs that day. According to CNBC, 80% of S&P 500 companies that have reported earnings so far have beaten Wall Street expectations.
The healthcare industry has been in the limelight since the onset of the pandemic. Pharmaceutical and biotech companies that have developed COVID-19 therapies and vaccines have generated billions of dollars in revenues so far. In addition, digital healthcare is gaining traction, with telehealth companies reporting a more than doubling of visits for 2020. The robust usage and popularity of digital healthcare are expected to drive more investments in this space. According to FactSet, companies with higher international revenue exposure are expected to deliver higher earnings growth. For companies generating more than 50% of sales outside the U.S., their blended earnings growth rate is 44.3%, versus a 26.3% earnings growth rate by companies with more than 50% of sales inside the United States.
Johnson & Johnson (JNJ),  Abbott Laboratories  (NYSE:ABT), Anthem, Inc. (ANTM), and Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB), each with a significant global presence, have reported better than expected earnings results. So, considering their fundamental strength, we think these stocks could be solid additions to cash in on the industry’s growth.

Investing.com -- Stocks wavered on Wednesday as falling U.S. bond yields lifted technology stocks but the broad S&P 500 lost steam heading into the closing bell. 
Better-than-expected earnings from Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)and Google’s Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) set a positive tone. On Thursday, Apple and Amazon are due to report their numbers. 
Alphabet’s third-quarter earnings beat was driven by strong performance in its digital advertising search business, which was less vulnerable to privacy changes Apple made recently that dinged Snap (NYSE:SNAP).
Microsoft raised its fourth quarter guidance after topping expectations in its cloud business.  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR), however, fell short of expectations and its stock tumbled.
The energy sector was under pressure with oil prices cooling off their recent highs. Oil major Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) PLC ADR (NYSE:RDSa) rose after reports that hedge fund activist Dan Loeb’s Third Point (NYSE:SPNT) had amassed a sizable stake in the shares and was pressing the company to break apart into a legacy carbon-based business and a growth-oriented renewable energy company.
A reading of gross domestic product for the third quarter will come out tomorrow. Here are three things that could affect markets:
1. Apple earnings
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) will report its fourth-quarter numbers Thursday. Revenue at the iPhone-maker is seen touching $84.85 with profit per share likely to be $1.23, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com.
2, Amazon earnings
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s third profit per share is seen at $8.91 on likely revenue of $111.62 billion. Analysts will be eager to hear the company’s outlook for the holiday season.

722,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2021 03:16PM ET</span>","Breakthrough infections can lead to long COVID; genes may explain critical illness in young, healthy adults","By Nancy Lapid
(Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that have yet to be certified by peer review.
Breakthrough infections can lead to long COVID
The persistent syndrome of COVID-19 after-effects known as long COVID can develop after ""breakthrough"" infections in vaccinated people, a new study shows. Researchers at Oxford University in the UK reviewed data on nearly 20,000 U.S. COVID-19 patients, half of whom had been vaccinated. Compared to unvaccinated patients, people who were fully vaccinated - and in particular those under age 60 - did have lower risks for death and serious complications such as lung failure, need for mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, life-threatening blood clots, seizures, and psychosis. ""On the other hand,"" the research team reported on medRxiv on Tuesday https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.26.21265508v1 ahead of peer review, ""previous vaccination does not appear to protect against several previously documented outcomes of COVID-19 such as long COVID features, arrhythmia, joint pain, Type 2 diabetes, liver disease, sleep disorders, and mood and anxiety disorders."" The absence of protection from long COVID ""is concerning given the high incidence and burden"" of these lasting problems, they added.
Genes may explain critical COVID-19 in young, healthy adults
A gene that helps the coronavirus reproduce itself might contribute to life-threatening COVID-19 in young, otherwise healthy people, new findings suggest. French researchers studied 72 hospitalized COVID-19 patients under age 50, including 47 who were critically ill and 25 with non-critical illness, plus 22 healthy volunteers. None of the patients had any of the chronic conditions known to increase the risk for poor outcomes, such as heart disease or diabetes. Genetic analysis identified five genes that were significantly ""upregulated,"" or more active, in the patients with critical illness, of which the most frequent was a gene called ADAM9. As reported on Tuesday in Science Translational Medicine https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.abj7521, the researchers saw the same genetic pattern in a separate group of 154 COVID-19 patients, including 81 who were critically ill. Later, in lab experiments using human lung cells infected with the coronavirus, they found that blocking the activity of the ADAM9 gene made it harder for the virus to make copies of itself. More research is needed, they say, to confirm their findings and to determine whether it would be worthwhile to develop treatments to block ADAM9. 
Pregnant women get sub-par benefit from first vaccine dose 
Women who get the first dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine while pregnant or breastfeeding need the second dose to bring their protective benefit up to normal, according to a new study. Researchers compared immune responses to the mRNA vaccines from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc or  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) in 84 pregnant women, 31 breastfeeding women, and 16 similarly-aged nonpregnant, non-lactating women. After the first shot, everyone developed antibodies against the coronavirus. But antibody levels were lower in women who were pregnant or breastfeeding. Other features of the immune response also lagged in the pregnant and lactating women after the first dose but ""caught up"" to normal after the second shot. In a report published last week in Science Translational Medicine https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.abi8631, the researchers explained that in order for a mother's body to nurture the fetus, ""substantial immunological changes occur throughout pregnancy."" The new findings suggest that pregnancy alters the immune system's response to the vaccine. Given that pregnant women are highly vulnerable to complications from COVID-19, ""there is a critical need"" for them to get the second dose on schedule, the researchers said. 
Coronavirus found to infect fat cells
Obesity is a known risk factor for more severe COVID-19. One likely reason may be that the virus can infect fat cells, researchers have discovered. In lab experiments and in autopsies of patients who died of COVID-19, they found the virus infects two types of cells found in fat tissue: mature fat cells, called adipocytes, and immune cells called macrophages. ""Infection of fat cells led to a marked inflammatory response, consistent with the type of immune response that is seen in severe cases of COVID-19,"" said Dr. Catherine Blish of Stanford University School of Medicine, whose team reported the findings on bioRxiv on Monday https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.24.465626v1 ahead of peer review. ""These data suggest that infection of fat tissue and its associated inflammatory response may be one of the reasons why obese individuals do so poorly when infected with SARS-CoV-2,"" she said.

Investing.com — Following an order for 100,000 Tesla's,  Hertz Global  Holdings Inc (OTC:HTZZ) has secured an exclusive arrangement to sell electric vehicles to Uber (NYSE:UBER) drivers and has enlisted the help of  Carvana  Co (NYSE:CVNA) to sell its older rental cars
The two deals represent a significant shift in the pace for the adoption of electric vehicles and help to boost a business that seemingly was, at one stage, on its last legs. However, it is now under the control of hedge funds and private-equity owners and looking to transform the vehicle rental market.
Starting on Nov. 1, the deal with Uber will give drivers the ability to rent Tesla's through Hertz's rental program in Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, and Washington, D.C., with a nationwide expansion in the following weeks.
""We believe this will be a win-win for drivers who rent: a chance to both increase earnings and reduce environmental impact,"" Uber stated in its announcement. 
In regards to Carvana, the two companies are partnering nationally – following a pilot – to allow Hertz to use Carvana's online transaction technology and logistics network to sell its unwanted rental vehicles.
With the company purchasing 100,000 Tesla's, it is looking to transform its fleet and look more toward the electric vehicle market. The order on Monday for $4.2 billion helped boost Tesla's valuation to over $1 trillion.
""This is another step toward the new Hertz – combining our brand strength and global fleet expertise with new technology and innovations to chart a dynamic, new course for the future of travel, mobility and the auto industry,"" said Mark Fields, Hertz interim CEO.

Therefore, we think it could be wise to bet on quality trucking stocks Ryder System (NYSE:R), ArcBest Corporation (NASDAQ:ARCB), and Daseke (NASDAQ:DSKE). Read on for a closer look at these names.The skyrocketing demand for raw materials, auto parts, and other goods has intensified the supply chain crisis, leading to a surge in demand for trucking transportation. With the economy opening up, the demand for truck-based transit is expected to continue rising. According to American Trucking Associations, a record 80,000 additional truck drivers are now needed to meet the nation’s freight demand. The situation has drawn investors’ attention to this space, as is in-part evidenced by the iShares Transportation Average ETF’s (IYT) 7.3% gains over the past month versus the SPDR S&P 500 ETF’s (SPY) 2.9% returns.
Furthermore, despite being hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, the global transportation industry is expected to grow at a 3.4% rate through 2027. Also, contract truckload volumes increased 3% year-over-year this month, while spot market volumes were approximately 120% higher.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 edged higher Wednesday, as a jump in tech on falling U.S. bond yields and better-than-expected earnings from Microsoft and Google's Alphabet offset weakness in energy.
The S&P 500 rose 0.04%, though remained below its all-time high of 4,598.36. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 30%, or 106 points, while the Nasdaq was up 0.8%.
Technology was lifted by the fall in Treasury yields, with the 10-year yield dropping below 1.6%, while a climb in Microsoft and Alphabet also supported the sector.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s third-quarter earnings beat was driven by strong performance in its digital advertising search business, which was less vulnerable to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s privacy changes. Its share price was up 6%.
""Search [was] the clear beneficiary from Apple's ATT [App Tracking Transparency], and the least exposed to mobile tracking and measurement issues,"" Wedbush said in a note.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) delivered fourth-quarter guidance that topped expectations as its cloud business Azure continued to impress, growing more than 50% in the third quarter. Its shares were up about 4%.
Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) plunged 10% after reporting third-quarter earnings that fell short of Wall Street estimates.
The upside in the tech offset weakness in cyclicals as energy and financials stumbled.
Energy fell more than 1% as oil prices were pressured by expectations for a jump in global crude supplies from Iran as Tehran and European Union agreed to resume talks on to revive the 2015 nuclear deal before month-end.
Oil prices were also pushed lower by data showing a larger than expected build in the U.S. weekly crude stockpiles.
Crude inventories rose by 4.3 million barrels for the week ended Oct. 24, well above analysts' expectations for a build of 1.9 million barrels.
Energy, which up about 16% year to date, likely has further room to run.
“I'm bullish on energy as underinvestment in energy projects should continue to support the supply and demand imbalance, substantially pushing crude prices higher,” Aptus Capital Advisors portfolio manager David Wagner told Investing.com in a recent interview.
“When you couple that with energy firms’ plans of returning capital shareholders, I just don’t see energy as being an underperformer,” Wagner added.
Financials were dragged lower by a 7% slump in  Capital One  Financial (NYSE:COF) as the payment company's better-than-expected results were offset by concern over rising expenses amid a ramp-up in marketing spend.
Still, Wall Street analysts remained constructive on the Capital One, forecasting the ramp-up in marketing to lead to further growth.
""We view [higher marketing expenses] as positive driver future growth and a sign that management is becoming more confident in the outlook, though it is a near-term expense headwind,"" RBC said in a note.
Falling banking stocks also weighed on financials as Treasury yields slipped as yield curve continued to flatten.
Boeing (NYSE:BA), meanwhile, fell 1% after third-quarter results fell short estimates as the rebound in 737 Max demand was offset by production delays of its 787 Dreamliner jets as the aircraft manufacturing continues to address manufacturing flaws.
On the economic front, durable goods orders for September were better than expected amid smaller than expected decline in aircraft and autos orders.
""Headline durable goods orders were depressed by declines in the civilian aircraft and autos components, but both were smaller than we expected. Behind the headline noise, the 0.8% jump in core capital goods orders - the biggest since June - is very encouraging,"" Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a note."

730,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2021 02:41PM ET</span>",Gas price surge pushes Europe's ceramics industry to breaking point,"By Stephen Jewkes, Isla Binnie and Elvira Pollina
MILAN (Reuters) - Continental Europe's $35 billion ceramics industry thought the worst was over when sales jumped more than 10% in the first half of the year and order books began to fill up after the damage inflicted by the pandemic. But surging gas prices have caught out companies in an energy-intensive business, leaving them to choose between passing on higher costs to customers and scaling back or halting production. And all at a time when many feel energy transition costs are already hurting them.
Iris Ceramica Group, based in the central region of Emilia-Romagna and one of Italy's leading manufacturers in the sector, has had to introduce an energy surcharge of 3% on invoices to help cushion the blow.
Reception has been mixed. 
""Some clients realise we've done our best to limit price rises but others, especially the big bulk buyers, are interpreting contracts to the letter and asking for a pre-warning period,"" says CEO Federica Minozzi. It was Minozzi's father Romano who first persuaded gas transport group Snam to bring its grid to the area in the 1980s, effectively launching Italy's 'Tile Valley' district. Now his daughter is planning to build the industry's first green hydrogen ceramics factory driven by a rooftop solar plant. The project, started before gas prices exploded, is easier to justify in the face of higher gas prices. ""In effect given recent developments production could become competitive from an economic point of view faster than we thought,"" Minozzi said.
Europe's ceramics industry guzzles gas to fire up furnaces and keep 200,000 direct workers in a job. Energy bills nL8N2QM1BY typically account for up to 20% of overheads. With no short-term solution in sight the final quarter of the year could turn into a blood bath, warns Giovanni Savorani, the head of Italy's Confindustria Ceramica federation.
""It's a total disaster. There are companies that risk shutting down production and sending workers home because they can’t balance their books,"" Savorani told Reuters.
Italy, which with Spain dominates Europe’s ceramics trade, has invested more than 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion) in six years in new materials and technologies to help it compete with cheaper production from China, India and Turkey. After the headwinds of COVID-19, demand in the tiles business has returned with revenues in Italy in the first six months up 12.3% on the same period in 2019. But the rise in order books cannot keep pace with the impact of energy costs.
""I’m thinking of stopping things in January because I can’t produce at these prices and make a profit,” said Savorani, who owns his own company.
CHEAPER RIVALS
Natural gas prices nL1N2QZ01Y have soared 300% this year to record highs in Europe and parts of Asia as economies recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic and energy consumption increased faster than supplies. 
The increases have prompted energy-intensive industries like ceramics to review production to cope in a trend that is disrupting supply chains and risks fuelling inflation. Jose Luis Lanuza, Chief Executive of Spain’s Keraben Group, used to look at gas prices once or twice a year, to help decide on structuring contracts for his wall and floor tile business. ""Now I look at gas every day, hoping it goes down,"" he said. ""We have no alternative source of energy. We have to buy gas.""
In September Keraben, owned by Victoria Plc, spent seven million euros to fire up its 140-metre-long ovens compared to a monthly average last year of two million euros.
He is now looking into partial stoppages in December, potentially cutting production temporarily by around 50% and bringing forward next year’s holiday for employees. ""This could end with production going elsewhere, outside Europe,"" Lanuza said, mentioning Turkey, Poland, Vietnam and Mexico as potential alternatives. 
""We are already looking at investing outside of Europe. It pains me but it's what I have to do.""

Geert-Jan Starting, who runs a 165-year-old brick factory in the Netherlands, compares the crisis to World War One, when a disruption of supplies of coal from Britain to the Netherlands led to a wave of bankruptcies. The business survived two world wars and transitions from peat to coal and then to natural gas in the 1960s. But he’s now having to tell clients he can no longer offer them price guarantees amid market volatility. ""I hadn't seen this coming a few months ago, price surges of threefold or fourfold, and if you ask me what lies ahead, I have no idea.""

(Reuters) - With costumed trick-or-treaters raring to go door to door this year after a pandemic-ridden 2020, candy maker  Hershey Co  (NYSE:HSY) is expected to bump up its annual sales forecast even as supply chain bottlenecks plague the industry.
Hershey has about 70% of its manufacturing capacity in the United States, and that is expected to help it deliver its Kisses and Reese's in time for what is expected to be the biggest Halloween in terms of spending.
The period around the October holiday is Hershey's busiest time of the year, making up about 10% of the company's annual sales. 
Graphic - Halloween spending forecasts over the years: https://graphics.reuters.com/HERSHEY-RESULTS/byprjramape/chart.png 
Consumer spending on Halloween-related items is expected to reach an all-time high of $10.14 billion this year, according to a National Retail Federation (NRF) survey, compared with $8.05 billion spent in 2020.
""There's going to be a lot of pent-up demand this Halloween, because many people couldn't celebrate last year. Coupled with that, in general the consumer is in a very healthy position and vaccination rates have been growing,"" CFRA analyst Arun Sundaram said.
THE CONTEXT
Growing global supply chain issues and worker shortages triggered by the pandemic have hurt packaged food makers. The companies are also taking a hit to their margins due to soaring prices of commodities such as sugar, cocoa beans, wheat and edible oils.
""Hershey would have an easier time navigating the (supply chain) crisis given that the company has less complexities in its supply chain compared to other packaged food companies who have a more global presence,"" Sundaram added.
NRF data suggests more U.S. consumers are ready to celebrate Halloween this year after a year of limited trick-or-treating.
THE FUNDAMENTALS
** Analysts forecast annual revenue of $8.82 billion for Hershey, which will report quarterly results before markets open on Thursday
** Full-year adjusted profit is estimated to be $6.91 per share

732,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 27, 2021 02:36PM ET</span>","U.S. Holiday-Spending Plans Tempered by Inflation, Survey Shows","(Bloomberg) -- Consumers’ holiday spending intentions are slightly lower than in 2020, partly reflecting higher prices and supply chain challenges, the Conference Board said Wednesday.
On average, consumers intend to spend $648 on gifts this holiday season, according to the group’s survey. While down from $673 last year, budgets are still historically high.
Spending on non-gift holiday items such as food, decorations, and wrapping paper is expected to reach $374, which may explain the decline in gift spending as consumers shift toward more social activities. About 60% of people expect to pay more for gifts and food this year. 
“These spending intentions may be thwarted by severe supply-chain challenges and transportation issues,” said Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at The Conference Board. “If these problems persist, Americans may face bare shelves that send more shoppers back online, and could also mean delays in receiving products purchased in time for the holidays.”
The Board’s survey found that gift cards are expected to have the biggest spending increase this year. That likely reflects gift-givers trying to avoid supply chain snarls ahead of Christmas.

733,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2021 02:23PM ET</span>",U.S. companies to keep prices high as supply chain headaches persist,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The largest U.S. manufacturers including General Motors (NYSE:GM),  General Electric  (NYSE:GE), 3M and Boeing (NYSE:BA) face logistics headaches and higher costs due to global supply bottlenecks that are likely to persist into next year but agreed the hit to profits can be mitigated by charging higher prices for their goods. 
Companies across the globe sounded the alarm on supply issues months ago that have pushed prices higher on raw materials from chemicals to steel.
In earnings reports this week investors got a closer look at how companies are managing. 
""It starts with really strong price,"" said GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra in a call with reporters. ""We were able to do very well (with) full-size trucks and full-size SUVs. We just can't build enough of those vehicles."" 
GM is also looking to wring efficiencies from its supply chain and she said the chip shortage is likely to improve in the second half of 2022.
Larry Culp, the chief executive of General Electric Co, a maker of jet engines and wind turbines, told investors keeping up with fits and starts in the global supply chain was akin to playing a carnival game that aims to keep players on their toes. 
""I'm not sure we're yet at a place where we would say that things are stable,"" Culp told investors on an earnings call on Tuesday. ""It really is akin to playing a whack-a-mole.""
General Electric also expects supply constraints to persist through the rest of the year and in 2022, hurting profit in its healthcare business.  Boeing Co  also complained of a ""severely weakened supply chain.""
The pandemic has crippled many companies' ability to send and receive the parts and supplies needed to make a wide range of products, creating shortages, reducing inventories and hammering profits. 
On Wednesday, Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) said it increased surcharge pricing in the United States to offset higher raw material costs. The motorcycle maker expects these costs to remain high and is exploring higher surcharge costs globally.
Harley-Davidson said the inventory shortage is also squeezing its international market share.
McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) also said it had to raise prices in the United States.
Industrial giant 3M Co cut its full-year earnings outlook on Tuesday and said it would increase product prices to combat inflationary and supply chain pressures.
The company, which makes a long list of building and construction products, said it was facing higher costs related to polypropylene, ethylene, resins and labor. It added that the global semiconductor crunch would continue to weigh on its automotive and electronics end-markets.

On Tuesday,  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) dramatically lowered its sales expectations for this year, saying the pandemic has hobbled the top U.S. defense contractor's supply chain. Its shares fell more than 11% on Tuesday.
Lockheed's chief financial officer said the problem worsened for them over the last two months, as the maker of the F-35 fighter jet lowered its 2021 revenue expectations by 2.5% to $67 billion and said next year's revenue could fall to $66 billion.

Senators Richard Blumenthal and Ed Markey, both Democrats, called for the passage of an update of the 1998 Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which would, among other things, raise the age of children whose data cannot be collected without consent from 12 to 15.
They also urged the passage of legislation that would ban auto-play settings and push alerts designed to pull users onto an app and then keep them there.
""Whether your name is Facebook, YouTube, TikTok or Snapchat, these platforms all seem to operate on the same computer code of misconduct, endangering kids and teens,"" said Markey. ""Big Tech has lost trust.""
Blumenthal called for the measures to be passed within months. 
The lawmakers have expressed concern about children and teenagers being shown content that they say sometimes encourages dangerous behavior, eating disorders or other kinds of self-harm. 
Markey was the House author of the 1998 Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).
Facebook and TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Google's YouTube declined comment.

A  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) spokesperson said the company ""built critical safety protections directly into Snapchat's architecture and products, and are constantly working to strengthen our efforts."" The company, the person said, supports ""thoughtful regulation.""
In a hearing Tuesday, executives for TikTok, Snapchat and YouTube said that they sought to create fun, safe online experiences for kids and to exclude dangerous or unsavory content.

737,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2021 01:56PM ET</span>","Exclusive-Moderna COVID-19 shot could start being used in children, teens 'within weeks,' CEO says","By Carl O'Donnell
(Reuters) -  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc's COVID-19 vaccine could start to be used in children and teens in the United States within weeks, its chief executive said in an interview ahead of the Reuters Total Health conference, which will run virtually from Nov. 15-18.
Moderna CEO Staphane Bancel said based on dialogue with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, he believes his company's COVID-19 vaccine will be authorized for 12- to 17-year-olds in the next few weeks. 
Moderna plans to apply for separate U.S. regulatory clearance in children ages 6 through 11 ""very soon,"" Bancel said, adding that he is hopeful that age group could start receiving Moderna's shots by the end of this year. 
""It's entirely possible that this side of Christmas, 6 to 11 years of age would have access to Moderna's vaccine,"" Bancel told Reuters. [See link to all Reuters Total Health interviews here: https://reutersevents.com/events/healthcare/]
Moderna expects to publish data from its vaccine study of children as young as 6 months to 6 years by the end of this year or early in 2022, Bancel said. 
Moderna applied for U.S. authorization of its shot for those aged 12 to 17 in June. It published positive data https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/moderna-says-its-covid-19-vaccine-generates-immune-response-young-children-2021-10-25 from a clinical trial in children ages 6 to 11 this week, but has not yet submitted an application to regulators for that age group. 
While children becoming seriously ill or dying from COVID-19 is relatively rare compared with adults, some develop complications, and infections in unvaccinated kids have risen due to the easily transmitted Delta variant of the coronavirus.
On Tuesday, a panel of advisers to the FDA backed the use of  Pfizer 's shot https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-fda-advisers-weigh-pfizerbiontech-covid-19-vaccine-children-2021-10-26 in children ages 5 to 11. That still needs authorization from the FDA and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
ANNUAL BOOSTER SHOTS?
The Delta variant has contributed to a global spike in coronavirus cases in recent months, and several countries have begun administering vaccine booster shots to some people to help combat the surge.
U.S. regulators last week authorized a half strength booster shot of Moderna's vaccine for people aged 65 and older and those who are at risk of severe disease due to health problems or high risk of virus exposure through their jobs.
Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE) and partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) received authorization for boosters for the same groups in September.
Bancel said he expects people over age 50 will need annual COVID-19 booster shots starting in 2023 because protection against the virus wanes over time. Some experts say it is unclear if boosters are broadly needed.
""I could see a world where from 2023 everyone ages 50 and above is boosting every year,"" Bancel said. ""It's a population that drives hospitalizations and way too many deaths.""
Bancel also said Moderna was engaged in a 'good ongoing dialogue' about long-term licensing of its COVID-19 vaccine to a South African vaccine manufacturing hub backed by the World Health Organization (WHO). 
The WHO is working to get more COVID-19 vaccine to Africa to help improve developing countries' access after rich nations bought up most of this year's supply, leaving many nations with very low vaccination rates. 

A WHO official in September told Reuters that a lack of progress in talks with Moderna meant the project will take time.
""We have been very clear that we will not be litigating (patent rights) during the pandemic,"" Bancel said. ""The question is do they want a license for long term and, as you know, discussing licensing has a lot of implications.""

738,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2021 01:28PM ET</span>","Universal Music Group’s core earnings up 21%, boosted by streaming","By Toby Sterling
AMSTERDAM (Reuters) -Universal Music Group NV (UMG (AS:UMG)), the record label behind many of the music industry's biggest stars, on Wednesday reported a 21% rise in third quarter core earnings it attributed to growing revenue from streaming and social media platforms.
UMG's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) came in at 461 million euros ($535 million) compared with 382 million euros in the same period a year ago.
""I firmly believe the music industry is only at the beginning of a new wave of growth and evolution,"" said CEO Lucian Grainge in a presentation.
It is the first time the label behind stars such as Lady Gaga, Billie Eilish and Taylor Swift has published earnings as an independent public company after it was spun off from former parent Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) in September in Europe's largest listing of the year.
Grainge said the results showed the strength and diversity of Universal's artist catalogue, noting important deals struck in recent months with South Korean pop band BTS, Indian rapper Badshah and German singer Helene Fischer, as well as innovative deals with U.S. rock band Aerosmith and Sweden's ABBA.
UMG is also betting that a boom in music streaming led by Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), that has fuelled royalty revenue and profit growth for several years, still has a long way to run in a music industry it dominates along with Warner and  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Music. 
Universal's quarterly revenue rose 16% to 2.15 billion euros, it said, citing growth in recordings, publishing and merchandising.
It has forecast full year 2021 revenue to grow by more than 10% and adjusted EBITDA by more than 20%.
Universal's shares surged on their first day of trading last month, at one point rising more than 30% from the listing reference price of 18.50 euros. They have since traded sideways, closing on Wednesday at 25.135 euros.
Spotify earlier on Wednesday reported better than expected third quarter subscriber growth.
CFO Boyd Muir told analysts Spotify's results were ""very encouraging"" but cautioned against assuming that UMG's results would ""align with that of any one company"".

He said when it reports full-year earnings, UMG will detail the share of revenue it receives from both subscriptions and from advertisements on platforms such as Spotify, TikTok, YouTube, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Music, Instagram and others.

739,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2021 01:16PM ET</span>",Intel teams with Google Cloud to develop new class of data center chip,"By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) -  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google Cloud on Wednesday said they have worked together to create a new category of chip that Intel hopes will become a major seller in the booming cloud computing market.
The new chip, which is called Mount Evans and will be sold to others beyond Google, reflects the way that cloud computing providers operate. They build huge data centers full of powerful physical computers and sell virtual slices of those machines to other businesses, who in turn get better bang for the buck than building the machines themselves.
For cloud providers, tasks like setting up the virtual machines and getting customer data to the right place are essentially overhead costs. The Mount Evans chip, which Google and Intel have dubbed an ""infrastructure processing unit"" (IPU), separates those tasks out from the main computing tasks and speeds them up. Doing so also helps ensure the safety of those functions against hackers and adds flexibility to the data center.
""We see this as strategically vital. It's an extremely important area for us and for the data center,"" Nick McKeown, senior vice president of the network and edge group at Intel, told Reuters.
Intel is not the only player making infrastructure chips. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp and Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) Technology Inc have similar but slightly different offerings.
But Intel and Google are working together on a set of software tools that will be released for free in hopes of making Intel's version of the chip a broader industry standard used beyond Google's data centers.
Amin Vahdat, a Google fellow and vice president of engineering, said Google is hoping to spur a technology trend that makes it easier for all data center operators to be more flexible about how they slice up their physical computer servers into virtual ones to suit whatever computing task is at hand.

""The basic question of what is a server is going to go beyond what's inside the sheet metal. The IPU is going to play a central role there,"" Vahdat told Reuters. 
(This story has been refiled to reflect that Amin Vahdat is also vice president of engineering at Google, paragraph 7)

(Reuters) -Higher U.S. prices and celebrity-themed meals boosted quarterly comparable sales at McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD), though the company struggled to keep restaurants open at full capacity amid labor shortages and COVID-19 outbreaks, it reported on Wednesday.
U.S. same-store sales grew 9.6% in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with estimates for 8.27%, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Global comparable sales also jumped 12.7% in the quarter versus estimates of 10.31% as international markets slowly recovered from the pandemic.
Shares in the world's largest burger chain rose about 2.2% to $241.70 in late morning trading. 
The U.S. labor shortage caused some locations to close early and lose speed of service, Chief Executive Chris Kempczinski said in an earnings call, adding problems were not ""unsolvable.""
McDonald's has had to push back some new restaurant openings into early 2022 in part because global supply-chain problems made it difficult to get kitchen and tech equipment. That caused new unit development in the United States and some international markets to be ""down a little bit"" from how many the company had expected to open this year, Kempczinski said.
Seating areas remained closed in about 20% of McDonald's American locations - roughly 3,000 restaurants - in regions with high rates of COVID-19.
Even so, some pandemic-related restrictions have eased, luring more customers into restaurants. McDonald's crispy chicken sandwich and latest celebrity partnership with rapper Saweetie also boosted sales.
The Chicago-based company has also raised U.S. prices about 6% versus 2020 to help cover rising commodity and labor costs. Higher prices, combined with larger order sizes, drove sales.
Most restaurant chains, including  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (NYSE:CMG), are charging more on menus to protect their margins against higher costs for everything from payroll to beef and chicken.
McDonald's forecast current-quarter U.S. comparable sales to post low double-digit growth on a two-year basis.
The fast-food chain, which has been seeking to grow sales digitally, launched a new loyalty program in the United States that now has over 21 million members enrolled, while also doubling down on advertising. 
Most of the company's international markets also returned to sales growth, especially the UK, Canada and Japan, as coronavirus-related restrictions eased, while Australia and China sales continued to be pressured by the resurgence of COVID-19 cases.

Kempczinski said  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) Corp will acquire McD Tech Labs, which was created after McDonald’s 2019 acquisition of Apprente, an artificial intelligence company working on automating drive-thru orders.
Net income rose 22% to $2.15 billion and the company earned $2.76 per share on an adjusted basis, beating estimates of $2.46 per share.

Animal and plant-based steaks with varieties of dishes make it one of the most versatile dishes, suitable for a small dinner or a large party.
While good-quality customized steaks are now available online thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic-driven adoption of online platforms by several restaurants and steakhouses, the pent-up demand to dine on steaks at eateries is helping steakhouses and restaurants generate high foot traffic.
Therefore we think restaurants that specialize in serving steaks, such as Darden Restaurants, Inc. (DRI), Ruth’s Hospitality Group, Inc. (RUTH), and The ONE Group Hospitality, Inc.

Intel is working to regain its lead in making the fastest computing chips after having lost its title to rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), both of which use outside partners to make their chips while Intel has struggled with its internal manufacturing operations. Santa Clara, California-based Intel made the announcement at an event aimed at persuading software developers to write code for its chips.
Intel showed versions of its 12th generation of Intel Core chips for PCs, known by their code name of Alder Lake. The company said the product line will eventually include 60 different chips destined for 500 models of PCs from various makers, from thin laptops to larger machines designed for gamers.
The company said it is shipping 28 versions of the chip to PC makers, with ""broad availability"" starting on Nov. 4. 

Intel also said that Aurora, a supercomputer that Intel is building with the U.S. Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory (NYSE:LH) for artificial intelligence work in suburban Chicago, will be twice as fast as originally planned.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's pick to head the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Wednesday signaled that climate risk and the rapid adoption of digital currencies would be top priorities if he is confirmed to the role.
Rostin Behnam, a Democratic commissioner at the CFTC since 2017 and its acting chairman, laid out his vision for the agency before the Senate Agriculture Committee, a significant first step in reinvigorating an agency seen as languishing for months without a permanent pick to head it. 
Behnam touted the CFTC'S ongoing work to monitor derivatives, noting that corner of the financial markets ""performed very well"" during the hectic onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020. He also said he would ensure an active enforcement program at the agency if given the top job.
""I will prioritize policy that invigorates a culture of compliance, reinforced by an enforcement program that roots out fraud,"" he said in his opening testimony.
Behnam also said he would support any legislation Congress would consider to give the CFTC greater authority over digital currencies, arguing the rapidly growing market could benefit from clearer oversight.
""Given the size, the scope, and the scale of this emerging market ... I think it's critically important to have a primary cop on the beat,"" he said.
Behnam has made climate issues a core of his work at the CFTC. In March, he set up a climate risk unit dedicated to better understanding and pricing climate-related risks into derivatives markets. He also backed a 2020 report from the CFTC's industry advisors that called climate change a significant risk to the financial system.
On Wednesday, he said monitoring climate risk in financial markets was important. He said climate change does not yet pose a risk to the financial system, but could in the future if severe weather events become worse and more frequent.
However, he added that derivatives could play a ""key role"" in any market-based policies to address the issue.

Behnam's nomination comes at a time when the CFTC is short-staffed.
In October, Democratic Commissioner Daniel Berkovitz stepped down, leaving the agency politically frozen with just two active commissioners - Behnam and Republican Commissioner Dawn Stump.

Investing.com –  Robinhood Markets  stock (NASDAQ:HOOD) plunged 12% to trade below its IPO price of $38 on Wednesday as its August warning of retail activity slowing down came true and the company said this is persisting in the current quarter.
“In the absence of any changes to the market environment or exogenous events, we believe this may result in quarterly revenues no greater than $325 million and full year revenue of less than $1.8 billion. Additionally, we expect new funded accounts for the fourth quarter will be roughly in line with the 660,000 opened in the third quarter of 2021,” the company said in its earnings release.
Total net revenue rose 35%, to $365 million, in the third quarter.
The trading platform was a huge beneficiary of the surge in retail trading during the pandemic as people, ensconced in the comfort of their homes took to selling and buying cryptos and equities like never before. It was a hit with the millennials and the young crowd trying their hand at cryptos. With public spaces and avenues of entertainment increasing in an economy reopening, that frenzy came off in July to September.
The craze for meme stocks which led stocks like GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) to climb by a factor of hundreds also fueled the platform’s growth. Those stocks lead mostly common lives now.
At $164 million, trading in options contributed to more 61% of the $267 million revenue Robinhood earned from transactions on the platform.
Crypto-based trading revenue climbed more than 10 times from a year earlier to $51 million, but was 78% off its second quarter level, Robinhood said. From contributing to more than half of the trading revenue in the second quarter, cryptos shared only 19% of it July through September.
Trading in Dogecoin DOGE/USD - a token started as a joke and a pet of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk - made up 62% of Robinhood's cryptocurrency transaction volume during July-September.
Equities trading revenue fell 27% from a year ago to $50 million.
Net loss of $1.32 billion was largely attributable to stock-based employee compensation in the wake of the IPO, Tenev said.

Earlier, Volkswagen's works council head took aim at Diess, accusing him of not taking an interest in workers' concerns and rekindling a long-standing conflict between the two sides.
Two people familiar with the matter told Reuters that Diess made the commitment to be present at the staff meeting, the first in about two years, to the group's supervisory board at a meeting on Wednesday.
Emotions at Europe's largest carmaker are running high ever since Diess told a supervisory board meeting last month that the company could lose 30,000 jobs if it transitioned too slowly to electric vehicles.
The comments by Daniela Cavallo - who became Volkswagen's works council head this year and replaced Bernd Osterloh, a fierce opponent of Diess - mark a fresh low point in a relationship that has for years been fraught with conflict.
They were made in response to news that Diess, who is aggressively pushing Volkswagen to catch up and overtake electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), would not take part in the meeting scheduled and instead meet with U.S. investors and politicians.
""Herbert Diess is preferring Wall Street investors over the company's workforce - this behaviour is unprecedented in the history of our group and once again shows that even in times of crisis the group chief executive has no empathy or sense for the situation of the workforce,"" Cavallo had said.
""He is simply not taking an interest in the concerns of the workforce.""

A VW spokesperson had earlier said Diess' U.S. trip had been planned for some time and could not be rescheduled at short notice. Diess had invited staff at Volkswagen's Wolfsburg plant to a Q&A session on Oct. 28, the day of third-quarter results, instead.
But this event will be cancelled now that Diess is taking part in the meeting next week.

 Capital One  Financial (NYSE:COF) sold off on Wednesday despite a positive earnings report after the close Tuesday, as sector concerns sparked by Visa’s earnings report and perhaps the opportunity to take profit held sway.
COF’s reported earnings of $6.78/share and revenue of $7.8B, both comfortably beating estimates, with revenue up 6% year over year. The earnings growth was 34%, but came mostly from a net benefit of $342 from credit provisions as a release of loan reserves of $770M offset net charge-offs of $426M, a sign that consumers’ balance sheets remain strong.
Marketing expense grew 165% from the year-ago quarter and 50% from the two years-ago quarter, a sign of the company’s “leaning further in the marketing to drive growth and to build our franchise,” as CEO Richard Fairbank said on the company’s earnings call.
Average loans increased 3% quarter over quarter to $253.1B, while net interest margin increased 46 basis points over the quarter to 6.35%. The company separately announced that net charge-off rate was 1.09% in September, down from 1.54% in August, with 30-day delinquencies at 1.93%, up from 1.79% in August.
COF shares are up 55% year to date and 108% over the past twelve months even amidst the sell-off, a sign of how strong the recovery has been for U.S. consumer spending as well as how much the market has priced into the recovery, and how hard it is to sort out what are one-off effects from the pandemic and recovery environment and what will last.
Capital One trades at 5.7x trailing earnings, a noisy number given how much of earnings is due to loan reserve releases and an example of this market confusion."

755,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2021 12:13PM ET</span>",U.S. pushing to speed up G20 common debt restructuring process,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is calling for quicker progress on restructuring the debts of highly indebted countries under the Common Framework agreed last year by the Group of 20 economies and the Paris Club, a senior Treasury official said Wednesday.
G20 member China, in particular, had dragged its heels in some cases, the official told reporters ahead of G20 health and finance ministers in Rome on Friday.
""The Common Framework process is going slowly, in part because of China's inability to make some decisions on common framework countries,"" the official said. ""So we're urging the processes to be speeded up.""
The official said G20 members understood some countries would need additional aid after a temporary pause in debt payments expires at the end of this year, but were not expected to back a debt freeze under the Common Framework, as proposed by World Bank President David Malpass.
Once the debt freeze ends, countries' debt service payments will be rescheduled into the future, rather than coming due all at once, the official said.
The World Bank this month warned that the debt burden https://www.reuters.com/business/poor-countries-debt-rose-12-record-860-bln-2020-world-bank-2021-10-11 of the world's low-income countries rose 12% to a record $860 billion in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and called for urgent efforts to reduce debt levels.

The U.S. official said Washington backed expanding the Common Framework - which currently includes only Chad, Zambia and Ethiopia - to beyond just the poorest countries, and urged steps to accelerate the pace of negotiations.
""The focus in the G20 has been on the Common Framework and trying to make that operational and make it more efficient,"" the official said.

756,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2021 12:13PM ET</span>","GM outlook doesn't impress, sees chip shortage continuing; shares sink","By Ben Klayman and Paul Lienert
DETROIT (Reuters) -General Motors Co offered a profit forecast for 2021 that disappointed analysts on Wednesday, as its third-quarter earnings were hit by a global semiconductor shortage and rising commodity prices, factors it expects to continue until late 2022.
Chief Executive Mary Barra attempted to counter the downbeat financial results by focusing on GM's plans for a wave of electric vehicles and new software-driven services. Still, shares sank 5.3% in midday trading.
GM's quarterly profit and revenue were dragged down by a drop in wholesale shipments to dealers amid the chip shortage, as well as higher commodity and logistics costs, company executives said.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Dan Levy said in a research note: ""Not the beat/guide raise we were looking for.""
GM said the negative impact on earnings was partially offset by strong pricing on full-size pickups and SUVs and an agreement by supplier LG Electronics to cover most of an anticipated $2 billion in costs related to the recall of the Bolt EV and Bolt EUV. 
""We were able to do very well"" with big trucks and SUVs, Barra said on a call with reporters. ""We just can't build enough of those vehicles.""
Earlier on Wednesday, the CEO said in an interview with CNBC that GM could ""absolutely"" catch up to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in U.S. sales of EVs by 2025.
Barra told analysts GM will provide more specifics next year on its extended EV rollout, including the introduction in January of the Chevrolet Silverado EV, the spring launch of the Cadillac Lyriq, the unveiling of a $30,000 Chevrolet mid-size crossover and the first details on a smaller, less expensive electric vehicle.
Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson, on the same call, said GM expects commodity prices to continue rising in the fourth quarter and in 2022. Barra said rising magnesium prices in China did not pose a significant risk to the company at this point.
Barra also said the company now expects its full-year results will approach the high end of its guidance for operating earnings in the range of $11.5 billion to $13.5 billion. 
However,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Brian Johnson said that implied fourth-quarter earnings would be below Wall Street's consensus estimates.
GM earlier this month told investors it expects to more than double annual revenue to as much as $315 billion by 2030, fueled by growth in software-driven services and new businesses, including its majority-owned Cruise self-driving unit.
GM's market cap early on Wednesday dropped to $79.6 billion, a fraction of Tesla Inc's $1.0 trillion. 
GM said adjusted earnings per share in the third quarter dropped to $1.52, from $2.83 a year earlier. Analysts had expected 96 cents a share.
Revenue dropped to $26.8 billion, from $35.5 billion in the year-ago quarter, while net margin dipped to 9% from 11.4%.

GM said a $14.3 billion year-to-year drop in adjusted automotive free cash flow reflected the impact of work-in-process inventory of vehicles produced but missing some semiconductors.
""We expect to clear the majority of our work-in-process inventory but anticipate some inventory will remain at year end,"" the company said.

The Chinese billionaire's empire came under heavy official scrutiny after a speech in October in Shanghai, which accused the regulatory system of stifling innovation, and the blockbuster $37 billion IPO of his fintech affiliate Ant Group was suspended.
Ma, once China's most famous and outspoken entrepreneur, 
had been ""lying low"" and focusing on hobbies and philanthropy, Alibaba's executive vice chairman and co-founder Joe Tsai told CNBC in June. 
He reappeared in Hong Kong in October, where he met at least ""a few"" business associates over meals, two sources told Reuters.
He then flew to the Spanish island of Mallorca, where his luxury yacht is anchored, his first trip abroad since he fell out with Chinese regulators, two Spanish newspapers reported last week.
Marco van Herk, commercial director at Dutch flower company Anthura, said on Wednesday he had been expecting to give a tour to a group of Chinese business executives earlier this week.
""We were totally surprised when Jack Ma stepped out of the car,"" Van Herk told Reuters. ""He was very interested on a personal level. We talked about how they (orchids) could smell great and were beautiful at the same time.""
Ma wanted to know all the details about the cultivation of the flowers. ""We also focus on robustness, which is right up his alley because you get into how to offer a plant online packaging, rather than out of a store.""
Ma visited several other business and research centres in the Netherlands, including the World Horti Center. 
He was photographed in a baseball cap, wearing a white protective gown and holding flowerpots, while in another picture he is seen in jeans and a hoodie.
The billionaire, who retired as Alibaba's chairman in 2019, will continue touring European companies and research institutions involved in agricultural infrastructure and plant breeding, according to the South China Morning Post (SCMP) newspaper. 
Ma believed combining the technology he researched with Alibaba’s cloud computing, big data analysis and artificial intelligence could help modernise Chinese agriculture, people familiar with the trip told SCMP.
On Sept. 1, photographs of Ma visiting greenhouses in eastern Zhejiang province, home to both Alibaba and Ant, went viral on Chinese social media.

The next day, Alibaba said it would invest 100 billion yuan ($15.5 billion) by 2025 in support of ""common prosperity"", becoming the latest corporate giant to pledge support for the wealth sharing initiative driven by President Xi Jinping.
""I don't know if it will lead to any business, but it was valuable just to have him here,"" Van Herk said.

Investing.com – Harley-Davidson stock (NYSE:HOG) surged 7% Wednesday as sales of its iconic motorcycles left supply chain challenges behind to go past estimates in the third quarter.
Adjusted profit per share of $1.18 was well ahead of Wall Street analysts’ estimate of 78 cents as the company shipped 12% more motorcycles and sold more of the higher-margin models.
Operating margin expanded by 360 basis points to 8.4% year as the company's comparison period included heavier Rewire restructuring charges. One basis point is one hundredth of a percent.
‘Rewire’ is the name the company gave to the exercise it undertook to overhaul its business. It was complete in January, and the company says it laid the foundation for The Hardwire, the company’s 5-year strategic plan to deliver profitable and long-term growth.
Third-quarter revenue from motorcycles and related products rose 20%, to $1.16 billion. Total revenue rose by 17%, to $1.36 million.
North America was the only geography that showed growth in retail sales in the September quarter. The rest continued to be affected by pandemic-driven restrictions.
Inventory at its dealers fell by around 4%, to 25,000 units, as more customers chose to ride its motorcycles and adhere to social distancing.
""We are working to align supply with demand,"" Reuters quoted Chief Financial Officer Gina Goetter as telling analysts during a conference call.
Harley told Reuters it is exploring imposing surcharges, currently applied only in its U.S. market, on its motorbikes worldwide next year in a bid to cope with inflationary pressures. The company raised the surcharge in its biggest market them to 3.5% in the third quarter from 2% to offset higher raw material costs.
The company retained its forecast of 30%-35% growth in its annual motorcycle sales."

(Reuters) -Defense contractor General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD) posted a 3% rise in third-quarter profit on Wednesday, boosted by higher sales in the unit that makes U.S. Navy ships and its aerospace division, which makes Gulfstream business jets, but trimmed its annual revenue target by $400 million.
""This quarter revenues decrease will impact the year, and we now expect revenue to be around $12.6 billion or $400 million less than our second-quarter update,"" General Dynamics Chief Executive Phebe Novakovic said on a post-earnings conference call. Previous annual earnings per share guidance of $11.50 was unchanged.
Revenue rose 1.5% to $9.57 billion in the quarter, but missed an average analyst estimate of $9.85 billion, according to Refinitiv data. 
Business aviation has picked up from pandemic lows as easing travel curbs and the lure of private flights fills order books for new corporate aircraft. On the call Novakovic said Gulfstream has seen ""some upward pressure on pricing"" for the jets with backlog reaching a six-year high. 
Novakovic said about 75% of her workforce had ""either full or partial"" vaccination with a government-contractor deadline coming on Dec. 8. 
General Dynamics shares were 1% higher in midday trading.
The results follow yesterday's 11% stock drop at weapons maker  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) after it lowered its full-year revenue target, citing supply-chain issues, and figures from Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX), which makes a mix of weapons and commercial aerospace components and which raised its forecast for full-year adjusted profit on encouraging signs in the commercial air travel space.
Novakovic said chip shortages impacted the company's Mission Systems unit, which makes tanks, and while being mitigated - could last into next year. 
Sales in General Dynamics' Marine Systems unit, which makes nuclear-powered submarines and surface ships for the U.S. Navy, rose 9.6% to $2.64 billion, while aerospace sales rose 4.6% to $2.07 billion.
The company delivered 31 Gulfstreams versus 32 a year ago, and said it planed to deliver 40 in the fourth quarter.

General Dynamics earlier this month announced two new jets, with its larger Gulfstream G800 set to compete with Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF) Inc's Global 7500 and Dassault Aviation SA's 10X.
Net earnings rose to $860 million, or $3.07 per share, beating an average analyst estimate of $2.98 for the quarter ended Oct. 3, up from $834 million, or $2.90 per share, a year earlier.

Investing.com -- Visa (NYSE:V) shares dropped 5% on Wednesday despite beating estimates on their fiscal year Q4 earnings report Tuesday, as investors appear concerned by the outlook for the year ahead.
The payments company posted $1.65/share GAAP earnings, as well as $6.6 billion, both beats compared to analyst estimates. Processed transactions increased 21% year over year, while payments increased 17%, and cross-border volume grew 38%, a sign of increased travel activity last summer. CEO Al Kelly said, “Our performance was driven by the continuation of the recovery in many global economies and the increased diversification of our revenue with new flows and value added services.”
The company’s guidance for their fiscal Q1 is for “high teens,"" with expected moderation through the rest of the year as they lap the pandemic spending recovery experienced this year.
Analyst reactions included maintaining buy ratings but lowering price targets. Per StreetInsider, Raymond James analyst John Davis said, “while the estimate reset is no doubt frustrating as it likely keeps the stock range bound near-term, it should set the table for the company to beat and raise throughout 2022 as crossborder travel recovers barring any further COVID related hiccups.” RBC analyst Daniel Perlin wrote that, ““FQ4/21 print and guidance suggest that the US consumer continues to rebound, with travel & restaurant spending improving, ecommerce remaining healthy (albeit slightly lower), credit accelerating, with debit remaining relatively stable. Incorporating guidance we are reducing our FY22 estimates.”
Concerns over muted spending growth are having knock-on effects for other credit card companies, with Mastercard (NYSE:MA) down over 6%, Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) down nearly 5%, and  Capital One  Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF), which also reported yesterday, is down 7%.  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) has been the outlier, down only half a percent."

(Reuters) -CME Group Inc said on Wednesday its third-quarter profit more than doubled as trading in the futures exchange operators' interest rate and energy products surged, while the approval of exchange-traded funds (ETF) tied to CME bitcoin futures also lifted volumes.
Average daily volume at CME rose 14% from a year earlier to 17.8 million contracts, mainly driven by double-digit growth in interest rate futures, up 53%, and energy futures, up 18%, as economies around the globe reopen from COVID-19 lockdowns.
CME's bitcoin futures volumes rose 170% versus the third quarter of 2020, helped by the recent regulatory approval and launch of the first U.S. futures-linked bitcoin.
""The launch of ETFs based on CME's bitcoin futures is validation from the industry of what we've known for some time, that CME bitcoin futures are the leading source of bitcoin price discovery in the industry,"" Sean Tully, global head of financial and OTC products, said on a call with analysts.
So far in October, average daily volume for the company's bitcoin contracts is up 57% versus September, to over 12,000 contracts or more than 60,000 equivalent bitcoin worth a record $3.5 billion per day, he said.
Net profit attributable to CME rose to $926.5 million, or $2.58 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $411.7 million, or $1.15 per share, a year earlier.
Stripping out one-time costs, the company earned $1.60 per share, four cents below the consensus estimate of analysts, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 

Total quarterly revenue was up nearly 3% to $1.11 billion, just off the mean estimate of analysts of $1.15 billion.
The majority of the miss relates to a new post-trade services company CME jointly launched with IHS Markit, said Daniel Fannon, an analyst at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF).

(Reuters) -Harley-Davidson Inc said on Wednesday it was exploring imposing surcharges on its motorbikes worldwide next year in a bid to cope with inflationary pressures, even as it reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue.
So far, Harley's surcharges were applicable only in the United States, its biggest market, where the company raised them to 3.5% in the third quarter from 2% in the second to offset some higher raw material costs.
Many companies, including consumer products giants Unilever (NYSE:UL) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), have also passed on higher costs to customers. 
Harley's main raw materials include steel, whose prices have surged in the United States this year. In some cases, the company also sources parts from a single supplier, potentially making it vulnerable to supply chain pressures.
Despite surcharges, customers queued up for Harley's motorbikes such as its Pan America 1250 model in the quarter as demand for socially distanced recreational outdoor activity remained high, which led to inventory shortages at dealers.
""We are working to align supply with demand,"" Chief Financial Officer Gina Goetter said during a conference call with analysts.
Goetter's comments mark another turning point in the company's fortunes, whose sales have risen for three consecutive quarters after falling for two years.
Shares of Harley were up 8.4%, on course for their best day in nearly six months.
The Milwaukee-based company reset its strategy in 2020 to focus on selling its high-margin Touring, and large Cruiser and Trike bikes to older and wealthier customers in markets like the United States and Europe. That bet appears to be paying off.
Retail sales in the United States rose 1.2% to 31,699 units in the third quarter from a year earlier.

Sales from motorcycles and related products jumped 20.4% to $1.16 billion, beating estimates of $1.14 billion.
Excluding items, profit was $1.18 per share, above expectations of 70 cents.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former U.S. President Donald Trump cannot fight his suspension from Twitter in a Florida federal court, but instead must abide by the social media company's terms of service and sue in California, following a judge's ruling.
U.S. District Judge Robert Scola in Miami said in a written order late on Tuesday that Trump was bound by a ""forum selection clause"" in  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR)'s terms of service, which mandates that certain lawsuits against the company be heard by a federal judge in the Northern District of California.
Trump lost his social media megaphone this year after the companies said he violated their policies against glorifying violence.
A mob of his supporters launched a deadly assault on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 after a Trump speech repeating his false claims that his election defeat was the result of widespread fraud, an assertion rejected by multiple courts, state election officials and members of his own administration.
Trump's lawyers had argued his Twitter account was a ""public forum"" and ""government entity,"" and therefore fell under an exception to Twitter's forum selection clause.
Scola rejected this argument, saying the forum selection clause was ""valid and mandatory, and that ""Trump’s former status as the President of the United States does not preclude the application of the forum selection clause.""
John Coale, a lawyer for Trump, said in an interview that he was not surprised by the ruling because forum selection clauses are often held to be binding.
""We thought this was a longshot from the beginning,"" Coale said. ""We expected there was a decent shot we would end up in California.""
Earlier this month, a different judge transferred a lawsuit Trump brought against Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's YouTube, which involves related arguments, from Florida to California on similar grounds.

Trump sued YouTube and Twitter in July, alleging they unlawfully silence conservative viewpoints. He also brought a similar case against  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB).
The lawsuits, filed in federal court in Miami, allege the California-based social media platforms violated the right to freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

769,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 27, 2021 11:27AM ET</span>",The Margin Squeeze Bears Are Worrying About Has Yet to Happen,"(Bloomberg) -- One bearish case Wall Street strategists and equity investors kept sweating over ahead of the reporting season was a squeeze of profit margins that would hinder the bull market. 
Early results for the third quarter suggest that fear is actually premature -- at least for now.
From commodity inflation to supply-chain disruptions and labor shortages, things that threaten to push up costs for doing businesses are indeed piling up. But thanks to robust demand and a rush to cut expenses since the Covid-19 outbreak, corporate America’s ability to wring out from sales has defied all the warnings.
Excluding financial firms, companies in the S&P 500 that announced results have boosted net-profit margins by 40 basis points to 12.4% from the previous quarter, according to data compiled by Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). The improvement has spread across major industries, with all but energy and consumer staples posting better margins. 
“Companies are facing increased cost pressure, but higher sales and operating leverage outweighed cost headwinds so far,” BofA strategists led by Savita Subramanian wrote in a client note. 
The data is the latest evidence of corporate resilience that has underpinned a rally that saw the S&P 500 doubling in 19 months. More than 80% of large-cap companies have beaten analysts’ profit estimates during this season, a pace of positive surprises that has persisted in five of the past six quarters -- and never seen before the pandemic. 
Partly offsetting any rising costs was a jump in demand that’s expected to boost S&P 500 revenue by 15% in the third quarter. Over the past five years, every 10% increase in sales tended to translate to an expansion of 1.2 percentage points in margins related to earnings before interest and taxes, according to an estimate from BofA. 
Throw on top all of the actions that companies have carried out to rein in costs and boost productivity -- digital ordering at restaurants or an app upgrade to attract customers -- and it’s a recipe for better margins. 
Read more: Supply Chain Angst Is No Restraint on Rapidly Reflating S&P 500
While profitability has come in better than expected, company managers haven’t let their guard down. During earnings calls, their mentions of labor, the biggest component of costs for doing businesses, almost quadrupled from a year ago. Meanwhile, the discussions on supply chain surged 321%, both picking up pace from the previous quarter, data compiled by BofA show. 
Mentions of price -- an indicator that BofA views as a proxy for pricing power -- has risen only 45%, compared with 52% from the last season. To BofA’s Subramanian, the increased focus on labor relative to pricing is a sign that anyone anticipating profit margins to expand in 2022 is likely to be disappointed. 
That view put her team in square contrast with analysts who follow individual companies. Based on analysts’ collective forecasts, profit margins for S&P 500 firms will improve in the next two years. 
While no one can predict with high confidence on the post-pandemic market, investors are starting to differentiate winners from losers. During the last three weeks, a basket of companies with high pricing power outperformed that of lower pricing power by 4 percentage points, according to data compiled by  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). that strip out industry bias.
“It’s going to be a war on margins going into next year -- higher wages, higher interest rates, high input costs nearly across the board,” Matt Miskin, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management, told Jonathan Ferro (NYSE:FOE) on Bloomberg TV. “You’ve got to find those companies in those sectors that can have good margins into a tougher year.”
For now, however, a prevailing margin squeeze has yet to materialize on the index level. Separate analysis from Well Fargo & Co. on third-quarter results so far showed a similar trend. Excluding financials, margins have widened by 50 basis points among those that reported.
“Fears of broad margin compression from rising material and labor costs proved to be unfounded during Q3 earnings season to date,” said Chris Harvey, head of equity strategy at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC). “Demand and pricing are strong, and margins remain resilient.”

nvesting.com --Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) shares sold off heavily in early Wednesday action, reversing post-market gains as analysts sift out the good and the bad from earnings. In morning trading shares were down 8%.
The company reported 37% year over year revenue growth and appeared to be unaffected by the changes in Apple’s tracking system on iOS devices that rocked  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP)’s Q4 guidance and to a degree  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)’s. Twitter’s earnings release reported that the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) changes’ “Q3 revenue impact was lower than expected, and we have incorporated an ongoing modest impact into our Q4 guidance.” Analysts have cited either Twitter’s relative weakness in direct response advertising or relative strength in first party data as reasons it might have avoided the Apple concerns.
Earnings took a hit due to $766M in litigation charges, including a $809.5M shareholder class action lawsuit settlement. The company’s monetizable daily average users (mDAUs) grew 13% year over year, with most of the growth coming outside of the U.S. Most of the focus remained on Twitter's advertising business, though the release did cover the roll-out of three new creator oriented products - ticketed Twitter spaces (live audio events), tips, and super follows.
Twitter guided for $1.5-1.6B revenue in Q4, and restated their target of $7.5B in revenue for 2023 even after selling MoPub. Twitter continues to guide to 30%+ expenses growth (and higher revenue growth) in 2021, but also guided for mid 20% expenses growth in 2022 before adjusting for any new investments next year. To achieve their $7.5B revenue target, Twitter will need to grow revenue at roughly 21% per year in the next two years based on Q4 guidance.
Analysts’ reactions were largely mixed, with more lowering price targets than raising them. Among those lowering their price target was Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Brett Thill, who cited a miss on mDAU expectations and uncertainty from the iOS changes. Aaron Kessler of Raymond James held steady and called the results solid, citing the revenue growth opportunities that were offset by higher than expected expense growth. Angelo Zino of CFRA reiterated a buy rating, saying, “We think results are impressive relative to peers, as TWTR appears to be better navigating iOS privacy changes as well as supply chain concerns given its greater exposure to services/digital goods.”
Twitter bought back $170M in shares in Q3, offsetting share-based compensation in the quarter."

JERUSALEM (Reuters) -Israel-based Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) reported third-quarter profit that missed estimates, citing lower North American sales but said a post-COVID recovery would allow it to meet its 2021 targets.
The company trimmed its revenue outlook in July due to a slower bounceback from the pandemic but now sees its business nearly close to pre-pandemic levels.
""We have good reason to believe that because we are not seeing any new lockdowns in Europe ... and in the U.S.,"" Chief Executive Officer Kare Schultz told a conference call. On prescriptions, ""we're getting very close to the 2019 levels.""
Teva reaffirmed its 2021 forecasts of adjusted EPS of $2.50-$2.70 and revenue of $16.0-$16.4 billion, compared with adjusted EPS of $2.57 and revenue of $16.7 billion in 2020.
In the third quarter, the world's largest generic drugmaker said it earned 59 cents per diluted share excluding one-time items in the July-September period, up from 58 cents a share a year earlier. Revenue fell 2% to $3.89 billion.
Analysts had forecast Teva would earn 65 cents a share ex-items on revenue of $4.03 billion, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
Teva's New York listed shares were down 3.9% at $9.02 in morning trading.
After a slow start to the year, Huntington's disease treatment Austedo and migraine product Ajovy continue to show revenue gains, growing 19% and 31% respectively in the United States in the quarter. Teva expects sales of Austedo to reach $850 million and Ajovy $300 million this year, with Schultz reiterating an expectation of Ajovy ultimately reaching a one-third market share, from 21% in the U.S. currently.
Sales in North America fell to $1.88 billion the quarter from $2.02 billion a year earlier. Overall generic drug sales in North America slipped 7% to $859 million, while sales in Europe grew 9% to $1.22 billion.
Its former blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone showed another U.S. sales drop of 44% amid strong generic competition. 
Teva paid down another $1 billion in the quarter, bringing its net debt to $21.7 billion. While the company has targeted a net debt to EBITDA level of three times by 2023, Schultz told Reuters the company would likely be aggressive until around 2025 when debt should fall to a more manageable $10-$12 billion.
With debt high, Schultz said Teva was in no position to make any more acquisitions. He told Reuters Teva was not interested in buying Sandoz from Novartis for financial reasons and a high overlap in their biosimilars portfolios. Novartis this week raised the prospect of divesting its generic drugs unit Sandoz as price pressures mount.

On the ongoing opioid lawsuits in the United States, Schultz said Teva remained in talks with state attorney generals and was hopeful for a settlement within 12 months. He said the upcoming New York trial could serve as a trigger for a settlement.
The company also said it was selling $4 billion of sustainability-linked senior notes to refinance its debt and to secure access to medicines in low and middle-income countries.

Lucid shares jumped following the announcement, up around 4.3%, to $27.50. 
The Dream Delivery event comes not long after the company started production last month at its manufacturing facility in Casa Grande, Arizona.
Once the customers have received their cars, Lucid said they will take part in the inaugural Lucid Rally to showcase the vehicle's ""standout ride, handling, and performance capabilities.""

(Reuters) -Phillips 66 said on Wednesday it will buy the remaining units of Phillips 66 Partners (NYSE:PSXP) it does not already own for $3.4 billion, as the refiner aims to simplify its governance and corporate structure.
Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) Partners was formed by the refiner to own, operate, develop and acquire primarily fee-based crude oil, refined petroleum products and natural gas liquids pipelines, terminals and other midstream assets.
""We believe this acquisition will allow both PSX shareholders and PSXP unitholders to participate in the value creation of the combined entities, supported by the strong financial position of Phillips 66,"" Chief Executive Officer Greg Garland said in a statement. 
The all-stock deal, expected to close in the first quarter of 2022, will offer each outstanding Partnership common unitholder 0.50 shares of PSX common stock for each PSXP common unit.
The oil and gas industry has financed billions of dollar in pipeline and storage products under Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs) since former President Ronald Reagan signed legislation in 1986 allowing them as a way to spur energy investment.
However, several pipeline companies, largely oil and natural gas pipeline firms, have restructured in recent years after U.S. regulators said they will no longer be allowed to recover an income tax allowance as part of fees they charge to shippers under a ""cost-of-service"" rate structure.
""The Phillips 66 Complex has been frustrated with the midstream valuation and acknowledged the environment has shifted dramatically since the MLP was first conceived,"" Spiro Dounis, analyst at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), said in a note.
The Alerian MLP Index, a gauge of energy infrastructure MLPs, is currently valued at nearly $200 billion.

The U.S. refining and midstream industries have consolidated in recent years, a process which accelerated after the coronavirus pandemic drastically reduced demand for transportation fuels.
""This roll-up suggests Phillips 66 may have not seen Phillips 66 Partners as a useful vehicle for industry consolidation, particularly given this likely would have required capital raises,"" Jason Gableman, analyst at Cowen, said in a note.

(Reuters) -Uber Technologies Inc on Wednesday said it is launching a new partnership with rental car company Hertz (PK:HTZZ) to offer 50,000 Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc vehicles as a rental option for its ride-hail drivers by 2023.
Uber (NYSE:UBER) drivers can rent a Tesla through Hertz starting on Nov. 1 in Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego and Washington DC, with the program later this year expanding to cities nationwide, the ride-hail company said in a blog post https://www.uber.com/newsroom/hertztesla.
The announcement comes after Hertz on Monday said it would order 100,000 Tesla vehicles by the end of 2022, meaning that half of the rental company's Tesla fleet would be reserved exclusively for Uber drivers.
News of the biggest-ever Tesla order led to a share price rally and saw the electric vehicle company's market value surpass $1 trillion on Monday.
Tesla shares on Wednesday were up 3%, while Uber shares were down 1.4%. Hertz shares were up 2%.
Hertz on Wednesday also announced a separate partnership with online used-car dealer  Carvana  Co (NYSE:CVNA), whose shares rose 3% in morning trade. Under the agreement, Hertz would reduce its reliance on mass auctions to offload used rental fleet vehicles and instead sell vehicles directly to consumers through Carvana's sales channels.
For Uber drivers, Tesla rentals will start out at $334 a week, including insurance and maintenance, and consist mostly of the company's Model 3 sedan. Uber said the rental cost would drop to $299 per week or lower as the program expands in the coming year.
Wednesday's deal represents Uber's most significant step so far in expanding the use of EVs on its platform. The company has vowed to operate only electric vehicles on its United States, Canadian and European platform by 2030, and worldwide by 2040.
But only a few ride-hail drivers can afford the higher EV sticker prices and in 2019, only 0.15% of all Uber miles in the United States and Canada were driven in electric vehicles, company data showed.
Ride-hail drivers produce more pollution per passenger mile traveled because they spend more than a third of their time driving around empty. Researchers generally assume that electrifying one ride-hail vehicle reduces the same amount of CO2 as converting three regular gas-powered vehicles.
Hertz, which is emerging from bankruptcy, hopes the EV focus will allow the once-dominant brand to stand out against competitors. 

Carmakers also consider partnerships with ride-hail companies as a convenient way to expose more consumers to non-fuel-powered vehicles.
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

(Reuters) -Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc on Wednesday reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its full-year forecast for revenue as well as earnings, fuelled by strong COVID-19 related sales and recovery in its mainstay business.
Shares of the world's largest maker of scientific instruments rose nearly 3% to touch a record high of $625.99 after it also raised its outlook for next year. 
Thermo Fisher (NYSE:TMO) makes and sells coronavirus tests and also provides raw materials and fill-and-finish services for COVID-19 vaccine makers. A surge in cases in recent months due to the virulent Delta variant has led to a rebound in demand for tests.
The company reported $2.05 billion of COVID-19 response revenue in the third quarter, which includes sales related to vaccines and therapies as well as diagnostic testing, up from $1.9 billion in the second quarter. 
""The extra COVID revenue gives them more free cash flow, but the underlying story remains strong, very robust and investors should be happy with the results,"" Atlantic Equities analyst James Mainwaring told Reuters. ""The COVID benefit is just giving them cash.""
Thermo Fisher's mainstay business revenue grew by 10% organically in the quarter and the company raised its 2021 revenue forecast by $1.2 billion to $37.1 billion.

Investing.com -- French pharmaceutical company  Valneva SE ADR  (NASDAQ:VALN) shares dropped 12% after announcing a share offering.
The vaccine maker announced a 5.5M share offering after the close Tuesday. The company had previously risen nearly 50% in the prior two weeks due to excitement over its ongoing Phase 3 trials for its Covid-19 vaccine. The trial showed superiority vs. AstraZeneca PLC ADR (NASDAQ:AZN) vaccines, and the company believes that its vaccine, “the only inactivated vaccine candidate for COVID-19 in clinical trials in Europe,” could offer “benefits in terms of safety, cost, ease of manufacture and distribution” vs. current approved vaccines, and be adapted to future Covid mutations.
The company aims to raise 100-116M, equivalent to roughly $116-$134M. Proceeds are intended, along with existing cash, to fund the Covid-19 vaccine development, as well as development of its vaccine candidates against Lyme disease and Chikungunya. The offering would bring total shares up to 105-106M shares, depending on whether the underwriters exercise their option to buy.
Valneva shares plummeted in September on news the U.K. government canceled a contract to purchase Valneva’s Covid vaccine, and then retook its heights after the trial result announcement. Valneva's shares are still up more than 44% since the beginning of October, and more than 275% over one year.

(Reuters) -Coca-Cola Co raised its full-year profit forecast on Wednesday, banking on higher prices and demand for its sodas globally to counter rising costs due to supply chain disruptions.
The company's shares rose 2.3% to $55.70, as a rebound in demand for its soft drinks, due to the reopening of public venues such as theaters, stadiums and restaurants across the world, led to a 16% jump in third-quarter revenue.
While demand is expected to remain strong, Chief Financial Officer John Murphy said Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) was not immune to cost inflation in 2022 or the business impact of potential new lockdowns in some markets due to a spike in COVID-19 cases.
""We do see the world emerging from the crisis a bit like an earthquake. You get more aftershocks, but the consequent aftershocks tend to be smaller than the early ones. And that's kind of how we see 2022,"" Murphy said.
The beverage giant said it would rely on more marketing expenditure to boost demand, as well as higher prices to get around any potential ""aftershocks"" related to the pandemic.
Other companies, including rival PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc and consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) Co, have said that they would have to increase prices again to counter the impact of surging commodity and freight costs.
""A lot of the things Coke has done operationally, like reduce the number of products that they have and focus on faster growing products, should help at least mitigate some cost inflation,"" Edward Jones analyst John Boylan said.

The company expects its annual adjusted earnings per share to rise 15% to 17%, compared with a prior forecast of a 13% to 15% increase.
On an adjusted basis, Coca-Cola earned 65 cents per share in the third quarter, beating estimates of 58 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

783,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2021 10:07AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Gas crisis helps to land BP $500 million windfall,"By Dmitry Zhdannikov
LONDON (Reuters) - BP (NYSE:BP)'s trading team made at least $500 million in the third quarter of 2021, two sources with knowledge of the company's trading results said, as the energy major benefitted from a gas crisis that has left consumers and industries smarting.
Natural gas and power prices soared to an all-time high in Europe and parts of Asia in August as the global economy recovered from the pandemic and energy consumption increased faster than supplies. 
Low gas stocks after a cold winter and hot summer as well as poor renewables output contributed to the rally.
The increase in power bills sparked protests in Spain and put European governments under pressure to find ways to protect consumers and industry and calm the markets. European Union https://www.reuters.com/article/eu-energy-idAFL1N2RM0FT countries failed to agree on a bloc-wide response on Tuesday.
In China, the government has taken measures to increase coal output and reform power markets to ensure homes are heated this winter.
BP's gas trading results were disclosed at an internal call with staff earlier this month, the sources said, asking not to be named because they are not authorised to speak to the media. BP declined to comment for this story.
The gains were made as customers in Europe and Asia rushed to buy Liquefied Natural Gas (OTC:LNGLF) (LNG) from the United States and other parts of the world to cope with shortages - in a reversal of the situation two years ago when LNG producers faced a global glut.
RIVALS COULD MAKE EVEN MORE
BP's strong gas trading results are likely to provide an early indication of how some of the other international energy companies will benefit from the global gas crunch.
BP has a smaller LNG and gas trading book than its rivals, including Shell (LON:RDSa) and Equinor, which could post even higher profits.
Shell, Equinor and BP will report results this and next week.
Energy companies typically do not disclose details on profits and loss from trading in their quarterly earnings. They usually only state whether trading positively or negatively contributed to overall financial results.
BP and Shell are banking on cash flow from trading to support them through their transition to a business model less reliant on fossil fuels. 
They need trading to generate profit as they focus more on renewable and power markets that tend to have lower margins than oil and gas. 
BP’s trading arm https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bp-trading-exclusive-idUSKBN2B30GK made nearly $4 billion in 2020 in profits, almost equalling the record trading profit in 2019.
The company has pledged to cut oil and gas output, while Shell says its oil production has peaked. Both say they are expanding trading and they still make billions of dollars a year moving oil and gas around the world.
Although BP plans to expand power and renewables trading, many of those markets are highly regulated and unlikely to deliver the same profit margins as oil and gas.
Last year, the bulk of BP's profit was made in oil as the price first slumped as a result of the impact of global lockdowns on fuel demand, and then recovered in a rally that has continued through 2021 to take oil prices to near their highest since 2014.
One of the biggest trading plays in 2020 was to store oil during the downturn, buying it at low prices and selling it later when prices recovered.

This year, natural gas has been an equally strong performer as a result of the market dislocations that led to the Chinese power shortage and tight European gas supplies.
BP has already earned close to $500 million in trading the first quarter of 2021 after a deep freeze in Texas sent gas prices surging, sources said.

And because the global supply crunch is far from resolution and OPEC is sticking to its plan to increase output only gradually, analysts expect oil prices to remain elevated. So, both Marathon Petroleum (MPC) and  Valero Energy  (VLO) are poised to benefit from the industry tailwinds. But which of these stocks is a better choice now? Read more to find out.Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) in Finlay, Ohio, engages primarily in refining, marketing, retailing, and transporting petroleum products in the United States. It operates in two segments: Refining & Marketing; and Midstream. In comparison, San Antonio, Tex.-based Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) manufactures, markets, and sells transportation fuels and petrochemical products in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and internationally. It operates through three segments: Refining; Renewable Diesel; and Ethanol.
On October 26, Brent futures rose to $86.40 per barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude settled at $84.65, marking their highest closes since October 2014. Analysts expect oil price strength to continue through year’s end because the global supply crunch shows no signs of subsiding. Furthermore, OPEC+ has also rejected calls to raise its output faster. Analysts expect oil prices to cross the $90 per barrel mark soon. ""A jump to $90 oil seems likely,"" noted Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at OANDA. Given the multi-year-high oil prices, both MPC and VLO should generate substantial returns.
But while MPC’s shares have gained 28.7% in price over the past six months, VLO has gained 17.8%. In terms of their past year’s performance, MPC is the winner with 128.2% gains versus VLO’s 97%. Also, MPC’s 64.9% gains year-to-date compare with VLO’s 46.2% returns.

In addition, Saks Fifth Avenue’s plan to seek an IPO for its e-commerce segment at a high valuation has buoyed investor optimism regarding the growth of the retail industry. So, to cash in on the growing industry tailwinds, we believe fundamentally well-positioned department store stocks Macy’s (M) and Kohl’s Corporation (KSS) could be worth owning now. Read on.Earlier this week, luxury retailer Saks Fifth Avenue announced its plans for a $6-billion IPO of its online business. This prompted Jana Partner LLC, an activist shareholder, to call for Macy’s to spin off its e-commerce business. The COVID-19 pandemic has propelled the growth of major retailers' digital units, leading investors to predict that these businesses could see high e-commerce sales in the coming months and spin-off their online business segments for better growth.
Despite shifting sentiments, consumer spending remains resilient, thanks to strong household wealth and rising wages driven by a tight labor market. The Commerce Department reported an unexpected increase in September retail sales. Retail sales climbed by 0.7% in September after jumping by an upwardly revised 0.9% in August. Furthermore, economists forecast that customers will begin their holiday shopping early to avoid bare shelves, resulting in greater October retail sales.
Given this backdrop, we think shares of leading department store operators Macy’s Inc. (M) and Kohl’s Corporation (KSS) could be ideal bets now.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Congressional hearing this week into whether oil companies misled the public about climate change marks the start of a broad probe that may extend to other industries from advertising to social media, according to a lawmaker leading the effort.
The sweeping nature of the Democrat-led investigation reflects rising urgency within the party to address global warming as Republicans and moderate Democrats block climate provisions at the heart of President Joe Biden’s spending bill, and as global leaders prepare to meet on climate change in Glasgow, Scotland next month.
""This will be a year-long investigation and the hearings mark the beginning of it,"" Representative Ro Khanna, a progressive Democrat on the House committee told Reuters in an interview. ""The idea is for them to admit to the American people what they have done."" 
Top executives from  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM), BP (NYSE:BP) America,  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) and Shell (LON:RDSa) Oil, along with lobby groups the American Petroleum Institute and the Chamber of Commerce, will testify on Oct. 28 at the House oversight committee hearing. 
Democratic lawmakers have said they want to model the event after the House's Big Tobacco probe of the 1990s which took place over many months and eventually revealed that companies buried evidence that cigarettes are addictive and harmful. 
Khanna said Thursday’s hearing would focus on the energy industry's denial for decades that their products played a leading role in fueling climate change, and on whether the companies' current claims of supporting climate action were real.
He said the committee would also eventually turn to the oil industry’s use of advertising and social media platforms and seek testimony from executives in those companies too.
Executives from social media firms like  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) have already come under intense scrutiny from Congress over their role in the pervasion of fake news and their impact on the well-being of young social media users.
The CEOs who have agreed to testify at the virtual hearing are Exxon Mobil's Darren Woods, BP America's David Lawler, Chevron's Michael Wirth and Shell Oil President Gretchen Watkins. American Petroleum Institute President Mike Sommers and Chamber of Commerce President Suzanne Clark will also testify.
All have denied deliberately misleading the public about climate change.
BIG OIL'S STRATEGY
A source involved in the oil industry's pre-hearing preparations said the companies hoped to use the hearings to highlight their recent efforts to address climate change through investment in renewables and research and development.
The executives were also expected to highlight the rise in gasoline and natural gas prices due to the global energy supply crunch and argue that a rapid shift away from fossil fuels would lead to even higher energy bills, the source said.
Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney had asked the executives for documents dating back to the 1970s showing who the companies and groups funded on climate campaigns and what internal scientists had advised them on climate.
Khanna said the committee was unhappy with the number of documents that had been submitted so far, and implied that it could lead to subpoenas. ""We're willing to use any tool at our disposal to get more documents,"" he said.
He said the documents received so far included some from a former Exxon lobbyist, Keith McCoy, who was secretly recorded https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-lobbying-exxon-climate-idCAKCN2E62TJ by environmental group Greenpeace, saying the company's support of a carbon tax was a ruse to appear progressive on climate change since the company believed the idea would never become law.
Exxon has said McCoy’s statements were an inaccurate depiction of the company's position. McCoy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Thursday's hearing will also likely highlight a strategic rift between Europe and U.S-based energy companies on climate change. European companies like BP and Shell are moving faster into clean energy businesses than U.S. based Exxon and Chevron.
""I think it's an opportunity for a company like BP to show that we are in action toward a net zero goal by 2050,"" said J.P, Fielder, a BP America spokesperson. Shell's Watkins said meeting the demand for reliable energy while addressing climate ""is a huge undertaking and one of the defining challenges of our time.""

Exxon spokesperson Casey Norton said the company had made “substantial investments in next-generation technologies” and “advocates for responsible climate-related policies.”
Chevron did not comment.

 Spotify Technology  SA (NYSE:SPOT) shares opened up 7% after a strong Q3 that gave investors confidence over the company’s podcast investments.
Spotify reported revenue of €2.5B, beating estimates of €2.45B. Monthly Active Users (MAUs) rose 19% year over year to 381 million, with both ad-supported non-paying users and premium users rising 19%. Ad-supported revenue grew 75% year over year and 17% quarter over quarter, while premium subscription revenue grew 22% year over year.
The ad-supported revenue ties to Spotify’s meaningful investments in podcasts, which the company hopes will boost both retention among paying users and gross margins as the content is fully owned vs. licensed songs from music labels. Ad-supported gross margins jumped to 10% this quarter, still off the 30% levels of the premium business but a big jump from 8% in the first half of the year and basically break even last year. On the premium side, ARPU was 4% year over year, up to €4.34 per user.
The shareholder letter pointed out that podcasts on Spotify are up to 3.2M from 2.9M last quarter, and that the Spotify Audience network has seen the number of podcasts on it grow by more than 50% since launch, with “nearly 1 in 5 Spotify advertisers are already participating.”
Spotify’s guidance for Q4 included MAU of 400 million to 407 million and revenue of €2.54 billion to 2.68 billion, an increase on the lower end of the revenue range, with gross margins expected to come in at 25.1% to 26.1%.

Shares of Kraft were up about 2% in premarket trading after the Chicago-based company topped Wall Street estimates for third-quarter revenue and profit. 
Kraft said it expects strong pricing in the first half of 2022 to offset the escalating inflation, as at-home dining trends, which emerged during the pandemic, hold up despite the reopening of dine-in restaurants and bars.

However, the stock’s price has since fallen on the company’s weak financials. So, let’s discuss if it is wise to add the stock to one’s portfolio now.Phunware, Inc. (PHUN) in Austin, Tex., is a pioneer of Multiscreen-as-a-Service (MaaS), a fully integrated enterprise cloud platform for mobile, and has made several partnerships and acquisitions. The stock has gained 330.7% in price over the past month to close yesterday’s trading session at $4.35. The shares had soared more than 1,000% on October 22 to hit their 52-week high of $24.04, due mainly to speculation that PHUN would play a significant role in former U.S. President Donald Trump’s latest attempt to launch a social media platform.
However, no reports have yet been published to confirm that PHUN would help develop Trump’s platform. In addition, according to an SEC filing by the company on October 26, it has registered a common stock shelf offering for roughly $48.50 million worth of its shares. This led to a decline in investor sentiment.
The stock is currently trading 81.9% below its 52-week high. The company also remained unprofitable in its latest reported quarter. So, PHUN’s near-term prospects look bleak.

798,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2021 09:01AM ET</span>",Column: U.S. regulators barely corralling feverish bitcoin mania,"By Jamie McGeever
ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - Insatiable demand for bitcoin is forcing U.S. regulators to walk an increasingly fine line between opening up the booming market to investors, and shielding them from what is still a highly speculative, volatile and risky asset.
By authorizing the first-ever bitcoin futures exchange-traded funds last week, while doubling down on its resistance to cash-based ETFs, the Securities and Exchange Commission may be getting the balance just about right.
The risks bitcoin poses to investors broadly fall into three categories: market opacity (such as highly concentrated ownership, potential for price manipulation, fraud and illicit transactions); market infrastructure (where the asset is traded, ease of access for investors); and price volatility. 
By giving the green light to ETFs tracking the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's bitcoin futures but keeping the door closed on cash-based ETFs, the SEC is reducing the first two while allowing investors with the stomach for it to enjoy the upside of the third.
""Bitcoin is unregulated and has risks related to fraud or manipulation which concerns the SEC. Their concerns are hefty,"" notes Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research at research firm CFRA in New York.
Last week the spot price of bitcoin surged to a new high above $67,000, open interest on the Chicago futures market reached the highest since the contract was launched four years ago, and ProShares and Valkyrie debuted their ETFs.
More bitcoin ETFs tracking futures contracts rather than the cash market will likely be approved in the coming weeks and months. But that is as far as it is likely to go for now. 
Regulators' skepticism and caution surrounding bitcoin and cryptocurrency is long-standing and deep-rooted. Fraud, manipulation, front-running, opaque pricing, and other abuses are seen as features, not bugs.
""It's really a matter of bringing as much of this space within the investor protection remit. That's the story here. Without that, it really is ... a bit of the Wild West,"" SEC Chairman Gary Gensler told Yahoo Finance on Monday, stressing that the global $2.5 trillion crypto market is mostly unregulated.
400% WORTH THE RISK?
From an investor point of view, ETFs are not without actual or opportunity cost either. 
Futures don't track spot prices exactly, so investors could miss out on perhaps 5% to 10% of the upside over the course of a year, according to some analysts. And as contracts expire, buyers will have to roll into the next front month, which in a bull market is at a higher price. 
Gensler's latest salvo - he made similar comments the day of ProShares' ETF debut - comes at a particularly frenzied time for crypto currencies.
Bitcoin is up 45% so far in October, on track for one of its best-ever months, and ProShares Bitcoin Strategy's ETF amassed over $1 billion of assets in a record-breaking two days.
Not only are investors desperate to ride the crest of that wave, there is a growing view that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are vying with gold as the de facto hedge against inflation.
Cash is being pulled out of gold ETFs even with inflationary pressures and expectations rising, JP Morgan strategists note, and many wealth managers are replacing gold in their portfolios with bitcoin and crypto assets.
""Clearly, it (crypto) is winning the race against gold at the moment,"" billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones told CNBC last week. He would prefer to own physical bitcoin rather than the ETF, but ""the fact that it's SEC-approved should give you great comfort."" 
Figures from digital asset manager CoinShares on Monday showed that cryptocurrency products and funds attracted a record $1.5 billion in inflows last week, their 10th straight week of investments. The bulk of that - $1.45 billion - went to bitcoin. 
Inflows so far this year of $8 billion already exceed the record set for the whole of 2020 of $6.7 billion. Some $6.1 billion of that is bitcoin, the report showed. 

A 400% rise in bitcoin's price over the past year will help soothe investor concerns over its volatility - bitcoin halved in value between May and July - and other myriad risks. Gains like that will only intensify the clamor for cash-based ETFs. 
But for now at least, the SEC is standing firm.

799,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2021 08:51AM ET</span>","Spotify adds more subscribers, podcasts fuel ad rebound","By Supantha Mukherjee
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Spotify Technology SA beat Wall Street estimates for third-quarter revenue as more paid subscribers signed up for its premium service and advertisers lined up to air ads in between music and podcasts. 
Premium subscribers, which account for most of the company's revenue, hit 172 million, just beating analysts' expectations of 171.7 million. 
Total monthly active users rose 19% to 381 million.
Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) earns from subscriptions and by presenting adverts to non-paying members. Revenue from ads, which fell at the height of the pandemic, jumped 75% to 323 million euros ($376 million), and the company is planning to hire hundreds of staff to further boost advertising sales.
The company has also been investing heavily in its podcast business to rival that of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and later launched a paid subscription platform for podcasters in the United States and opened it up for advertising.
""We are seeing lots of demand on the podcasting side, which is bringing more advertisers in,"" Chief Executive Daniel Ek said in an interview.
The company does not break out the share of advertising generated by podcasts but Ek said growth was in triple digits over the same period last year, becoming a significant contributor to overall advertising growth.
Spotify ventured into podcasts in 2018 with a series of acquisitions and currently has 3.2 million podcasts on its platform, up from 2.9 million in the last quarter. 
""While we have been relentless in our pursuit of being the world's largest audio platform, it's still early days and we are just getting started,"" Ek said. 
Spotify forecast fourth-quarter revenue of 2.54-2.68 billion euros with 177-181 million premium subscribers. The top end of both measures surpasses average analyst estimates of 2.62 billion euros in revenue and 180 million subscribers. 
Total revenue rose 27% to 2.50 billion euros in the third quarter, beating the 2.45 billion expected by analysts, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
About 40% of Spotify's premium subscribers are based in Europe and 29% in the United States.

The company reported a net profit of 2 million euros compared with a loss of 101 million euros a year earlier.

(Reuters) - Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is expected to emerge as a winner in the digital advertising arena, surviving Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s privacy changes better than rivals Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Snap (NYSE:SNAP).
The ecommerce giant's vast trove of customer shopping data reduces its reliance on tracking info once provided by Apple's iOS mobile operating system. 
Others including Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, which also collects a rich set of data from users' search habits, reported a 41% surge in Google advertising revenue for the third quarter, a sign that businesses that rely less on targeted ads are able to overcome Apple's limits on tracking mobile users.
Amazon, which reports earnings on Thursday, does not break out its advertising sales, but nestles it in its ""other"" business segment.
""Google and Amazon require a user to already be looking for something, therefore aren't as reliant on cookies,"" Eduardo Cruz, performance marketing manager at SupplyKick.
""For brands selling a physical product, Amazon Ads are a powerful way to drive purchases, increase product consideration, and reach customers."" 
Apple's advertising business has surged since it prevented advertisers from tracking iPhone users without their consent in April, eating into market share once occupied by Facebook, Instagram and Snap. 
The iPhone maker will report fourth-quarter results on Thursday.
Most Facebook users access the social networking platform through a mobile device, with nearly 15% of adults using iPhones and iPads in July, according to data firm Data Reportal.
Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), which relies on targeted ads but not as much as Facebook, reported advertising revenue in line with estimates.
Wall Street analysts said since the majority of advertising on Twitter comes from Brands, especially services or digital, as opposed to Direct ads, the company was better positioned to overcome the privacy changes than Facebook or Snap.
To be sure, the digital advertising market is still booming exponentially as the pandemic led to more consumers shopping online and spending more time on social media. Like Facebook and Snap, Google's YouTube saw a modest hit, the company said, primarily in direct-response advertising.

""This is the early innings of a shift that will play out over several quarters,"" Andrew Lipsman, eMarketer principal analyst at Insider Intelligence, said.
""The strength that we've seen in the past few quarters has remained, but it is starting to shift a little bit between the different players.""

Investing.com – Boeing stock (NYSE:BA) traded nearly 1% higher in Wednesday’s premarket as the aeroplane manufacturer delivered more aircraft, allowing it to report a small core operating profit for the second straight quarter.
The world’s largest maker of commercial planes reported core operating earnings of $59 million in the September quarter compared to a loss of $754 million in the same period a year ago.
Revenue rose to about $15.3 billion, fuelled by deliveries of its once best-selling 737 MAX jets. Boeing said it is currently building nineteen 737 MAX jets per month, up from the 16 last quarter, and is targeting 31 per month in early 2022.
Since the regulator’s approval to return the 737 MAX to operations in November 2020, Boeing said it has delivered more than 195 units of those planes.
The company continues to resolve issues surrounding its wide-body planes in the 787 catalog. The low production rates and rework are expected to result in approximately $1 billion of abnormal costs, of which $183 million was recorded in the quarter, it said.
The current 787 production rate is approximately two planes per month. The company expects to continue at this rate until deliveries resume and then return to five per month over time, still a slow rate.
The company's net loss of $132 million was less than a third of the $466 million last quarter."

(Reuters) - Britain's GSK delivered better-than-expected third-quarter results and raised its annual profit outlook, lifting its shares on Wednesday after strong sales of key drugs and cost cutting ahead of a planned split next year.
GSK now expects 2021 adjusted earnings per share to decline by between 2% and 4% at constant exchange rates, excluding any boost from its COVID-19 offerings. It had previously expected profit to fall by mid-to-high single digit percentages.
The results and outlook sent GSK's London-listed shares up 2.1% in early afternoon trade, after hitting seven-week highs.
The improved outlook rests on expected pharmaceuticals sales growth, despite a forecast for lower vaccine sales as a surge in the more-infectious coronavirus Delta variant delayed an expected recovery, including its key shingles vaccine, Shingrix.
""As people didn’t want to go out and leave their houses and (health systems) were really prioritising mass scale vaccination, that was the main hit. These are deferred and not lost sales for sure and it's good to see us firmly on the recovery track,"" GSK CEO Emma Walmsley said on a results call.
Turnover at the world's biggest vaccine maker by sales rose 5% to 9.07 billion pounds ($12.5 billion) for the three months to Sept. 30, while adjusted earnings were up 3% to 36.6 pence per share.
Analysts had expected third-quarter earnings of 29.4 pence per share on sales of 8.73 billion pounds, a company-compiled consensus showed.
GSK said it was sticking with its plan to spin off consumer health in 2022, after a report the business could attract bids from private equity firms. 
Activist investors Elliott and Bluebell have called for a sale of the unit, among other proposals for ""New GSK"", including leadership changes.
""We also continue to make excellent progress towards unlocking the value of Consumer Healthcare through a successful demerger in mid-2022,"" Walmsley said in Wednesday's statement.

A new chair of the consumer healthcare business is expected to be announced before the end of the year, GSK said.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) said on Wednesday that 175 of its suppliers have now committed to use clean energy for the work they do for the iPhone maker, helping to bring more than 9 gigawatts of clean energy onto power grids.
The new round of suppliers - which is an increase from the 70 suppliers and nearly 8 gigawatts of power the company reported last year - are part of the company's efforts to make its sprawling global supply chain carbon-neutral by 2030. 
The companies must commit to using energy sources such as solar or wind energy for the work they do for Apple, part of Apple's efforts announced last year for its products to have what it calls a ""net-zero"" climate impact.
Among the new round of suppliers are South Korea's SK Hynix Inc, which supplies memory chips for Apple devices and will be one of the first Korean firms to join Apple's program. Also joining will be Franco-Italian chipmaker STMicroelectronics, a top supplier of sensors and other chips in iPhones that Apple said has started nine new renewable energy projects since committing to the program.
Apple now has suppliers on the program in 24 countries, including India, Japan and South Korea.
""One of the things that comes along with this is building a core of businesses in different markets on different grids who are demanding clean energy. That's helpful to policy makers,"" Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives told Reuters.

Apple previously signed major suppliers such as Foxconn parent Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, which assembles many of its products, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, which makes Apple's processor chips, to clean energy pledges in 2019 https://www.reuters.com/article/cbusiness-us-apple-energy-idCAKCN1RN0JQ-OCABS.
Apple also announced it was providing funding for 10 smaller renewable energy projects aimed at helping renewable power to under-resourced communities.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)'s profits rose a stronger than expected 7% in the third quarter, the bank's fifth straight quarter in the black as fees for advising on deals partly made up for a drop in trading revenue. 
The profit, while a fraction of that of major U.S. competitors, is a victory for Chief Executive Office Christian Sewing, who in 2019 embarked on a 9 billion euro ($10 billion) overhaul of the German bank after a series of regulatory failings and billions in losses logged over the previous decade.
Investors, however, balked at the bank's reliance on volatile money spinners. Its shares were down 6% by early afternoon having hit a four-month high the previous session.
Net profit attributable to shareholders rose to 194 million euros ($225 million) from 182 million a year earlier and beat the 135 million expected by analysts, based on forecasts published by Deutsche. 
The result was partly helped by a decrease in provisions set aside to cushion fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, while costs related to the bank's ongoing overhaul kept a lid on profit.
The fifth consecutive quarter of profit represents its longest streak in the black since 2012. 
(GRAPHIC: Deutsche Bank results - https://graphics.reuters.com/DEUTSCHEBANK-RESULTS/znvnezojapl/chart.png) 
DISCIPLINED PATH
""We are focused on driving efficiencies while maintaining strong controls, and we are confident of achieving Deutsche Bank's 2022 targets,"" Sewing said.
""It is also clear that we must not lose any ground on our disciplined path,"" he said in a memo to staff.
Analysts at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said the results were strong and showed the bank was ""on the right path to deliver on its strategic ambitions"".
But Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analysts, which rate Deutsche Bank ""underperform"", said Deutsche's investment bank business lagged some U.S. competitors and questioned whether revenue at the unit was sustainable.
One trader called the bank's results a ""low-quality beat"", referring to its reliance on unpredictable investment banking. 
Part of the bank's 2019 overhaul has involved reducing dependence on the more volatile income of the investment bank, but the division, as in recent quarters, was again the bank's biggest revenue generator.
Although the investment banking division's revenue declined 6% in the third quarter from a year earlier, as a pandemic trading boom eased, it is on track to match last year's, Deutsche Bank said. That would be a significant improvement over 2019.
The investment bank's advisory business benefited from a global dealmaking boom, with revenue surging 82% to 118 million euros. A surge in fees from M&A and fundraisings also boosted earnings at U.S. rivals, such as Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS). 
Revenue for fixed-income and currency trading, one of the bank's largest divisions, fell 12% from an exceptionally strong period a year earlier as markets calmed down from their pandemic trading frenzy.

The bank is growing more confident of achieving group revenue of at least 25 billion euros next year, due to loan growth, inflows of assets under management, and higher interest rates, Chief Financial Officer James von Moltke told reporters on a call.

Investing.com –  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) stock (NYSE:DB) fell 5.5% on Nasdaq in Wednesday’s premarket trading as revenue from trading in fixed income securities and currencies fell 12% in the third quarter.
Revenue from fixed income business has fallen at other global banks too after last year’s boom but it exposed once more the vulnerability of the German lender, dependent on the business for more than a quarter of its revenue.
The fall in fixed income trading revenue at Deutsche compares with an average decline of 13% at the five biggest U.S. investment banks, according to Bloomberg.
Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing, tasked with turning around the bank more than 3 years ago, has relied on strong growth in fixed income so far to achieve the objective.
Fee revenue from advising on deals and fund-raising activities rose 22% as capital markets boomed and corporates went for M&As and restructuring. However, it remained a bystander to the boom in equities trading at its Wall Street rivals, having quit the business two years ago.
Revenue growth at corporate banking was mostly flat while it fell in the retail division.
Spain’s Banco Santander (NYSE:SAN) also fell on Wednesday, declining 2%, even as it said it would “significantly” beat its profit target for this year. Growth at rival lenders UBS (NYSE:UBS) and Barclays (NYSE:BCS) had fuelled optimism about the sector and bank share prices had recently gained.
Net revenue in the third quarter rose 2% to 6 billion euro (around $7 billion) and group net income was higher by 6% to 329 million euros.

""Leisure travel remained strong and business travel continued to pick up during the quarter,"" Chief Executive Officer Christopher Nassetta said, adding global tourism is likely to see a strong recovery in months and years ahead.
Hotel operators around the world, including Hilton, are seeing occupancy rates inch towards pre-pandemic levels amid rising vaccination rates.

810,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2021 07:37AM ET</span>",Fiat Chrysler nears plea deal in U.S. emissions fraud probe - sources,"By Mike Spector and David Shepardson
(Reuters) -Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) is nearing an agreement to plead guilty to criminal conduct to resolve a multiyear emissions fraud probe surrounding Ram pickup trucks and Jeep sport-utility vehicles with diesel engines, people familiar with the matter said.
FCA lawyers and U.S. Justice Department officials are brokering a plea deal that could be unveiled in coming weeks and include financial penalties totaling between $250 million and $300 million, the people said. 
Such a resolution with FCA, which is now part of Stellantis NV, would come more than four years after Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) pleaded guilty to criminal charges https://www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-emissions/volkswagen-pleads-guilty-in-u-s-court-in-diesel-emissions-scandal-idUSKBN16H1W4 to resolve its own diesel-emissions scandal involving nearly 600,000 vehicles.It would also mark the final significant chapter in the government crackdown on automakers' emissions practices that was precipitated by Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s deception, which became known as ""Dieselgate.""
The FCA investigation focuses on roughly 100,000 diesel-powered vehicles that allegedly evaded emissions requirements. The plea negotiations are fluid and some terms, including the size of any financial penalties, could change as discussions continue, the people said. 
Justice Department officials are preparing paperwork that will likely be negotiated with FCA to finalize the plea deal, which could result in changes and also present an outside chance for the agreement to fall apart, the people said.
A plea agreement would cap a series of investigations dating back to 2015 surrounding diesel-powered vehicles in FCA's U.S. lineup. The current criminal investigation targets the U.S unit of the Italian-American automaker. The affected vehicles span model years 2014 to 2016.
Representatives for FCA parent Stellantis and the Justice Department declined to comment.
The scandals over emissions cheating tarnished diesel technology and accelerated the industry's shift to electric vehicles. 
The European automakers had promoted ""clean diesel"" technology as a way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and ease a transition to an all-electric future. When regulators on both sides of the Atlantic uncovered evidence that diesel vehicles polluted far more in real world driving, the argument for a slower transition to battery electric vehicles was shredded.
Now, automakers are accelerating battery electric vehicle development to comply with tougher, post-Dieselgate pollution standards.
TRIAL SET FOR 2022
The FCA discussions are heating up as one of its employees prepares to face trial next year on charges he misled regulators https://www.reuters.com/article/cbusiness-us-fiat-chrysler-emissions-idCAKBN1W9217-OCABS about pollution from the vehicles, and continued the deception even after officials caught Volkswagen cheating on government emissions tests.
In April, the Justice Department unveiled charges against two additional FCA employees in the alleged emissions fraud. Italian authorities arrested https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/italys-police-arrest-stellantis-manager-us-diesel-emissions-enquiry-2021-09-29 one of the two additional employees in September.
An indictment alleges the employees conspired to install illegal software known as defeat devices in vehicles so they could dupe government emissions tests and then pollute beyond legal limits on roadways.
FCA has previously resolved related civil allegations while denying it deliberately attempted to cheat on emissions tests.
Other legal troubles have also dogged the automaker. In March, the company pleaded guilty to violating U.S. labor law, admitting it conspired to make illegal payments to union officials. 
The current plea negotiations in the emissions probe come on the heels of other changes at FCA. The company earlier this year sealed a merger with French Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY) maker PSA to form Stellantis. In September, Stellantis said FCA's former top boss would depart to become chief executive of AutoNation Inc (NYSE:AN), the largest U.S. dealership chain.
In the emissions probe, the criminal case against FCA is expected to track closely with one against Volkswagen that the Justice Department unveiled in 2017, the people said. 
Volkswagen admitted to cheating on government emissions tests with diesel-powered vehicles, in the process misleading the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and customers. The German automaker pleaded guilty to charges including conspiracy to defraud the United States, commit wire fraud and violate the Clean Air Act.
Volkswagen agreed to pay $2.8 billion to resolve that criminal case, and billions of dollars more to settle Justice Department civil allegations and lawsuits from vehicle owners and state officials. 
FCA, meanwhile, spoke with senior Justice Department officials in recent months to push back against a demand that the company plead guilty, the people familiar with the matter said.
The automaker instead argued for a so-called deferred prosecution agreement, the people said. In such agreements, a company is criminally charged and agrees to monitoring and other conditions instead of pleading guilty. If the company abides by the agreement, prosecutors later ask a judge to dismiss the charges. 
Justice Department officials rejected FCA's request for the more lenient treatment. 

In talks with U.S. prosecutors, FCA has emphasized the automaker's January 2019 agreement to pay roughly $800 million to settle civil litigation brought by the Justice Department, state officials and consumers alleging the company’s vehicles evaded emissions requirements, one of the people said.
Separately, FCA this year resolved legal claims from customers who opted out of the earlier settlement with consumers, according to court records.

812,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2021 07:22AM ET</span>",Saudi Arabia licenses 44 companies to open regional headquarters in Riyadh,"(Refiles to correct day of week in par 10)
By Davide Barbuscia and Saeed Azhar
RIYADH (Reuters) -Saudi Arabia said on Wednesday it had licensed 44 international companies to set up regional headquarters in the capital Riyadh under the kingdom's push to become a regional commercial hub and vie for foreign capital and talent. 
Among the 44 companies are multinationals in sectors including technology, food and beverages, consulting and construction including Unilever (NYSE:UL), Baker Hughes and Siemens, a press release said.
The world's top oil exporter and largest Arab economy in February said it would give foreign firms until the end of 2023 to set up headquarters in the country or risk losing out on government contracts.
The move, part of efforts by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to wean the economy off oil by creating new industries that also generate jobs for Saudis, has put the kingdom in competition with regional business hub the United Arab Emirates.
The new headquarter establishments would add 67 billion riyals ($18 billion) to the economy and provide around 30,000 job opportunities by 2030, the president of the Royal Commission for Riyadh City, Fahd al-Rasheed, said in a statement. 
Rasheed told Reuters he expects the 44 firms to move to Riyadh within a year, adding that some had already done so. He said the target was for 480 companies by 2030.
The kingdom earlier this year said 24 companies had signed agreements to establish main regional offices - including PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), Deloitte, PwC and Bechtel - rather than oversee operations remotely from the UAE's Dubai emirate.
European law firm DWF Group said on Wednesday that Riyadh would become its regional headquarters for business services. 
Rasheed has said the move is not aimed at dismantling corporate operations elsewhere.
""We are simply saying - you need to have your regional headquarter here because this is not simply a contract economy that you come in and come out. We want to see you with us for the long term,"" he told Reuters on Wednesday.
UNCERTAINTIES LINGER
Rasheed defined regional headquarters as housing all major decision-making functions, but it was unclear how all firms themselves are defining Saudi headquarters. 
Some people in the business community say companies are unlikely to shut operations in the UAE and may simply shift some operations to Saudi. 
Danish wind turbine maker Vestas, not among the list of 44 firms, told Reuters in a statement that it was moving its Middle East sales headquarters from Dubai to Riyadh.
Saudi Arabia has launched economic and social reforms aimed at making the kingdom an easier place to live and work in and has cut the red tape that long deterred companies.

However some attendees at the FII investment summit where Wednesday's announcement was made, and who were speaking on condition of anonymity due to sensitivities, cited continued uncertainty around regulations and taxes, as well as high operational costs and lack of a skilled local workforce.
One example was the kingdom's sudden move in May 2020 to triple its value-added tax rate. Issues around negotiating electricity tariffs would make it much harder for manufacturers to relocate than financial companies, some said.

Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) shares are trading higher after its Q3 results beat estimates.
Net sales for the third quarter were $6.3 billion, down 1.8% from the year-ago period but still above analysts' expectations of $6.04 billion.
In the same period, operating income rose slightly by 0.8% year-on-year to $2 billion, while net income increased by 23.2% to $736 million. Earnings per share fell year-over-year to $0.65 from $0.7, where $0.58 was expected.
Commenting on the results, Kraft Heinz CEO Miguel Patricio said: ""We are effectively adapting to near-term challenges, transforming our business and modernizing our iconic brands to meet consumers' long-term needs. We still have work to do, but our momentum is strong and our strategy is working, which is why we are raising full-year expectations.""
The press release cited both the pandemic and escalating inflation as challenges. The food giant’s guidance for the rest of the year includes revenues staying flat after an ""exceptionally strong"" prior-year period, and raised its adjusted EBITDA guidance from at least $6.1 billion to more than $6.2 billion. This appears to suggest Kraft Heinz is passing on inflation to customers, as they cite “the Company's ongoing efforts to manage inflationary pressures as it continues to invest in long-term growth” as a reason for the raised guidance. Their 2019 Adjusted EBITDA was $6.06B.
The company paid off $1.545B in debt in the quarter as it continues to rebuild its balance sheet, while producing $195M in free cash flow.
Shares of Kraft Heinz rose 1.65% to $37.04 in early U.S. trading Wednesday after the company announced its quarterly results. Kraft has pulled back 18% from 52-week highs."

(Reuters) - Bristol Myers (NYSE:BMY) Squibb Co on Wednesday said its third-quarter sales rose 10% and reported higher-than-expected earnings as its core cancer business regained momentum after a decline earlier this year.
The New York-based drugmaker's revenue for the quarter of $11.6 billion and adjusted profit of $2.00 per share both topped Wall Street estimates of $11.58 billion in sales and $1.92 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Bristol Myers raised the low end of its full-year adjusted profit forecast by 5 cents and now expects to earn $7.40 to $7.55 per share. 
Bristol Myers had missed analysts' estimates in the first quarter, largely due to a decline in sales of its growth driver, the cancer immunotherapy Opdivo.
Sales growth has since recovered even as the Delta variant of the coronavirus caused a surge in global COVID-19 cases that could have kept people from seeking treatment for other diseases. 
""We're seeing good recovery from COVID really across all of our markets,"" Chris Boerner, Bristol Myers' chief commercialization officer, said in an interview. 
""In immuno-oncology, we've seen a gradual recovery in patient volume,"" he added. ""We're still about 5 to 10% below where we were pre-COVID, but the trend is moving in the right direction.""
Cancer drugs Revlimid and Opdivo generated sales of more than $3.3 billion and $1.9 billion respectively. The blood thinner Eliquis, which Bristol shares with  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE), brought in more than $2.4 billion. All three were higher than sales reported a year earlier. 

The drugmaker is continuing to look at expanding its pipeline of medicines in development through deals, mostly involving smaller, early-stage companies in areas such as cancer, immunology, and cardiovascular health, Chief Financial Officer David Elkins said. 
Bloomberg News reported last week that Bristol Myers has expressed interest in buying autoimmune disease drug developer Aurinia Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:AUPH) Inc, citing people familiar with the matter.

818,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2021 07:07AM ET</span>",We're hiring: Deutsche expands investment bank in revenue quest,"By Tom Sims, Frank Siebelt and Emma Rumney
FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) is gingerly hiring new staff at its investment bank, which has become its biggest revenue generator https://www.reuters.com/business/deutsche-bank-posts-better-than-expected-q3-net-profit-2021-10-27, as it pursues new revenue opportunities.
In the first year-on-year increase in front-office staff at the investment bank since Germany's largest lender embarked on a restructuring in 2019, Deutsche said on Wednesday the number had risen in the third quarter by 4% to 4,325 people.
While relatively small for a bank with more than 84,000 staff, the return to hiring is significant for Deutsche after years of losses, retrenchment and layoffs. 
Two people with direct knowledge of the matter said that in recent months Deutsche's investment bank has added 30 managing directors and directors to its origination and advisory unit and a similar number to its fixed-income operations, with more planned for early 2022.
""We've been making targeted hires,"" Deutsche's finance chief James von Moltke told reporters on Wednesday.
Once Deutsche's problem child, the investment bank has quickly become its biggest revenue generator, benefiting from a pandemic-induced trading boom and a wave of dealmaking. 
And Deutsche's aim is to further increase its revenue.
Deutsche Chief Executive Christian Sewing last week formally opened a new New York headquarters, a major hub for the investment banking operations that were hit hard by the 2019 restructuring. 
""We are here to stay,"" Sewing told CNBC before ringing the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange.
The investment banking hires are in contrast to the aim to reducing headcount globally. Deutsche has pledged to cut staff by 18,000, and is only partly through that process.
Wednesday's earnings again highlighted the strength of the investment bank, which helped Deutsche beat estimates.
As it planned its overhaul, Deutsche had hoped to rely more on its corporate bank https://www.reuters.com/article/us-deutsche-bank-strategy-insight-idUSKCN1VA0D5 for revenue but ultra-low interest rates have been an obstacle. 
In recent months, Deutsche has hired investment bankers for healthcare and technology, beefing up in places like Israel and Dubai, other bankers said. There are also new hires for its rates business. 
An example of the repositioning is South Africa, where Deutsche wants to become a top dealer in government bonds again, executives told Reuters. 
Johannes Engel, interim chief country officer, said the bank was making selective hires, including senior roles, in areas it was focused on growing. 
These include lending to financial institutions and multinational companies, while Deutsche also sees a chance to grow its advisory services as mergers and acquisitions pick up.

One recent hire is Esra Turk, head of institutional clients in central and eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa. 
Turk said Deutsche saw opportunities across the continent and was looking to grow in other select African markets.

Investing.com – Alphabet stock (NASDAQ:GOOGL) traded 0.7% lower in Wednesday’s premarket owing to slower-than-expected growth at its YouTube and Cloud computing businesses in the third quarter.
YouTube, part of Google advertising, delivered $7.2 billion in revenue. More was expected from the division as most expected the pandemic-driven binge by consumers and advertisers to continue on the video streaming platform.
Apple’s anti-tracking app privacy features had a “modest impact on YouTube’s revenues” in the quarter, according to Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat , Bloomberg reported.
The iPhone-maker updated its privacy policy in the second quarter to make it tougher for apps to track users and source their personal data for ad targeting. Users have to now opt-in to let an app track them, a turn-off for advertisers.
Sales from the company’s Cloud division rose 45% to $4.99 billion, missing Wall Street expectations of $5.04 billion. The company trails Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in the big business. Analysts keep expectations from Cloud companies high given the shift to digital that the pandemic only accelerated. Any softness there isn’t well accepted.
Porat warned that sales from Google’s app store would suffer as a result of the reduction in commission this summer after pressure from regulators and software developers.
Google advertising revenue rose over 43% to $53.1 billion during the third quarter. Of this, Google search delivered about $38 billion in revenue and showed that spending by companies remains robust as consumers continue to look for products and services online while parts of the world remain affected by the pandemic.
Alphabet's overall sales jumped 41% to $65.1 billion and was ahead of estimated. So was the diluted profit per share of $27.99."

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Electrolux warned on Wednesday it may struggle to meet demand through the rest of the year and into 2022 due to global supply-chain challenges, after its profit slumped in the third quarter as component shortages held back production. 
Europe's biggest home appliances maker said it still sees demand normalising above pre-pandemic levels but flagged limited availability of some product categories through the year, with regional variances. 
""We continue to have a tight collaboration with suppliers to mitigate global supply shortages, but we estimate that the fourth quarter will be even more challenging than the third quarter,"" the rival to Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) said in a statement. 
""Although we anticipate sequential improvements in 2022, we expect challenging conditions to remain in meeting continued strong demand.""
Global shortages of semiconductors and other electronic components will continue to be the biggest issue, hitting primarily the production of cookers and washing machines, CEO Jonas Samuelson told Reuters. 
In the third quarter, Electrolux' North America business, which ships some ready assembled products from China, was particularly affected due to congestion at big U.S. ports, he said. 
The Swedish group assembles most of its products in the regions they are sold.
Households have been spending more on their homes, including on appliances, during the pandemic, and Electrolux expects demand to stay above pre-pandemic levels in the long run amid a bigger focus on home improvement, cooking at home and hygiene.
The group's third-quarter operating profit tumbled 49% to 1.64 billion crowns ($191 million) as sales shrank 3% and price hikes did not fully offset higher costs for ocean freight and electronic components. The year ago-quarter was unusually strong due to the stay-at-home trend and pent-up demand from earlier in the pandemic. 
Compared with the pre-pandemic third quarter of 2019, profits were up from 1.19 billion crowns.
Analysts polled by Refinitiv had on average forecast a 1.66 billion crown profit.

Electrolux shares, which have bounced from a nine-month low of 178.84 set in early October, were down 1.6% at 193.95 crowns by 1035 GMT.

MADRID (Reuters) -Global wind power leader Iberdrola (OTC:IBDRY) expects no further impact from Spain's recent attempt to swoop on utilities' earnings and use them to shield consumers from soaring energy prices, the company said on Wednesday.
Electricity and gas prices have hit record highs around the world as economies began to recover from the coronavirus crisis, but companies such as Iberdrola say they have not benefited from this because they lock in prices with customers in advance.
Spain on Tuesday said it would introduce exemptions to a decree that was originally expected to claw back about 2.6 billion euros ($3 billion) in profit from companies deemed to have profited from the price rises.
Iberdrola's shares were buffeted by the measures, losing almost 14% of their value in less than three weeks, but recovered as it became clear the government would change tack.
The clawback cost the company 85 million euros. 
""This impact will be withdrawn and is not expected to continue in the coming months after the measure adopted by the Spanish government yesterday,"" Chief Executive Ignacio Galan said on a conference call.
The stock rose on Wednesday despite the company reporting a 10% fall in net profit for the first nine months of the year, partly owing to the increased costs of buying power on wholesale markets to meet strong demand.
Iberdrola generates power through wind and solar farms and combined cycle gas plants in Europe, Britain and Latin America, owns and operates distribution grids and expects to supply power to 60 million customers worldwide by 2025.
When there is demand for more power than it can generate, Iberdrola buys extra on the open market. Fellow Spanish group Endesa blamed higher wholesale prices for a drop in its own profit earlier this year.
Nevertheless, Iberdrola's result beat market expectations for a turbulent nine months in which it was also hit by a chunky one-off tax charge in Britain, where it operates Scottish Power. 
Adjusted for one-off factors, net profit rose 5.2% year on year to 2.7 billion euros. 
Government targets to reduce planet-warming carbon emissions and strong investor appetite for environmentally sustainable businesses have buoyed Iberdrola's plans to spend 150 billion euros on tripling its global renewables capacity by 2030 in spite of the market volatility.
It stuck to its financial guidance for the full year and said it was speeding up expansion of its offshore wind business, a fast-growing sector that is key to the decarbonisation plans of some of the world's biggest economies. 

The company now has huge turbines with a combined capacity of 1.5 gigawatts spinning offshore and is building a further 2.6 GW in France, the United States and Germany.

The world's second-largest brewer said it sold 5.1% less beer on a like-for-like basis than a year earlier, with Asia-Pacific sales down 37.4% as COVID-19 restrictions hit Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam.
The average estimate in a company-compiled poll of analysts was for a 2.3% overall decline, with the Asia-Pacific region down 25.6% and modest growth in Africa, the Middle East and Europe.
The maker of Europe's top-selling beer, Heineken, and Tiger and Sol lagers retained its forecast of full-year results finishing below those of pre-pandemic 2019. 
Vietnam, consistently one of Asia's fastest-growing economies, suffered a record contraction in the third quarter as an outbreak of the Delta variant of the coronavirus led to a strict lockdown in the commercial hub of Ho Chi Minh City.
The city's lockdown started to ease this month, and though bars remain closed, Heineken Chief Executive Dolf van den Brink said there are signs of recovery in the Asia-Pacific region

European sales also disappointed, failing to deliver an expected uplift. Heineken said the weakness partly reflected poor summer weather in northern Europe, though it also faced logistics diruptions in Britain. 
Rivals Anheuser-Busch InBev and Carlsberg (OTC:CABGY) provide updates on the third quarter on Thursday.

TOKYO (Reuters) - A lawyer for Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co. on Wednesday asked a Tokyo court for leniency when it sentences the company over charges it allowed ousted chairman, Carlos Ghosn, to hide earnings from Japanese authorities.
Nissan, which has already pleaded guilty, is standing trial alongside former executive Greg Kelly, who has denied charges he helped his former boss hide 9.3 billion yen ($81.8 million) of Ghosn's earnings over eight years through deferred payments.
Prosecutors are seeking a 200 million yen fine for the carmaker, and a two-year jail sentence for Kelly, for breaching regulations introduced in 2010 that forced company executives earning more than 1 billion yen a year to disclose their compensation. 
In closing statements to the court the Nissan lawyer said the company had already seen its reputation damaged by the charges and had not benefited from Ghosn's alleged actions. 
The lawyer added that the carmaker already faced fines from Japan's financial regulators and had strengthened its corporate governance to guard against further breaches.
Kelly's legal team submitted a 497-page document arguing that emails and documents presented as evidence during the year-long trial did not show there was any conspiracy or agreement to defer Ghosn's remuneration. 
""There was no crime. Carlos Ghosn never was paid anything. And there was no enforceable agreement,"" Kelly, who has been in Japan for three years since his arrest and release on bail, told reporters outside the court. ""There were many senior executives that were worried that we might not retain him.""
A ruling in the case is expected next year. Japan's conviction rate is about 99%.
Ghosn, who fled to Lebanon at the end of 2019 hidden in luggage on a private jet, also denies any wrongdoing. 

He also faces separate breach of trust charges that allege he enriched himself at Nissan's expense through $5 million in payments to a Middle East car dealership, and by temporarily transferring personal financial losses to his employer’s books. 
Both Ghosn and Kelly say they are victims of a boardroom coup by former colleagues worried that Ghosn would push through a merger between Nissan and Renault SA (OTC:RNLSY), its largest shareholder.

Officials are looking into whether Facebook research documents indicate that it might have violated a 2019 settlement with the agency over privacy concerns, according to the report.
Facebook and the FTC did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. 
The company has come under fire after Frances Haugen, who worked as a product manager on the civic misinformation team at Facebook, revealed that she was the whistleblower who provided documents underpinning a recent WSJ investigation. 

In September, the Journal published a report that focused on data suggesting that Instagram had a harmful effect on teenagers, particularly teen girls, and that Facebook had made minimal efforts to address the issue.
Facebook shares were down 0.6% in premarket trading.

(Reuters) -Former U.S. President Donald Trump will be able to retain the ownership of his newly launched social media venture even if he chooses to make another White House run or is convicted by prosecutors who are looking into his business dealings.
Trump said last week that TRUTH Social would be created through a new company formed by a merger of the Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) and blank-check firm Digital World Acquisition Corp. 
According to regulatory filings issued late on Tuesday, Trump was referred to as the ""company principal,"" even though the exact size of his stake in the company was not disclosed.
However, the former president is set to keep his ownership in TMTG, even if the company faces a ""material disruptive event"" - the latest filings include a clause that is designed to shield his stake. 
""In order to maximize business continuity and to minimize, mitigate, or eliminate any negative impacts on the Company from a Material Disruptive Event, the Company Principal's ownership and position in the Company shall be structured in such a way as to eliminate the need for restructuring of ownership or changes in position were a Material Disruptive Event to occur,"" according to the filing. 
Since Trump was voted out of office in the last presidential elections in 2020, he has repeatedly dropped hints that he might seek the presidency for a third time in 2024. 
Trump and his business interests are also the subject of numerous investigations from U.S. authorities - in June, Trump's namesake company and its chief financial officer were indicted, the first charges to arise from a more than two-year probe by New York prosecutors of Trump and his business dealings, Reuters reported. 
In the latest filings, DWAC highlighted the risks of being associated with Trump's company. 
""The Purchaser hereby acknowledges the controversial nature of being associated with the Company Principal and the Company Principal’s family,"" it said. 

As part of an earnout clause in the deal, TMTG shareholders will receive an additional 40 million shares, based on the share price performance of DWAC, which on Tuesday closed down nearly 30% but are still trading well above the SPAC's IPO price of $10 a share. 
Earlier in October, Reuters reported that the merger with TMTG has delivered a potential windfall of $420 million for DWAC's main backer, Patrick Orlando, who has been trying for a decade to reinvent himself as a serial dealmaker.

Investing.com – Microsoft stock (NASDAQ:MSFT) traded 2.3% higher in Wednesday’s premarket as its Cloud business topped $20 billion in revenue for the first time to drive the company past analysts’ estimates for the first quarter.
Microsoft Cloud generated 36% more revenue on-year to touch $20.7 billion as clients like GE Healthcare (NYSE:GE) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) migrated critical workloads to its Cloud platform led by Azure. Azure revenue grew more than 50%. Without the impact of an accounting change, gross margin in the segment would have widened by 4 percentage points instead of narrowing slightly to 71%.
The Cloud business of Microsoft and rivals Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has boomed as more people asked for on-demand digital services during the pandemic, accelerating the shift of corporates to a hybrid model.
Microsoft's revenue from selling Windows to PC makers grew 10% year over year, easily surpassing the overall PC market, which grew about 4% because of supply constraints, according to data from IDC.
Microsoft 365 subscription growth drove Office consumer results. Advertising market growth drove another strong quarter in LinkedIn as well as Search and News advertising by 40% excluding traffic acquisition costs, the company said.
The company continues to persuade more customers to pay up for its more premium services that offer enhanced feature-loaded apps and security and they are responding. Sales of Office 365 to business customers rose 23%.
Xbox content and services revenue rose 2% while Surface sales declined 18% as lack of semiconductors held back sales of devices. Surface sales could further erode in the ongoing quarter, the company said, citing persistence of supply issues.
Overall, Microsoft’s first-quarter revenue jumped 22% to $45.3 billion. Adjusted profit per share rose 25% to $2.27.
Microsoft said Azure will continue to drive revenue growth. Intelligent Cloud sales are seen between $18.1 billion and $18.35 billion in the second quarter, after notching up $17 billion July-September.
In ‘More Personal Computing’ comprising Windows, Office 365, LinkedIn and other consumer-facing businesses, the company expects revenue of $16.55 billion at midpoint in the current quarter.

By Eric M. Johnson
SEATTLE (Reuters) - Hopes of an imminent breakthrough in deliveries of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's 787 jetliner were fading on Tuesday after a top supplier reported a lull in activity and two industry sources said the jetmaker continued to wade through lingering factory problems. 
Boeing shares fell 1.4% on the eve of quarterly earnings due on Wednesday, reaching their lowest level since Sept. 21 as uncertainty continues to plague its main commercial programs. 
More than 100 long-haul 787s are parked, locking up an estimated $9 billion in cash, after a series of manufacturing issues over the past two years compounded weak demand.
""There is a substantial risk that Boeing will recognize a charge related to the program at Q3 results,"" Bernstein analyst Doug Harned wrote last week.
The 787 problems have stifled a crucial source of cash as Boeing's main cash cow, the 737 MAX, recovers gradually from a two-year safety crisis triggered by fatal crashes.
""We are progressing through our comprehensive inspections and reviews, and will continue to take the time necessary to meet the highest standards, while coordinating closely with our suppliers and customers,"" a Boeing spokesperson said on Tuesday when asked about the 787 issues.
While the MAX received Western approvals late last year, Boeing faces renewed uncertainty over the timing of its re-entry to service in China, which drives a quarter of its sales.
China had been expected to approve the MAX in November but chances are growing this will slip to next year, sources said.
China's regulator did not respond to a request for comment.
A Boeing spokesperson declined to comment on China or the MAX.
Although Boeing and Chinese regulators recently carried out a successful test flight, the clearance has become tangled in diplomatic tensions with the United States.
Boeing said earlier this year it would deliver fewer than half of the 100 or so 787s in its inventory this year, instead of the ""vast majority"" previously expected. So far this year it has delivered 14. 
Hopes are fading that a meaningful number could be delivered before year-end, one of the industry sources said, although a handful of deliveries could not be ruled out.
One supplier said Boeing had not given parts makers an indication of its timing one way or the other, leaving uncertainty over the timetable for deliveries. 

Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX), which supplies a raft of systems, said on Tuesday it was not shipping anything for the 787.
Boeing has been grappling with manufacturing flaws that produced structural defects in the 787 and have twice halted deliveries, with the latest stoppage ongoing since May.

By Eduardo Baptista
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Bottled water, vaccine development, short video platform TikTok and electric vehicle technology propelled the big earners on China's rich list this year, as embattled property moguls and others facing regulatory scrutiny slipped down the rankings.
Zhong Shanshan was No. 1 on the Hurun China Rich List 2021 published on Wednesday, with personal wealth of $60.6 billion thanks to a surge in the value of his listed companies, Nongfu Spring and Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise.
ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming, battery maker CATL Chairman Zeng Yuqun, Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Pony Ma, and Jack Ma, founder of  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group and Ant Group, rounded out the top five. 
Ma, who had previously topped the rich list for three years running, dropped places following the suspension of Ant Group’s initial public offering and the slapping of a record fine on Alibaba for monopolistic behaviour. 
Also falling down the list of the country's 100 wealthiest people amid regulatory scrutiny was China Evergrande Group founder Hui Ka Yan, who lost around 70% of his net worth to be left with around $11.3 billion.
Xu's personal finances have plummeted as the country's second largest property developer reels under more than $300 billion in liabilities.
With the broader property sector facing a funding crunch after a regulatory crackdown on excessive borrowing and land buying, the Hurun Report said it was the first time since it began compiling the report in 1999 that a real estate developer was not in the top ten.
China Fortune Land founder Wang Wenxue lost his billionaire status altogether, with his net worth plunging 88% from last year to $930 million.
Yang Huiyan, co-chairwoman at and majority shareholder of real estate developer Country Garden, the highest woman on the list, fell five places to 11th.
Zhang Bangxin, founder of home-tutoring service TAL Education Group (NYSE:TAL), also dropped off the list, losing 94% of his net worth after China introduced new rules banning for-profit tutoring.
Tencent's Ma, whose wealth swelled 70% last year, saw it decrease 19% this year as his company's video games business was rattled by new, stricter limits on gaming time for minors.
WINNERS
In a country of 1.4 billion people, just 2,769 people were worth more than 2 billion yuan ($313 million) each, the report said. 
The biggest mover in the top 100 was Luo Liguo, the chief executive of solar product firm Hoshine Silicon Industry Co , who multiplied his net worth 6.5 times, vaulting from 220th to 21st spot. 
The Biden administration earlier this year banned U.S. imports of Hoshine's materials, citing allegations of forced labour of Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups in China's Xinjiang region. In response to the action, China said it would take ""all necessary measures"" to protect its' companies rights and interests.

ByteDance's Zhang, which owns short-video platform TikTok, tripled his wealth from last year to $52.8 billion and is likely to take the No. 1 spot next year, particularly if persistent rumours about a company listing are realised, the Hurun Report said. 
Zhang “is a likely candidate to become the next Number One in China, especially if he gets to list ByteDance”, according to Rupert Hoogewerf, Hurun Report’s chairman.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German sportswear company Puma on Wednesday advised people to shop early for Christmas as supply bottlenecks and manufacturing disruptions would mean a shortage of its products well into 2022.
The company expects that Vietnam factory closures, compounded by shipping constraints, will hit its product supplies, even as the group increased its 2021 sales outlook.
Puma, which reported stronger-than-expected third quarter results, also expects its sales in China to continue to be impacted by coronavirus lockdowns and a consumer boycott of Western brands triggered earlier this year by a political row.
Factories in Vietnam, a major supplier to the footwear industry, closed for 10 to 11 weeks due to COVID-19 outbreaks, but Puma Chief Executive Bjorn Gulden said they were now open again and should resume full production by the end of November.
But he said the closures in Vietnam, where Puma makes a third of its products, would still impact supplies through to the end of this year and into the first quarter of 2022, exacerbated by port congestion and a lack of shipping capacity.
""If you want to buy Christmas presents, you should buy now,"" Gulden told a briefing for reporters, adding that supply chain issues, compounded by higher costs of raw materials, could feed through to higher prices in the second half of 2022.
Rival  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) cut its fiscal 2022 sales expectations last month and also said it expected delays during the holiday shopping season, blaming a supply chain crunch.
Puma said sales in the third quarter, when the Vietnam closures had not yet hit supplies, rose a currency-adjusted 20.4% to 1.9 billion euros ($2.21 billion) and operating profit jumped to 229 million euros, both beating analyst forecasts.
Puma shares were up 1.8% at 0845 GMT, making them the biggest gainer on the German blue-chip index.
""Puma's third-quarter earnings confirm a brand in rude health in Western markets,"" said Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst James Grzinic.
Sales fell 16% in Greater China due to ongoing lockdowns there and the impact of a consumer boycott.
Western brands, including Puma, faced online attacks in China in late March over past statements saying they would not source cotton from Xinjiang after reports of human rights abuses against Uyghur Muslims. Beijing denies any such abuses.
Gulden said Puma was still not able to do marketing with Chinese celebrities and shopper traffic in stores was down, but he is optimistic about China's ""Single's Day"" sales event in November and ultimately for a medium-term recovery there.

Puma increased its forecast for full-year currency-adjusted sales growth to at least 25% from a previous outlook of at least 20%, and Gulden said the company eventually hopes to double its annual sales to more than 10 billion euros.

835,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2021 05:41AM ET</span>",Investment banks argue Hong Kong's proposed SPAC rules are too rigid -sources,"By Scott Murdoch and Alun John
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Investment banks and corporate advisors are pushing back against Hong Kong's proposed rules for blank check listings, arguing they are too onerous and will not make the city competitive, three sources with knowledge of the matter said.
Interested parties have until Oct. 31 to lodge submissions with the Hong Kong stock exchange over its proposed framework for Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs).
The criticism comes at a time when rival Asian financial hub Singapore has shot ahead with its preparations to allow SPACs, which raise money on stock markets to buy private companies, giving those businesses a quick and cheap route to a listing.
Key concerns raised include a proposed requirement that any SPAC deal be worth at least HK$1 billion ($130 million) as that excludes smaller buyout targets, said the sources who have worked on submissions.
The sources were not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified. 
The proposed rules also stipulate that there need to be at least 75 professional investors in a SPAC listing, 40% of which must be institutional while retail investors cannot participate until after the company has carried out its merger - requirements likely to make trading illiquid, the sources added.
The rules also require the merged entity to appoint a financial sponsor to carry out due diligence and meet the exchange's existing listing requirements which could tack on another three to six months to the listing process.
""It is of the view to some practitioners that it could undermine the intention of offering the SPAC as an alternative and streamlined listing approach,"" the city's Financial Services Development Council said of the due diligence requirement in a submission lodged on Wednesday.
The Hong Kong stock exchange did not comment on whether it would be amenable to making concessions when asked for comment by Reuters.
Its SPAC consultation paper says the bourse does not want to replicate U.S. SPAC rules but instead plans to create a regime ""tailored to the particular risks and requirements of the Hong Kong market"", adding that several proposals are ""designed to provide a high entry point for SPAC listing applicants and De-SPAC targets.
Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission told Reuters in a statement it would work closely with the exchange to take into account market feedback when finalising the new rules.
There has been nearly $137 billion worth of SPACs issued globally so far in 2021, according to Refinitiv. The pace of deals has fallen sharply https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/how-wall-streets-hottest-dealmaking-trend-fizzled-2021-09-16 since the first quarter, however, with U.S. investors spooked by the vehicles' poor financial performance and a regulatory crackdown.
While Hong Kong is still debating its rules, Singapore last month became the first Asian market to allow SPACs to list, making concessions after the initial proposals were seen as too strict.
European asset manager Tikehau Capital is among the first https://www.reuters.com/article/tikehau-capital-listing/asset-manager-tikehau-capital-applies-to-list-spac-on-sgx-sources-idUSKBN2HH05F to plan a SPAC listing in Singapore, sources have told Reuters.
""I think there is a concern that the proposed SPAC regime for Hong Kong is less competitive than that in other jurisdictions,"" said Vivian Yiu, a Hong Kong-based capital markets partner at law firm Morrison & Foerster. 

""While the Stock Exchange is understandably putting in place these safeguards to prevent abuse and market manipulation, there is perhaps room for relaxation in some areas as retail investors are excluded from investing until the de-SPAC completes,"" she said.
Hong Kong authorities have spent years trying to combat illegal practices linked to the formation and speculative trading of shell companies, which they say provide opportunities for market manipulation and insider dealing. Those concerns resulted in strict rules in 2019 that constrain back door listings.

While Travis Katz, BrightDrop's chief executive, did not disclose how many dealers will be in the network, he said it will be smaller than GM's retail network and focused in urban markets. The locations will be tailored to serve fleet customers such as FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ), which GM supplies vehicles to by contract.
""The plan is we're setting up our own BrightDrop-specific dealership network,"" Katz told the Automotive Press Association in Detroit, adding that BrightDrop is talking to existing GM dealers but could use others as well.
BrightDrop is a key growth market for GM, which has said it plans to double revenue by 2030.
The No. 1 U.S. automaker sees global e-commerce revenue hitting $4 trillion in 2023 and growing to $7.4 trillion in 2029. GM executives have said they expect BrightDrop's revenue to top $10 billion by 2030 with low-20% profit margins.
Asked if GM will spin off BrightDrop or seek outside investors for the business as it did for its Cruise autonomous-driving unit, Katz said there were no such current plans and GM does not need external capital to build the business.

""Right now, the company is structured as a wholly owned entity and that's how we're running it,"" he said. 
BrightDrop is scheduled to begin selling its first vehicle, the EV600 van, this fall, followed by the smaller EV410 vehicle in 2023.

Turkey, a manufacturer and buyer of the F-35s, was expelled from the programme over its purchase of Russian S-400 defence systems. It says its removal is unjust and has demanded reimbursement of $1.4 billion. 
Erdogan has said Washington offered Ankara a package of F-16 jets and modernisation kits in exchange for the payment, but the United States has said it offered no such financial plan.
""The information we received is that there is a payment plan of some sort with them,"" state-run Anadolu news agency cited him as telling reporters regarding the F-16s.
""Whether this is true or not, we will find out from them. It will be good for me to discuss this with Mr. Biden at the highest level. If so, we will go for a deal in that regard,"" he said on a flight returning from a visit to Azerbaijan.
Glasgow will host the U.N. COP26 climate summit between Oct. 31-Nov. 12. Erdogan said previously he would meet Biden at the G20 summit in Rome at the end of this month.
Turkey and its Western allies climbed down from a full-blown diplomatic crisis on Monday after foreign embassies said they abide by diplomatic conventions on non-interference, averting a threatened expulsion of 10 ambassadors.
Asked about U.S. media headlines that Erdogan had taken a step back in the row, Erdogan said: ""How did I take a step back? I'm on the offensive. There is no stepping back in my book.""
The ambassadors, including the U.S. envoy, had called on authorities last week to free Osman Kavala, a philanthropist detained for four years on charges of financing protests and involvement in an attempted coup. He denies the charges.

The Council of Europe has said it was set to begin infringement proceedings against member state Turkey at its end-November meeting if Kavala is not released in line with a European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruling.
Asked about that meeting, Erdogan said: ""We will listen and see what they say. We will listen to the ECHR and the Council. After listening we will do what is necessary.""

The developers proposed the ideas at a meeting jointly held by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the State Administration for Foreign Exchange (SAFE) on Tuesday, said the sources.
It was not immediately clear which developers raised those proposals, and what decision the regulators would settle on.
The regulators, however, told developers facing large offshore debt maturity to evaluate their repayment risks and report difficulties, the sources said, declining to be named due to sensitivity of the matter.
The development underlines the frenetic behind-the-scenes efforts by the debt-laden developers and Chinese regulators to contain the fallout centred around embattled China Evergrande Group, as worries over the liquidity crisis in the property sector mount.
""Developers were asked to report in great details about all their offshore bond repayment plans; they need to voice out if there are particular payments (for which) they're seeing some difficulties in repayment,"" one of the sources said.
NDRC said in a statement late on Tuesday that the regulators have asked the unnamed companies in the meeting to optimise their foreign debt structures and proactively prepare for repayment of both principal and interest on their foreign bonds.
They told the foreign debt issuers to use funds for approved purposes and ""jointly maintain their own reputations and the overall order of the market"".
Details of the meeting, including proposals from the developers who attended the meeting, have not been disclosed.
The meeting with the regulators took place in Beijing on Tuesday against the backdrop of developers Fantasia Holdings Group, Sinic Holdings and Modern Land defaulting on their maturing dollar bonds this month.
The liquidity crisis in China's $5 trillion property sector has been, in part, fuelled by Evergrande, which is teetering on the brink of collapse with more than $300 billion in debt and is struggling to meet payment obligations.
SAFE and NDRC did not respond to Reuters request for comment.
A total of eight developers including Kaisa Group, Shimao and Sino-Ocean Group attended the meeting on Tuesday, financial media outlet Caixin reported on Wednesday.

China Vanke, Central China Real Estate and Oceanwide Holdings were also among the attendees, the two sources, who have direct knowledge of the discussions, told Reuters. 
Vanke declined to comment. Kaisa confirmed its participation in the meeting, without further elaboration. Central China, Oceanwide, Shimao and Sino-Ocean Group did not respond to request for comment.

(Reuters) -French catering and food services group Sodexo (PA:EXHO) said on Wednesday it expects sales to accelerate in 2022 and will resume dividend payments after posting better-than-expected annual results.
The company, which operates in 56 countries, reported a 12.4% jump in annual core profit to 578 million euros ($672.68 million), on revenues edging down to 17.4 billion euros - both slightly beating forecasts.
Sodexo cited the acceleration in cornavirus vaccination programmes across its markets as the driving force of restaurant reopenings. By the fourth quarter, the group reached 87% of its annual activity in 2019, it said.
The company remains confident in its capacity to continue the recovery momentum to pre-COVID levels, and expects organic growth between 15% and 18%, as well as an operating margin of close to 5% at constant rates for its 2022 fiscal year.
A boost in growth in the United States, the accelerated deployment of the new food model based on digital solutions and the active portfolio management will help Sodexo return to regular and sustained growth, it said.
Shares in the company jumped 6.6% at 0747 GMT.
The caterer will pay a dividend of 2 euros ($2.33) for the year ended Aug. 31, including an exceptional 0.80 euro linked to the disposal programme, becoming the first leisure stock to resume dividend, Bernstein analysts said in a client note. 
The COVID-19 crisis cost Sodexo a further 2 billion euros in revenue, Chief Finance Officer Marc Rolland said during a call with analysts. 
""In China, we've recovered well. And in Brazil we've almost never lost because our sector exposure was very industrial and the factories were running in Brazil and we continued to operate throughout the pandemic,"" he said, adding the U.S. market still lags on back-to-office trend.
Sodexo launched a search in July for a new chief executive to replace Denis Machuel, and aims to fill the post before the end of 2021.

""We are past the stage of the long list,"" interim CEO Sophie Bellon said on a call with journalists.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Assa Abloy said on Wednesday material shortages and supply chain problems would continue to impact its markets, after posting third-quarter profit below market expectations.
The world's biggest lockmaker said it expected growth in Europe and the Americas to recover to normal levels ahead, while its travel-related business was recovering slowly. 
Like-for-like sales growth came in at 7%, helped by the reopening of societies in most of Assa's core markets during the quarter. However, sales in Asia Pacific declined 7% due to new lockdowns in some markets and a slowdown in China.
Assa Abloy (OTC:ASAZY)'s Global Technologies division grew like-for-like sales by 7%, driven partly by strong growth in the firm's non-travel-related segment, while negatively affected by component shortages.
Assa - whose products range from security doors and automated entrance solutions to electronic and mechanical locks under brands such as Yale - said it expected recovery in the travel-related segments and in Asia to be slower. 
""We also assume material shortages, logistic challenges and cost inflation to continue to impact our markets during the rest of the year,"" Chief Executive Nico Delvaux said in a statement.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) Chief Executive Ed Bastian said on Tuesday that travelers should be prepared for initial long lines when the United States lifts international travel restrictions for fully vaccinated travelers on Nov. 8.
""It's going to be a bit sloppy at first. I can assure you, there will be lines unfortunately ... but we'll get it sorted out,"" Bastian said at a U.S. travel event.
""We're going to have a good surge of demand but in order to keep that surge up we're going to need to make it easier and easier for people to figure out what the documentation requirements are.""
U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday signed an order https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-usa-travel-facts/factbox-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-u-s-international-air-travel-rules-idUSL1N2RM00E imposing new vaccine requirements for most foreign national air travelers and lifting severe travel restrictions on China, India and much of Europe effective Nov. 8.
Airlines will check vaccination documentation for international travelers as they currently do for COVID-19 test results.
U.S. Travel Chief Executive Roger Dow said in an interview he was concerned whether U.S. border officials would be prepared for the Nov. 8 surge.
""I think there will probably be a few hiccups,"" Dow said, saying the travel industry thinks the international travel increase ""will be much bigger than people expect.""
Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said at the travel event the department is preparing for a significant domestic and international holiday air travel increase. """"I think we're going to be equipped to handle what we hope to be a real surge in holiday traffic,"" Mayorkas said.

Last week, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) and the White House said they do not think the Biden administration's executive order mandating that federal contractors require employee vaccinations by Dec. 8 will impact holiday travel or result in employees leaving.
Some airlines and industry watchers initially feared an exodus of unvaccinated airline or government employees involved in travel just before the Christmas season but airlines later said that would not happen and cited comments from the White House last week.

The chip shortage has seen major carmakers worldwide - still recovering from coronavirus disruptions - cut or even suspend their production, eating into demand for auto parts.
The group, which makes fuel systems, bumpers and tailgates for cars, reported sales of 1.79 billion euros ($2.08 billion), down from 2.10 billion a year ago.
""We are significantly sharpening our focus on cost reduction and cash generation,"" Chief Executive Officer Laurent Favre said in a statement, citing an ""exceptionally volatile market"" due to the ongoing shortages in semiconductor chips.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Plastic Omnium's biggest customer in 2020, has so far this year produced the lowest number of cars at its main plant since 1958, a source told Reuters.
Plastic Omnium said it was in talks with suppliers to mitigate the rising costs, exacerbated by the spike in raw material prices.
It added that it had extended part of its hedges against this year's rising gas and electricity prices until the end of 2023.
The supply-chain issues have hampered the auto industry's push to recover from pandemic lockdowns and shift towards producing electric vehicles.
But Favre said the company, which supplies hydrogen fuel tanks and emissions control systems, saw sustainability as a competitive advantage and not a constraint.

Plastic Omnium confirmed its financial outlook for 2021, but warned that production in the last three months of the year would hinge on developments in semiconductor chip supplies and the strategies of auto manufacturers.

LONDON (Reuters) - TP ICAP (LON:NXGN), the world's largest inter-dealer broker, said on Wednesday it had launched a weather data-backed index that would allow financial risks tied to the pace of climate change to be traded for the first time.
Insurers and bankers already track specific, local weather events such as rainfall near coffee plantations, or hurricane risks in the Gulf of Mexico, but TP ICAP said it believed the index would be the first to track climate change globally.
While scientists have long kept an eye on the data, the creation of an index allows the market to form a view on the rate of temperature change and build financial products to hedge the risks. 
Launched in conjunction with environmental data company Speedwell, the ICAP-Speedwell Climate Index would be based on data collected from 50 independent weather stations globally, it said.
Using a dataset that is already 20 years old and which will be updated daily, TP ICAP said it expected a futures curve to be created that would allow counterparties to create financial structures with varied payoffs over specific periods of time.
""Many companies have significant and sometimes unquantified exposure to weather and climate risk,"" said Nicholas Ernst, managing director, weather markets, at TP ICAP. 

""The introduction of the index has the ability to dramatically change how people calculate the financial impact of global climate change, providing comprehensive data to quantify the impact of future temperature changes for the first time,"" Ernst said in a statement.
The launch of the index comes ahead of the next round of global climate talks in Glasgow starting Oct. 31, where governments are being urged to accelerate efforts to reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

848,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2021 02:21AM ET</span>",Australian iron ore baron bets big on global green revolution,"By Sonali Paul and Melanie Burton
MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australian iron ore magnate Andrew Forrest wants to turn his company, Fortescue Metals Group (OTC:FSUGY) Ltd, into the world's biggest green energy group, but critics say his targets are a stretch even for a man who built the world's fourth-largest iron ore producer from scratch in just over a decade.
Forrest has spent the global pandemic crisscrossing the globe, announcing a string of green energy projects from Papua New Guinea to Brazil in plans that have both intrigued and irked investors because of their grand ambition and lack of detail. 
But this month, Forrest tantalisingly laid out his most specific target yet: to produce 15 million tonnes a year of green hydrogen by 2030, which could be sold to customers in Asia as either green hydrogen or green ammonia, used for fertiliser.
Unsurprisingly for an entrepreneur who bounced back from a failed attempt to shake up global nickel production in the 1990s to build a personal fortune of over $13 billion with Fortescue, Forrest's target is 50% more ambitious than the European Union's target of 10 million tonnes a year by the same date.
Sceptics say he will face technical hurdles with high production costs, demand years away and no global carbon price, although his drive is unquestioned.
""If Fortescue says it's going to do something it will do it,"" Forrest told Reuters in an interview. 
""People say, 'Well where do you get the markets from?' I don't have to look far, I just have to get up in the morning and look in the mirror."" 
Fortescue is already readying its operations to run on hydrogen, developing fuel cell vehicles like trucks, trains and buses, and eventually aims to fuel ships and even produce ""green iron"", which could be used to make steel without burning dirty coking coal.
The key factors needed to make hydrogen competitive with fossil fuels today are a sharp drop in the costs of equipment used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, called electrolysers. For green hydrogen, the electrolysers must be powered with renewable power. 
Fortescue has given no cost estimate for achieving its target. So far it has committed to spend up to 10% of its annual profit after tax on the green push and is counting on securing funding from other investors to advance its projects.
Net profit last year was $10.3 billion with iron ore at record prices, but these have since dropped by half.
""There is a lot of fanfare around (hydrogen) as a prospect for a new source of energy but the reality is that when you delve into it technically, it's very hard and expensive to do and, it's not clear that the economics work,"" said Brenton Saunders of fund manager Pendal Group in Sydney.
The EU estimated that to reach its 2030 target, it would need investment of up to $445 billion in electrolysers and solar and wind power.
Forrest says he can achieve his target by driving down costs through automation, massive scale in manufacturing electrolysers and innovations in solar photovoltaic (PV) technology.
""If you automate, you deeply increase efficiency, you lower costs and you can employ more people to expand your operations. That has been the key to Fortescue’s success,"" he said.
RAPID SCALE-UP
Two deals Fortescue announced this month aim to achieve just that - a joint venture with U.S. hydrogen technology company  Plug Power  (NASDAQ:PLUG) and investments in private Netherlands-based firms HyET Hydrogen and HyET solar.
Fortescue Future Industries, the company's green power arm, and Plug Power plan to build the world's biggest factory to manufacture electrolysers in Queensland, aiming to start construction by March 2022 and complete it in 2023.
Plug Power CEO Andrew Marsh is undaunted by the size of the project and is banking on cost savings.
""What we found with scale is that every time we double the number of units in the field, our cost goes down by about 25%,"" Marsh told Reuters.
The bigger challenge for Forrest would be to acquire the land, water supply and renewable electricity for the plant in very tight timeframes, Marsh said.
On the solar front, Forrest is betting on HyET's Powerfoil technology, which the company's chief executive Rombout Swanborn says is light-weight, flexible and simpler to manufacture than conventional glass solar panels.
HyET and Fortescue plan to build a 1 GW solar Powerfoil PV factory in Australia at a cost of about $350 million, half the cost of a conventional plant.
While the factory is 1,000 times bigger than HyET's largest so far, Swanborn said the ""massive scale up"" was what attracted him to working with Forrest. 
They aim to drive costs down for HyET's solar PV modules to less than 10 cents per watt - or about half the cost of conventional solar panels - which Swanborn said could make them viable for large-scale green hydrogen production.

""I've seen Andrew's track record. He leads from the front, grabs a concept and runs hard with it,"" said Ric Ronge, head of investments at Adansonia Capital.
""I have absolutely no doubt he'll get a hydrogen project up and running. I don't know if it'll be a commercial success, but he'll get the support to build it.""

The world's largest chemicals maker by sales said in a statement it now expected 2021 earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), adjusted for special items, to come in at between 7.5 billion and 8 billion euros ($8.7-$9.3 billion), compared to a previous forecast for 7.0 billion to 7.5 billion euros. 
Adjusted operating earnings in the third-quarter, when a summer lull normally dampens demand in the sector, jumped to 1.87 billion euros, up from 581 million euros in the pandemic-stricken year-earlier period and beating the 1.8 billion expected on average by analysts.
A 42% surge in group revenues to 19.7 billion euros was fuelled by price increases of 36% on average.
The upswing came even as a shortage of microchips in the car sector and power cuts in China were a drag on demand.

""Growth momentum slowed compared with the previous quarter due to supply bottlenecks in many value chains of the manufacturing sector,"" the company said.
While benefiting BASF's basic chemicals units, the global material scarcities and higher procurement costs proved a burden on BASF businesses that make more sophisticated products such as farming pesticides, coatings and nutritional supplements, where margins and earnings slipped.

LONDON (Reuters) - The United Nations called on Wednesday for the world's biggest economies to ensure net zero commitments made by financial institutions were robust, backed by science and ended financing for new fossil fuel projects.
The call is the first time the UN Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) has directly given guidance to the G20 on the issue and comes days before the start of crunch climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland.
In a report for the G20 as it meets ahead of the talks, UNEP FI laid out 11 recommendations for policymakers as they consider how best to oversee the industry efforts to help cut greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century.
There are concerns some of the current pledges are too weak after a landmark report from a U.N. climate panel in August that issued a ""code red for humanity"", urging faster action from countries to curtail emissions.
""In the last two years we've just seen an incredible explosion of net-zero commitments,"" Jesica Andrews, investment lead at the UN EPFI, told Reuters.
""This is really the first time we've done a state of the art assessment and put forward really concrete recommendations on how a financial institution, specifically, sets a net-zero target that is credible.""
Against that backdrop, the UNEP FI said financial institutions needed to align with a science-based scenario or scenarios and be transparent about which ones were used.
""What is challenging is how you define that science, and that's what this paper does; it lays out how the science should be applied to make sure that commitment is credible,"" Andrews said.
""If policymakers want to get behind this and they want to see more comparability, this is what we need to be asking financial institutions to do,"" she added.
Once the scenario was set, firms needed to begin aligning lending as soon as possible to have any hope of hitting the global target of capping global warming at no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius.
""This would include, for example, the immediate cessation of any new fossil fuel investments, and rapid decommissioning of remaining fossil fuel production as indicated by the scenarios,"" the report said.

Institutions should also set, ideally, five-year targets and report annually on progress, applying appropriate pathways to net zero that incentivise their underlying companies to act.
""We have a lot of portfolio level targets, a lot of commitments to net zero at the high level, but (they are) not drawing that down to the sector level, which is what's going to make a difference in the real economy,"" Andrews said.

The pace of transition to a lower-carbon economy in many of the countries across Africa, Asia and Latin America is set to dominate the COP26 talks, with richer nations being urged to give more financial help to their poorer peers.
As more investors look to make sure their portfolios are net-zero carbon emissions by mid-century, though, the risk was that they cut off finance to the very countries that needed it, the asset manager said in a statement.
To help fix the problem, it said it had created a Net Zero Sovereign Index, an independently verified index it hoped would be used by other asset owners and managers to help guide their investment decisions and engagement with governments.
The index would cover 115 countries, including 85 in emerging markets, a much fuller coverage than existing indexes and therefore more useful to investors with broader portfolios, it said.
It also applied a fairer pathway to net zero for the emerging market countries that took into account a series of calculations including emissions and levels of economic development.

""We developed the Net Zero Sovereign Index to address the growing need among asset owners and managers for the means to show that their sovereign bond portfolios are Paris-aligned and on a credible path to net zero,"" said Peter Eerdmans, head of Fixed Income, Ninety One, which managed $180.6 billion at end-March.
""We believe the index provides greater capacity to support a fair transition for emerging markets and will help sovereign-debt investors hold governments to account for their climate policies and actions.""

853,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2021 01:17AM ET</span>",Doomed to fail? How carmakers' climate vows fall short - and who's to blame,"By Victoria Waldersee
BERLIN (Reuters) - Car and truck makers from Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) to Nissan (OTC:NSANY) and Ford have embraced the narrative that reducing carbon emissions in line with the Paris Agreement should be a key tenet of their business agenda.
Are they doing enough? Research shows their goals are still a far cry from what is needed, but the jury is out on whether automakers alone are responsible for the shortfall.
While some say carmakers should plan to make their fleets carbon-neutral whatever the circumstances, companies argue that their ability to transition to electric vehicles (EV) is dependent on conditions outside their direct control.
Consultancy firm Boston Consulting Group said in a report released last week that at least 90% of new passenger vehicles and 70% of trucks must be electric by 2030 in order to meet climate targets, echoing environmental groups like Greenpeace.
But among major auto brands, very few - among them Geely's Volvo and VW's Bentley - have set goals for 100% EV production by then, with most arguing that they cannot take full accountability for a transition to electric vehicles without the market conditions to remain profitable in the process.
German luxury carmaker Daimler (OTC:DDAIF), for example, has refrained from stating it will produce only electric vehicles by 2030 no matter what - instead it has emphasised it will be ""ready to go all electric ... where market conditions allow.""
""We will lead from the front. Is it realistic to turn 100% of the market by 2030? It would be a stretch,"" Daimler's CEO Ola Kaellenius told Reuters in an interview, adding he hoped to see countries and economic regions do their bit at the COP26 summit by synchronising their plans for electric vehicle rollouts.
Charging infrastructure is just one of many challenges standing between the auto industry, estimated by the International Energy Agency to be responsible for around 18% of all carbon emissions worldwide, and climate neutrality.
(Graphic: Transport sector CO2 emissions 2000-2030, https://graphics.reuters.com/CLIMATE-UN/AUTOS-EMISSIONS/zdpxorwwgvx/chart.png) 
Others include getting rid of dirty fossil-fuel powered cars still on the roads, reducing emissions in battery production, and building storage systems for renewable energy to ensure the electricity used to charge electric cars is from renewable sources.
TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE?
Under carbon reduction policies already agreed by governments and automakers, global CO2 emissions from vehicles are still set to rise over time, research by the International Council on Clean Transportation shows.
If policies under discussion are implemented, the growth trajectory stabilises but still does not fall, it said, highlighting growing demand for cars, buses and trucks in coming years due to population growth and increased economic activity in emerging markets.
While one in five vehicles sold in Europe last quarter were electrified, the share is much lower in the United States at around 2%. EVs are an even tinier slice of sales in less rich markets such as Latin America or Southeast Asia.
Automakers and governments must also find answers for labour unions who are worried that a rapid shift to EVs will put thousands of workers out of their jobs.
This includes German unions demanding clarity from Stellantis on its plans for Opel plants, and U.S. President Joe Biden facing pressure from the U.S. United Auto Workers' union to provide more state support during the EV transition.
""There are a lot of factors involved ... we try to project a realistic picture,"" a spokesperson for Germany's BMW said. ""But if certain conditions change fundamentally, we will of course have to re-examine our climate goals.""
CARBON EMITTER 
The majority of a vehicle's emissions do not come from the manufacturing process, but from the fuel used to power it - be it electricity, petrol, or diesel.
In the case of electric vehicles, the process of making batteries is also a significant carbon emitter, with a Volkswagen ID.3 for example generating nearly twice the emissions of a diesel equivalent in the production phase, according to company calculations.
While carmakers are increasingly investing in producing batteries in a more environmentally friendly way, controlling the source of energy flowing into electric cars is much harder. 
Automakers like VW and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are growing their offering of residential storage systems for clients to power vehicles through mechanisms like solar panels on their roofs – but the question of who is responsible for sourcing and distributing energy in public spaces is more contentious.
Even if automakers invest in public charging stations, ongoing problems with storage of renewable energy could force energy providers to rely on coal and natural gas to meet short-term demand, as recent volatility in energy markets has shown.
Lobby groups such as the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association and the U.S.-based Alliance for Automotive Innovation have urged states to invest in renewable-based charging infrastructure, from public-private investments to fully state-funded projects.
But some environmental groups argue that relying on taxpayer funds is unfair as the networks would disproportionately benefit car companies and owners, as opposed to spending on public transport.
Another lingering problem is the diesel and gas cars still driving on roads beyond 2030, which will bump up the industry's emissions well beyond the limit necessary to stay within the Paris Agreements' bounds, researchers have said.

Even if half of all new cars sold in 2035 were zero emission – which climate goals set by BMW, General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Nissan would account for – some 70% of vehicles on roads would still be burning fossil fuels, Boston Consulting has said.
""Even economies in the vanguard of the climate-change fight are therefore likely to fall short of decarbonisation targets.""

BEIJING (Reuters) - Earnings for China's power utilities during the first three quarters of 2021 have plunged as the companies were squeezed by surging coal costs that they could not pass on to consumers. 
Huadian Power International, a subsidiary of China Huadian Corp on Tuesday reported profits for the January-September period dropped 58% from a year earlier to 1.6 billion yuan ($251 million) with a third-quarter loss of 1.8 billion yuan. 
Huaneng Power International (NYSE:HNP), a listed arm of China Huaneng Group, also said their earnings in the first nine months of the year dropped 91% year-on-year to 783.9 million yuan, with a third quarter loss of 3.5 billion yuan.
Both companies blamed the losses on cost increases from a surge in power demand at the same time coal prices jumped with Huadian plainly saying in its statement, ""The decrease in net profit was mainly due to the surge in the price of thermal coal.""
Other power generators are also preparing investors for losses. 
Huadian Energy, also part of Huadian Group, forecast on Oct. 16 a net loss in the January-September period of 522.9 million yuan, versus a loss of 173.1 million yuan a year earlier. The company will report earnings on Oct. 29.
That same day, Datang International Power Generation, part of China Datang Corp, said profits over the first nine months of the year may fall by up to 100% from a year earlier to 2.67 billion yuan. Earnings will be released on Oct. 28. 
(For graphics on China utilities - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/jnpwewoyzpw/Pasted%20image%201635299429312.png) 
Chinese power generation firms remain reliant on coal for more than 50% of their electricity generation despite a years-long effort to boost renewable power projects to meet amid Beijing's climate change goals.
Chinese coal prices have gained nearly 190% this year on tight supplies as a result of stringent safety inspections and anti-corruption probes at major mining regions, and heavy rains submerging dozens of coal mines in the northern part of the country.

Huadian Power International said its operating costs in the first three quarters of the year rose by 38% year-on-year, while Huaneng Power International said costs climbed by 37% during that time.
However, the firms said that their power tariffs only increased by less than 5% in the first nine months of 2021 from a year ago, despite a surge of electricity sales.
Analysts have estimated that a majority of coal-fired power plants in China are loss-making, while the National Energy Administration since July has been warning that a number of power firms in northwestern and northeastern China were facing operational difficulties because of coal shortages.
Earlier this month, China said it will price all electricity generated by coal-fired plants through market trading mechanisms and allow firms to pass more costs to some customers.
But, analysts from CITIC estimated that the power tariff increases would be inadequate to make most coal power plants profitable based on current coal prices, even though they have fallen by 15% in the past week after the government vowed to control them.

The power tariff rise could offset coal costs by up to 179 yuan per tonne but spot prices at the port of Qinhuangdao, a major coal transportation hub, have risen by 437 yuan per tonne this year, CITIC said.

855,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2021 12:10AM ET</span>",U.S. FDA advisers back Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for children,"By Manas Mishra and Michael Erman
(Reuters) - An expert panel on Tuesday voted overwhelmingly to recommend the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorize the  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 5 to 11, saying the benefits of the shot outweigh the risks.
An authorization for that age group would be would be an important regulatory step toward reaching about 28 million children for inoculation, most of them back in school for in-person learning. 
The vaccine could be available to the younger age group as soon as next week. The FDA is not obligated to follow the advice of its outside experts, but usually does. The vote was 17 in favor with one abstention.
If the FDA authorizes the shots for this age group, an advisory panel to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will meet next week to make a recommendation on the administration of the vaccine. The CDC director will make the final call.
While children becoming seriously ill or dying from COVID-19 is relatively rare compared with adults, some develop complications, and infections in unvaccinated kids have risen due to the easily transmitted Delta variant of the coronavirus. Data from the American Academy of Pediatrics shows that more than 500 U.S. children have died from COVID-19.
It ""is the eighth highest killer of kids in this age group over the past year,"" said Dr. Amanda Cohn, a pediatric vaccine expert at the CDC and a voting member of the panel. ""Use of this vaccine will prevent deaths, will prevent ICU admissions and will prevent significant long-term adverse outcomes in children.""
Only a few other countries, including China, Cuba and the United Arab Emirates, have so far cleared COVID-19 vaccines for children in this age group and younger.
In the United States, just 57% of the population is fully vaccinated, lagging other nations such as the UK and France.
Still, the percentage of young children who receive the shots may be low. The U.S. vaccination rate for 12- to 15-year-olds trails other age groups at roughly 47%.
The World Health Organization since May has been urging rich countries to reconsider plans to vaccinate children and instead donate COVID-19 shots to the COVAX program for distribution to poorer countries.
LOWER DOSE 
Pfizer and BioNTech are seeking clearance for a lower, 10-microgram dose of the vaccine in young children, versus 30 micrograms for those age 12 and older. The shot has been authorized for ages 12-15 since May after being cleared for those age 16 and older in December.
The companies have said their vaccine showed 90.7% efficacy against the coronavirus in a clinical trial of children aged 5 to 11.
The advisers paid close attention to the rate of a heart inflammation called myocarditis that has been linked to both the Pfizer/BioNTech and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) vaccines, particularly in young men. 
If the number of myocarditis cases in the younger age group turns out to be similar to that in 12- to 15-year-olds, the hospitalizations prevented for COVID-19 would outnumber those prevented for myocarditis in most scenarios analyzed, FDA staff reviewers said in documents prepared ahead of Tuesday's meeting.
Some panel members suggested that due to the myocarditis risk, the vaccine should be given to a narrower group of children, such as those with conditions that make them more likely to be hospitalized.
""There are certain kids that should be vaccinated. The question of how broadly to use it, I think it's a substantial one,"" said Eric Rubin, Editor-in-Chief of the New England Journal of Medicine.
If authorized, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is likely to be the only one available to the age group in the United States for some time. 
On Monday, Moderna released data from its own clinical trial of children ages 6 to 11, and said it would soon ask regulators for authorization in the age group. 

It is unclear when U.S. regulators will consider that. The company is still waiting for a response to its application filed in June for use of its vaccine in children ages 12 through 17.
Pfizer has said it could have data from its clinical trial in even younger children - ages 2 to 4 - by year end.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Some airlines risk failure if they do not cut carbon emissions quicker in the next three to five years due to a mismatch between short-term corporate travel targets and the airline industry's 2050 net zero target, an industry report said.
Airlines are also at a rising risk of shareholder activism at a time when major fund managers such as BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), Vanguard Group Inc and  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT) have publicly expressed concerns about climate change, the report from CAPA Centre for Aviation and Envest Global released on Wednesday said.
""The pressure from customers and governments and investors is going to probably demand an acceleration of the journey to net zero, which is clearly going to put pressure on airlines,"" said David Wills, advisory executive director at Australian carbon reduction strategy firm Envest.
""The conditions are right for airlines who get it wrong to find themselves in a potential failure situation,"" he added.
Several companies, such as HSBC Holdings (NYSE:HSBC) plc, Zurich Insurance Group (OTC:ZFSVF) Ltd, Bain & Company and S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Inc, have already announced plans to quickly cut business travel emissions by as much as 70%.
Qantas Airways Chief Executive Alan Joyce said last week that his airline was developing a 2030 emissions target.
""Our view is that smart airlines will pivot to reinforcing not only 2050 but enhancing their definitive views on 2030, because they will be looking to engage with their corporate customers more,"" said Brett Mitsch, Envest's executive director of investment.
The CAPA/Envest report found the top quartile of 52 global airlines examined emitted an average of 30% less per passenger kilometre flown in 2019 than those in the bottom quartile. 

Low-cost carriers like Wizz Air, Ryanair and AirAsia with newer fleets and higher load factors were among the best performers, while the worst included Turkish Airlines, Japan Airlines Co Ltd (JAL) and British Airways.
The report said JAL was able to break even with a carbon price of more than $160 per tonne based on 2019 earnings, whereas many airlines with lower profit margins would have reported a loss at a carbon price of $30 per tonne.

859,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 26, 2021 09:27PM ET</span>",Australian Bond Yields Surge as Inflation Exceeds Forecasts,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s three-year bond yield advanced to the highest level since January 2020 after consumer inflation beat expectations in the September quarter. 
Yields rose as much as 14 basis points to 0.91% after trimmed mean inflation for the third quarter -- a core measure which feeds into central bank policy -- rose 2.1% versus a year ago, above economist estimates of a 1.8% rise. Headline inflation rose 3% from a year earlier, below economists’ forecasts for a 3.1% rise. 
A quickening inflation is seen bolstering bets for an earlier policy tightening by the Reserve Bank of Australia. Traders have so far priced in two quarter-point hikes by end-2022, even as the central bank doesn’t see conditions for tightening to be met by 2024. 
The latest economic indicator is also likely to revive the debate on whether inflationary pressures in the global economy are here to stay.
Australia’s bond yields have been on the rise since late September, tracking Treasuries, after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank could start scaling back its bond purchases as soon as November. 
The upward pressure on Aussie yields has also come from expectations of a growth rebound, after the nation’s state governments announced the end to long-standing lockdowns in the nation’s two-largest cities. The federal government has committed to reopen the country to international travelers. 
Inflation Casts a Longer Shadow After Week of Wild Price Spikes
The surge in yields forced the RBA back to defend its 0.1% bond-yield target Friday, for the first time in eight months, raising doubts on potential central bank tightening.

(Reuters) -Eli Lilly said on Tuesday it has started the application process for a U.S. approval of its closely watched experimental Alzheimer's drug and expects a regulatory decision by the second half of 2022, potentially setting it up against rival Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB)'s recently approved Aduhelm.
Lilly said it has started a real-time submission for its donanemab to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for accelerated approval for use in early Alzheimer's disease.
Biogen used the same regulatory pathway, which requires a study to confirm the drug works as intended against the fatal mind-wasting disease, to get approval for its treatment in June.
Lilly said that even if it secured expedited approval based on mid-stage trial data, it expected to see modest uptake of the drug until full data from an ongoing late-stage trial becomes available. The company said it expected data from the larger study by mid-2023.
The note of caution appeared to weigh on Lilly's shares, which have risen 45% this year through Monday's close largely due to optimism around its Alzheimer's treatment.
Lilly also said it had launched a head-to-head study comparing its donanemab to Biogen's Aduhelm to assess which drug was more effective in clearing brain amyloid plaque deposits, which is likely to benefit patients with Alzheimer's disease.
Lilly's shares were up 1% in choppy trading after early gains following the company's upgraded profit outlook for 2021 and a mixed third-quarter earnings report that showed a rise in sales of its COVID-19 antibody therapies, but also increased costs of developing some of its drugs denting profits.

The timeline for regulatory decision along with the company's initial expectations for its launch could be playing a role in the stock's weakness, Mizuho analyst Vamil Divan said.
Lilly raised its forecast for this year's adjusted earnings per share to between $7.95 and $8.05, from an earlier $7.80 to $8.00 range, despite missing third-quarter profit estimates.

Walmart last week recalled about 3,900 bottles of the spray, which was manufactured in India and sold at about 55 stores and on its website between February and October, after the bacteria was identified by the public health agency.
Walmart said on Tuesday it would continue assisting the agencies in their investigation.
""As part of the recall we proactively put plans in action to notify customers and prevent further product sales while federal agencies continue their investigation,"" the U.S. retailer said.
The infection, Melioidosis, is caused by a rare and sometimes fatal bacteria called Burkholderia pseudomallei, which is predominantly found in tropical climates.

(Reuters) -Robinhood Markets Inc's shares fell below their initial public offering price in after-hours trading on Tuesday after the retail broker reported softer revenue than expected for the third quarter as trading levels declined for cryptocurrencies like dogecoin.
Shares of Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) were down 8.77% at $36.10 following the release of the results, below the $38 they were priced at in the Menlo Park, California-based company's July IPO and well below the $85 they hit in August.
Robinhood, which owns the app that was at the center of January's trading mania for so-called meme stocks, said in August it expected retail investors to take a breather https://www.reuters.com/technology/robinhood-revenue-more-than-doubles-crypto-trading-boom-2021-08-18 in the third quarter. 
The slowdown in retail trading, one of the standout market trends of the COVID-19 era, comes as vaccine rollouts in the United States have helped allow the country to ease pandemic restrictions and activities like sports and other entertainment to resume.
""Looking back at Q2, we saw a huge interest in crypto, especially doge, leading to large numbers of new customers joining the platform and record revenues,"" Robinhood Chief Executive Officer Vlad Tenev said on a call with analysts.

(Reuters) -Microsoft Corp on Tuesday forecast a strong end to the calendar year thanks to its booming cloud business but said supply chain woes will continue to dog key units such as those producing its Surface laptops and Xbox gaming consoles.
The company beat Wall Street expectations for its fist quarter ended Sept. 30, with pandemic-induced demand for the software giant's cloud-based services driving sales.
Contracts for cloud services provided by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s AWS and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc-owned Google Cloud have surged since last year when the COVID-19 pandemic shut offices and schools, pushing more activity online.
First-quarter revenue growth for Azure, the company's flagship cloud-computing business, came in at 48% in constant currency to beat analysts' estimates of 47.5%, according to consensus data from Visible Alpha. Amy Hood, executive vice president and chief financial officer of Microsoft, said that the company also expected ""broad based growth"" for the unit in the fiscal second quarter.
Azure's growth rate is the best direct measure of competition with rivals such as AWS and Google Cloud as Microsoft does not break out revenue from the cloud-computing unit. 
Microsoft appeared to hold off Google Cloud's rising challenge. Google Cloud said on Tuesday https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-parent-alphabet-beats-revenue-expectations-2021-10-26 its revenue surged by 45% to $4.99 billion, but failed to live up to estimates of $5.2 billion.
Revenue at the firm's other business units that house Windows software, the Teams messaging service and LinkedIn professional social networking platform also beat analyst expectations.
The supply chain issues affecting much of the global tech industry had mixed consequences for Microsoft.
Hood said Microsoft has continued to increase its cloud computing margins despite higher data center construction costs because it keeps adding more profitable services to those data centers. Hood also said that the company was able to ship more Xbox S and X gaming consoles than it expected in the first quarter - sales of gaming consoles and accessories were up 166% as the company continued to see strong demand for new models after the pandemic forced millions to seek entertainment at home. 
But Microsoft and its rivals have been unable to keep up with demand because of the global chip crunch. Hood told Reuters the company expects Xbox demand to continue to exceed supply in the company's second quarter, which includes Christmas.
She also said that sales of the company's Surface computers, which declined 17% in the fiscal first quarter, were likely to keep sinking in the second quarter, with supply chain shortages hitting premium items in the lineup. 
Microsoft's revenue from selling Windows to PC makers grew 10% year over year, beating the overall PC market, which only grew 3.9% over the same period because of supply constraints, according to data from IDC.
Hood said that the company was able to outperform in the PC market because of its strength in selling licenses for Windows destined for corporate customers, where it gets more revenue per license and has better market share.
Overall, revenue rose 22% to $45.32 billion in the first quarter ended Sept. 30, beating expectations of about $43.97 billion.
Net income rose to $20.51 billion, or $2.71 per share. The company said its results included a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit.
On an adjusted basis it earned $2.27 per share, trumping analyst expectations of $2.07 per share.
For the fiscal second quarter, Microsoft predicted a midpoint of $18.23 billion in revenue for its intelligent cloud business for the fiscal second quarter, above estimates of $17.84 billion, according to Refinitiv data. 
First-quarter revenue from ""Intelligent Cloud"" surged 31% to $17 billion. Analysts had expected a figure of $16.58 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

Microsoft's forecast for its software app and Windows centric segments with midpoints of $15.83 billion and $16.55 billion, respectively, were also above Refinitiv estimates of $15.40 billion and $15.51 billion.
Shares of the company, which have risen nearly 40% this year, were marginally up in extended trading.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Democratic and Republican U.S. lawmakers urged President Joe Biden's administration not to sell F-16 fighter jets to Turkey and said they were confident Congress would block any such exports.
In a letter to Biden and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, 11 members of the House of Representatives cited ""a profound sense of concern"" about recent reports that Turkey may purchase 40 new  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) F-16s and 80 F-16 modernization kits.
The letter was dated Oct. 25 and reviewed by Reuters on Tuesday. 
""Following President (Tayyip) Erdogan's September announcement that Turkey will purchase an additional tranche of Russian S-400 missile defense systems, we cannot afford to compromise our national security by sending U.S.-manufactured aircraft to a treaty ally which continues to behave like an adversary,"" the lawmakers wrote.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A State Department spokesperson said the department does not comment on correspondence with Congress.
Reuters reported earlier this month https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkey-seeks-40-f-16-jets-upgrade-air-force-sources-2021-10-07 that Turkey had made a request to the United States to buy 40 Lockheed Martin-made F-16 fighter jets and nearly 80 modernization kits for its existing warplanes.
Ankara had also previously ordered more than 100 Lockheed Martin F-35s, but the United States removed Turkey from the program in 2019 after it acquired the Russian S-400s.
The letter was led by Republican Representative Nicole Malliotakis and Democratic Representative Carolyn Maloney.

""While we are confident that Congress will stand together to block any such exports should these plans progress, the United States cannot afford to transfer any advanced military equipment to the government of Turkey at this time,"" the letter said.
The partnership between the NATO allies has gone through tumult in the past five years over disagreements on Syria, Ankara's closer ties with Moscow, its naval ambitions in the Mediterranean, U.S. charges against a state-owned Turkish bank and erosion of rights and freedoms in Turkey.

868,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2021 07:22PM ET</span>",Twitter avoids revenue hit from Apple privacy changes,"By Sheila Dang
(Reuters) -  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) on Tuesday reported its quarterly revenue grew 37% and avoided the brunt of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) privacy changes on advertising that hobbled its rivals, sending its shares up 3%.
The social networking site has been working to add new features such as audio chat rooms to attract users, and also rolled out improvements to its advertising capabilities to reach its goal of doubling annual revenue by 2023.
Advertising revenue was $1.14 billion during the quarter ended Sept. 30, in line with consensus estimates.
The company said it saw a ""modest"" impact to ad revenue due to privacy changes Apple rolled out, which prevent advertisers from tracking users on their devices without their consent. 
Investors had expected Twitter would be relatively shielded from being hurt by the changes, because most of its advertisers do not rely on highly targeted ads.
As the San Francisco-based company works to expand its targeted advertising business, it is introducing more features like topics that users can follow on Twitter. Those features provide data on people's interests that can eventually be used to help deliver relevant ads, said Twitter Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal, during a conference call with analysts.
""A lot of this is opportunity that's in front of us,"" he said.
Twitter's tech peers Snap (NYSE:SNAP) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) said the Apple changes hurt their ability to target and measure digital ads, citing the updates as the reason why the companies fell short of revenue expectations.
Twitter said monetizable daily active users, its term for users who are served ads, was 211 million during the third quarter, missing analyst estimates of 212.6 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
While Twitter increased its number of users outside the United States by 5 million from the previous quarter, its U.S. base remained flat.
Total revenue, which also includes money that Twitter earns from data licensing, was $1.28 billion, also in line with Wall Street targets. 
Twitter said its costs this year from hiring and investing in a new data center will flow into next year, resulting in a mid-20% increase in total costs for 2022.
The company forecast fourth quarter revenue between $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion.

Twitter previously announced it would sell its advertising technology unit MoPub, and the deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022. 
The company said it does not expect to be able to recoup the revenue loss next year from selling MoPub, estimated between $200 million to $250 million, though it added the sale does not affect Twitter's goal of doubling annual revenue by 2023.

The European STOXX 600 index hit its highest in seven weeks, adding 0.75%.

""Even though this has been a good earnings season in aggregate, we are starting to see more companies with supply backlogs, hiring difficulties, and rising input prices that are eating into profits,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analysts wrote. 
Gold prices snapped five straight sessions of gains, shedding nearly 1% as the dollar firmed and strong earnings lowered investor appetite for the safe-haven asset.

(Reuters) -The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said on Tuesday it obtained an injunction and asset freeze against a man behind a popular Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) account that promoted the trading of penny stocks before selling them at inflated prices. 
The SEC alleges that since at least December 2019, Steven Gallagher, 50, of Maumee, Ohio, manipulated stocks by sending thousands of tweets using his handle @AlexDelarge6553 to encourage his numerous followers to buy stocks in which Gallagher had secretly amassed holdings, according to the complaint https:// ""The complaint alleges that Gallagher used his followers for his own financial gain, tweeting out false advice to pump up the price of stocks he owned, so he could sell for a profit,"" said Richard Best, director of the SEC's New York Regional Office. ""This case is a reminder that investors should be wary of taking financial advice from unverified sources on Twitter and other social media platforms."" The SEC said it has imposed a permanent injunction, disgorgement, prejudgment interest, civil penalties and a freezing of Gallagher's assets. A representative of Gallagher could not immediately be reached for comment. The U.S. Department of Justice also said in a related charge that Gallagher had been arrested for additional violations, including wire fraud and market manipulation, after he gained over 70,000 followers related to the same pump-and-dump scheme. The charge also specified that Gallagher earned over $1 million in profit. 
The SEC's charges come after the agency in February suspended trading in the securities of 15 companies because of ""questionable trading and social media activity."" The top markets watchdog has also pushed to address soaring interest by retail investors fueled by social media platforms, most notably in the January surge and subsequent plunge of  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME)'s share price.

871,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2021 06:16PM ET</span>",Alphabet earns record profit on Google ad surge,"By Paresh Dave and Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) -Google owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc on Tuesday reported higher than expected third-quarter ad sales, a sign that the business is overcoming new limits on tracking mobile users and that online shopping is as popular as ever heading into the holiday season.
Through its search engine, YouTube video service and partnerships across the Web, Google sells more internet ads than any other company. Demand for its services surged in the past year as the pandemic forced people to spend more time online, and their new habits have persisted.
Google advertising revenue rose 41% to $53.1 billion during the third quarter. Alphabet's overall sales jumped to $65.1 billion, above the average estimate of $63.3 billion among analysts tracked by Refinitiv.
""The consumer shift to digital is real and will continue even as we start seeing people return to stores,"" said Philipp Schindler, Google's chief business officer. ""The underlying takeaway is that people want more choice, they want more information, more flexibility, and we don't see this reversing.""
Shares fell 0.93% to $2,760.19 following the after-hours release of the financial results.
Quarterly profit was $18.936 billion or $27.99 per share, beating expectations of $24.08 per share and marking a third-straight quarter of record profit. Alphabet's profit is subject to wide fluctuations because accounting rules require the company to measure unrealized gains from its investments in startups as income.
Investors had braced for some sales challenges for Google.
Anxiety by consumers over how Google and other companies use their browsing behavior to profile them and then pick which ads to show has become widespread. In the latest challenge, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), whose iPhones account for half of the smartphones in the United States, gave its users more control to stop tracking over the past few months. The change led advertisers to recalibrate their spending in ways that Google rivals  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) said hurt their third-quarter sales. 
REGULATORY SCRUTINY
Alphabet's chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, reported ""modest impact"" on YouTube ad sales from Apple's efforts. But analysts said Google overall was less affected than peers because its search engine collects data on user interests that is valuable to advertisers and is unmatched in the industry. 
""They are almost completely immune to Apple's changes,"" said Collin Colburn, an analyst at tech consultancy Forrester. 
Other companies also faced slowdowns because advertisers cut spending as they struggled to staff up and keep shelves stocked amid hiring and supply-chain issues brought on by the pandemic. Schindler said supply-chain challenges affected only Google's sales of automotive ads.
Google Cloud, which trails Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) in cloud services market share, increased revenue by 45% to $4.99 billion, slightly below estimates of $5.2 billion. 
Alphabet's total costs increased 26% to $44.1 billion in the third quarter and the company's workforce size passed 150,000 employees. 
Alphabet shares have outperformed those of many big peers since the end of last year, rising about 57%. Microsoft is up 39%, Facebook 20% and Amazon 2% over the same period. 
But shares of Alphabet trade at a slight discount to Facebook, the internet's No. 2 seller of online ads. Facebook trades at 6.8 times expected revenue over the next 12 months compared with 6.4 times for Alphabet.
Facebook has been swamped with accusations in recent weeks from a former employee who leaked thousands of confidential company files to media and filed complaints with the U.S. securities regulator over alleged misrepresentations by the company about its risks from hosting inappropriate content.
Google has been caught up in some of the fallout. A YouTube policy official testified to U.S. Congress earlier on Tuesday alongside other companies about the harms of social media to young users.
Investors also await further changes to Google's businesses as a result of regulatory scrutiny. U.S. and other authorities have alleged some of the company's practices in advertising and search are anticompetitive, though the company argues they are to benefit users. In one concession to critics last week, Google said it would cut some of the fees it collects from apps on its Play app store starting next year. 

But the move could end up generating new revenue for Google if it leads companies such as music streamer  Spotify Technology  SA (NYSE:SPOT) to start selling subscriptions through their apps and giving Google 10% to 15% of the sum. 
Alphabet's Porat said on Tuesday that earlier trims to Play fees would cut in to sales.

The company, which makes analog and embedded processing chips used in everything from smart phones to cars, is facing a shortage of parts used in making chips, hampering its ability to cash in on growing demand.
Chief Financial Officer Rafael Lizardi said in a post-earnings call that the company was operating at a lower inventory level than customer target levels, especially on finished goods.
""We're at 112 days. Our target is 130 to 190 days. So clearly, we're well below where we want to be,"" Lizardi said.
Chipmakers have been cranking up production to navigate a shortage in chips that has led automakers to cut output and left electronic device makers struggling despite red-hot demand from a shift to work from home. 
The company said it expects fourth-quarter revenue in the range of $4.22 billion to $4.58 billion. The midpoint fell short of analysts' average estimate of $4.44 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

Total revenue rose 22% to $4.64 billion from $3.82 billion last year, but missed expectations of $4.66 billion.
Shares of the Dallas, Texas-based company were trading at $189.50 in extended trading.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -General Motors Co said on Tuesday it will resume limited production for two weeks at its Orion Assembly plant in Michigan, which has been shuttered since August and builds the electric vehicle Chevrolet Bolt.
The largest U.S. automaker in August widened its recall of the Bolt to more than 140,000 vehicles to replace battery modules and to address fire risks. The plant that assembles the Bolt was idled through the end of October.
GM said limited production will start Nov. 1 to help optimize battery production and supply chain repair logistics, including providing vehicles to be used as courtesy transportation for customers during recall repairs.
GM President Mark Reuss at a roundtable in Washington Tuesday that the company is addressing the recall before it will resume production of new vehicles for consumers.
GM has suspended sales of new Bolt vehicles. Reuss said GM has to certify Bolt vehicles on dealer lots before they can be sold but he did not say when those sales might begin.
GM disclosed this month its partner South Korea's LG Electronics agreed to reimburse it for the $2 billion estimated costs and expenses associated with the Bolt recall.
Reuss said Tuesday LG ""are great partners ... they stepped up in terms of commitment and problem solving.""
GM and LG said in April they would build a $2.3 billion battery factory in Spring Hill, Tennessee similar to the companies' Ultium Cells joint-venture plant in Lordstown, Ohio. The Lordstown plant is finished but production has not started, Reuss said.

GM disclosed in June it will build two additional battery cell manufacturing plants. Reuss said he expects to disclose where the plants will be located within the next six months.
""There's time but there's not a ton of time,"" Reuss said, noting that GM plans to have 30 electric vehicles by 2025.

(Reuters) - Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX)' top boss warned on Tuesday the U.S. aerospace and defense firm will lose 'several thousand' employees who refused to take COVID-19 vaccines, as it prepares to meet the Biden administration's Dec. 8 deadline for immunization.
""We will lose several thousand people,"" Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) Chief Executive Greg Hayes said in a CNBC interview on Tuesday, adding that staff hiring was underway. The company has a total of 125,000 U.S. employees.
Raytheon, the maker of Tomahawk missiles, last month said it will require all U.S. employees to be fully vaccinated, after the Biden administration mandated immunization for nearly all federal employees and contractors, to widen vaccination coverage in the country.
Many federal contractors, such as Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, 3M and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), have announced vaccination mandates since. European planemaker Airbus, which supplies helicopters to the U.S. Army, also joined the list on Tuesday. 
""We will require all employees and temporary workers of Airbus in the U.S. to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by Dec. 8,"" a company spokesperson said.
Other companies such as Gillette maker Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) Co also have mandates in place.
To be sure, not every company is facing a pushback from its employees. United Food and Commercial Workers, the union which represents 26,000 workers at  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN), said on Tuesday over 96% employees were now vaccinated.
While some other large U.S. employers such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) were yet to issue broad requirements, the Labor Department's standards will require them to introduce mandates.
Separately, Raytheon's Hayes said he expects Biden's vaccine mandate to cause ""some disruption"" in the supply chain in a post-earnings conference call.
 General Electric  (NYSE:GE), another federal contractor that has mandated vaccines, however, said it was too early to say if the decision would have an impact on the U.S. conglomerate's operations.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Chief consumer finance watchdog Rohit Chopra will tell lawmakers on Wednesday his agency wants to minimize foreclosures on struggling American homeowners and make consumer lending more competitive, according to prepared testimony from his inaugural address.
The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) will also scrutinize the efforts of technology giants or ""Big Tech"" to gain greater control over the flow of money in the economy by offering real-time consumer payments systems, and the huge amounts of data they consequently control.
And, it will sharpen its enforcement focus on companies that repeatedly violate consumer finance laws.
Chopra, a longtime consumer advocate tapped by Democratic President Joe Biden to help address inequities in lending, will outline an ambitious agenda amid the continuing economic fallout from the coronavirus in his first hearing as CFPB director before members of the House Financial Services Committee https://financialservices.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=408560 at 10:00 a.m. EDT (1400 GMT).
""In many parts of the country and in many individual neighborhoods, conditions remain fragile,"" Chopra will tell the panel, according to the testimony https://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hhrg-117-ba00-wstate-choprar-20211027.pdf. ""Many families continue to struggle to afford their mortgage and rent payments. Many small businesses are facing severe challenges to make ends meet."" 
Chopra's appearance is likely to reinvigorate the CFPB's status as a political lightning rod. Republicans have sought to handcuff the agency since its creation, calling it overpowerful and unaccountable.
Sworn in as the CFPB's full-time director earlier this month, Chopra built his name as a fierce consumer advocate at the Federal Trade Commission, and previously helped Senator Elizabeth Warren set up the CFPB after it was created in 2010.
Chopra's record as a corporate critic and experience at the agency will likely make him a potent director, say analysts.
""This hearing should serve as a reminder of both the bureau’s broad authority and Director Chopra’s capacity to effectively use the bureau’s toolbox,"" said Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research for financial firm BTIG.
Just a few weeks into the job, Chopra made his mark when the CFPB ordered https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-consumer-watchdog-orders-tech-giants-turn-over-information-payment-systems-2021-10-21 Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) to hand over information about how they gather and use consumer payment data.
His testimony said the agency will keep a close eye on practices that might impede competition by taking note of ""the obstacles small local financial institutions face when seeking to challenge dominant incumbents, including in Big Tech.""
That push for clarity is part of a growing interest among regulators and lawmakers about the rapid adoption of technology in various financial products, ranging from cryptocurrency to new ""buy now, pay later"" lending products.
Chopra's expansive agenda at the CFPB will also include revisiting https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/how-bidens-agencies-are-picking-apart-trumps-wall-street-friendly-measures-2021-04-12 several major rule easings ushered through under Republican leadership, particularly around debt collection and payday lending.

Advocates are eager to see Chopra erase industry-friendly changes ushered in under Republican leadership and impose tough new rules on the marketplace.
""We hope he will explain how he plans to supercharge the CFPB's efforts to protect consumers from credit reporting mistakes, forced arbitration, overdraft fees and predatory loans,"" said Michael Litt, a director at Washington-based U.S. PIRG, a consumer advocacy group.

Earlier this month Stellantis said it would move the assembly line of its Grugliasco plant, near Turin, to nearby Mirafiori in a bid to increase efficiency.
Production in Grugliasco will stop on Dec. 17 and be moved to Mirafiori, where it will start on Jan. 17, unions said in a joint statement.
It will be concentrated in a single line in Mirafiori for a total of five expected Maserati brand models this year.
All 1,100 workers and functions in Grugliasco will move to Mirafiori by 2024 with no overall impact on jobs in the area.
The restructuring mirrors what Stellantis announced earlier this year for Melfi, its largest plant in Italy, as production in the county is under scrutiny for costing more than elsewhere in Europe since the group was formed at the beginning of this year through the merger of Fiat Chrysler and France's PSA.
Melfi's two existing lines for Jeep and Fiat models, including hybrid ones, will be merged in a single enhanced one, without losing capacity or jobs.
Mirafiori will keep its other line, where currently produces the electric version of the 500 Fiat small car.
Unions said that, starting from January, Stellantis will double working shifts on this line, to boost production of BEV 500, one of the group's best selling EV models in Europe.

Stellantis declined to comment.
However, in a sign that tensions could rise in the future, leftist FIOM, one of Italy's major metal mechanic union, did not sign the agreement, saying Stellantis failed to present a general plan for Italy with new investments and productions to fill existing capacity.

Tight supply and heightened demand have pushed oil and natural gas prices to multi-year highs lately. And because rising oil prices increase input costs for several industries, the Producer Price Index (PPI) is increasing, which could be a significant cause of concern for the stock market.

MP Materials became a public company back in November 2020 through a reverse SPAC merger. 
Grizzly described the stock as a ""low-quality deal that will cost investors dearly."" In addition, Grizzly claimed in the report that the company can be traced back to the Chinese government despite the company selling itself as ""the largest rare earth producer in the western world.""
MP Materials responded Tuesday afternoon in a series of tweets. ""Grizzly’s “report” gets the facts & analysis wrong and displays a fundamental misunderstanding of our business, industry & performance,"" said the first tweet. 


""We take great pride in communicating clearly & transparently with stakeholders through our public filings & communications. It’s disappointing to see entities misrepresent and sensationalize aspects of our business,"" MP said in another tweet.
Grizzly said, ""We found that Shenghe, a related party that accounts for 99% of $MP revenue, and a significant shareholder, can be traced back to the Chinese central government. This has been overlooked so far and could potentially pose a national security concern,"" tweeted Grizzly.
""The idea that $MP is the only feasible competitor to Chinese producers seems like a complete charade given that its biggest client and significant shareholder is controlled by the Chinese Treasury Department,"" Grizzly later added. 








Before the short report, JPMorgan analyst Tyler Langton said he sees ""positive tailwinds"" for MP Materials ahead of its Q3 earnings report on November 4.

NEW YORK/ZURICH (Reuters) -Swiss bank UBS wants to build a digitally scalable advice model for affluent clients in the Americas with up to $2 million to invest, it said on Tuesday as it reported third-quarter earnings.
As part of its new 2025 strategic vision, which Chief Executive Ralph Hamers said would be presented in February, the bank intends to provide wealthy clients in the Americas with a ""seamless digital experience with remote human advice"", it said in presentation slides.
The world's largest wealth manager is following a trend set by U.S. rivals Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in looking to broaden their client bases beyond the super high net worth clients they traditionally serviced.
Earlier this year, Goldman launched a digital wealth management service named Marcus Invest for customers investing a minimum $1,000.
Morgan Stanley acquired E*Trade last year in a $13 billion deal executed in part to further its reach in the mass affluent sector. 
The banks are looking to earn money from a wider pool of clients as part of plans to develop more predictable revenue streams and reduce their reliance on unpredictable capital markets activities.

UBS is targeting individuals with between $250,000 and $2,000,000 to invest, a demographic that is seen by analysts as having more growth potential than high net worth people, who have more than $2 million in liquid assets.
Wealth managers have been increasingly using fintech and artificial intelligence to tap into the mass affluent demographic, which includes younger investors more comfortable investing online.

897,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2021 03:45PM ET</span>",Airbus fends off growing revolt over jet output plans,"By Tim Hepher and Mike Stone
PARIS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Airbus was forced for the second time in as many days to defend sharp increases in production, after one its engine makers said its industrial plans did not match Airbus proposals for a near-twofold increase in the output of A320 jets by 2025.
The exchange with the world's largest aerospace supplier, Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX), comes after Airbus on Monday rejected worries about overproduction from leasing companies.
Engine makers and lessors rely on the attractiveness of existing planes to support their repair revenue or rental fees, putting them naturally at odds with planemakers who make money on new jets. But the balancing act between contrasting business models has erupted into growing tensions since the pandemic.
Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) Technologies Chief Executive Greg Hayes said on Tuesday he was sceptical the market would support proposals to lift A320-family output to 75 a month by 2025 from some 40 now.
Rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co is lagging behind Airbus after a safety crisis over its 737 MAX but suppliers say it is aiming for output of 50 or more MAX a month, beyond its current target of 31.
""The question is are we really going to see a market that will support, call it 50 737s and 75 A320s on a monthly basis or 125 airplanes a month,"" Hayes told analysts.
""We'll be ready to support Airbus, our customer, if indeed it does. But I would tell you that our plans, our 5-year plans, do not anticipate getting to that kind of rate by 2024 or 2025."" 
Boeing last month predicted 14,370 deliveries in the busy A320/737 segment over the next 10 years, equivalent to a monthly total of 120 spread between the world's largest planemakers.
CUSTOMER DEMAND
Asked about Hayes' doubts over demand, Airbus Americas Chief Executive Jeff Knittel - a former leasing industry veteran - said: ""Greg and I have had some very direct discussions about that and I would respectfully disagree at this point.""
Speaking at a jet delivery, Knittel told CNBC: ""Customers are asking us to bring airplanes forward, not push them out. To accommodate customers, to ensure that we have airplanes available, in our view ramping up is an important next step. The speed of that is the question, not whether we need to ramp up.""
Raytheon Technologies owns Pratt & Whitney, one of two engine suppliers on the A320 family.
The head of one of the partners in the plane's other engine supplier,  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co, backed ""near-term"" goals at Airbus and Boeing but declined comment on discussions being held behind closed doors on Airbus' long-term plans.
GE co-owns engine maker CFM with France's  Safran  (PA:SAF).
In May, Airbus announced a firm target of increasing A320-family production to 64 a month by second-quarter 2023 and asked suppliers to enable a ""scenario"" of 70 by first-quarter 2024. It also said it was investigating rates as high as 75 by 2025.
On Monday, Airbus pushed back against criticism from leasing companies about the output plans.
""The key to all this is that we have these firm contracts
with our client - we cannot say that we are not going to
respect those contracts because we think they are too many for

the business,"" said its Latin America head, Arturo Barreira..
Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury is expected to face questions from investors over the rift when the company releases earnings on Thursday. Airbus has said it is confident of a rebound, but people close to the company stress it has not decided on monthly A320 family production rates above 64.

898,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2021 03:36PM ET</span>",UK to slash bond issuance by around 34 billion pounds,"LONDON (Reuters) - Helped by a faster-than-expected economic recovery and borrowing that has undershot forecasts, Britain's government will slash its planned bond sales for the current financial year, a Reuters poll of primary dealers showed ahead of Wednesday's budget.
The median forecast from 12 primary dealers showed the Debt Management Office will plan to sell 218.8 billion pounds ($300.89 billion) of gilts in 2021/22, a 33.8 billion-pound reduction from its existing remit.
Primary dealers, known in Britain as gilt-edged market makers, are banks hired by the government to help create a liquid market for its debt.
The government has already sold 153.1 billion pounds of bonds in the current financial year, which began in April. 
It sold a record 485.8 billion pounds of gilts in the 2020/21 financial year to fund the economic response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The rebound in the world's fifth-biggest economy means borrowing this financial year is likely to be around 40 billion pounds ($55 billion) below official forecasts.
After hitting its highest since World War Two, at 15% of gross domestic product, in the year to March, the budget deficit in the current year looks to come in far lower than originally forecast. 
The poll showed government borrowing for 2021/22 looks set to come in at around 190 billion pounds - far less than the 233.9 billion pounds forecast in March by the Office for Budget Responsibility and compared with 247 billion in the 2020/21 financial year.

Investing.com — Citi started coverage of crypto exchange  Coinbase Global  Inc (NASDAQ:COIN) with a buy rating on Tuesday and a $415 price target. 
Despite the positive review, Coinbase shares are down 1.45% at $320.82 in afternoon trading.
In a research note, Citi  analyst Peter Christiansen told investors that the stock offers investors direct exposure to increased retail and institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies.
""For its position within the crypto value chain, a `networking-based' business model and strategy, the undeniably very large opportunity set … yes, we believe COIN is investable,"" said Christiansen.
Christiansen added that the stock is in place to make ""higher highs and higher lows"" as cryptocurrency adoption spreads.
The analyst said he also sees Coinbase benefitting from its expansion into other areas, such as its NFT marketplace and cold wallet storage. 
Regarding regulation, Citi said,"" To a degree, we think rising regulations could be a positive for Coinbase's competitive positioning, particularly versus business models that predominantly rely on markets being unregulated."" 
Elsewhere, Piper Sandler is also bullish on Coinbase stock, with analyst Richard Repetto raising the company's price target to $360 from $335, maintaining its overweight rating. Repetto pointed to Bakkt's deal with Mastercard as an example of ""greater mainstream adoption"" of cryptocurrencies.

However, elevated oil prices are a major headwind against the industry’s revival. Nevertheless, irrespective of high oil prices, we think fundamentally sound airlines stocks Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), United Airlines (UAL), and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) could be solid bets now. Read on.The airline industry was among the worst-hit industries during the COVID-19 pandemic, with lockdowns and travel restrictions imposed last year. However, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) expects the worst part of COVID-19’s effects on the airlines to be over and that total industry losses to fall considerably in 2022. Furthermore, IATA expects passenger numbers to increase to 3.4 billion in the coming year, almost hitting 2014 levels.
However, the key barrier to the industry’s recovery is the rallying oil prices, as fuel prices negatively correlate with the profitability of airline operators. Oil prices hit multi-year highs on October 25, with U.S West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures reaching their highest level since October 2014, while Brent hit its three-year high. Fuel costs constitute 19% of total expenditure for airlines worldwide in 2021.
Though oil prices remain elevated, we think Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV), Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL), United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL), and  American Airlines Group  Inc. (AAL) could deliver solid returns considering their fundamental strength and the expected increase in travel ahead of the holiday season.

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) on Tuesday revved up the drive to expand its Corvette sports car brand globally, with a roar from a 670-horsepower, eight-cylinder combustion motor, challenging the likes of  Ferrari NV  (NYSE:RACE), Porsche and McLaren.
The latest Chevrolet Corvette Z06, a high-performance, racetrack-ready version of the Detroit automaker's sports car, is leading the marque's growth outside the United States, company officials told Reuters.
Corvettes will now come with steering wheels on the right side, for drivers in the United Kingdom, Europe, Australia and Japan.
""There's a lot of upside,"" said Corvette Executive Chief Engineer Tadge Juechter.
The Bowling Green, Kentucky, factory that assembles Corvettes can build more than 40,000 cars a year, but has been hampered by the pandemic and supply chain disruptions, said Steve Majoros, vice president for marketing at GM's Chevrolet division which makes the Corvette.
GM said it sold 23,858 Corvettes worldwide in 2020, and 27,376 in the first nine months of 2021. U.S. customers bought more than 24,000 new Corvettes this year.
The latest-generation Corvette has transformed into a mid-engined sports car that looks and runs more like a Ferrari supercar.
But while Ferrari has introduced gasoline-electric hybrid and turbocharged engines, the 2023 Corvette Z06 is designed for fans of an earlier era's cars, wrapped in a modern skin. It features a hand-built, 5.5 liter V-8 engine capable of roaring at 8,600 revolutions per minute without using a turbocharger or a battery-booster.
GM has not disclosed pricing for the latest Z06, which will go into production next summer. The current Corvette starts at just under $61,000, and past Z06 models have been priced about $25,000 above the least expensive model.
Like other car makers, GM is working on the challenges of engineering fully battery electric supercars https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-mclaren-electric-focus-idINKBN2AG0IC - an imperative as regulators in major markets propose banning sales of petroleum-fueled vehicles as soon as 2030.

Battery packs and motors capable of propelling a vehicle to racetrack speeds are heavy and do not deliver much range.
""We'll be slower to the party,"" said Juechter. ""We won't do it until the battery technology is ready.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Luckin Coffee  (OTC:LKNCY) Inc reached a $175 million settlement of shareholder class-action claims that the Chinese rival to Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) fraudulently inflated its share price by falsifying revenue.
Lawyers for the shareholders called the all-cash settlement, filed on Monday night, an ""excellent result,"" citing Luckin's liquidation proceeding in the Cayman Islands and its related filing for protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
The accord also covers Luckin officials, and underwriters of the Xiamen, China-based company's $645 million initial public offering in 2019 and a later offering of American depositary shares.
U.S. District Judge John Cronan in Manhattan approved the preliminary settlement on Tuesday, and scheduled a Jan. 31, 2022 hearing to consider final approval. The settlement also requires approval by a Cayman Islands court.
Luckin denied wrongdoing. Its U.S.-based lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Founded in 2017, Luckin ended March with about 5,000 stores.
Shareholders sued Luckin in February 2020, two weeks after short-seller Muddy Waters (NYSE:WAT) Research accused it of inflating revenue.
Two months later, Luckin's share price sank 81% after the company said an internal probe found that its chief operating officer and other staff fabricated about $310 million of sales in 2019, or about 40% of annual sales projected by analysts.
Luckin agreed last December to pay a $180 million fine to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accounting fraud civil charges.
The SEC said Luckin raised more than $864 million from equity and debt investors while the fraud was taking place.

Shareholders in the class action are led by Swedish pension fund Sjunde AP-Fonden and the Louisiana Sheriffs' Pension & Relief Fund.
Their lawyers, led by Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check and Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann, may seek fees of up to 25% of the settlement fund.

Controlled by U.S. investment fund Elliott, the seven-time European champions reported a loss of 96.4 million euros ($112.2 million) for the year-ending June 30, compared with a record 194.6 million loss the previous year.
""Positive sports performance in the domestic league and participation in UEFA Europa League lifted audiovisual rights income by some 75 million euros,"" the club said in a statement after its annual shareholder meeting. Its TV rights revenue totalled 63.4 million euro the year before.
The club estimated that COVID-19 reduced 2020-2021 earnings by 55 million euros, including the loss of ticket sales due to closed-door matches to stem contagion. Total revenue rose by 36% to 261.1 million euros.
After playing in the UEFA Europa League last season, AC Milan qualified for the Champions League for the first time since 2013-2014 as it finished second in Italy's top flight soccer league. The Rossoneri, as the team is nicknamed, are now on the top of Serie A standings after nine matches. 
""If we manage to qualify for Champions League, and this is our goal, it's not unthinkable zeroing our losses within next two years,"" club chairman Paolo Scaroni told journalists during an online press briefing.
AC Milan and city rival Inter Milan have resumed talks with local authorities over long-standing plans for a new stadium to replace the nearly century-old San Siro. The proposal, partly delayed by the pandemic, is seen as crucial to compete with top European rivals which own stadiums.
To speed up the negotiations, the clubs are now suggesting to focus discussions on the stadium as they are reviewing a wider real estate project for the district surrounding the arena.

""Let's start with the stadium, and then we can talk about the real estate plan,"" Scaroni said.

(Reuters) - Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc (NYSE:TMO)'s third-quarter profit is likely to get a boost from a rebound in COVID-19 testing due to the highly contagious Delta variant and sustained demand for vaccines against the coronavirus, Wall Street analysts said.
In July, when cases eased in the United States, the company cut its annual sales forecast for COVID-19 tests by $900 million. But the demand has again picked up pace in recent months amid a surge in Delta-led infections.
The world's largest maker of scientific instruments, which also supplies raw materials for COVID-19 vaccines and therapies, may see some benefit from the United States authorizing booster doses for some age-groups. 
However, Thermo Fisher is unlikely to lift its testing forecast, according to Atlantic Equities analyst James Mainwaring, as it shifts its focus to its core business of making scientific instruments used in pharmaceutical and academic research.
The business took a hit last year as the pandemic disrupted research activities, but showed a strong recovery in the second quarter.
THE CONTEXT
** Thermo Fisher's COVID-19 response revenue, which consists of supply for vaccines and therapies as well as testing kits, helped cushion the hit to its mainstay business from COVID-19 curbs and beat profit expectations for the past few quarters. 
** Demand for test kits from employers in the United States have surged in the past few months and has even resulted in a supply crunch as the U.S. government mandated big employers to inoculate their workers and test them every week. 
** Last week, rival  Abbott Laboratories  (NYSE:ABT) raised its 2021 profit forecast due to the recent uptick in testing demand. However, Quest Diagnostics (NYSE:DGX) warned of a slowdown in demand through the rest of the year as infections decline.
THE FUNDAMENTALS
** Thermo Fisher is expected to report third-quarter revenue of $8.39 billion on Oct. 27, according to the mean estimate from 15 analysts, based on Refinitiv data 
** Thermo Fisher reported overall second-quarter sales of $9.27 billion.

Investing.com — Medical device maker  Inspira Technologies Oxy BHN  Ltd (NASDAQ:IINN) announced Tuesday that it has signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Anita Técnica S.L. (WAAS Group).
WAAS Group is a distributor and technical service provider of medical equipment and supplies in Spain.
The news sent Inspira shares flying over 200%, to $7.50 -- an all time high for the stock since its initial public offering in July.
The agreement has an initial seven-year term and will see the companies collaborate on the marketing and deployment of the ART device, a respiratory support system designed to treat deteriorating respiratory failure patients while they are awake and breathing. 
Inspira said the device has the potential to reduce the need for mechanical ventilation across Spain and Portugal.
As part of the deal, WAAS Group is committed to purchasing a minimum of 1040 ART devices and 35,360 disposable units within seven years.

ROME (Reuters) -Italy plans to negotiate with the European Commission a ""long extension"" of the deadline to cut Rome's 64% stake in ailing bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS), a source close to the matter told Reuters.
The extension to be requested by the Treasury to Brussels will amount to ""years,"" the source said, without elaborating.
The development comes after talks with Italy's No.2 bank UniCredit over a potential merger deal with the Tuscan lender collapsed on Sunday.
Rome believes the European Commission has no interest in putting Italy in a difficult negotiating position, the source added, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.
Under the terms of a state bailout agreed with Brussels in 2017 at a cost of 5.4 billion euros ($6.28 billion), the Treasury was due to cut its 64% stake in MPS no later than the approval of its 2021 results, meaning mid-2022 at the latest.
After deeming UniCredit's 6.3 billion euro capital demand too high a price to pay to offload MPS, Italy's Treasury now needs to address the bank's capital requirements which MPS has put at 2.5 billion euros.
A cash injection is now likely to exceed that figure, two sources close to the matter told Reuters on Monday. One of the sources said it could total 3.5 billion - or 3.5 times the bank's current market value.
Italy has so far set aside 1.5 billion euros to recapitalise Monte Paschi. Developments on this could come in Rome's 2022 budget expected to be unveiled by Prime Minister Mario Draghi's government this week.
The capital increase would take place as a market transaction to avoid any 'burden sharing' with junior bondholders. These investors must bear losses under EU rules if cash calls are classed as state aid.
Private investors contributed 2.8 billion euros to MPS' 2017 rescue through a debt-to-equity swap.
Italy also plans to implement some of the measures it had offered to UniCredit as part of a new stand-alone plan for MPS.

The bank's residual problem debts, worth around 4 billion euros, will go to state-owned bad loan manager AMCO, while state agency Fintenca is expected to take on up to 5 billion euros in legal claims stemming from MPS' pending lawsuits.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Jessica Rosenworcel, a champion of broadband access for low-income American households, is President Joe Biden's choice for permanent chair of the Federal Communications Commission, the White House confirmed on Tuesday.
A Democrat who already serves as acting FCC chairwoman under Biden, she is expected to win U.S. Senate approval for a new term on the five-member telecoms regulator. Biden announced he intends to nominate her for a new term and a White House official said Biden will tap her to become the first woman to serve as permanent FCC chief. 
Biden has waited more than nine months to make nominations for the FCC, which has not been able to address some issues because it currently has one vacancy and is divided 2-2 between Democrats and Republicans.
For the open seat, the White House confirmed to nominate Gigi Sohn, a former senior aide to Tom Wheeler, who served as an FCC chairman under President Barack Obama, a Democrat.
Rosenworcel has overseen the FCC's temporary $3.2 billion broadband subsidy program created by Congress in December that provides discounts on monthly internet service and on the purchase of laptops or tablet computers to more than 6 million lower-income American households or people afflicted by COVID-19.
She has said the lack of broadband access leads to a “homework gap” for lower-income Americans because most teachers assign homework that requires internet access.
The White House also confirmed Biden will nominate Alan Davidson, a senior adviser at Mozilla, as director of the Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration, the executive branch agency principally responsible for advising the White House on telecommunications and information policy issues. NTIA is also expected to oversee tens of billions of dollars in funding from Congress to expand internet access.
Last month, a group of 25 U.S. senators wrote to Biden in support of Rosenworcel, a former Senate staffer, for a new term and the chair role. They wrote ""further delays will unnecessarily imperil our shared goal of achieving ubiquitous broadband connectivity.""
Rosenworcel and her staff did not respond late on Monday to requests for comment on the announcement expected as soon as Tuesday. Without being confirmed to a new term, Rosenworcel would need to leave the FCC at the end of the year.
She has said the FCC decision under then-Republican President Donald Trump in 2017 to overturn net neutrality rules had put the FCC ""on the wrong side of history, the wrong side of the law, and the wrong side of the American public.""

The FCC under Obama, Trump's predecessor, adopted the net neutrality rules in 2015 barring internet service providers from blocking or throttling traffic, or offering paid fast lanes.
Supporters of net neutrality say the protections ensure a free and open internet. Broadband and telecoms trade groups contend their legal basis from the pre-internet era was outdated and would discourage investment.

As such, we think it could be wise to bet on fundamentally sound tech stocks  Analog Devices  (NASDAQ:ADI), VMware (NYSE:VMW), and Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS). So, let’s evaluate these names closely.Even though investors rotated out of expensive tech stocks last month and earlier this month, the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained yesterday driven by stellar third-quarter earnings reports. According to a Factset report, more S&P 500 companies are exceeding EPS estimates for the third quarter than on average and beating EPS estimates by a wider margin than on average.
Furthermore, the tech industry is expected to grow in the near future due to the increasing applications of smart technology solutions across several industries. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said, “We continue to believe this pressure on the tech sector is short-lived with our belief that tech stocks will be up 10% into year-end as the tech growth stories are being massively underestimated by the Street with 3Q earnings a major positive catalyst for the tech sector.”
Against this backdrop, we think the shares of quality tech companies Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI), VMware Inc. (VMW), and  Synopsys Inc . (SNPS) could be solid additions to one’s portfolio.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Lockheed Martin Corp dramatically lowered its sales expectations for this year and next on Tuesday as the COVID-19 pandemic severely hobbled the top U.S. defense contractor's supply chain, sending its shares down 12%. 
The pandemic has crippled many companies' ability to send and receive the parts and supplies they need to produce a wide range of products, creating shortages, reducing inventories and hammering profits.
Lockheed's chief financial officer said the problem worsened for them over the last two months, as the maker of the F-35 fighter jet lowered its 2021 revenue expectations by 2.5% to $67 billion and said next year's revenue could fall to $66 billion.
Lockheed's poor outlook, just 66 days from year-end, came after it reassessed its five-year business plan ""given recent external and programmatic events,"" Chief Executive Jim Taiclet said in the earnings report that dashed hopes the United States' largest arms maker could muscle its way through the pandemic. 
Shares of defense stocks fell after the report, with the Dow Jones U.S. Defense index down nearly 6% at midday.
The defense company's CFO said on a call with analysts that its suppliers ""are still dealing with the financial stress caused by the global pandemic."" 
A company executive noted suppliers that serve the commercial market as well as the defense market were struggling the most. The combination of fixed costs and falling revenue - the aviation industry in particular has struggled during COVID-19 with the huge drop in travel - hurt the suppliers that serve both markets. 
""Management laid out a meaningfully lower growth profile than previously indicated, and growth is a key metric in defense right now,"" Seth Seifman, a JP Morgan analyst said in a research note, adding, ""the potential silver lining the market may ultimately begin looking for here is that today's hit to the outlook is drastic enough to set up potential beats going forward.""
On the call with analysts, Taiclet said the company's sales would go up again in 2023 and increase steadily through 2026.
He also said Lockheed now sees its planned purchase of rocket maker Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings (NYSE:AJRD) Inc closing in the first quarter of 2022, a bit later than previously expected. 
Support for the defense industry could be on the way as congressional committees are set to start their conference on the Biden administration's 2022 defense policy bill that outlines increased spending.
Lockheed raised its earnings-per-share guidance for 2021 to $22.45, more than analyst estimates of $22.19, as operating profits rose 6.6% versus the same period last year.
The third quarter which ended on Sept. 26 showed sales at Lockheed's largest unit, aeronautics - which makes the F-35 fighter jet - down 2% from a year earlier, when the pandemic locked down many parts of the defense industry's supply chain.
Through Sept. 26, the unit made 90 F-35 deliveries, with 36 occurring in the third quarter. Lockheed aims to deliver 133 to 139 of the stealthy jets this year. 

In 2022, Lockheed plans to deliver 151 to 153 of the fighter aircraft.
Lockheed's third-quarter revenue was $16 billion, 6.6% below analyst revenue estimate of $17.1 billion, Refinitiv data showed.

Investing.com — Shares of measurement technology developer and creator  My Size Inc  (NASDAQ:MYSZ) have rallied Tuesday after the company said it's been awarded a contract from Dockers (Turkey).
The shares climbed to a high of $2.97 on the news. It has since lost some of the initial gains but is still trading well above the $2 mark, up around 86% from Monday's close.  
Dockers (Turkey) is an American brand of garments and other accessories from  Levi Strauss & Co  (NYSE:LEVI).
MySize has been working with Levi's Turkey for around a year, which has prompted the decision from Dockers to integrate MySize's proprietary AI-driven sizing technology. 
The company said the integration of the MySizeID widget has reduced return rates. Ronen Luzon, CEO of MySize, said, ""Our successful integration and results with Levi's Turkey has led us to this additional opportunity. We believe our land and expand strategy of initially working with a part of a larger company and then being able to penetrate additional brands and geographies within that company will enable us to accelerate our revenue growth in a much quicker timeframe."" "

919,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2021 12:27PM ET</span>",Amazon's Staten Island warehouse workers file petition for union election,"By Jeffrey Dastin and Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) -Workers at an Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) warehouse in New York City's Staten Island borough have filed a petition to form a union, the U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) said on Monday, though the company questioned whether enough legitimate signatures were gathered.
The move represents the second time that U.S. staffers for the world's biggest online retailer have aimed to unionize this year, following a failed effort https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-union-idTRNIKBN2BW1HQ at an Alabama facility in April. Though Amazon has long resisted such efforts, some employees are advocating for more protections and benefits in light of a COVID-19 pandemic that put their safety at risk.
Chris Smalls, a former employee at the Staten Island warehouse, led the organizing drive and collected around 2,000 signatures to request an official vote through the NLRB. Smalls rose to prominence last year when Amazon fired him, alleging he violated a paid pandemic-related quarantine when he showed up at his facility to protest work conditions.
""This is monumental for the workers,"" Smalls said in an interview. ""This is proof that you can stand up, fight back and organize your workplace.""
The NLRB confirmed that the union petition was filed electronically with the board.
Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said, ""We're skeptical that a sufficient number of legitimate employee signatures has been secured to warrant an election. If there is an election, we want the voice of our employees to be heard and look forward to it. Our focus remains on listening directly to our employees and continuously improving on their behalf.""
For the past six months, some staff at the Staten Island warehouse, called ""JFK8,"" and other nearby facilities have been organizing to form what they call the Amazon Labor Union (ALU). Smalls said he set up a tent outside the warehouse, while some current workers championed the same cause on the inside.
These workers are demanding higher wages, job security, safer conditions, better medical leave and more paid time off. According to Smalls, Amazon has put out anti-union literature, and his group has responded with their own literature.
The organizing drive is being held at Amazon's only New York City fulfillment center, one of the company's large warehouses from which it ships many goods.
It is not clear when an election would be held if regulators green light the petition.

Amazon handily beat back an effort by the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) to organize its Bessemer, Alabama, warehouse.
Workers rejected joining the RWDSU by a more than two-to-one margin this spring, but another vote could be held as the NLRB reviews union claims that Amazon violated labor laws during that election.

Investing.com – Intel stock (NASDAQ:INTC) fell 2.5% Tuesday as BMO Capital downgraded it to market perform with a target of $52.
The stock is over 13% lower than analyst Ambrish Srivastava’s previous target of $60 and around 8% higher than the current price of $48.2.
According to the analyst, the chipmaker’s earnings may take long to recover. Nor is the sales growth likely to compound in double digits, the analyst believes.
Intel’s third-quarter revenue fell short of its own guidance and the chipmaker predicted lower margins in the years ahead. The company said last week gross profit margins are likely to be between 51% and 53% over the next two to three years. It sees adjusted gross margins of 53.5% in the ongoing quarter, lower sequentially as well as year-on-year basis.
Intel forecast at least $74 billion in revenue in 2022 while also spending big — capital expenditure could hit $28 billion next year and rise subsequently. The company is spending $20 billion on setting up two new chip plants in Arizona under CEO Pat Gelsinger’s plans.
It guided to higher capital spending over two to three years, which is likely to keep free cash flow and margins depressed.
The analyst said Intel has the capacity to take on more debt and that he is not suggesting dividend payout by the company being at risk. But at the same time, the company may have to tap the markets to fund both its aggressive capital expansion plans while also paying dividend, the analyst wrote.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Jet engine maker  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co is aligned with ""near-term"" plans of both Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA) to ramp up production, its Chief Executive Larry Culp said on Tuesday.
Culp, however, declined to comment on Airbus' plan to go beyond an immediate ramp-up and almost double production of its best-selling A320 jets by 2025. This plan has drawn criticism from engine makers and aircraft leasing companies about the risk of overproduction during a fragile airline industry recovery from the pandemic.
""We will talk about those conversations with them directly behind closed doors,"" Culp told Reuters in an interview. ""There is no need to have that conversation publicly at this time.""
In May, Airbus announced a firm target of increasing A320-family production from 40 planes a month to 64 by the second quarter of 2023 and said it was asking suppliers to enable a ""scenario"" of 70 a month by the first quarter of 2024. The planemaker also said it was investigating rates as high as 75 by 2025.
Industry sources say suppliers have agreed to support the firm goal of 64 a month but have yet to reach agreement on supporting the higher rates, fearing that demand would fail to meet expectations.

Earlier, Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Chief Executive Greg Hayes said he was skeptical whether the market would support Airbus rates as high as 75 a month. 
Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) Technologies owns Pratt & Whitney which competes with GE-Safran venture CFM to supply jet engines for the best-selling Airbus A320 family.

This means the S&P 500 (SPY) has been ""melting up"" for 9 trading sessions for a more than 5% gain.

Investors just need to look for stocks that have an overall grade of A or B. But, you can go a step further, and only invest in A or B stocks in industries rated an A or B. That's why investors should consider  Gartner , Inc. (NYSE:IT), Signet Jewelers (NYSE:SIG), and CRA International, Inc. (CRAI), which are three such stocks.The S&P 500 may be up 6% for the month, but that doesn't mean stocks will continue rising through the end of the year. There are still a host of concerns that investors are grappling with, including inflation, labor shortages, and supply constraints. Since there could be some more volatility ahead, it's best to consider stocks that have a stronger chance to outperform in the months ahead.
As you may know, our POWR Ratings system was designed to find the stocks that have the best potential for outperformance. The system weighs 118 different factors for every stock. These factors help contribute to a stock's likelihood of outperformance. Stocks that have an overall grade of A or B are likely to outperform. But we can take it up a notch. The POWR Ratings also include six Component Grades and an Industry Grade. 
Our research found that picking top-rated stocks in top-rated industries increases the potential for outperformance. Our analysis shows that stocks in an A or B-rated industry, on average, are more likely to outperform. So, I ran a screen for stocks with an overall grade of A in an A-rated industry. This resulted in stocks such as Gartner, Inc. (IT), Signet Jewelers (SIG), and CRA International, Inc. (CRAI).

The industry tailwinds have favored  Kinder Morgan 's (NYSE:KMI) financial performance in the latest quarter. However, we think KMI’s near-term prospects look uncertain given the continued spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant, which could hinder future energy demand. Let’s discuss.Operating as one of the largest energy infrastructure companies in North America, Kinder Morgan (KMI), in Houston, Tex., transports natural gas, gasoline, crude oil, carbon dioxide (CO2), and more through its pipelines. The company’s terminals store and handle petroleum products, chemicals, and other products. KMI holds interest in or operates approximately 83,000 miles of pipelines and 144 terminals.
The stock has gained 46.4% in price over the past year and 35.7% year-to-date to close its last trading session at $17.85. Furthermore, KMI is trading above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. This can be attributed to optimism surrounding the oil and gas industry as the energy prices reach record highs amid rebounding fuel demand.
Rebounding fuel demand has boosted the pipeline operator's volumes significantly. KMI’s gasoline volumes jumped 9%, while its jet fuel volumes surged 56% for the third quarter. In addition, increasing liquefied natural gas exports mainly to Europe and Asia with the nearing winter heating season has increased its gas pipeline volumes. ""We continue to benefit from growing global natural gas demand. Our assets are well-positioned to serve growing domestic markets and export locations for LNG and Mexico,"" said Chief Executive Officer Steve Kean. KMI also reported better-than-expected revenue growth for the quarter.

LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - A top U.S. bank regulator said U.S. officials are looking to provide a clearer path for banks and their clients that are looking to hold cryptocurrencies, in order to keep control over the fast-developing asset.
Jelena McWilliams, who chairs the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, told Reuters in an interview on Monday that a team of U.S. bank regulators is trying to provide a roadmap for banks to engage with crypto assets.
That could include clearer rules over holding cryptocurrency in custody to facilitate client trading, using them as collateral for loans, or even holding them on their balance sheets like more traditional assets.
""I think that we need to allow banks in this space, while appropriately managing and mitigating risk,"" she said in an interview on the sidelines of a fintech conference.
""If we don't bring this activity inside the banks, it is going to develop outside of the banks. ... The federal regulators won't be able to regulate it.""
McWilliams' comments provide the fullest picture yet of what regulators are exploring as part of a cryptocurrency ""sprint"" team first announced https://www.reuters.com/technology/fed-occ-fdic-sprint-regulation-crypto-quarles-says-2021-05-25 in May. The goal of the team was to ensure cryptocurrency policy coordination among the three main U.S. bank regulators - FDIC, Federal Reserve and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
The rapid emergence of cryptocurrency has led to a murky regulatory picture in the United States. Under previous leadership, the OCC took an aggressive approach to bringing cryptocurrency into banks, including blessing https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-banks-cryptocurrency/u-s-banks-given-regulatory-green-light-to-safekeep-cryptocurrencies-idUSKCN24N2HI bank custody services for cryptocurrency, while other agencies were slower to act.
Those decisions are now under review, according to acting Comptroller Michael Hsu.
Some banks have already begun dabbling in these areas without regulatory clarity. Earlier this month, U.S. Bancorp announced it was launching https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-bancorp-launches-cryptocurrency-custody-service-investment-managers-2021-10-05 a cryptocurrency custody service for institutional investment managers.
But comments from McWilliams, a Republican holdover from the Trump administration, suggests regulators are still seeking a way to incorporate cryptocurrency into traditional bank oversight.
""My goal in this interagency group is to basically provide a path for banks to be able to act as a custodian of these assets, use crypto assets, digital assets as some form of collateral,"" McWilliams said on a conference panel.
""At some point in time, we're going to tackle how and under what circumstances banks can hold them on their balance sheet.""
McWilliams acknowledged the challenges.

The easiest issue would be getting regulators to lay out a roadmap for providing custody to crypto assets, she said. However, it is difficult to figure out how to allow the volatile asset as collateral and include it on bank balance sheets, she added.
""The issue there is ... valuation of these assets and the fluctuation in their value that can be almost on a daily basis,"" McWilliams said. ""You have to decide what kind of capital and liquidity treatment to allocate to such balance sheet holdings.""

MILAN (Reuters) - Italy's Campari plans bigger than usual increases in drinks prices next year to offset surging costs for logistics and raw materials including glass, alcohol and sugar, its top executive said.
On Tuesday the maker of Aperol and Campari bitters reported a 12.8% yearly rise in like-for-like sales in the July-September period as consumers went back to drinking and dining out and splurged on aperitifs.
Adjusted operating profit, or earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), came in at 137 million euros ($159.4 million), up 16% on the same period of last year when excluding foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures.
The group's best-selling aperitif Aperol, which is the key ingredient for the Aperol Spritz cocktail, posted a 15.5% rise in third-quarter sales. 
The group, however, flagged risks coming from rising costs and alerted investors about potential bottlenecks slowing down spirits shipments towards the United States and Asia.
""We normally raise prices every year... in 2022 we plan to have more robust increases than usual, given higher costs on all raw materials,"" said Campari CEO Bob Kunze-Concewitz in a phone interview with Reuters after Q3 results. 
Shares in the Milan-based group turned negative after results and were down more than 4% at 1450 GMT as investors took profit on the stock after it had briefly touched an all-time-high of 13.10 euros.
Campari will raise prices in all its main markets, including the United States, Kunze-Concewitz said, adding that speciality beverages such as Aperol and Campari could see higher increases than drinks that are more exposed to competition, such as vodka.
""We have increased tequila prices twice in 18 months, and we will have to do it again in 2022,"" he said.
During a conference call on results Campari's top executives said the group expected costs of materials, production and logistic expenses to increase by 5% at constant volumes.
Other companies around the world have warned investors and consumers about rising costs and workers and raw materials shortages. [L1N2RH0LQ]
Campari said it was also busy working to reduce the impact of bottlenecks due to ocean freighter issues and truck driver shortages.
""In the United States we have experienced booming consumption but we have issues with deliveries both at ports and on the ground ... we are doing our best to reduce tensions in the supply chain,"" Kunze-Concewitz said.
The Campari CEO said the group would also take action to be more efficient and adjust the mix of the products sold to protect its profitability.

""We expect the positive brand momentum and favourable sales mix to continue in the last quarter, helping to partially offset the intensifying input cost pressure, particularly logistics costs, accelerated brand building investments, as well as structure costs phasing,"" he said in a statement.

ZURICH (Reuters) - A new multilateral climate action development bank is needed to help get money to emerging markets more effectively, analysts at U.S. bank  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) said on Tuesday ahead of an upcoming U.N. climate summit.
Global leaders will assemble in Glasgow on Oct. 31 for the COP26 U.N. climate summit https://www.reuters.com/subjects/focus-climate-change, aiming to thrash out more ambitious plans to cap global warming and agree the funding needed to help accelerate the planet's shift towards a lower-carbon economy.
Under the Paris climate agreement, developed countries have promised at least $100 billion annually to help address the climate financing needs of developing countries, while the summit itself hopes to help mobilise trillions in private sector finance towards climate investments.
Calling for a so-called Climate Action Development Bank, Citi proposed a new global institution dedicated to financing lower carbon developments, funded by nations across the globe.
""(We) believe it would be a far more efficient if capital were to be allocated with the assistance of an institution fully dedicated to achieving climate change objectives,"" the Citi authors said.
Such a bank could work together with other development banks, such as the World Bank, the African Development Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, to coordinate climate action facilities and other goals.
It could further help harness trillions of private sector investments by adopting a blended finance approach, or public-private deals backed by government-financed institutions, and thereby reduce the risks and barriers for investors to back projects, particularly in emerging economies.
World business leaders also hope for a deal at the summit to resolve issues that have hindered use of carbon pricing to cut worldwide emissions. They look to boost the role companies play in slowing global warming.

""To stand any chance of staying within a 1.5 degree Celsius temperature increase, we need to do much, much more to reduce emissions,"" a team of nine experts concluded in the bank's 104-page global carbon market report, calling for a coordinated global effort to help price carbon and remove hurdles for developing countries to access climate financing.
""We cannot realistically expect emerging markets to fund their own decarbonization programs, and slow their economic growth ... The goal must fall at least in part on developed nations,"" the authors said. ""We need to find a mechanism whereby global efforts to decarbonize are funded efficiently and equitably.""

(Reuters) -Industrial giant 3M Co lowered its full-year earnings outlook on Tuesday and said it would increase product prices to combat inflationary and supply chain pressures plaguing U.S. manufacturers.
The company, which makes everything from Post-It notes to industrial sandpaper, said it was facing higher costs related to polypropylene, ethylene, resins and labor. It added that the global semiconductor crunch would continue to weigh on its automotive and electronics end-markets.
While demand for goods has rebounded with massive stimulus and the reopening of economies, a tight labor market and soaring raw material prices have left most U.S. companies in the lurch.
""Inflation has come in faster than anybody thought,"" Chief Financial Officer Monish Patolawala said on a call with analysts. ""We don't see the raw material or the inflation environment slowing down in any way.""
To offset these constraints, 3M said it would also turn to dual sourcing of raw materials and improving factory yields. 
3M forecast a hit of 80 cents to 90 cents to full-year earnings from raw material and logistics costs.
The Dow Industrial Average component, however, reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue on the back of sales growth across its business units.
Annual sales are now expected to grow between 9% and 10%, compared to a prior forecast of 7% to 10%, 3M said, while 2021 earnings per share are forecast to come in between $9.70 and $9.90, versus its earlier range of $9.70 to $10.10.
The biggest maker of N95 masks said third-quarter disposable respirator sales fell 7% and forecast waning demand for the rest of the year and into 2022. 

Net income attributable to 3M in the third quarter rose marginally to $1.434 billion, or $2.45 per share, above analysts' average estimate of $2.20 per share.
Net sales rose 7.1% to $8.94 billion, beating expectations of $8.67 billion.

Investing.com –  Lockheed Martin  stock (NYSE:LMT) plunged 11.4% Tuesday as the defense equipment manufacturer lowered its 2021 revenue guidance after supply chain issues kept its third-quarter numbers behind expectations.
The maker of F-35 fighter jets cut its 2021 revenue expectation by 2.5%, to $67 billion, and said next year's revenue could fall to $66 billion.
Net sales declined by around 3%, to $16.02 billion, and came in below expectations. So did the adjusted profit per share of $2.21.
Lockheed expects roughly flat to low-single-digit growth rates in both revenue and segment operating profit over the next few years. This followed, in the words of Chairman, President and CEO James Taiclet, the company’s “reassessment of our five-year business plan given recent external and programmatic events.""
Lockheed, however, raised its current-year EPS guidance to $22.45. The board also approved a $5 billion expansion of the company’s share repurchase program and a hike in quarterly dividend rate to $2.80 per share. All this did little to stem the slide in the share price."

While there has been no stock-specific news so far on Tuesday, its shares touched a peak of $252.59.
Yesterday, Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar made a bullish call on the stock, raising the price target to $260 from $225, keeping an overweight rating.
With Nvidia set to report its earnings on Nov. 17, Kumar said he is a ""bit more constructive"" on the gaming chip maker following an eBay scraping analysis. 
In a research note, the analyst told investors that the data implies there could be a decoupling between bitcoin prices and secondary market GPU price premiums, which would displace ""one of the major investor hang-ups"" around Nvidia. 
Kumar believes that as a result, it could bolster the company's market share in the GPU segment as more would be available for its gaming customers ahead of the holiday shopping period. "

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The African Union (AU) intends to buy up to 110 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc in an arrangement brokered in part by the White House, which will defer delivery of some doses intended for the United States to facilitate the deal, officials told Reuters.
The AU's doses will be delivered over the coming months, with 15 million arriving before the end of 2021, 35 million in the first quarter of next year and up to 60 million in the second quarter.
""This is important as it allows us to increase the number of vaccines available immediately,"" AU coronavirus envoy Strive Masiyiwa said in an email. ""We urge other vaccine producing countries to follow the lead of the (U.S. government) and give us similar access to buy this and other vaccines.""
The Moderna purchase is the second time that the AU has agreed with a pharmaceutical company to buy COVID-19 vaccines. It reached a deal https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-j-j-vaccine-idUSKBN2BL1V4 in March with Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) for up to 400 million doses.
With the exception of the J&J deal, the AU had not had access to vaccine purchases, Masiyiwa told a virtual news conference. 
""I have sat in meetings with every single one of the suppliers,"" he said.
He added that the deal announced Tuesday was unique and a breakthrough that came after South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta asked U.S. President Joe Biden to ""stand aside for the next quarter so that we could access vaccines and purchase ourselves."" 
The AU is paying the same price per dose as COVAX, a global scheme meant to ensure fair vaccine access, Masiyiwa said. In May, Moderna said it would sell COVAX vaccines at its ""lowest tiered price"" without disclosing further details.
The new shipments are well below what Africa needs to inoculate its 1.3 billion people, who have had far less access to the vaccines than more prosperous regions. Only 8.4% of Africa's population has received at least one dose, compared to the global average of 48.7%, according to the World Health Organization. 
The Moderna vaccines will bring the AU closer to its target of vaccinating 900 million people, or 70% of the continent.
The Biden administration is deferring delivery of 33 million doses it had bought from Moderna to give the AU its ""spot in line"" to make a purchase, according to Natalie Quillian, the White House's deputy coordinator for COVID-19 response.
Washington's decision is what the AU has been asking wealthy nations to do for months, Masiyiwa said.
""We are grateful to have helped negotiate this encouraging step forward between Moderna and the African Union that will significantly expand access to vaccines on the continent in the near-term,"" Quillian said.
The United States, where more than 700,000 people have died from COVID-19, is flush with vaccines. The delayed Moderna deliveries will not hinder efforts to provide booster shots to already inoculated Americans, Quillian said.
Moderna said it was working to make it possible to fill doses of its COVID-19 vaccine in Africa by 2023 and this month announced https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/moderna-plans-mrna-vaccine-factory-africa-2021-10-07 it would build a manufacturing plant there.
Masiyiwa said the AU wanted to see more concrete details about Moderna's manufacturing plans in Africa before deciding whether the AU would exercise its option to buy up to another 60 million doses in the second quarter of 2022. 
""We want production to be based in Africa, because it's at the center of our national health security,"" he said. The continent imports nearly 95% ofs its pharmaceutical and medicinal product needs, according to the United Nations.
""This is the first step in our long-term partnership with the African Union,"" Moderna Chief Executive Stéphane Bancel said in a statement, referring to a Memorandum of Understanding with the AU.

Last month, the AU accused https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-who/update-1-african-union-slams-vaccine-manufacturers-for-restricting-access-idINL8N2QG4CK COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers of denying African countries a fair chance to buy vaccines and urged manufacturing countries, in particular India, to lift export restrictions on vaccines and their components.
COVAX, the global vaccine initiative, has so far delivered about 128 million doses to African countries. It hopes to ramp up deliveries in the coming months as it expects supplies from India to gradually open up, the GAVI vaccine alliance CEO Seth Berkley told the virtual news conference.

It operates 70 distribution facilities and 78 cash-and-carry locations.
The cost of food in the United States increased 4.6% in September, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The key reasons for rising food prices are overall supply chain disruptions, heavy demand for food commodities, and a slowdown in shipping. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said that global supply chain issues could remain through 2022. Because these factors are expected to keep driving food prices higher, the food distribution industry should thrive. Therefore, we think both SYY and USFD should benefit.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -IKEA, the world's biggest furniture brand, has agreed to buy the iconic former flagship store of British fashion chain Topshop in central London from the administrators of bankrupt owner Arcadia Group, part of its push to open inner-city outlets.
Krister Mattsson, head of the investment arm of Ingka Group which owns most IKEA stores, told Reuters that three floors of the seven-storey building on Oxford Street, which it is buying for £378 million ($520 million), would be turned into an IKEA store due to open in the summer or autumn of 2023. 
""This is a very good fit into our strategy. This is a meeting place - it's one of the best spots for visitation in Europe, with amazing numbers of people passing by every week,"" Mattsson, managing director of Ingka Investment, said in an interview.
IKEA has tweaked its strategy in recent years towards adding inner-city store formats besides its giant out-of-town warehouse stores to reflect changing shopping behaviour. 
It opened its first inner-city full-range store in Paris in 2019. Its first centrally located store in London is due to open in the coming months, in the borough of Hammersmith. 
""The investment supports the transformation of Ingka Group’s retail business, bringing IKEA closer to customers,"" Ingka Investments said in a statement. 
Mattsson said the Oxford Street store would be IKEA's biggest inner-city format store to date. 
Ingka Investments and IKEA's shopping malls arm Ingka Centres are scouting for suitable centrally located properties across major cities in Europe and North America. Milano, Rome and Berlin are high on the agenda for Ingka Investments, Mattsson said.

He said there had been several bidders for the Oxford Street property. Overall in the segment where IKEA is looking to buy, interest from both institutional investor and other retailers was increasing alongside consumers' return to stores, he said.

(Reuters) -  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue on Tuesday, bolstered by strong e-commerce demand that has driven the delivery giant to raise shipping rates and cherry-pick more profitable customers.
The Atlanta-based company, which is heading into the peak holiday delivery season, raised its forecast for full-year adjusted operating margin to 13% from 12.7%. 
UPS shares jumped 6.7% to $217.46 on the results, which also lifted rival FedEx (NYSE:FDX) 1.7%.
UPS again plans to hold customers to agreed-upon holiday volumes to avoid overloading its facilities and staff. Volume growth for its biggest customers, including No. 1 user Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), will decline as UPS works to deliver more packages for small businesses and commercial users. 
To that end, Chief Executive Carol Tome said UPS is back to handling about the same number of Amazon packages as in 2019 - before pandemic-fueled shipments surged and shipping rival Amazon added significant home delivery capacity. 
Total revenue rose 9.2% to $23.2 billion for the third quarter, topping analysts' average estimate for $22.6 billion, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S data.
Adjusted operating profit jumped 23.4% to $2.9 billion, or $2.71 per share, above the average analyst estimate of $2.55.
In September, FedEx posted a 7% drop in quarterly profit and cut its full-year forecast after staffing shortages and turnover drove $450 million in excess labor costs and caused home delivery hiccups.

UPS appears to be benefiting from its unionized workforce, which is among the best compensated in the country. It is using technology and other tools to make its network more efficient - and during the latest quarter, direct labor hours per day declined 5.1%.
This holiday season, UPS will offer Saturday delivery across the United States and send oversized, bulky and heavy packages via Roadie - a crowd-sourced, same-day delivery company it is buying this quarter.

Fornairon, who owns the Canal Bookstore in central Paris, now hopes that new legislation that would set a minimum price for book deliveries will even the contest further in the battle of neighbourhood stores against Amazon.
""It's a just return towards a level playing field,"" Fornairon, who employs four workers, said. ""We're not at risk of closing down any time soon, but Amazon is a constant battle"".
Amazon said the legislation, adopted by parliament but not yet enacted, would punish those in rural areas who cannot easily visit a bookstore and rely on delivery.
""Imposing a minimum shipping cost for books would weigh on the purchasing power of consumers,"" Amazon told Reuters in a statement.
That is an undesirable consequence government officials are wary of at a time President Emmanuel Macron administration is scrambling to head off growing discontent over rising energy prices six months from an election. 
In the country of Victor Hugo and Simone de Beauvoir, where local bookshops are held with special affection -- they were deemed 'essential businesses' during latter COVID lockdowns -- the move is the latest by the state to shield national culture against big tech firms.
More than 20% of the 435 million books sold in France in 2019 were bought online and the market share of France's 3,300 independent bookstores has been slowly declining because of competition from online retailers like Amazon, Fnac and Leclerc. 
Support from Macron helped push the legislation, which does not target Amazon by name, over the line. The minimum fee still has to be negotiated with the regulator. 
'DISTORTED COMPETITION'
French law prohibits free book deliveries but Amazon has circumvented this by charging a single centime (cent). Local book stores typically charge about 5-7 euros ($5.82-8.15) for shipping a book. 
Amazon's pricing strategy had resulted in the growing market share of a single operator, the Ministry of Culture said.
""This law is necessary to regulate the distorted competition within online book sales and prevent the inevitable monopoly that will emerge if the status quo persists,"" the ministry told Reuters.
Centre-right Senator Laure Darcos, who drafted the law, decided upon the minimum delivery charge when she observed how bookstores maintained 70% of their business despite being forced to shut during early COVID lockdowns, because the government reimbursed the shipping fees.
""It showed what a brake on business the postage costs are for local bookstores,"" Darcos said.
Amazon had lobbied hard against the legislation, worried the French move might set a precedent, the senator said.
France's bookstores are concentrated in towns and cities. Amazon said online sales of books had enabled consumers to have equal access, regardless of where they lived. 
Virtually-free delivery allowed book lovers in rural areas to buy books at the same price as someone who could walk into a bookstore -- precisely the spirit of the 1981 law, it said.
Asked when the legislation would be enacted, the Ministry of Culture declined to give a date, saying it was too early to say.
For Fornairon, the bookshop owner, the steady stream of U.S. tourists through her door were a constant reminder of the shield French legislation had already wrapped around stores likes hers.

""They say to me 'we didn't even know independent bookstores still existed',"" she said.

HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Modern Land defaulted on a bond payment, the latest Chinese property developer to do so, adding to worries about the wider impact of the debt crisis at behemoth China Evergrande Group, and weighing on shares in the sector.
Modern Land (China) Co Ltd said in a filing on Tuesday that it had not repaid principal and interest on its 12.85% senior notes that matured on Monday due to ""unexpected liquidity issues"". The bond has outstanding principal of $250 million.
Separately, China's state planner said it and the foreign exchange regulator met with companies in ""key sectors"", which a source said included property firms, over their foreign debt holdings, asking them to ""optimise"" offshore debt structures and prepare to repay interest and principal on foreign bonds.
Modern Land's missed payment comes days after the company, a smaller developer, scrapped plans to seek investor consent to extend the maturity date of the bond by three months, saying doing so was not in the best interests of it and its stakeholders. 
Ratings agency Fitch earlier this month cut Modern Land's rating to ""C"" from ""B"" over the attempt to change bond terms, saying it considered the move a distressed debt exchange. The debt default prompted ratings downgrades by Fitch and Moody's (NYSE:MCO).
Developers are defaulting ""one by one"", said an investor with exposure to Chinese high-yield debt, who asked not to be identified as he is not authorised to speak to media.
""The question is always, who's next?"" 
REGULATORS WEIGH IN
After weeks of near-silence as investor worries over Evergrande and other developers mounted, Chinese regulators including the central nL1N2RB0PHbank have become increasingly vocal.
Late on Tuesday, China's National Development and Reform Commission said that it and the State Administration for Foreign Exchange had met with foreign debt issuers, telling them to use funds for approved purposes and ""jointly maintain their own reputations and the overall order of the market"". 
This month, Fantasia Holdings Group defaulted on a maturing dollar bond that heightened concerns in international debt markets, already roiled by worries over whether Evergrande would meet its obligations.
Evergrande, which narrowly averted a costly default https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-evergrande-sends-funds-trustee-bond-coupon-due-sept-23-source-2021-10-22 last week, is reeling under more than $300 billion in liabilities and has a major payment deadline on Friday. 
The company said on Tuesday it would deliver 31 real estate projects under construction in China's Pearl River Delta region by the end of 2021. That number will rise to 40 by the end of June 2022, Evergrande said in comments to Reuters. 
Evergrande had said on Sunday it had resumed work on more than 10 projects in six cities, including Shenzhen in southern China, after earlier halting them because it was unable to pay contractors. The developer has some 1,300 real estate projects across China in total.
Shares of property developers extended losses, hurt also by concern over China's plans to introduce a real estate tax https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/china-says-will-roll-out-property-tax-pilot-scheme-some-regions-xinhua-2021-10-23. 
China's CSI 300 Real Estate Index fell 2.8%, and the Hang Seng Mainland Properties Index dropped 4.3%. The broader Hang Seng index edged down 0.4% while China's CSI300 index slipped 0.3%.
The prospect of contagion and more defaults have weighed on the sector in a major setback for investors. 
Chinese Estates Holdings Ltd said it would book a loss of HK$288.37 million ($2.24 billion) this fiscal year from its latest sale of bonds issued by Chinese property developer Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd.

Modern Land's 11.8% February 2022 bond was down 1.6% at a discount of over 80% from its face value, yielding about 1,183%, according to data provider Duration Finance.
Evergrande shares ended the day down more than 4%. Shares in its electric vehicle (EV) unit closed down 6.75% after earlier rising as much as 5.8%.

Investing.com – Stocks of Phunware (NASDAQ:PHUN) and  Digital World Acquisition  (NASDAQ:DWAC), the two companies that shot into prominence last week because of their association with former U.S. President Donald Trump, plunged Tuesday.
Phunware slumped 33% and DWAC 20% but are still way higher than their prices before the news of their links with Trump became public. They have been among the top trades on Nasdaq and have acquired meme stock status.
It was DWAC first that shot into limelight Thursday after the September 20 announcement it would merge with Trump Media & Technology Group, an outfit set up by the former president to pursue opportunities in media.
The heart of that business will be a new social media platform called ‘TRUTH Social,’ that Trump says will “stand up to the tyranny of Big Tech.”
Between the two closings of Wednesday and Friday last week, DWA stock rose 1,657%. It is still 565% higher than Wednesday’s close of $9.96.
Even as DWAC was basking in its new-found status, the world discovered Phunware. Traders dug out an old article by USA Today and circulated it in social media. The May 2020 piece highlighted a partnership between Phunware and the Trump campaign of 2020.
According to that USA Today article, Phunware was associated with the Trump re-election campaign. Based on the article, the market speculated if Phunware would be the one developing Trump’s platform. There’s no final word on that, though.
Phunware soared as much as 1,471% in just Friday’s session before giving up some of the gains. It is still 194% higher than Thursday’s close of $1.53.
The company operates a platform that provides companies products, solutions and data and services necessary to engage and make money off its mobile application consumer base.
Trump has been off social media as both Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and his then favorite, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), banned him from their platforms for his alleged role in inciting the January 6 Capitol riot. Since then, the former president has been exploring ways to revive his social media presence, against a backdrop of reports that he will run again in 2024.

Trump is set to launch his own social media app, TRUTH Social, that he said would ""stand up to Big Tech"" companies such as Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) that have barred him from their platforms.
RightForge, which provides services such as web hosting and runs a network of servers, says it offers a platform where legal content is ""safe from censorship"" and is ""built for free speech and a free press.""
Avila told https://www.axios.com/trump-social-network-host-rightforge-c5c83181-db9f-4936-854b-1bf8942dfe17.html Axios on Monday the company was laying the groundwork in preparation for more than 75 million users to be on the social media network and will have servers everywhere. 
RightForge was building a global network in response to the de-platforming of Trump and Parler, and the Trump team approached the company over the summer, Avila told Axios.

Avila was not immediately available for a comment. 
TRUTH Social will be created through a new company formed by a merger of the Trump Media and Technology Group and a special acquisition company, Digital World Acquisition Corp.

(Reuters) -Raytheon Technologies Corp raised its forecast for full-year adjusted profit on Tuesday, as rising commercial air travel boosted demand for the aerospace and defense firm's engines, spare parts and aftermarket services.
But in an interview with CNBC Raytheon (NYSE:RTN)'s Chief Executive Greg Hayes warned the U.S. aerospace and defense firm will lose ""several thousand"" employees after they refused COVID-19 vaccinations. Separately, Hayes, in a post-earnings conference call with analysts, said he expects U.S. President Joe Biden's vaccine mandate to cause ""some disruption"" in the supply chain.
Shares fell about 1.5% in early trading. 
Recovering demand for air travel with the holiday season on the horizon has helped drive demand for Raytheon's aircraft cabin interiors and engines as the U.S. government's decision to open its borders to vaccinated individuals from abroad points to a recovery of the wide-body aerojet aftermarket, Raytheon Chief Financial Officer Neil Mitchill told Reuters in an interview.
While the company faces supply chain challenges among its 13,000 suppliers, Mitchill said ""it comes down to some very acute issues"" with labor shortages having some impact.
""We're seeing some shortfalls in electronic components, connectors, things like that. We're not as exposed like the auto industry is to the chips,"" Mitchill said.
The pandemic has crippled many companies' ability to send and receive the parts and supplies they need to produce a wide range of products, creating shortages, reducing inventories and hammering profits.
Raytheon, whose Pratt and Whitney unit supplies aircraft engines to companies like Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) , said it expects 2021 adjusted profit per share to be between $4.10 to $4.20, up from its prior forecast of $3.85 to $4.00 per share.
Hayes told Wall Street analysts that while he welcomed the commercial market rebound, he was ""skeptical"" that the production rate of Boeing 737s would reach 50 per month, or that Airbus A320s would reach 75 per month. Adding that Raytheon's ""5-year plans do not anticipate getting to that kind of rate by 2024 or 2025."" 

The maker of Tomahawk missiles reported that net income rose to $1.39 billion, or 93 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from $264 million, or 17 cents per share, a year earlier.
Raytheon's quarterly revenue rose 9.9% to $16.21 billion.

Investing.com – Crane Company stock (NYSE:CR) soared 11% Tuesday as the company overcame inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges to take its third-quarter sales and profits past analysts’ estimates.
The company’s board also approved a $300 million share repurchase program.
Riding on the outperformance in the third quarter, the maker of industrial products like cabin seats for airplanes, boosted its full-year net sales target to $3.15 billion and adjusted profit per share to $6.40 at midpoint. Its previous forecasts pegged net sales at $3.10 billion and EPS at $6.05 at the center of the range.
The company said the midpoint of its guidance range is also now well above its prior-peak 2019 adjusted EPS of $6.02 despite discontinuing operations of its engineered materials business, and many of its end markets are still in the very early stages of recovery.
Third-quarter sales were 21% higher, at $834 million. Core sales rose 20%. Net profit more than doubled to $116.6 million.
The company closed September with an order book of $1.21 billion, 2% stronger from end-June.
Orders grew most strongly in the company’s payment and merchandising technologies division, which makes electronic payment solutions and vending equipment.

(Reuters) -Hasbro Inc beat quarterly profit estimates on Tuesday, helped by a rebound in its TV and film production business that cushioned some of the impact from toy shipment delays due to global supply chain bottlenecks. 
The toymaker's shares rose 5% in early trading, despite the company's warning that its sales could take a hit during the crucial holiday shopping season.
Productions such as ""My Little Pony"" for Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and the musical ""Come From Away"" for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) TV+ from Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS)'s entertainment business boosted the unit's third-quarter revenue by 76% from a year ago, when filming was largely shutdown by the pandemic.
That helped offset some of the $100-million hit in delayed toy orders Hasbro had to endure in the quarter as factory shutdowns, a lack of container ships and long port delays pinched supply chains across the world. 
The maker of ""Transformers"" toys said the majority of those orders had been delivered in recent weeks, as the company is expanding its shipping capacity and using more air freight.
Hasbro said it expects 2021 revenue to rise between 13% and 16%, but warned supply issues could impact its ability to achieve the high-end of its forecast.
Still, Chief Financial Officer Deborah Thomas was confident that the company's investments to get around supply bottlenecks would be enough to ensure there would not be a dearth of Nerf blasters or My Little Pony toys under Christmas trees come December 

""We've got everything in place and there will be Hasbro toys and games on the shelves this holiday season,"" Thomas said on an analyst call. 
Hasbro said quarterly adjusted net earnings rose 5% to $271.2 million, or $1.96 per share, beating analysts' estimates of $1.69 per share, but warned that higher freight costs would pressure margins in the fourth quarter.

(Reuters) -Betting firm DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) walked away from a $22 billion attempt to buy gambling group Entain on Tuesday, becoming the second American bidder this year to try and fail to take control of the British owner of  Ladbrokes  (LON:LCL) betting shops.
Neither DraftKings nor Entain explained exactly why the deal talks foundered but said in separate statements that they believed strongly in their individual growth prospects.
""After several discussions with Entain leadership, DraftKings has decided that it will not make a firm offer for Entain at this time,"" DraftKings Chief Executive Officer Jason Robins said in a statement.
Under British takeover rules, DraftKings cannot make another bid for Entain for six months unless there is a competing offer. It had made a 28-pounds-per-share proposal for Entain in cash and stock in September after Entain rejected an earlier 25-pound proposal.
DraftKings shares jumped 5.8% in early trading in New York, while Entain shares were last down more than 6% on the London Stock Exchange, having fallen as much as 12% earlier.
Entain had already rejected a roughly $11 billion takeover approach in January from U.S. casino operator MGM, also its joint venture partner for U.S. online sportsbook BetMGM.
DraftKings' pursuit of Entain was complicated by the issue of BetMGM, a rival to DraftKings in the United States.
The boss of MGM had said he would have sought to take control of BetMGM if DraftKings had agreed to buy Entain.
""We are not surprised by this outcome, because we viewed this deal as just too complicated to close from the start,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst Joseph Greff said in a note.
Greff noted the ""sizable amount"" of shares that would have been used by DraftKings to fund the acquisition as another potential complication, besides the BetMGM issue.
U.S. MARKET EXPANDS
Dealmaking in the betting industry has been heating up as the United States opens up to sports betting and companies look to tap into the expertise of companies forged in more developed gambling markets such as Britain.
BetMGM was viewed as a major factor driving DraftKings' interest in Entain. The U.S. venture has grown steadily and challenged FanDuel owner Flutter, the No.1 player in the American sports betting and online gaming market.
MGM was not immediately available to comment on Tuesday.
A deal would have also given DraftKings Entain's Ladbrokes and Coral betting shops, long a feature of Britain's high streets, as well as the bwin and partypoker online brands.
""We are highly confident in our ability to maintain a leadership position and achieve our long-term growth plans in the rapidly growing North America market,"" DraftKings said.

Entain said its board ""strongly believes"" in its future prospects and that its management would focus on the company's growth targets.
Entain has enjoyed a boom in online gambling through the COVID-19 pandemic, with events such as last summer's European soccer championship and the U.S. National Football League having helped to revive sports betting.

955,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2021 09:47AM ET</span>","GE lifts 2021 earnings forecast, flags 'challenging' operating environment","By Rajesh Kumar Singh
CHICAGO (Reuters) -General Electric Co raised its full-year earnings forecast on Tuesday after a recovery in its jet-engine business helped it report higher-than-expected quarterly profit.
The industrial conglomerate, however, said it faced a ""challenging"" operating environment because of global supply chain disruptions and uncertainty over whether production tax credits for onshore wind investments will be extended over the long term in U.S. President Joe Biden's infrastructure bill.
GE, like other manufacturers, is grappling with a labor crunch and shortages of raw materials such as semiconductor chips and resins. It expects the supply constraints to persist through the rest of the year and in 2022, hurting profit in its healthcare business.
""I'm not sure we're yet at a place where we would say that things are stable,"" Chief Executive Larry Culp told investors on an earnings call. ""It really is akin to playing a whack-a-mole.""
The company expects inflationary pressure to intensify next year, adversely impacting its onshore wind business due to the rising cost of transportation and commodities like steel.
To mitigate that impact, it is trying to improve productivity, source alternative parts and redesign product configurations.
The uncertainty over production tax credits, meanwhile, is weighing on its onshore wind business. If the incentives are extended, customers may defer investments, and as a result, GE expects its renewable energy unit to burn cash this year.
The Boston-based company expects 2021 adjusted profit in the range of $1.80 to $2.10 per share, compared with $1.20 to $2.00 estimated previously.
GE said it expects revenue growth, margin expansion, and higher free cash flow next year. However, it narrowed free cash flow estimates for 2021 to $3.75 billion-$4.75 billion from $3.5 billion-$5.0 billion forecast earlier.
Shares were up 0.7% at $106.01 in morning trading.

Adjusted profit for the third quarter was 57 cents a share. Analysts on average expected 43 cents per share, according to Refinitiv data.
It generated $1.7 billion in free cash flow from industrial operations during the quarter, compared with $514 million a year ago.

(Reuters) -Logitech International SA shares plunged 6% on Tuesday after the computer peripherals maker reported a steep fall in operating profit and said it was facing ""unprecedented"" supply chain problems.
The maker of keyboards, mice and headsets became the latest company to warn about the difficulties getting enough semiconductor chips due to clogged up transport links and stuttering factory restarts by suppliers.
Swiss engineering firm ABB and Sweden's Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) last week flagged problems getting enough parts to make their products.
""This supply chain challenge will continue throughout the rest of this year,"" Logitech (NASDAQ:LOGI) Chief Executive Bracken Darrell told Reuters, referring to the company's financial year which runs to the end of March 2022. 
""We will have some issues delivering at the levels of demand that are out there,"" he added. ""On the logistics side, we just have to do the best we can, and plan well.""
The time to air-freight components has increased to two weeks from four or five days previously, while costs have spiralled, Darrell said.
Logitech was reacting by adding more suppliers as well as building up its inventory of components to satisfy still strong demand driven by stay at home workers and gamers, the executive said.
During its quarter to the end of September, Logitech sales rose 4% to $1.31 billion, beating a forecast of $1.25 billion in a Refinitiv poll of analysts.
The figure was 82% above the comparable pre pandemic figure for the second quarter of 2019.
Darrell said he did not think the work from home trend had been exhausted, with many customers now upgrading their home office computer equipment. 
The Swiss-U.S. company, the first to manufacture and sell computer mice in the 1980s, is also spending more on promotions and marketing in stores compared with last year, when many retailers were closed.
As a result non-GAAP operating income declined 40% to $211 million during the quarter. Net profit fell 48% to $139.5 million. Shares were down 6.5% at 13.17 GMT.
Logitech maintained its outlook for the financial year through March 2022, still expecting full-year non-GAAP operating income of $800 million to $850 million and flat sales growth plus or minus 5%.

Zuercher Kantonalbank analyst Andreas Mueller said he thought the share price reaction seemed exaggerated.

957,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2021 09:41AM ET</span>",Business leaders look to U.N. for deal toward carbon pricing,"By Ross Kerber and Simon Jessop
BOSTON/LONDON (Reuters) -World business leaders want the upcoming United Nations climate summit https://www.reuters.com/subjects/focus-climate-change to resolve issues that have so far hindered the use of carbon pricing to cut worldwide emissions, looking to boost the role that companies play in slowing global warming. 
Executives, trade groups and policy experts say hopes for a deal are growing after negotiators at the 2019 summit in Madrid failed to settle how countries can account for international carbon trading as called for under Article 6 of the Paris climate agreement. 
A lack of international agreement has held back the development of systems for putting a price on carbon. Having some way to measure the economic cost of emissions https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/climate-change-what-are-economic-stakes-2021-10-25 is a top priority of companies across many industries whose leaders want to cut greenhouse gasses, said Rich Lesser, global chair of Boston Consulting Group. 
For executives, ""if you had a global price on carbon, then it would be economically rational to pursue solutions and alternatives"", Lesser said.
Dan Byers, who will represent major trade group the U.S. Chamber of Commerce at the summit in Glasgow https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/cop26-glasgow-who-is-going-who-is-not-2021-10-15, called the final resolution of Article 6 ""long overdue"" to resolve technical issues such as how countries can monitor and verify carbon emissions.
He added that a factor favoring a deal is the climate focus of U.S. President Joe Biden, who returned to the terms of the 2015 Paris climate agreement https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-usa/its-official-u-s-back-in-the-paris-climate-club-idUSKBN2AJ16T after predecessor Donald Trump pulled out of the accord.
""Having the Biden administration backing Paris, and at the table, is hugely important over the long run,"" Byers said.
Other issues that business leaders will track at the meeting starting Oct. 31 include what new pledges national leaders might make to cut emissions, and how much money will be set aside to finance sustainable development in emerging markets.
Carbon pricing plans can range widely including carbon taxes that charge companies for emissions, or emissions trading markets that cap how much companies or countries can emit but allow them to trade permits to exceed those levels.
Many corporations expect carbon pricing plans will help them fulfill the now widespread ""Net Zero"" pledges, said Kelley Kizzier, a vice-president at the Environmental Defense Fund, a Washington advocacy group, and a onetime co-chair of the negotiating group over Article 6 at previous climate summits.
Specific issues to resolve in Glasgow for Article 6 include how to prevent two countries counting the same emissions cut, and how new carbon markets might help fund developing countries' efforts to adapt to climate change, she said. Even if a deal is reached, companies will still be left with the work of cutting their emissions, she added.
Just because a goal is set, ""It's not rainbows and butterflies,"" Kizzier said.
DIVISIONS REMAIN
Beyond carbon pricing, leaders are more divided on other topics that will be center stage in Glasgow such as the future role of fossil fuels in the world economy.
For instance, an investor group including PIMCO,  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT) and French asset manager Amundi has called on countries to take steps including raising their emissions-reduction commitments and ending fossil subsidies, and there have been separate calls for international banks to stop funding fossil fuel projects.
But energy executives say fossil fuels still have a role to play in the energy transition. New natural gas facilities in emerging markets would produce fewer emissions compared with existing coal-fired generation, said Aaron Padilla, a policy director for the American Petroleum Institute, whose members include big energy companies ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) Corp, Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) and Norway's Equinor.
""There's still significant room for natural gas especially to displace coal as a source of production,"" Padilla said.
Financial companies face their own pressures. Companies with a combined $90 trillion in assets known as the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero have called for governments to set broad net-zero targets, for instance, and to price emissions.
But the group includes banks that still back fossil fuel projects, drawing criticism that they and the alliance's chair, U.N. special envoy Mark Carney, are missing a chance to force harder action. Richard Brooks, climate finance director for the activist group Stand.earth https://www.stand.earth, said more should follow the example of France's Banque Postale, which said it would stop serving the oil and gas sectors outright by 2030. 

""Many of the banks who are part of the alliance are getting kudos and green cover but not changing their day-to-day financial practices,"" Brooks said.
Asked about the criticism, Carney said in an emailed statement that member banks must set interim 2030 carbon reduction targets and decarbonization plans. ""GFANZ has launched an ambitious body of work to accelerate implementation and action, which will be outlined at COP26,"" he said.

Following the creation of Stellantis in January through the merger of Italian-American automaker Fiat Chrysler and France's PSA, chief executive Carlos Tavares promised to keep the group's 14 brands on condition that each would focus on its strongest markets and segments.
The question of maintaining the DS brand's presence in China, where sales have slumped to a record low, has come up again after Stellantis sold its stakes in a local production site for the brand.
""Nothing is changing for DS at this point. The plan is to continue in China,"" Foucher told reporters.
Tavares will lay out by early 2022 how he aims to revive sales in the world's biggest car market.

Part of that plan will be a focus on 100% electric Opel vehicles and using one of the plants of its joint venture with GAC, which specialises in producing the Jeep brand.
DS, which is one of Stellantis' premium brands along with Alfa Romeo et Lancia, will inaugurate the group's STLA Medium electric platform with a new car model in 2024.

Investing.com – DraftKings stock (NASDAQ:DKNG) climbed 5% in early trading on Tuesday after the online sports betting operator called off what was considered an expensive proposal to buy U.K.-based Entain, the parent of gambling firm  Ladbrokes  (LON:LCL).
Entain (LON:ENT) traded 7% lower in London trading. Until yesterday, the stock was up around 12% since the deal was first made public on September 21.
In the same period, DraftKings stock lost around 17% in value.
It was supposed to make a firm offer as per the U.K. takeover rules but did not do so.
DraftKings’ September bid was a sweetened proposal that it made after Entain rejected the first one. It was willing to pay 2,800 pence per Entain share comprising 630 pence in cash and the balance payable in new DraftKings shares. The offer was a 46% premium to Entain's closing share price on September 20 and amounted to over 16 billion pounds ($22 billion).

MADRID (Reuters) - The Spanish arm of telecoms group Orange will sit out the looming auction of television broadcasting rights for LaLiga soccer to avoid driving up prices, its chief executive said on Tuesday after the business reported mixed third-quarter results.
Orange Spain will instead negotiate with the companies that win the various rights packages to broadcast matches in the top tier of Spanish soccer from 2022 onwards, Chief Executive Jean-Francois Fallacher told reporters at an event to discuss quarterly earnings.
Fallacher said the company would be watching the tender process closely as one of two operators providing soccer in Spain, adding that scenarios include a split between several parties or rival Telefonica (NYSE:TEF) acquiring all of the broadcasting rights on offer.
Spain's CNMC competition watchdog last week approved LaLiga's proposal to sell television rights for future seasons to several operators but rejected the idea of four or five-year contracts.
Orange Spain earlier reported third-quarter revenue and retail sales down 4.4% and 8% respectively from a year earlier, citing a highly competitive market.
But the operator's FTTH (fibre to the home) operation and mobile customer base grew over the period. Its fibre coverage rose 4.5% from last year to connect almost 16 million homes.
Fallacher also said that Orange Spain is negotiating with rival Masmovil over third-party access contracts that Euskaltel had with Orange. Masmovil bought Basque operator Euskaltel for 1.99 billion euros ($2.32 billion) this year.
As rising energy prices squeeze companies across Europe, Fallacher said that Orange Spain's fully renewable supply would help to soften the financial hit, as would the power purchase agreements it had reached.

At the group level, Orange posted a 0.7% drop in third-quarter core earnings and reiterated its full-year financial targets.

The announcement comes just months after the No. 1 U.S. automaker said it had signed agreements with some companies to offer its customers access to nearly 60,000 charging points across the same regions.
The company said on Tuesday it would expand home, workplace and public charging infrastructure through its Ultium Charge 360 ecosystem, adding that it would focus on installing them in rural and urban areas with limited access to support widespread adoption of EVs.
The charging stations will be available to all EV customers, and not just those who purchase vehicles from GM, the carmaker said. 
Earlier this month, GM said it plans to double its revenue by 2030, indicating that it can build profitable software-driven services and take on Elon Musk's Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. 

The company's market capitalization of $83.85 billion, however, remains far behind that of Tesla, which crossed $1 trillion in market value on Monday following its biggest-ever order from car rental firm Hertz.

The company boosted its profit forecast for the year to $1.95 at the midpoint of the guidance range from $1.60 previously.
GE expects revenue growth, margin expansion, and higher free cash flow in 2022, although it narrowed its free cash flow outlook for the ongoing quarter.
The company overcame supply shortages and higher costs of raw materials to expand its third-quarter adjusted industrial profit margin by 270 basis points to 7.5%. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percent.
New orders and faster execution in the aviation business rescued the company’s performance in the September quarter. But for the 10% growth in the aviation business, the 1% fall in the company’s revenue would have been steeper.
The company booked orders worth $22.1 billion during the quarter, 22% higher than last time. Orders came in all four key segments but with more than 60% share, aviation and renewables accounted for the bulk of it. Healthcare was next while power was a laggard with new orders rising 8% from last year.
The company warned of supply chain disruptions and onshore wind market pressure because of uncertainty over the extension of production tax credits in President Joe Biden's infrastructure bill.

969,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2021 07:26AM ET</span>",No end in sight for labor shortages as U.S. companies fight high costs,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Labor shortages may be the most intractable of the cost risks that U.S. companies faced in the latest quarter, and as the earnings season moves into its peak there are signs the problem will persist, some strategists say.
Finding and paying for workers is a challenge investors are paying close attention to as third-quarter results come in, with supply bottlenecks and high energy and other commodity prices among other key risks for companies.
Warnings have come already from companies in several industries, including healthcare, with hospital operator HCA Healthcare (NYSE:HCA) Inc saying higher labor costs seen in the third quarter could stick around longer because of a shortage of workers.
Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) cited a shortage of drivers as it reported recently a rare fall in U.S. sales, and FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) also cited higher labor costs in September when it cut its full-year forecast.
The coming weeks, which bring results from the bulk of S&P 500 companies, should give investors more clues on how long labor pressures could persist.
""We're going to see it come up in the next couple of quarters as we try to continue to reopen,"" said Mace McCain, chief investment officer at Frost Investment Advisors. ""The reopening was delayed by the Delta variant, so we haven't seen the full impact of the labor shortage yet.""
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) strategists wrote in a research note ahead of this week that there have been some ""tentative signs of improvement from supply chain data and commodity prices,"" while labor market tightness could be a challenge ""for many companies for years.""
""Our economists expect COVID-related pressure on labor market supply will ease in coming months but forecast a U.S. unemployment rate of 3.5% by the end of 2022, meaning companies will continue to face many of the labor market challenges they face today,"" they wrote.
Among stocks within the leisure and hospitality industry, low-labor-cost names have outperformed high-labor-cost peers for months, the Goldman strategists said, noting that in the broader market, ""the most asset- and labor-efficient firms have outperformed peers in recent years and in recent weeks.""
Recent economic data has underscored the tightening labor market trend. The latest data showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped to a 19-month low in the week ended Oct. 16, marking a second straight week that claims remained below 300,000 as employers hold on to workers amid an acute labor shortage.
U.S. companies managed to keep profit margins at record levels in the second quarter, but rising costs have sparked some concern among investors.
So far this reporting period, stronger-than-expected earnings have raised the year-over-year profit growth forecast for S&P 500 companies to 34.8%, up from about 30% at the start of the month, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
To be sure, a labor shortage is good news for people out of work and looking for a job. And there are several signs that suggest the labor shortage may be temporary, Thomas Lee, managing partner and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, wrote in recent note.
""Labor usage is actually 4.9 million lower now than pre-COVID-19,"" he wrote. ""Has the economy permanently changed during COVID-19 that somehow less people working means a tighter labor market? Nope.""

Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management in Chicago, said labor shortages seem to be more of a problem for some industries than others. 
""Customer-facing businesses"" that were forced to close during the pandemic lockdowns are having a hard time filling jobs and getting back up to speed, he said, while ""manufacturers never quite completely shut down.""

970,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2021 07:21AM ET</span>",U.S. billionaire tax proposal seems to unite Democrats - but will it work?,"By Trevor Hunnicutt and Jarrett Renshaw
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A first-of-its-kind proposal from Democratic lawmakers to tax U.S. billionaires on the assets they own is expected to face challenges from the super-rich, and be tough to implement, say tax experts and investors.
The proposal, set to be unveiled as soon as Tuesday, would require roughly 700 U.S. billionaires to pay taxes annually when their stocks and some other assets increase in value, according to people familiar with the matter. 
Currently, such taxes are only due when the stocks are sold.
House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi says Democrats hope the plan would raise as much as $250 billion to help pay for expanding the social safety net and tackling climate change.
The provisions may be tough to implement even if they become law. Experts say some billionaires will shift their wealth away from assets that are easily tracked and taxed under the new rules to ones that are not. They also warn that a sharp market decline could give billionaires a new tax break.
""It's a stupid idea,"" said billionaire Leon Cooperman, an investor who warned such a law could cause ""unnatural"" economic reactions. ""The progressives are out to lunch.""
But Gabriel Zucman, a University of California at Berkeley economics professor whose research on the subject helped inspire Democratic tax proposals, said that ""billionaires have lower taxes than the middle class"" as a percentage of their income. 
""It would be historic. It would be the most progressive tax ever,"" Zucman said.
Getting billionaires to pony up may be one of the ideas capable of uniting Democrats, who are trying to resolve other ideological disputes over what should be in their social spending package. The bill is a signature policy for President Joe Biden and is likely to be valued at $1.5 trillion or more over 10 years.
Biden backs taxing the wealthy and corporations more heavily and has privately supported the proposal focused on taxing billionaires, according to a person familiar with his thinking.
Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, a centrist with a virtual veto over Biden's agenda in the evenly divided Senate, said on Monday: ""I'm open to any type of thing that makes people pay that's not paying now.""
CHALLENGES AHEAD
The proposal, if passed, will likely face an immediate challenge in court and by taxpayers eager to evade the rules, according to tax and legal experts.
""I could potentially see people trying to get out of easier-to-value assets,"" said Tim Laffey, a lawyer who heads tax policy and research at Rockefeller Capital Management, which manages money for wealthy families. ""Obviously, everything that's publicly traded has an established value, so maybe we see a push into alternative investments.""
He also said there could be legal challenges, such as contesting whether appreciated assets that have not been sold can be treated by the federal government as taxable income.
Republicans do not support Biden's social spending bill and will also likely oppose the billionaire tax. 
""They are talking about rewiring the entire economy after a couple of days' discussions on the back of an envelope,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, adding the ""harebrained scheme"" had not received ""any meaningful study or scrutiny.""
Under the plan, details of which are still being finalized, gains on stocks and other easily traded assets would be taxed only for U.S. taxpayers with over $1 billion in assets or $100 million in income for three consecutive years, according to people familiar with the matter.
The billionaires would pay capital gains rates on their gains that year rather than putting off the bill indefinitely by holding on to the assets. Losses would offset that liability. The capital gains tax for assets held over a year top out at 23.8% currently, less than the 37% maximum for regular income.
A new levy would also be placed on assets that do not trade as easily, like real estate or a stake in a business. In that case, billionaires would essentially pay a surcharge when they sell the asset.
Not all billionaires are opposed. George Soros, the investor and liberal activist, is ""supportive,"" his spokesperson told Reuters on Monday. 
A ProPublica report in June said Soros paid no federal income tax for three years in a row. Citing private Internal Revenue Service data, it said Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Jeff Bezos and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's Elon Musk had also been able to skirt all federal income tax liability in some years.

The new law would likely include a set of rules to ensure the wealthy comply, including giving the federal government the power to examine whether trusts, estates and other legal structures are being used to evade the tax.
Still, the proposal would put new pressure on the IRS, which enforces U.S. tax law and has been hollowed out https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-irs-explainer/explainer-hobbled-irs-tax-agency-may-need-months-to-get-cash-to-americans-idUSKBN21D2II by budget cuts and hobbled by obsolete technology.

975,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2021 06:46AM ET</span>",HSBC joins investors reckoning worst is over in China,"By Tom Westbrook
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Analysts at Europe's biggest bank HSBC have turned bullish on Chinese stocks, arguing the worst of a regulatory storm has passed and that Beijing will provide policy support to arrest slowing growth.
HSBC said on Tuesday it had upgraded its recommendation on Chinese equities to ""overweight"" from ""neutral"", joining a small but growing chorus of investors who reckon the tide is beginning to turn.
""We think the baby is being thrown out with the bathwater,"" the HSBC analysts said in a report which had Herald van der Linde (NYSE:LIN), head of Asia-Pacific equity strategy, as its lead author.
""Yes, China is struggling with growth, and a stronger dollar is not good news for China's stock markets. But that's now well-known and is priced in,"" the report said.
This year MSCI's China index has fallen about 12% compared with a 15% rise in MSCI's world stocks index, as crackdowns spanning technology firms' behaviour to property borrowing have pounded share prices. 
HSBC is among a few in the financial sector calling time on the selloff. Asset manager BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) said a month ago it was dipping its toes back into Chinese equities.
On Monday strategists at Citi Private Bank also said they were modestly overweight on Chinese equities, while analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) unveiled a ""Common Prosperity"" portfolio which they said had been insulated from regulatory risks.
""As growth is slowing, we expect Beijing to introduce more targeted easing measures in the coming months,"" said the HSBC analysts.
""As for regulations, which have battered the China internet sector so much this year, they tend to come in cycles ... the focus eventually shifts to growth and stability, especially heading into the twice-a-decade Party Congress next year.""
HSBC cited the beaten-down real estate sector as particularly attractive over the longer term, though concerns about fallout from troubles at teetering giant China Evergrande may weigh on prices for a while. 

It has ""buy"" recommendations on developers China Resources Land, Longfor Group Holdings and Shimao.
Evergrande said on Oct. 24 it had resumed work on more than 10 projects, after it appeared to avert default with a last-minute bond coupon payment last week.

976,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2021 06:45AM ET</span>",Chalco posts best profit in almost 8 years on high aluminium prices,"(Reuters) - Aluminum Corp of China Ltd said on Tuesday its quarterly net profits in July-September jumped more than five-fold year on year, hitting their highest since late 2013 on buoyant aluminium and alumina prices. 
The state-controlled company, known as Chalco, said third-quarter net income was 2.23 billion yuan ($349 million), up around 430% from an adjusted 421.25 million yuan a year earlier.
Profits were also up almost 6% from a bumper second quarter and marked Chalco's best result since net income of 2.79 billion yuan in the fourth quarter of 2013, Refinitiv Eikon data show.
Third-quarter revenues meanwhile rose 51.3% year-on-year to 74.19 billion yuan as Shanghai aluminium prices soared to their highest since 2008. The rally came as electricity shortages saw power shortages imposed on Chinese smelters and took about 3 million tonnes of annual supply out of the market. 
Chalco's own production was not greatly affected, however, its operational data showed. The company said it produced 2.92 million tonnes of primary aluminium in January-September, up 5.8% year on year. That implies third-quarter production of 960,000 tonnes, up around 6.7% on the year.
Shanghai aluminium has eased around 7% this month as China's government steps up efforts to tame high prices for coal, the main source of power for energy-intensive aluminium smelting.
Spot prices for alumina in China, as assessed by industry data provider SMM, are however still up some 76% year-to-date above 4,000 yuan a tonne, the highest in records going back to 2012. 

Chalco, the world's biggest alumina producer, said it produced 12.17 million tonnes of alumina in the first nine months of 2021, up 13.3% year-on-year and implying 3.92 million tonnes for third quarter, up around 10.7% on the year.

979,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2021 06:36AM ET</span>",Hyundai Motor's Q3 profit misses estimates as chip shortage takes a toll,"By Heekyong Yang and Joyce Lee
SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co slightly missed analysts' profit estimates as the global chip crisis drove down vehicle shipments and it said it expects it will take a long time to get back to normal chip supplies.
Hyundai, which together with affiliate Kia Corp is among the world's top 10 automakers by sales, reported a net profit of 1.3 trillion won ($1.10 billion) for the July-September quarter. 
In the same period a year earlier it posted a loss of 336 billion won when it was hit by a one-time expense related to engine quality issues and recalls.
The profit was just shy of an average analyst forecast of 1.4 trillion won compiled by Refinitiv SmartEstimate.
""Hyundai Motor expects that on-year sales growth might slow down for the rest of 2021 amid adverse business conditions caused by the unstable supply of semiconductor chips,"" Hyundai Motor said in a statement. 
The automaker said the global chip shortage would last until the end of this year or into next year, and it expected it would take a long time to get back to normal.
""The chip shortage will likely continue into the fourth quarter but supply conditions would partially improve in the fourth quarter compared with the third,"" Hyundai Motor's Executive Vice President Seo Gang Hyun said in a call with analysts. 
The global chip crisis https://www.reuters.com/article/chips-shortage-explainer-int-idUSKBN2BN30J, triggered partly by surging demand for laptops and consumer electronics during the pandemic, has shuttered auto production lines globally and forced automakers to slash shipment forecasts.
Hyundai previously said its on-year sales growth might slow in the second half of 2021 due to challenging business conditions, including the unstable supply of automotive chips.
The company said it had cut this year's capital expenditure spending by more than 10% to 8 trillion won to better respond to uncertainties, including the coronavirus pandemic. 
It revised up this year's auto-business operating margin profit to 4.5%-5.5% from a previously announced a 4%-5%, citing strong sales of its high-margin sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) and its premium Genesis cars. 
""Based on Hyundai's revision of its operating margin targets, the upcoming fourth quarter results would likely mark the most profitable quarter this year as the company seems to expect that the chip supply issues would likely improve,"" said Lee Jae-il, analyst at Eugene Investment & Securities. 
Hyundai had turned in its best quarterly profit in about six years in the April-June quarter thanks to its conservative supply chain management that helped it to navigate the chip shortage better than other automakers.
But the prolonged crisis forced Hyundai to suspend production in the third quarter.
This month, Hyundai's global chief operating officer Jose Munoz said the automaker wanted to develop its own chips https://www.reuters.com/technology/hyundai-motor-says-it-wants-develop-chips-cut-reliance-chipmakers-2021-10-13 to reduce reliance on others.

Shares of Hyundai Motor were trading up 0.7% after the firm published its earnings results, compared with a 0.8% rise in the broader market KOSPI.

982,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 26, 2021 06:27AM ET</span>",Record China Defaults in Focus as Modern Land Joins the List,"(Bloomberg) -- A Chinese developer of real estate projects that use green technologies has become the latest builder to default, adding to the record for offshore bonds from the nation’s borrowers.
 Modern Land China Co Ltd  (HK:1107), which is based in Beijing and builds energy-saving homes throughout the nation, didn’t repay either the principal or interest on a $250 million bond due Monday, according to a filing Tuesday morning. The company is working with its legal counsel Sidley Austin and expects to engage independent financial advisers soon, the filing said. 
Fitch Ratings downgraded Modern Land to restricted default from C late Tuesday following the payment miss. The developer tried divestitures, borrowing and adding strategic investors before not making the payment, reported Chinese financial platform Cailian. It last week terminated a proposal to extend the bond’s maturity by three months. 
Chinese borrowers have defaulted on about $9 billion of offshore bonds this year, with the real estate industry accounting for one-third of that amount. That’s come as authorities clamp down on excessive leverage in the real estate sector amid a crisis at China  Evergrande  Group (HK:3333) that has left many investors around the world on edge. 
Multiple developers have defaulted this month, though Evergrande made a coupon payment last week before a grace period expired. Still, Evergrande’s creditors are bracing for an eventual debt restructuring that could rank among the largest ever in China. 
Policy makers are trying to keep such issues from snowballing. Chinese authorities told billionaire Hui Ka Yan to use his personal wealth to alleviate Evergrande’s deepening debt crisis, according to people familiar with the matter.
Separately, China’s National Development and Reform Commission called on companies to make active preparations for offshore bond repayment at a symposium with some companies in key industries Tuesday.
Credit-rating downgrades of Chinese developers have accelerated further in October, hitting a record high for a second straight month. There were 44 cuts in the sector by Moody’s Investors Service, S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings as of Oct. 21, after 34 downgrades for all of September, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. 
Ratings reductions surged in the third quarter as China Evergrande Group’s troubles fueled broader debt-related worries. Ongoing downgrades, occurring as developers face heavy operational and refinancing pressure, “will worsen their capability of raising funds,” said Ma Dong, a partner with Chinese bond firm BG Capital Management Ltd.
Record China Defaults; IPO Flops; Indonesian Junk: Asia Markets
Also hindering capital-raising is the surge in yields on Chinese junk-rated debt, recently reaching their highest in a decade at 20% and resulting in the country’s developers making up nearly half the world’s distressed dollar bonds. Still, a media representative for  Ronshine China Holdings Co Ltd  (HK:3301) told Bloomberg that the developer paid the $30.2 million of interest due Monday on a dollar bond. Peer Agile Group Holdings Ltd. said it has sufficient funds to meet upcoming debt maturities.

983,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2021 06:26AM ET</span>",Novartis may divest generic unit Sandoz as price pressures mount,"By Ludwig Burger
(Reuters) -Novartis has raised the prospect of divesting its generic drugs unit Sandoz after years of revamping the business, as price pressures mount in the off-patent drug sector.
""Novartis has commenced a strategic review of the Sandoz Division,"" the Swiss-based group said in statement alongside quarterly results in which it lifted its peak revenue estimate for its two best-selling pharmaceuticals.
Sandoz achieved sales of $9.7 billion last year, about 20 percent of the group's total, but Novartis on Tuesday warned it expected the unit's operating income to fall faster than previously expected this year.
""The review will explore all options, ranging from retaining the business to separation, in order to determine how to best maximize value for our shareholders,"" the statement said. 
Novartis added it would have more to say on the review of Sandoz, which makes cheaper copies of drugs that have lost patent protection, by the end of next year.
""It's synergies versus freedom and the ability to allocate capital and all of these considerations will of course be undertaken now,"" Chief Executive Vas Narasimhan said in a media briefing.
He started setting up the generics business as an independent unit and slashing costs in early 2019, shortly after selling most of Sandoz's U.S. operations. Competitive pressures on prices, which have long been a burden, increased in the third quarter, with the U.S. market a particular challenge.
The company would not say whether rivals or financial investors might buy it, or whether Sandoz could be floated on the stock exchange.
Though the group's 2021 target for group earnings growth remained at a ""mid-single digit"" percentage rate, Novartis downgraded Sandoz's full-year outlook for operating income to a decline by a ""mid to high teens” percentage rate,"" worse than the ""low to midteens” seen previously.
CONSOLIDATION MODE 
""Given the continued drag on Novartis growth from Sandoz, the announcement of a strategic review is likely to be well received,"" JP Morgan analysts said in a research note.
Novartis shares gained 0.9% to 77.70 Swiss francs, while the STOXX Europe 600 Health Care index edged up 0.2%. 
The generic drugs industry has been in consolidation mode for years. The trend culminated in the creation of Viatris from the merger last year of Mylan (NASDAQ:VTRS) and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s Upjohn unit, which expects up to $17.9 billion in revenue in 2021. It is worth close to $17 billion on the stock market.
Israel's Teva and Sandoz, with roughly $10 billion in annual generic drug sales each, are runners-up in the sector. Other players include Perrigo, Sun Pharma and Aurobindo.
Novartis reiterated that Sandoz will need to invest in the launch of a raft of ""biosimilar"" drugs, which are cheaper versions of complex biotech drugs that have lost patent protection.
The group's third-quarter operating profit, adjusted for special items, rose 10% to $4.47 billion, driven by better-than-expected sales of arthritis and psoriasis drug Cosentyx and heart failure treatment Entresto.

It increased its peak sales guidance for Cosentyx to at least $7 billion from a goal of at least $5 billion previously, and for Entresto to at least $5 billion, from at least $4 billion.
Third-quarter sales rose 6% to $13.03 billion, in line with the average analyst estimate compiled by Refinitiv, while core net income increased 10% to $3.83 billion versus a market consensus of $3.7 billion.

984,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2021 06:25AM ET</span>",Facebook invests billions in metaverse efforts as ad business slows,"By Elizabeth Culliford and Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) -Facebook Inc said on Monday it will start publishing the financial results of its augmented and virtual reality labs as a separate unit, where it is investing billions in its ambitions to build the ""metaverse"" and as it reported that its main advertising business faces ""significant uncertainty.""
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which reported third-quarter profit up 17%, warned that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s new privacy changes would weigh on its digital business in the current quarter. The social media company reported quarterly revenue below market expectations, which Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg told analysts was due to the iOS changes.
David Wehner, Facebook's chief financial officer, said the company expected its investment in its hardware division, Facebook Reality Labs, to reduce overall operating profit in 2021 by approximately $10 billion. 
The financial commitment to this hardware-focused unit which will work on Facebook's ""metaverse"" ambitions, https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-sets-up-new-team-work-metaverse-2021-07-26 comes as the company is swamped by coverage of documents leaked by former Facebook employee and whistleblower Frances Haugen which she said showed the company chose profit over user safety. CEO Mark Zuckerberg started Monday's analyst call by issuing a defense against criticisms stemming from the documents, which he said painted a ""false picture of our company."" 
The CEO has said Facebook in the coming years will be seen not as a social media firm but as a company focused on the metaverse. The buzzy term refers broadly to a shared virtual environment which can be accessed by people using different devices.
Facebook, which has invested heavily in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), including buying companies like Oculus, this year created a product team to work on the metaverse. This month, it said it plans to hire 10,000 employees in Europe over the next five years to work on this initiative.
""This is not an investment that is going to be profitable for us any time in the near future,"" Zuckerberg told analysts. ""But we basically believe that the metaverse is going to be the successor to the mobile internet."" 
Wehner said that starting in the fourth quarter of 2021, it would break out Facebook Reality Labs as a separate reporting segment from Facebook's family of apps. 
Shares of the company were up about 1% in after-hours trade on Monday. Facebook, whose shares have gained about 20% so far this year, is about $85 billion away from regaining a spot on the $1 trillion club and joining new entrant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. 
RETOOLING 
The world's largest social media network is under scrutiny from global lawmakers and regulators, including from the Federal Trade Commission which has filed an antitrust lawsuit alleging anticompetitive practices.
The whistleblower documents, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, have intensified scrutiny of the company. They include internal research and reports about Instagram's effects on the mental health of teens and about whether Facebook's platforms stoke divisions, as well as its handling of activity around the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and inconsistencies in the company's content moderation for users around the globe. 
For the third quarter, Facebook reported monthly active users of 2.91 billion, up 6% from a year ago but short of analysts' estimates. 
On the call, executives emphasized the company's focus on attracting young adults, including through its short video feature ""Reels.""
""We are retooling our teams to make serving young adults their North Star rather than optimizing for the larger number of older people,"" said Zuckerberg, a shift he said would take ""years, not months, to fully execute.""
The leaked documents show Facebook's ongoing concerns about its appeal to younger users, as rivals like TikTok have enjoyed popularity with teens. They also show the company's difficulties in dealing with users who create multiple accounts on its platform. 
Facebook said it expects fourth-quarter revenue to be in a range of $31.5 billion to $34 billion. Analysts had forecast $34.84 billion in revenue, or a 24.1% jump, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Its third-quarter revenue too faced the brunt of Apple's privacy rules that made it harder for brands to target and measure their ads on Facebook. Sandberg, the COO, said Facebook expects it will solve ""more than half"" of the problems that led to the under-reporting by the end of this year.
""The changes to Apple privacy settings have not hurt Facebook in a major way, at least not yet,"" said Haris Anwar, an analyst at Investing.com. ""Though revenue and user numbers have taken a slight hit over the past quarter, the company’s earning power is still intact.""

The company's total revenue, which primarily consists of ad sales, rose to $29.01 billion in the third quarter from $21.47 billion a year earlier, missing analysts' estimates of $29.57 billion. Sandberg said Facebook's advertisers were also affected by the global supply-chain disruptions and labor shortages, which hurt advertising demand across a range of sectors and regions.
Facebook said it repurchased $14.37 billion in stock during the third quarter and announced an additional $50 billion in share buybacks.

986,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2021 06:16AM ET</span>","Global supply chain logjams, costs in focus as restaurant chains report earnings","By Hilary Russ
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors hope to gauge the impact of the global supply-chain logjam on restaurant expansion plans when McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD),  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Yum Brands Inc report capital expenditures in their earnings this week. 
Skyrocketing prices for kitchen equipment – as well as for labor, food and other goods – are prompting some U.S. restaurant chains to curtail opening plans despite consistently strong revenue growth. Some chains and their franchisees may put off remodeling or adding drive-thrus in the face of rising costs, restaurant consultant Aaron Allen told Reuters. 
Median capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue at publicly traded U.S. restaurant companies dropped to 3% in early May 2021 and remained at that level as of October compared with a ratio of 5% from 2017 to 2019, Allen said. 
 Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (NYSE:CMG) opened 41 new restaurants in the third quarter. CEO Brian Niccol told Reuters that aligns with plans to build 200 new locations in 2021, mostly in the United States, but without delays and higher costs for construction, labor and equipment, it might have been able to open ""well beyond"" that.
Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) Inc CEO Richard Allison said in an earnings call on Oct. 14 that problems getting kitchen equipment were a key factor in a number of store openings delayed in the third quarter. 
Globally, all sectors are expected to boost capital expenditures by 8.1% in 2021, according to a report from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s global economist. Restaurants are paying at least 10% more for some new equipment and waiting months for it to arrive. 
SURCHARGES AND LONG WAITS 
Italy-based equipment manufacturer Ali Group raised prices by 10% to 20% on some metal shelving and refrigerators over the past 18 months, said Rob August, senior vice president of manufacturer Ali Group North America. 
When Atosa USA's next price increases take effect on Nov. 1, one of its two-door refrigerators will be priced at $3,249 – 37% more than in January, according to a dealer. Atosa is a division of China's Yindu Kitchen Equipment Co Ltd.
Ice makers from Ali Group are now hard to find, the dealer said, and the wait for certain Pitco fryers from Middleby Corp has been as long as seven months, franchisees said. 
""We are experiencing unprecedented cost increases in material, freight and labor,"" a Middleby spokesperson said, noting that while wait times are longer than usual, seven months is not standard.

John Stack, president of A City Discount equipment dealer outside Atlanta, said most of the new and remodeled restaurants his company has designed have delayed openings because they cannot get equipment on time.

988,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2021 05:55AM ET</span>","Japan's Nidec raises profit outlook on strong auto, home appliance demand","TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's Nidec Corp increased its full-year earnings outlook by 6% on Tuesday, as the precision electric motor maker benefited from increased demand from home appliance makers, auto companies and others. 
The company expects a full-year operating profit of 190 billion yen ($1.6 billion) compared with an earlier forecast of 180 billion yen. That is lower than an average 192.2 billion yen prediction based on estimates from 20 analysts, according to Refinitiv data.
The Japanese company, which is known for building motors for computer hard drives and smartphones, is looking to tap the growing demand for electric vehicles with energy-saving electric car motors known as e-axles.
In April, Nidec said it was aiming to capture around a third of that growing market and already supplies e-axles to automakers including China's GAC Motor and France's  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP), competing against Germany's Bosch Ltd and  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) affiliate BluE.
To expand production capacity, Nidec is investing 200 billion yen over a decade to build a European production hub in Serbia, that in addition to making motors for electric vehicles will build motors for household appliances. 
The company's second-quarter operating profit rose 10% to 45.6 billion yen from a year earlier, worse than analysts' average estimate of 46.8 billion.
Pandemic restrictions in Vietnam cut the production of small precision motors and raised costs, Nidec chairman and founder, Shigenobu Nagamori, said at a briefing following the earnings release.

""Even if there is one infection in a factory with 5,000 workers authorities there will lock it down,"" Nagamori said.
Those production delays resulted in a 2.5 billion yen loss in the business segment for the second quarter, the company said.

Investing.com – Facebook stock (NASDAQ:FB) traded 3% higher in Tuesday’s premarket as the company notched up more active users during the third quarter and authorized an additional $50-billion buyback.
The company has guided for $31.5 billion-$34 billion in current-quarter revenue, which, while being below analysts’ forecasts, indicates that sequential growth is still possible despite more than a year of surge in pandemic-driven traffic.
Facebook will also spin off its augmented and virtual reality operations, giving more visibility into the investments it is making in the business. Those investments will shave $10 billion off the company’s operating profit this year.
Daily active users, or DAUs, a key metric advertisers use to determine the reach and effectiveness of a platform, rose to 2.81 billion. This was higher by around 11% year-on-year and up 2% on a sequential basis, reflecting that while the pandemic-driven surge is behind, its platforms are still managing to attract users. As per reports, CEO Mark Zuckerberg is focused on attracting younger people to its platforms as its earlier adopters age. This comes at a time when the company is under tight scrutiny from the Congress amid a whistleblower's charges that it prioritizes growth over safety and has knowingly ignored its own findings that its Instagram platform is toxic for young females.
Total revenue growth slowed to 35% on-year to $29 billion from over 50% in the first half and fell below analysts’ estimates. Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg told analysts if it weren't for Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iOS14 changes, the company “would have seen positive quarter-over-quarter revenue growth.""

990,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 26, 2021 05:36AM ET</span>","Earnings Peak May Have Been Reached, Citi Warns","(Bloomberg) -- This earnings season may be as good as it gets, according to  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).
Strategists led by Mert Genc say global earnings per share will rise only 5% in 2022, less than the current consensus for 7% growth and far below the 50% increase anticipated for 2021. Their projection comes after Citi economists downgraded their global growth forecast for next year to 4.2% from 4.4%.
Company analysts may soon shift to “net downgrade mode” for the first time since July 2020, which while “not necessarily fatal for markets” provides reason to be nervous, the strategists wrote in a note. Industries and countries that are most exposed to Chinese growth are the most vulnerable, they said, citing the mining sector, Australia and Germany.
Citi’s caution adds to a series of warnings by strategists that the seemingly unstoppable rally that has pushed U.S. and European stocks to successive records may be running out of steam. Bond yields are rising as central banks hit the brakes on stimulus measures, while the impact of a slowdown in China’s economy is becoming more pronounced.
UBS Global Wealth Management’s Chief Investment Officer Mark Haefele takes a more positive view. He sees a 9% global growth in earnings per share next year and further upside for equities against the backdrop of a continuing robust expansion of the world’s economies.
“We see the current issues as transitory rather than the makings of a new, stagflationary economic regime,” Haefele wrote in a note Tuesday.
Despite their differing outlooks, both Citi and Haefele recommend that investors buy financials -- either because they benefit from higher bond yields or as beneficiaries of economic expansion. And for both, healthcare is their preferred defensive sector, in case things turn sour.

991,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2021 05:31AM ET</span>",France's Thales maintains 2021 targets as Q3 sales slip,"PARIS (Reuters) - French defence group Thales reaffirmed full-year financial forecasts as it reported a 1.4% dip in underlying third-quarter sales, dampened by comparisons with the easing of a first wave of COVID-19 lockdowns a year earlier.
The maker of radars for fighters and airport control towers, as well as biometric identity systems, also reported a 9% pick-up in quarterly orders on a like-for-like basis, led by its satellite business and a partial recovery in commercial flying.
The gradual rebound in short-haul and domestic air travel helped push Thales' Aerospace unit sales up 4% in the third quarter, while its 'Digital Identity and Security' division also ticked higher as more people start to travel after shunning flights during the pandemic.
""For long-haul, the recovery will take much longer,"" Chief Financial Officer Pascal Bouchiat told reporters.
Overall, Thales' group sales slipped 1.4% to 3.555 billion euros ($4.1 billion) in the third quarter because of a tough basis of comparison with the same period a year earlier, while new orders rose by an underlying 9% to 2.992 billion.
Thales said it continued to implement the sale of its GTS railway signalling business after announcing advanced talks in August to sell it to Japan's Hitachi (OTC:HTHIY). The proposed deal values the division at 1.66 billion euros. 
On Tuesday, it said it expected to sign a definitive deal in the first quarter of 2022. For now, the group's 2020 and 2021 numbers have been adjusted to remove the outgoing unit.
Thales expects 2021 sales between 15.8 billion and 16.3 billion euros based on its structure as of August 2021, and an operating margin of 9.8% to 10.3%, with orders topping revenues.
The Paris-based company, which owns 35% of France's state-run Naval Group military shipyard, reiterated it did not expected a significant financial impact from the cancellation of a contract to supply Australia with French submarines. 
Australia last month said it would scrap a $40 billion deal for Naval Group to supply conventional submarines and would instead build at least eight nuclear-powered subs with U.S. and British technology after striking a trilateral security pact.
It remains unclear whether Thales could still pick up any business for the replacement subs via its presence in the UK.
""As to what a new submarine contract would look like, and whether our activities could be involved, that's much too early to say,"" Bouchiat said.
Asked about widespread concerns about growing labour shortages and logistical bottlenecks, Bouchiat said Thales faced ""a battle for talent"" alongside many other companies. 

He did not see significant supply chain bottlenecks, though a shortage of semi-conductors has cost the company some 20-30 million euros that it expects to recoup in the fourth quarter.

PARIS (Reuters) - French car parts maker Faurecia posted a more than 10% drop in third-quarter sales on Tuesday, as its customers cut production due to a global shortage of semiconductor chips.
The group, which supplies car seats, dashboards and fuel systems, reported sales of 3.43 billion euros ($4 billion), down from 3.82 billion in the same period of 2020. Its shares were down 1.9% at 41.52 euros by 0838 GMT.
However, Faurecia said it had outperformed the sector as a whole, citing October forecasts from information provider IHS Markit that showed a more than 19% decline in global auto output.
Car makers such as  Renault  (PA:RENA), Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Stellantis - some of Faurecia's biggest customers - have cut production targets due to the shortage, slowing demand for parts.
The supply chain issues have put the brakes on car makers' efforts to recover from last year's coronavirus lockdowns and shift towards making electric vehicles. 
In a call with analysts, finance chief Michel Favre said the company was asking for compensation when customers ""brutally"" cancelled orders with less than a day's notice. He didn't say what the response had been.
On top of chip shortages, Favre said Faurecia was also facing challenges from rising costs of steel and plastics.
He added that the company had a ""significant operational challenge"" from its new operations in Detroit and Michigan, largely due to difficulties in recruiting qualified workers, high staff turnover and rising salaries.
Faurecia reiterated its 2021 financial guidance, even if conditions remain very challenging at the end of the year. It had cut its guidance in September after IHS Markit's forecast of a global shortfall in automotive production. 
Stifel analyst Pierre-Yves Quemener said the company's annual revenue - guided at 15.5 billion euros - would depend on a pick-up in production through the end of the year, though the cash flow guidance seemed ""safe"".

Last week, IHS Markit estimated the supply chain problems would cost the automotive industry about 11 million vehicles this year.

(Reuters) - Higher vaccination rates and improved mobility during the third quarter drove strong demand for Mucinex cough syrups and Durex condoms, Reckitt Benckiser Group said on Tuesday, prompting it to raise its full-year forecast.
That sent its shares up 5.8% in morning trading, making it the top gainer on the FTSE index.
Sales of over-the-counter medicines rose more than 20% in the quarter, driven primarily by Mucinex cough and cold remedies after a strong cold and flu season saw sales across most of its markets come in at or above 2019 levels, it said.
Improved mobility in markets including India also saw the company gain share in sexual wellness products such as Durex, Chief Executive Laxman Narasimhan said on a media call.
That drove like-for-like sales up 3.3% in the quarter, compared to the 0.7% drop analysts had expected, according to company-supplied estimates, which excluded sales from the recently completed sale of its infant nutrition business in China. 
The company also raised its full-year net revenue like-for-like growth forecast to 1-3% from flat to 2% earlier, but cautioned that growth would be ""softer"" in the fourth quarter.
Like its peers, Reckitt said it was seeing a sharp rise in raw materials costs, which were up 10% in the quarter compared with an 8-9% rise it had estimated previously. 
Chief Financial Officer Jeff Carr said he expected inflation to be ""up a touch"" in the fourth quarter and possibly in the low double digits in 2022, but could not estimate when these higher costs would subside. 
""There will be another round of pricing we will take to offset the inflation,"" Narasimhan said, over and above the 1.7% hikes it took in the third quarter.
Domestos maker Unilever (NYSE:UL) last week also warned of another round of price hikes to battle fierce inflation.

Reckitt kept its adjusted operating profit margin forecast, excluding IFCN China, for the year in the range of 22.7% to 23.2%
Shares in the group were down 16% this year before the results, after hitting near-record levels in 2020.

ZURICH (Reuters) -UBS posted its highest quarterly profit since 2015 on Tuesday, as robust trading activity by the world's ultra wealthy led to a 23% surge in fee income.
The surprisingly strong results follow double-digit percent gains for net profit in each of the past four quarters and come as Switzerland's largest bank announced new plans for its digital push including a new advisory service for affluent U.S. clients.
Third-quarter net profit came in at $2.279 billion, easily surpassing a median estimate of a 24% slump to $1.596 billion from a poll of 23 analysts compiled by the bank.
""We continue to perform well above the financial targets that we have given you. And while we do that, we continue to be focused on driving growth on the top and the bottom line,"" Chief Executive Ralph Hamers said on a call with analysts.
The bank's flagship wealth management business posted its best pre-tax profit ever, soaring 43% on a 4% climb in income from transactions amongst its wealthy and ultra-wealthy clients as well as a 15% rise in net interest income due to higher lending levels and margins.
The division saw $18.8 billion in fresh client fee-generating inflows, while invested assets fell slightly from June to $3.198 trillion.
UBS's investment bank posted a steadier performance, with revenue edging 1% higher. Revenue in its equities trading unit was up 3% to $1.36 billion, but its foreign exchange, rates and credit arm posted a 32% drop in turnover to $363 million.
Revenue from advising on deals and listings jumped 22% to $792 million, helped by bumper M&A volumes.
The surprise profit comes on the heels of a stellar quarter for U.S. and British banks which, encouraged by economic rebounds, released cash set aside for pandemic losses. A record wave of dealmaking activity also bolstered results for the likes of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).
UBS shares were 1.4% higher in morning trade.
""The result marks another impressive quarter,"" Citi analysts said in a note to clients, adding that UBS remained one of their top picks in the banking sector and reiterating a buy rating on the stock.
It nonetheless sounded a slightly cautious note for the coming quarter, saying continued uncertainty surrounding economic recovery and recent policy changes in China could hurt business. It also noted client activity levels had been unusually high in the past quarter.
DIGITAL FLOURISH
CEO Hamers, who took the reins in November 2020 following a successful tenure at ING that made the Dutch lender more digitally savvy, said he planned to present an updated strategy on Feb. 1.
That will include new pushes into digital and hybrid banking.
UBS is trying to improve its digital services to reach more customers outside its super rich core client base, while also saving on costs. It sees potential for a new online platform to pull in $30 billion in the next year after being launched in May 2020, Reuters reported in June.
As part of its 2025 vision, it now wants to build a digitally scalable advice model for affluent clients in the Americas, which includes the core wealth market of the United States.
It also wants to expand its digital offerings in its home market, aiming to bring its cost/income ratio down to 55% in its Swiss business from 59% in the first nine months.

UBS derives the biggest chunk of its profits from advising and managing money for the world's rich, while also maintaining smaller global investment banking and asset management operations. It conducts retail and corporate banking only in its home market.
That model has helped Switzerland's largest lender exceed expectations since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, as buoyant markets helped it generate higher earnings off of managing money for the rich.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Tuesday, helped by strong numbers from Swiss banking giant UBS.
At 4:10 AM ET (0810 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.7% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.6%, climbing to a new 52-week high.
UBS (SIX:UBSG) stock rose 1.9% after the Swiss bank reported net profit of $2.3 billion in the third quarter, its highest quarterly profit in six years, and a 9% increase from the same period a year before as its wealth management division continued to boom.
These strong results followed on from Monday’s healthy numbers by U.K.-based rival HSBC (LON:HSBA), but neither can be seen as particularly good proxies for the European sector as a whole given their focus on Asia.
Earlier Tuesday, Asia markets pushed higher, helped by HSBC upgrading its call on Chinese stocks to overweight, saying investors had become too bearish on the market, while Wall Street closed Monday at new record levels.
Back in Europe,  Reckitt Benckiser  (LON:RKT) stock rose 5.5%, the maker of Lysol cleaning products raising its full-year forecast after reporting higher-than-expected third-quarter sales.
 Thales  (PA:TCFP) stock rose 0.2% after the French defence group reaffirmed its full-year financial forecasts even with a 1.4% dip in underlying third-quarter sales, while Swiss drugmaker  Novartis  (SIX:NOVN) stock climbed 1% as its third-quarter adjusted operating profit rose 10%.
On the flip side,  Faurecia  (PA:EPED) stock fell 3.1% after the French car parts maker reported a drop in third-quarter sales of over 10% from a year ago, as its customers cut production due to a global shortage in semiconductor chips.
There is little economic data to study in Europe Tuesday, but investors will be keeping an eye on a meeting of European Union ministers to discuss the recent spike in energy prices.
Crude prices stabilized Tuesday after the recent strong rally and ahead of the release of the latest U.S. stockpiles from the American Petroleum Institute, a guide to demand in the world’s biggest consumer of oil.
Oil prices have more than doubled over the last year, helped by strong demand in the United States, as the world’s largest economy recovers from the damage caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.
Crude oil stockpiles are expected to have risen by 1.7 million barrels last week, according to a Reuters poll, but gasoline and distillate inventories are expected to fall.
By 4:10 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% lower at $83.50 a barrel, while the Brent contract traded 0.1% lower at $85.08.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Draft EU rules to curb the power of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) unit Google and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) should also tackle providers of cloud computing services for possible anti-competitive practices, a study said on Tuesday.
The report comes amid concerns that some EU lawmakers who are reviewing the Digital Markets Act https://www.reuters.com/technology/tech-rules-not-just-few-giants-eus-vestager-says-2021-07-02 (DMA) proposed by EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager may be lenient towards cloud computing companies.
Amazon's Amazon Web Services was the leading provider in the second quarter, followed by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure and Google Cloud, market research company Statista found. Others include  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) Cloud,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Cloud, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL).
Frederic Jenny, chairman of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's Competition Committee, put together the study, in his personal capacity, for trade body Cloud Infrastructure Services Providers in Europe (CISPE).
The new EU rules should also cover software licensing, the report said, with respondents citing unfair terms imposed by some of the big software companies to access their cloud infrastructure. 
""The DMA does say that cloud infrastructure can come within the ambit of the DMA but it is not obvious that all the suppliers are covered,"" Jenny told Reuters in an interview.
""For example, it doesn't seem that Google Cloud qualifies under the DMA as a gatekeeper or IBM Cloud or Salesforce."" 
Potential anti-competitive practices by some companies could include unfair pricing techniques or efforts to make users' move to a rival technically difficult, he said.
Jenny said the study interviewed some 25 companies that use cloud computing services, some of which cited issues such as unfair licence terms that force customers to pay again to use software they already own when they move to a competitor.
Respondents were also concerned about providers bundling software products with their cloud infrastructure to make rival products either less attractive or more expensive.

Google, Oracle and SAP declined to comment. Microsoft and Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
EU lawmakers have to thrash out the draft DMA with EU countries before it becomes law, possibly in 2023.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)... and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). We now have a trillion-dollar EV firm whose 10% surge on Monday lifted Wall Street to new record highs -- electric vehicles going mainstream is perhaps encouraging news ahead of the COP26 environment summit. 
The news was less cheerful from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) which is contending with whistleblowers and falling popularity among the young. But a $50 billion buyback plan, unveiled after market close, may be enough to lift the shares on Tuesday, especially if fellow tech titans Google, Microsoft and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) also post upbeat figures. 
All in all, the global equity index is inching back towards the record highs hit early-September. U.S. stock futures pointing north for Tuesday and Japanese markets added 1.8%. In Europe, a surprise 9% profit boost at UBS -- its highest in six years -- could see the pan-European banking index rally further past April 2019 highs. 
But the supply-chain snarl-ups, container traffic jams and chip shortages bedevilling companies worldwide show no signs of going away any time soon.
Just take carmaker Hyundai, which missed profit estimates and predicted that the chip shortages hampering output would take a long time to fix. And French car parts maker Faurecia saw Q3 sales drop 10% as semiconductor shortages forced its customers to cut production.
Then there is the prospect of central bank policy tightening, with the Bank of England looking set to join rate-hike club next month. 
It all adds up to slower economic growth and earnings, Citi reckons. That could see buy-side analysts switching to net ""downgrade"" mode on stock recommendations for the first time since the pandemic first hit, it added. 
And don't forget China, where another developer Modern Land missed paying a bond due on Monday. Shanghai and Hong Kong shares fell, despite gains for EV firms.

PARIS (Reuters) -French telecoms operator Orange's quarterly profit was hit by lower returns from co-financing deals to deploy networks, it said on Tuesday. 
Like other European operators, the state-controlled former monopoly struggles to maintain strong upward momentum in earnings, caught between the need to upgrade networks while contending with fierce competition in France and Spain, its biggest markets.
Third-quarter earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation after leases (EBITDAaL) dropped by 0.7% from a year earlier to 3.55 billion euros ($4.13 billion) despite increasing customer numbers in France and Spain.
Orange has signed deals with French rivals such as  Bouygues  (PA:BOUY) Telecom and Iliad's Free to help it to deploy broadband fibre networks, adding revenue to the group's regular sale of mobile and broadband contracts. 
Under such co-financing deals, Orange receives payments from rivals in exchange of the right to use the networks. 
Lower returns from these deals explains a 4.1% drop in Orange's sales in France, Chief Financial Officer Ramon Fernandez told reporters. 
Over the July to September period, Orange managed to add 121,000 customers for its mobile business in France, plus 80,000 new broadband customers. 
It also added new clients for both businesses in Spain, where it took a 3.7 billion euro writedown in the second quarter to reflect the market's decreasing value.
Orange reiterated its full-year targets, including a slight decline in core operating profit and underlying cash flow from telecoms activities of more than 2.2 billion euros, down from 2.5 billion euros in 2020.
It also reiterated its targets for 2023, which include underlying cash flow from telecom activities of 3.5 billion to 4 billion euros.

Orange Chief Executive Stephane Richard has told French weekly JDD he would be willing to stay on as group chairman when his third four-year mandate as CEO ends in May 2022.

1003,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2021 03:11AM ET</span>","Australia's Crown branded 'disgraceful', gets two years to fix Melbourne casino","By Shashwat Awasthi and Byron Kaye
SYDNEY (Reuters) -An Australian inquiry on Tuesday declared Crown Resorts unsuitable to hold a gambling licence in Melbourne but allowed it to run its biggest-earning casino under supervision, raising hope for its earnings and takeover prospects.
After months of hearings in which the casino operator was accused of enabling money laundering and misleading regulators, a Royal Commission called Crown's actions ""disgraceful"" in a report published on Tuesday by the Victorian state government.
The company 37%-owned by billionaire James Packer had acted in a way which was ""illegal, dishonest, unethical and exploitative"", the report said. Some actions were ""so callous that it is hard to imagine it could be engaged in by such a well-known corporation"".
But rather than shut down Crown's flagship casino, the commission recommended letting it continue to operate the resort for two years under supervision.
It also recommended boosting the maximum penalty for casino wrongdoing to A$100 million ($75 million), from A$1 million, and forcing Packer to cut his holding to 5% by September 2024, meaning he must sell 32% of the company by then.
Crown CEO Steve McCann said in a statement the casino operator was working to repair its culture and would ""emerge as a stronger and more transparent company"".
A spokesperson for Packer was not immediately available for comment.
The report sent a rush of relief through investors who have seen takeover approaches evaporate and the share price dive in anticipation of the loss of its licence to operate the Melbourne resort, which delivers three-quarters of Crown's profit.
Crown shares closed up 9%, against a flat overall market. The stock is down 17% since early 2020 when COVID-19 restrictions forced full or partial closures of its casinos and kept foreign tourists out of the country.
The stock price of smaller rival Star Entertainment Group Ltd, which had binned a Crown buyout approach due to uncertainty about Crown's future, also rose. Star is now under investigation over similar matters.
John Ayoub, a portfolio manager at Wilson Asset Management, which has Crown shares, said potential buyers of Crown ""can run the rulers and see what it's worth again"".
Nathan Bell, a portfolio manager at Investsmart, which owns Crown shares, said the company's pivotal role in the Victorian economy and ""the fact Crown's key board members and CEO departed may have helped it get a second chance"".
Victoria's biggest single-site employer with 11,500 employees at the Melbourne complex, Crown has replaced its chairman, CEO, most of its board and senior management since regulators in three states began holding inquiries into its governance in 2020.
Packer also removed his designated nominees from the board after a separate inquiry in New South Wales found he held improper influence. 
'STRINGENT OVERSIGHT'
Victoria's minister for gaming regulation, Melissa Horne, said the state government would accept all of the report's recommendations.
""We are creating the most stringent oversight of any casino in the country. No longer will Crown's destiny be theirs to manage,"" Horne told reporters.
An independent manager would be able to investigate the Melbourne casino's operations, direct the board and veto its decisions, and inspect the books, the government said.
Earlier this year, the NSW inquiry led to the freezing of Crown's licence for a new A$2.1 billion casino tower in Sydney. A third inquiry into Crown's remaining casino, in Perth city, is ongoing.
As with the other two, the Melbourne inquiry heard detailed accounts of Crown enabling money laundering and failing to act on regulatory concerns.

Fitch Ratings analyst Kelly Amato said the Melbourne licence could be ""presumed cancelled in two years"" if the regulator felt the company had not reformed itself.

Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and leases (EBITDAL) came in at 607 million euros ($706 million) for the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with 598 million euros a year earlier and expectations of 606 million euros in a company-compiled poll.
""We see a healthy customer inflow in consumer and business (operations), especially in mobile,"" Chief Executive Officer Joost Farwerck said in a statement.
Revenue increased by 1% to 1.31 billion euros as growth in mobile customers and broadband connections offset a multi-year decline in sales to business customers, which slowed to 2.3%.
KPN, which is targeting a full-year 2021 EBITDAL growth of 1% to 2.345 billion euros, had said in July it would repurchase 200 million euros of shares this year.
With fund assistance from civil servants' pension fund ABP, KPN is spending more than a billion euros annually to roll out fibre optics to 80% of Dutch households by the end of 2024, its biggest infrastructure investment programme in two decades.
KPN saw its shares slump in May when Farwerck said the company had rejected two takeover approaches because it did not believe private equity suitors EQT (NYSE:EQT) or KKR would offer any improvement on its own strategy.
KPN, which competes with VodafoneZiggo and T-Mobile Netherlands, saw its shares recover in September when private equity investors Apax Partners and Warburg Pincus -- rather than a strategic international competitor -- agreed to buy the T-Mobile Dutch operations for 5.1 billion euros.

Shares of KPN are up 9.1% year-to-date, and closed on Monday at 2.71 euros.

1006,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2021 02:15AM ET</span>",BlackRock creates biggest climate exchange-traded fund range,"By Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - Asset manager BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) said on Tuesday it had created the largest range of climate-aligned exchange-traded equity funds (EFT) after agreeing to tighter rules to govern six existing funds with $9 billion in assets.
Following consultations with BlackRock, the MSCI indexes that underpin BlackRock's iShares ESG Enhanced UCITS ETF range will follow the European Union's Climate Transition Benchmark, established to help cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7°Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial norms.
The CTB requires a 30% reduction in carbon intensity - a measure of emissions to revenue - against the MSCI benchmark and a 7% year-on-year decarbonisation of the benchmark itself. 
For the first time, Scope 3 emissions that cover the emissions produced by the use of a company's products, and not just those produced by the company itself, will be included.
In addition to the CTB, BlackRock said tougher environmental filters would be applied when deciding what to include in the ETFs. It will widen an oil sands exclusion to include a broader array of unconventional oil and gas activities.
The funds will exclude any company making 5% or more of its revenues from oil sands, shale gas, shale oil, coal-seam gas, coal-bed methane and Arctic onshore/offshore reserves.
An ""environmental harm"" screen will also be applied from November 2022 to companies that have faced severe or very severe controversies relating to environmental issues, such as land use and biodiversity, toxic spills and water management, it said.
Unlike BlackRock's iShares MSCI World Paris-Aligned Climate UCITS ETF fund range, which drills down into each constituent stock to make sure it's aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate, the Enhanced funds will seek to meet the same goal at the portfolio level.

As a result, the number of stocks eligible for inclusion in each fund is more than double that of the Paris-Aligned funds, at 1,385 compared with 685. 
This allows the funds to have a much closer risk-return profile to the parent index and potentially be more attractive to wealth managers keen to invest more sustainably but worried about diverging from the returns of the parent.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to edge higher Tuesday, helped by strong numbers from Swiss banking giant UBS.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.2% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.2% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.1%.
UBS (SIX:UBSG) reported net profit of $2.3 billion in the third quarter, up from $2 billion in the previous quarter and a 9% increase from the same period a year before, as its wealth management division continued to boom.
These strong results may boost the heavily-weighted banking sector Tuesday, especially after Monday’s healthy numbers from U.K.-based rival HSBC (LON:HSBA) - even if neither is a particularly good proxy for the European sector as a whole, given their focus on Asia.
Earlier Tuesday, Asia markets pushed higher, helped by HSBC upgrading its call on Chinese stocks to overweight, saying investors had become too bearish on the market, while Wall Street closed Monday at new record levels.
Back in Europe, French car parts maker  Faurecia  (PA:EPED) reported a drop in third-quarter sales of over 10% from a year ago, as its customers cut production due to a global shortage in semiconductor chips.
 Thales  (PA:TCFP) reaffirmed its full-year financial forecasts even as the French defence group reported a 1.4% dip in underlying third-quarter sales, while Swiss drugmaker  Novartis ' (SIX:NOVN) third-quarter adjusted operating profit rose 10%.
 Carrefour  (PA:CARR) will also be in the spotlight after Europe’s largest retailer announced plans to partner with Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) to launch a new rapid grocery delivery service in Paris.
There is little economic data to study in Europe Tuesday, but investors will be keeping an eye on a meeting of European Union ministers to discuss the recent spike in energy prices.
Crude prices stabilized Tuesday after the recent strong rally and ahead of the release of the latest U.S. stockpiles from the American Petroleum Institute, a guide to demand in the world’s biggest consumer of oil.
Oil prices have more than doubled over the last year, helped by strong demand in the United States, as the world’s largest economy recovers from the damage caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.
Crude oil stockpiles are expected to have risen by 1.7 million barrels last week, according to a Reuters poll, but gasoline and distillate inventories are expected to fall.
By 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% lower at $83.64 a barrel, while the Brent contract traded flat at $85.17.
Additionally, gold futures traded flat at $1,806.30/oz, while EUR/USD traded just lower at 1.1603.

SEOUL (Reuters) -SK Hynix forecast steady demand for memory chips on Tuesday as it posted its highest quarterly operating profit in nearly three years on the back of rising prices, striking a more bullish note than rivals including Micron (NASDAQ:MU).
SK Hynix and other other chipmakers have been hit by slowing personal computer sales after a pandemic-led surge, but the South Korean company said supply bottlenecks had created pent-up demand for PC chips that could boost sales next year.
""There have been a lot of uncertainties recently, but I think memory is still doing business at a level that provides good supply and predictability compared to other semiconductors,"" SK Hynix's chief financial officer, Kevin Noh, told an earnings call. 
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) said earlier this month shortages of other chips were stopping its customers from shipping PCs and servers, echoing comments from Micron. 
Corporate demand and changing hybrid working environments would also underpin PC chip demand, said SK Hynix, which trails only Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd in DRAM chips used for temporary storage in PCs, servers and mobile devices.
An expected replacement cycle of equipment bought by data centres during 2017-2018 will create demand for server chips, Hynix added. 
SK Hynix shares rose 3% on Tuesday compared with a 0.6% rise in the wider market. 
Operating profit rose to 4.2 trillion won ($3.6 billion) in the July-September quarter, up from 1.3 trillion won a year earlier, SK Hynix said.
That was its highest quarterly profit since the fourth quarter of 2018, and above a Refinitiv Smartestimate of 4.1 trillion won from 18 analysts. 
The Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier's NAND business turned profitable for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2018, analysts said. NAND chips are used for permanent storage in mobile devices and servers.
SK Hynix said it expected Chinese regulators to approve its deal to buy Intel's NAND business this year.
Analysts said the company had improved the yield of its 128-layer NAND flash chips that serve the data storage market, which would propel shipments.

SK Hynix said third-quarter revenue rose 45% on-year to a record 11.8 trillion won.

Digital World Acquisition, a Miami-based special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), fell 10.98%, its first declining session since announcing Wednesday it would merge with Trump's media company to create a social media app called TRUTH Social.
The stock surged following the announcement and remains up over 700% since the deal was unveiled.

“We are short $DWAC. Now that initial excitement has passed, we see only risks for investors in near future. Based on Trump's track record, at current price, renegotiation is likely to keep more of the merged company for him,” Iceberg Research tweeted. 
Iceberg, which publishes a blog with its research on Wordpress, gained attention in 2015 for highlighting what it called aggressive accounting practices at Hong Kong-based commodities trader Noble Group. Noble denied the allegations but subsequently saw its profits collapse and was forced to sell most of its assets.
The company said earlier this year that it was short popular meme stock AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings.

1015,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2021 08:40PM ET</span>",Analysis: Capitol Hill drug pricing reform opponents among the biggest beneficiaries of pharma funds,"By Ahmed Aboulenein and Carl O'Donnell
(Reuters) - Democratic Party lawmakers holding up proposed drug pricing reforms are among the largest beneficiaries of the pharmaceutical industry's push to stave off price cuts, a Reuters analysis of public lobbying and campaign data shows.
The industry, which traditionally gives more to Republicans, channeled around 60% of donated campaign funds to Democrats this year. It has spent over $177 million on lobbying and campaign donations in 2021.
Nonprofit political action committees (PACs) run by  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and  Amgen Inc  (NASDAQ:AMGN) and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) were among the biggest donors, according to political spending data from OpenSecrets, formerly the Center for Responsive Politics. 
Drugmakers are seeking to block laws that would give the U.S. government authority to negotiate prices for prescription medicines. Current U.S. law bars the government's Medicare health insurance program from negotiating drug prices directly.
Many of the Democrats opposing an ambitious drug reduction bill proposed in the House of Representatives are among some of the biggest recipients of drug manufacturer lobbying funds.
They include Senators Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, Robert Menendez of New Jersey, and Representative Scott Peters of California, OpenSecrets data covering industry donations through September of 2021 shows. In all, they have received around $1 million in pharmaceutical and health product industry donations this year. 
A spokesperson for Sinema did not respond to a request for comment on the funds she has received but said the Senator supports making drugs as cheap as possible for patients.
Menendez and Peters said the donations did not influence their views. All three said they are opposed to The Lower Drug Costs Now Act, which is sponsored by Democrats in the House of Representatives and also known as H.R.3.
Menendez and Peters have advocated for alternative scaled-back drug pricing reforms that would still allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices but would lead to significantly smaller savings.
Congressman Frank Pallone of New Jersey, who is also one of the top recipients of drugmaker donations, voted in favor of H.R.3. 
Sinema, who campaigned in 2018 on cutting drug prices, told the White House she opposes allowing Medicare to negotiate them. She received about $466,000 from the industry in 2021, according to OpenSecrets data. 
Peters was the top recipient of pharmaceutical industry funds in the House this year at nearly $99,550, according to OpenSecrets data. A spokesperson said Peters was not influenced by lobbying money and opposed the proposed law to protect pharmaceutical industry jobs and innovation.  
Drugmakers say the Democrats’ proposed drug price overhaul would undermine their ability to develop new medicines, an argument they have used whenever price cuts are discussed by politicians regardless of political party. 
""Patients face a future with less hope under Congress' current drug pricing plan,"" PhRMA Chief Executive Steve Ubl said in an August statement in reference to the proposed law. PhRMA declined to comment on donating to key Democratic opponents of the bill.
The United States is an outlier as most other developed nations do negotiate drug prices with manufacturers.
Amgen did not immediately respond to requests for comment on its donations and Pfizer declined to comment.
PROSPECTS FOR REFORM
President Joe Biden has vowed to cut medicine costs, in part by allowing the federal government to negotiate drug payments by Medicare, which covers Americans aged 65 and older.
But prospects for major drug pricing reforms have stalled in recent weeks amid opposition from centrist Democrats including Sinema and Peters. Negotiations are ongoing, eight Democratic staffers said.
The lawmakers' resistance comes as 83% of Americans support allowing Medicare to negotiate medicine costs, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll. The United States spends more than twice as much per person on drugs as other wealthy economies, about $1,500, for a total of around $350 billion in 2019.
""Members of Congress don't always mirror the views of the public and the pharmaceutical industry is a powerful lobbying force,"" said Larry Levitt, a health economist at Kaiser. 
The healthcare industry is the second largest industry lobbying group in the United States behind the finance sector. It donated more than $600 million to politicians ahead of the 2020 elections. 
The pharmaceutical industry has spent hundreds of millions of dollars per year to sway federal and state policy. But current Democratic leadership has the industry concerned major reforms could actually be enacted and is working harder to offer alternatives such as reducing insurance co-pays, one industry source said. ""It's been sort of a mad scramble.""  
Corporations in the United States are not permitted to make direct contributions to candidates but can give money through PACs. Most corporate PACs, including Pfizer’s and Amgen’s, are run by company managers and employees. 
Democrats and some drug price experts say the Lower Drug Costs Now Act could save U.S. taxpayers and consumers billions annually with relatively minor impact on innovation.

A House Oversight and Reform Committee report showed that top drugmakers have spent around $50 billion more on share buybacks and dividends than research and development between 2016 and 2020.
Lovisa Gustafsson, a healthcare policy analyst at the Commonwealth Fund, a non-profit healthcare advocacy group, said, ""There are other ways that we can incentivize innovation, aside from just paying huge margins for pharmaceutical companies.”

Tesla Inc jumped 12.66% to its own new high of $1,045.02 and breached $1 trillion in market capitalization, after car rental firm Hertz placed an order for 100,000 Tesla cars, while  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) raised its price target on the stock to $1,200 from $900 per share.
""Tesla, there is a lot of the chatter out there today and Hertz placing a big order has created some excitement,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York.
Tesla, which has risen in nine of the past ten sessions and is up more than 28% for the month, provided the biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. Also helping to lift the two indexes was PayPal Inc, which gained 2.70% after the payments company scrapped plans to buy the digital pinboard site Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) Inc for as much as $45 billion. Shares of Pinterest slumped 12.71%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 64.13 points, or 0.18%, to 35,741.15, the S&P 500 gained 21.58 points, or 0.47%, to 4,566.48 and the Nasdaq Composite added 136.51 points, or 0.9%, to 15,226.71.
U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday held out hope for an agreement on his major spending plans before attending a climate summit in Scotland, while the White House said Democratic negotiators were closing in on a deal.
The majority of the 11 major S&P sectors advanced, with energy and consumer discretionary shares the best performing, as energy names received a boost from another rise in oil prices to multiyear highs on tight supply.
Shares of  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) were up 1.26% ahead of its quarterly results. Investor fears that like  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP), the social media giant's ad revenue could face the brunt of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s privacy changes appeared warranted as the social media company warned the rules would weigh on its digital business in the fourth quarter when it reported results after the closing bell. Its shares rose 2.95% in extended trade in choppy trading. 
Other mega-cap names scheduled to report this week include Apple,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. 
This week, 165 components of the S&P 500 are expected to post quarterly results, according to Refinitiv data. Analysts expect earnings at S&P 500 companies to grow 34.8% year-on-year for the third quarter.
Investors are also assessing how companies are navigating supply-chain bottlenecks, labor shortages and inflationary pressures to sustain growth. Of the 119 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings through Monday morning, 83.2% have topped analysts' expectations. 
""We are obviously in the heart of earnings season here, and that is a lot of what is going on and earnings are coming in better than expected and there was real fear we would see some bad earnings reports because of supply-chain issues and reduced outlooks, again because of supply-chain issues. So far, so good,"" said Ghriskey. 
Shares of Kimberley-Clark declined 2.20% after the Huggies diaper maker cut its 2021 profit outlook due to higher input cost inflation.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.91-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.76-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 78 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 161 new highs and 87 new lows. 
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.89 billion shares, compared with the 10.41 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

1017,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 25, 2021 07:45PM ET</span>",Stocks Gain Before Earnings; Oil Drops From High: Markets Wrap,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks rose to another record high as traders geared for a string of earnings reports from technology heavyweights including  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)., while keeping in mind inflation concerns and rising Covid-19 risks.
Consumer discretionary, energy and materials sectors led the S&P 500 to an all-time high.  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL). rose after the company said it isn’t pursuing an acquisition of Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) Inc., ending days of speculation over a potential $45 billion deal. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. advanced after receiving an order for 100,000 cars from Hertz Global Holdings (OTC:HTZGQ) Inc. Still to come: the five largest U.S. technology companies are set to report earnings, starting with Facebook on Monday.
“This year, broad market indices have benefited from robust earnings growth—the rising tide lifts all boats adage has been in full effect,” said Principal Global Investors Chief Strategist Seema Shah. “But as the economy slows and market conditions become more challenging, selectivity will be key. Staying overweight equities, with a focus on factors such as quality, will be increasingly important for investors aiming to balance portfolios in the market environment ahead.”
Oil pared gains after hitting $85 a barrel for the first time since 2014 with traders focused on upcoming talks between Iran and the European Union that may lead to a revival of a 2015 nuclear deal.  
Yields on shorter-maturity Treasuries fell and the dollar edged higher after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell flagged that inflation could stay higher for longer, fueling investor concern that sticky price increases may force policy makers to raise borrowing costs. Gold advanced above $1,800 an ounce. 
Global equities have remained resilient despite risks from price pressures stoked by supply-chain bottlenecks and higher energy costs. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is among those counseling the inflation situation reflects temporary pain that will ease in the second half of 2022. Investors are wary that tighter monetary policy to keep inflation in check will stir volatility.       
Traders are also monitoring an outbreak of the delta virus strain in China that is expected to worsen. The nation sought to allay concerns about the economy’s slowdown with a lengthy state media commentary outlining how the government is managing risks and remains confident about achieving its targets for the year.
The Stoxx Europe 600 index edged higher. The basic-resources sector advanced as crude oil and metals rose earlier, while banks increased on HSBC Holdings (NYSE:HSBC) Plc’s bright outlook.

1018,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2021 07:40PM ET</span>",Comedian Dave Chappelle addresses Netflix transgender controversy in full for first time,"By Helen Coster
(Reuters) - Editor's note: Attention to strong language in paragraph 4 that could offend some readers
Comedian Dave Chappelle on Monday addressed the transgender controversy at Netflix https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/netflix-workers-stage-walk-out-over-chappelle-transgender-comments-2021-10-20 in full for the first time on a video on his Instagram account, five days after about 100 people protested near the streaming company’s headquarters.
The employee backlash began after Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) decided to release Chappelle’s new comedy special, ""The Closer,"" which critics say ridicules transgender people. 
“It’s been said in the press that I was invited to speak to transgender employees at Netflix and I refused,” Chappelle said in the video. “That is not true. If they had invited me I would have accepted it. Although I am confused about what we are speaking about ... You said you want a safe working environment at Netflix. Well it seems like I’m the only one that can’t go to the office anymore.”
“I want everyone in this audience to know that even though the media frames this as me versus that community, it’s not what it is,” Chappelle said. “Do not blame the LBGTQ community for any of this shit. This has nothing to do with them. It’s about corporate interest and what I can say and what I cannot say.”
Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos stoked further unrest with an Oct. 11 staff memo in which he acknowledged Chappelle’s provocative language in ""The Closer"" but said it did not cross the line into inciting violence. 
In interviews before the walkout, Sarandos acknowledged “I screwed up” in how he spoke to Netflix’s staff about the special.

In Monday’s video, Chappelle said that after the controversy he began getting disinvited from film festivals that had accepted a documentary he made last summer, and that he is now making that documentary available in ten American cities. 
“Thank god for Ted Sarandos and Netflix,” Chappelle said. “He’s the only one who didn’t cancel me yet.”

1019,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2021 07:31PM ET</span>","Facebook knew about, failed to police, abusive content globally - documents","By Elizabeth Culliford and Brad Heath
(Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) employees have warned for years that as the company raced to become a global service it was failing to police abusive content in countries where such speech was likely to cause the most harm, according to interviews with five former employees and internal company documents viewed by Reuters.
For over a decade, Facebook has pushed to become the world's dominant online platform. It currently operates in more than 190 countries and boasts more than 2.8 billion monthly users who post content in more than 160 languages. But its efforts to prevent its products from becoming conduits for hate speech, inflammatory rhetoric and misinformation - some which has been blamed for inciting violence - have not kept pace with its global expansion. 
Internal company documents viewed by Reuters show Facebook has known that it hasn't hired enough workers who possess both the language skills and knowledge of local events needed to identify objectionable posts from users in a number of developing countries. The documents also showed that the artificial intelligence systems Facebook employs to root out such content frequently aren't up to the task, either; and that the company hasn't made it easy for its global users themselves to flag posts that violate the site's rules.
Those shortcomings, employees warned in the documents, could limit the company's ability to make good on its promise to block hate speech and other rule-breaking posts in places from Afghanistan to Yemen. 
In a review posted to Facebook's internal message board last year regarding ways the company identifies abuses on its site, one employee reported ""significant gaps"" in certain countries at risk of real-world violence, especially Myanmar and Ethiopia.
The documents are among a cache of disclosures made to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Congress by Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen, a former Facebook product manager who left the company in May. Reuters was among a group of news organizations able to view the documents, which include presentations, reports and posts shared on the company’s internal message board. Their existence was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. 
Facebook spokesperson Mavis Jones said in a statement that the company has native speakers worldwide reviewing content in more than 70 languages, as well as experts in humanitarian and human rights issues. She said these teams are working to stop abuse on Facebook's platform in places where there is a heightened risk of conflict and violence. 
""We know these challenges are real and we are proud of the work we've done to date,"" Jones said.
Still, the cache of internal Facebook documents offers detailed snapshots of how employees in recent years have sounded alarms about problems with the company's tools - both human and technological - aimed at rooting out or blocking speech that violated its own standards. The material expands upon Reuters' previous reporting https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/myanmar-facebook-hate on Myanmar and other countries https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-india-content/facebook-a-megaphone-for-hate-against-indian-minorities-idUSKBN1X929F, where the world's largest social network has failed repeatedly to protect users from problems on its own platform and has struggled to monitor content across languages. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-languages-insight-idUSKCN1RZ0DW
Among the weaknesses cited were a lack of screening algorithms for languages used in some of the countries Facebook has deemed most ""at-risk"" for potential real-world harm and violence stemming from abuses on its site. 
The company designates countries ""at-risk"" based on variables including unrest, ethnic violence, the number of users and existing laws, two former staffers told Reuters. The system aims to steer resources to places where abuses on its site could have the most severe impact, the people said.
Facebook reviews and prioritizes these countries every six months in line with United Nations guidelines aimed at helping companies prevent and remedy human rights abuses in their business operations, spokesperson Jones said. 
In 2018, United Nations experts investigating a brutal campaign of killings and expulsions against Myanmar's Rohingya Muslim minority said Facebook was widely used to spread hate speech toward them. That prompted the company to increase its staffing in vulnerable countries, a former employee told Reuters. Facebook has said it should have done more to prevent the platform being used to incite offline violence in the country.
Ashraf Zeitoon, Facebook's former head of policy for the Middle East and North Africa, who left in 2017, said the company's approach to global growth has been ""colonial,"" focused on monetization without safety measures.
More than 90% of Facebook's monthly active users are outside the United States or Canada.
LANGUAGE ISSUES
Facebook has long touted the importance of its artificial-intelligence (AI) systems, in combination with human review, as a way of tackling objectionable and dangerous content on its platforms. Machine-learning systems can detect such content with varying levels of accuracy.
But languages spoken outside the United States, Canada and Europe have been a stumbling block for Facebook's automated content moderation, the documents provided to the government by Haugen show. The company lacks AI systems to detect abusive posts in a number of languages used on its platform. In 2020, for example, the company did not have screening algorithms known as ""classifiers"" to find misinformation in Burmese, the language of Myanmar, or hate speech in the Ethiopian languages of Oromo or Amharic, a document showed. 
These gaps can allow abusive posts to proliferate in the countries where Facebook itself has determined the risk of real-world harm is high.
Reuters this month found posts in Amharic, one of Ethiopia's most common languages, referring to different ethnic groups as the enemy and issuing them death threats. A nearly year-long conflict in the country between the Ethiopian government and rebel forces in the Tigray region has killed thousands of people and displaced more than 2 million. 
Facebook spokesperson Jones said the company now has proactive detection technology to detect hate speech in Oromo and Amharic and has hired more people with ""language, country and topic expertise,"" including people who have worked in Myanmar and Ethiopia. 
In an undated document, which a person familiar with the disclosures said was from 2021, Facebook employees also shared examples of ""fear-mongering, anti-Muslim narratives"" spread on the site in India, including calls to oust the large minority Muslim population there. ""Our lack of Hindi and Bengali classifiers means much of this content is never flagged or actioned,"" the document said. Internal posts and comments by employees this year also noted the lack of classifiers in the Urdu and Pashto languages to screen problematic content posted by users in Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan. 
Jones said Facebook added hate speech classifiers for Hindi in 2018 and Bengali in 2020, and classifiers for violence and incitement in Hindi and Bengali this year. She said Facebook also now has hate speech classifiers in Urdu but not Pashto. 
Facebook's human review of posts, which is crucial for nuanced problems like hate speech, also has gaps across key languages, the documents show. An undated document laid out how its content moderation operation struggled with Arabic-language dialects of multiple ""at-risk"" countries, leaving it constantly ""playing catch up."" The document acknowledged that, even within its Arabic-speaking reviewers, ""Yemeni, Libyan, Saudi Arabian (really all Gulf nations) are either missing or have very low representation.""
Facebook's Jones acknowledged that Arabic language content moderation ""presents an enormous set of challenges."" She said Facebook has made investments in staff over the last two years but recognizes ""we still have more work to do.""
Three former Facebook employees who worked for the company’s Asia Pacific and Middle East and North Africa offices in the past five years told Reuters they believed content moderation in their regions had not been a priority for Facebook management. These people said leadership did not understand the issues and did not devote enough staff and resources.
Facebook's Jones said the California company cracks down on abuse by users outside the United States with the same intensity applied domestically.
The company said it uses AI proactively to identify hate speech in more than 50 languages. Facebook said it bases its decisions on where to deploy AI on the size of the market and an assessment of the country's risks. It declined to say in how many countries it did not have functioning hate speech classifiers.
Facebook also says it has 15,000 content moderators reviewing material from its global users. ""Adding more language expertise has been a key focus for us,"" Jones said. 
In the past two years, it has hired people who can review content in Amharic, Oromo, Tigrinya, Somali, and Burmese, the company said, and this year added moderators in 12 new languages, including Haitian Creole. 
Facebook declined to say whether it requires a minimum number of content moderators for any language offered on the platform. 
LOST IN TRANSLATION
Facebook's users are a powerful resource to identify content that violates the company's standards. The company has built a system for them to do so, but has acknowledged that the process can be time consuming and expensive for users in countries without reliable internet access. The reporting tool also has had bugs, design flaws and accessibility issues for some languages, according to the documents and digital rights activists who spoke with Reuters.
Next Billion Network, a group of tech civic society groups working mostly across Asia, the Middle East and Africa, said in recent years it had repeatedly flagged problems with the reporting system to Facebook management. Those included a technical defect that kept Facebook's content review system from being able to see objectionable text accompanying videos and photos in some posts reported by users. That issue prevented serious violations, such as death threats in the text of these posts, from being properly assessed, the group and a former Facebook employee told Reuters. They said the issue was fixed in 2020.
Facebook said it continues to work to improve its reporting systems and takes feedback seriously.
Language coverage remains a problem. A Facebook presentation from January, included in the documents, concluded ""there is a huge gap in the Hate Speech reporting process in local languages"" for users in Afghanistan. The recent pullout of U.S. troops there after two decades has ignited an internal power struggle in the country. So-called ""community standards"" - the rules that govern what users can post - are also not available in Afghanistan's main languages of Pashto and Dari, the author of the presentation said.

A Reuters review this month found that community standards weren't available in about half the more than 110 languages that Facebook supports with features such as menus and prompts.
Facebook said it aims to have these rules available in 59 languages by the end of the year, and in another 20 languages by the end of 2022.

The order, issued last October, mandated testing and some additional safeguards for crew members as part of a framework for a phased resumption of cruises. 
The public health agency said the extension includes minor changes and when the order is lifted it will shift to a ""voluntary program"" and work alongside ship operators to control COVID-19 numbers aboard cruise ships.

The highly contagious variant had earlier this year led to a surge in infections and hospitalizations in the United States, but cases have started to decrease in recent weeks.
The CDC had in May initiated a key step for the eventual resumption of U.S. cruise industry operations by issuing new technical instructions.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - A senior Airbus official on Monday defended the European planemaker's output goals after it clashed with leasing companies worried about overproduction of jetliners.
Airbus hopes to almost double production of its best-selling A320 family as air travel gathers pace following the coronavirus crisis. Critics have accused it of ignoring the impact on jet prices and service revenues.
""The key to all this is that we have these firm contracts with our clients - we cannot say that we are not going to respect those contracts because we think they are too many for the business,"" said Airbus Latin America president Arturo Barreira, on the sidelines of the ALTA airline conference in Bogota.
""We have those commitments with our clients, so the demand is there and we are seeing that the interests of many airlines to improve the fleet are being reactivated,"" he told Reuters.

Industry sources said earlier on Monday Airbus had rebuffed calls for output restraint from leasing companies, which fear the effect of too much production on the value of existing assets.
The dispute deepens an industry split over post-COVID demand after Airbus also received flak from engine makers and other suppliers over the pace of its planned output increases.

Carrefour Sprint will offer a 15-minute grocery delivery service to Parisians exclusively via the Uber Eats mobile app from nine ""dark stores"" - shops closed to customers where workers prepare orders for delivery - operated by Carrefour's partner Cajoo. 
Earlier this year, the French retailer agreed to take a minority stake in the newly founded start-up Cajoo, which operates ""dark stores"" across the country.
Established retailers and food deliverers face intense competition from a crop of newer, well-funded start-ups running networks of ""dark stores"" that can dispatch groceries ordered on a smartphone app to the doorstep within minutes.
""Over the past 18 months people have increasingly come to expect quick and reliable delivery ... in Europe alone we've seen a triple-digit increase in demand for grocery delivery,"" Eve Henrikson, Regional General Manager, Uber Delivery EMEA, said in a statement.
Uber and Carrefour are already offering 30-minute deliveries in France from Carrefour's almost 2,000 shops available on Uber's app under a deal agreed last year.

Both companies have also separately struck deals to speed up delivery with other market players like Britain's Deliveroo and France's supermarket chain Casino.
Uber and Carrefour plan to expand the 15-minute service to other major French cities such as Lyon, Bordeaux, Toulouse, Lille and Montpellier in coming weeks, they said.

1023,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2021 06:16PM ET</span>","Facebook will fuel further unrest, whistleblower says","By Paul Sandle and Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) -Facebook Inc will fuel more violent unrest around the world unless it stops its algorithms pushing extreme and divisive content, whistleblower Frances Haugen told the British parliament on Monday.
The former employee, who accused the social media giant of putting profit before people at a Senate subcommittee earlier this month, said she was encouraged by British plans to force big tech companies to tackle harmful content on their platforms.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Haugen said, saw online safety as a cost and the company lionised a startup culture where cutting corners was good. ""Unquestionably it is making hate worse,"" she said. 
With a focus on the United States, the company was wilfully blind to its impact in many markets where a lack of local-language staff meant it often failed to understand the toxic or dangerous nature of messages on its platform, she said.
The world's biggest social network has rejected the charges, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-congress-facebook-idCNL1N2R10Y1 saying earlier this month that it was deeply illogical to argue that Facebook deliberately pushed content that made people angry.
""Contrary to what was discussed at the hearing, we've always had the commercial incentive to remove harmful content from our sites. People don't want to see it when they use our apps and advertisers don't want their ads next to it,"" Facebook said in a statement on Monday.
It said it had spent $13 billion on keeping users safe and agreed regulation was needed across the industry, adding that it was pleased Britain is moving ahead with online safety laws. 
Facebook, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, has been accused by U.S. lawmakers of chasing higher profits while being cavalier about user safety. 
Britain is bringing forward laws that could fine social media companies up to 10% of their turnover if they fail to remove or limit the spread of illegal content.
""The events we're seeing around the world, things like Myanmar and Ethiopia, those are the opening chapters because engagement-based ranking does two things: one, it prioritises and amplifies divisive and polarising extreme content and two it concentrates it,"" Haugen said.
Haugen in October told a Senate Commerce subcommittee hearing that Facebook had devised ways to keep users scrolling even if it was detrimental to their wellbeing. 
She also said she provided the documents used in a Wall Street Journal investigation and a Senate hearing on Instagram's harm to teenage girls. She compared the platform to addictive substances such as tobacco and opioids.
Facebook operates in more than 190 countries and boasts more than 2.8 billion monthly users.
BRITISH INTERIOR MINISTER SEEKS TOUGHER LAWS
Before Monday's hearing, Haugen met the country's interior minister, Priti Patel, who advocates tougher legislation for tech platforms that fail to keep users safe. 
She is scheduled to speak at a major tech conference, the Web Summit, next week and in Brussels to European policymakers. 
""Facebook has been unwilling to accept even little slivers of profit being sacrificed for safety, and that's not acceptable,"" she said on Monday, singling out Instagram's impact on the mental health of some young users. 

Reuters, along with other news organisations, viewed documents released to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Congress by Haugen.
They showed Facebook https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-knew-about-failed-police-abusive-content-globally-documents-2021-10-25 had known it had not hired enough workers who possessed both the language skills and knowledge of local events needed to identify objectionable posts from users in a number of developing countries.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Engine manufacturer Navistar (NYSE:NAV) International Corp will pay a $52 million civil penalty and has agreed to prevent at least 10,000 tons of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions in a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department over Clean Air Act violations.
The Justice Department said on Monday that Illinois-based Navistar, which was acquired by Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s Traton truck unit for $3.7 billion in July, illegally introduced into commerce heavy-duty diesel engines not authorized by Environmental Protection Agency emissions rules.
In 2015, the United States filed suit against Navistar over the engines. Navistar must purchase and destroy enough older diesel engines to prevent 10,000 tons of future NOx emissions, the Justice Department said, and forfeit its current NOx credits.
Navistar said it had signed ""a definitive settlement agreement"" with the Justice Department and the EPA.
""Navistar is pleased to put this legacy issue behind us and eager to focus on transportation solutions for the future,"" the company said.
The Justice Department alleged that in 2010, after lower emission standards went into effect, Navistar introduced into commerce 7,749 diesel engines that did not meet the lower emission standards.
The Justice Department lodged a proposed consent decree outlining the settlement terms, saying Navistar can destroy diesel engines used to power heavy-duty diesel 
""trucks, transit, intercity, or school buses, or any other on-highway heavy duty diesel vehicles"" to prevent future emissions. 
A U.S. court held that the Navistar engines were in fact model-year 2010 engines and required to be covered by a 2010 certificate demonstrating compliance with the lower emission requirements, the Justice Department said.

Acting EPA Assistant Administrator Larry Starfield said ""older diesel engines without modern emissions controls emit significant amounts of air pollution that harms people’s health and takes years off people’s lives.""
Navistar's mitigation of NOx emissions must take into consideration ""geographic diversity and benefits to communities that are overburdened by air pollution,"" Starfield added.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Global stocks rose and Treasury yields dipped on Monday with major Wall Street benchmarks hitting fresh records, buoyed by a robust start to the U.S. corporate earnings season and an improving economic outlook.
A large proportion of S&P 500 companies are due to report results this week, including technology heavyweights Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which have been the drivers of the market rally this year.
The Dow Jones Industrials and S&P 500 closed at record highs on Monday as traders looked ahead to earnings reports.
""The number one thing is that earnings are better-than-expected and what's more interesting is that as we approach the end of the year, we're going to see forward guidance being lifted, which would make the market multiple more reasonable,"" said Thomas Hayes, chairman of Great Hill Capital in New York.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 50 countries, rose 0.28%, while the pan-European STOXX 600 index gained 0.07%.
In choppy trading on Monday, U.S. Treasury yields were lower as uncertainty about when the Federal Reserve would raise rates to curb rising inflation weighed on market sentiment.
The benchmark U.S. 10-year yield fell to 1.6325%. Last week, the 10-year yield hit 1.705%, the highest since mid-May.
The U.S. dollar rose from a one-month low on Monday, ahead of central bank meetings and economic data coming later this week, boosted by the prospect of a tighter U.S. monetary policy. The dollar index was up 0.178% at 93.828.
On Wall Street, the group of stocks with the highest gains were consumer discretionary, industrials, communication services and technology stocks.
A string of solid quarterly earnings reports this month, including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and insurer Travelers (NYSE:TRV) Cos Inc, have boosted market expectations.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which jumped 12.66% and breached $1 trillion in market capitalization, also provided the biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.18% to 35,741.15, the S&P 500 gained 0.47% to 4,566.48 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.9, to 15,226.71.
Oil prices rose on Monday and reached multi-year highs, as tight global supply and strengthening fuel demand in the United States and beyond supported prices.
Brent crude futures gained 0.43% to $85.90 a barrel, while the U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures pared earlier gains and traded lower at 0.06% to $83.71 a barrel in early afternoon trading.

Gold prices rose nearly 1% on Monday, as a retreat in U.S. bond yields and persistent worries about inflation lifted the safe-haven asset ahead of major central bank meetings this week.
Spot gold gained 0.85% to $1,807.7102 per ounce, while U.S. gold futures for December delivery settled up 0.6% at $1,806.80 per ounce.

The FTC said in a statement that it had already put this policy in place for dialysis company DaVita (NYSE:DVA) Inc following the company's purchase of the University of Utah Health’s dialysis clinics.

Going forward, the policy would be in effect for any company that wins deal approval through a divestiture, the FTC said in a statement. The policy includes deals that normally would be too small to be reported to antitrust enforcers. Companies that abandon a transaction are less likely to face the restriction, the agency said. 
""The FTC should not have to waste valuable time and resources investigating clearly anticompetitive deals that should have died in the board room,"" said Holly Vedova, director of the Bureau of Competition.

In setting a hearing focused on TikTok, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s YouTube and Snapchat, the Senate Commerce Committee said the popular apps have ""been misused to harm kids and promote destructive acts, such as vandalism in schools, deadly viral challenges, bullying, eating disorders, manipulative influencer marketing, and grooming.""
In his prepared testimony, reviewed by Reuters in advance of the hearing, Michael Beckerman, head of public policy for the Americas at TikTok, said that the company's moderation teams work to quickly take down any such content known as ""devious licks."" 
The ""devious licks"" trend on TikTok pushed students to steal from schools or vandalize them.
""We recently saw content related to 'devious licks' gain traction on TikTok and other platforms,"" Beckerman's testimony says. ""Our moderation teams worked swiftly to remove this content and redirect hashtags and search 
results... to discourage such behavior.""
Beckerman added TikTok ""issued specialized guidance to our teams on this violative content and proactively detected and removed content, including videos, hashtags, and audio associated with the trend,"" including looking for spelling variants potentially used to elude moderators, he said.
 Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP)'s Jennifer Stout, vice president of global public policy, said in prepared testimony that Snapchat is not designed for content to go viral and is instead focused on conversations between friends. Professionally created media content and certain stories that are spotlighted on the app are all vetted by human moderators.

YouTube's Leslie Miller, a vice president of public affairs, was expected to assert the company strives to encourage healthy habits, and to ensure that children see only age-appropriate material. The company has been accused of being a treasure trove of misinformation on everything from politics to coronavirus vaccinations.
The hearing is the latest part of a lengthy inquiry into what lawmakers from both parties see as Big Tech's increasingly negative influence on competition, society and children.

Another factor driving market sentiment is that President Biden’s trillion-dollar infrastructure spending plan may finally be passed in the near term.

(Reuters) -Tesla Inc surpassed $1 trillion in market value on Monday after landing its biggest-ever order from rental car company Hertz, a deal that reinforced the electric car leader's ambitions to top the entire auto industry in sales over the next decade.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares surged as much as 14.9% to $1,045.02, making it the world's most valuable automaker according to Reuters calculations based on its latest filing.
Even Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk expressed surprise at the velocity of the surge. ""Strange that moved valuation, as Tesla is very much a production ramp problem, not a demand problem,"" Musk tweeted in reply to a comment by Ross Gerber, co-founder of the investment fund Gerber Kawasaki and a Tesla shareholder.
""Wild $T1mes!"" Musk wrote in a separate tweet.
Tesla is the first carmaker to join the elite club of trillion-dollar companies that includes Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.
Most automakers do not boast about sales to rental car companies, often made at discounts to unload slow-selling models. But for Tesla and its investors, Hertz's decision to order 100,000 Tesla vehicles by the end of 2022 showed electric vehicles are no longer a niche product, but will dominate the mass car market in the near future.
""Electric vehicles are now mainstream, and we've only just begun to see rising global demand and interest,"" Hertz interim Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields told Reuters.
Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has set an annual sales growth target of 50%, on average, eventually reaching 20 million vehicles a year. That would be more than twice the volume of current sales leaders Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) and  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp.
Consumer demand for electric vehicles is turning a corner in some major markets. The Tesla Model 3 was the best-selling vehicle of any kind in Europe last month, consulting firm JATO Dynamics reported Monday.
Tesla also appeared on Monday to be making progress resolving regulatory problems that threatened its business in China. The company said it had opened a new data and research center in Shanghai to comply with government requirements that data collected from vehicles in China stay in the country.
However, Tesla faced new U.S. regulatory pressure on Monday. The National Transportation Safety Board's new chief sent Musk a letter questioning why Tesla was rolling out its ""Full Self Driving"" software even though the company has not officially responded to the NTSB's questions about the automated driving system's safety.
""It (the Hertz order) puts an exclamation point under guidance for 50%+ growth in deliveries,"" Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin said. ""Another solid piece of evidence EVs are going mainstream.""
Tesla now faces the daunting day-to-day challenge of becoming a high-volume automaker growing at a rate not seen since the early 1900s when demand exploded for Henry Ford's Model T.
Tesla is coping with an order backlog for its vehicles and extended supply chain disruptions. Tesla Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn cautioned investors during a call last week that Tesla's near-term production goals will hinge on resolving those disruptions and ramping up two new, huge assembly and battery plants in Austin and Berlin.
""There is quite an execution journey ahead of us,"" Kirkhorn said.
Rivals are not sitting still.  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn)'s Mercedes-Benz brand, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, and startups such as Lucid and China's Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) are all battling Tesla with new electric cars or trucks.
Investors and analysts, for now, are looking past the near-term challenges.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) boosted its Tesla price target by 33% to $1,200 as the brokerage expects the electric carmaker to surpass 8 million deliveries in 2030. 
The Hertz deal also underscored the power of the Tesla brand, as the rental car company emerges from bankruptcy and aims to revive its once-dominant brand. Hertz's rescue is led by a group of investors including Knighthead Capital Management, Certares Opportunities and Apollo Capital Management.
""We absolutely believe that this is going to be competitive advantage for us,"" interim Hertz CEO Mark Fields said of the Tesla order, due to be delivered by the end of 2022.
""We want to be a leader in mobility. ... Getting customers experience with electrified vehicles is an absolute priority for us.""
Tesla's cheapest Model 3 sedan starts at about $44,000, making this order worth about $4.4 billion, if the entire order were for its mass-market sedan. 
Fields declined to say how much Hertz was paying for the order. Tesla was not immediately available for comment. 
With the current order, Hertz said EVs will make up more than 20% of its global fleet. Fields cited the rising number of EVs for sale and consumer interest in electrified vehicles.

Hertz also said it was installing thousands of chargers throughout its network. Customers who rent a Tesla Model 3 will have access to 3,000 Tesla supercharging stations throughout the United States and Europe.
Tesla shares closed up 12.7% at $1,024.86.

1034,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2021 04:51PM ET</span>",Tesla's $1 trillion value a double bonanza for Musk,"By Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - The surge in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's stock market value beyond $1 trillion on Monday is a double bonanza for Chief Executive Elon Musk, the electric car maker's largest shareholder.
The stock rallied 12.7% on news that Tesla landed its biggest-ever order from rental car company Hertz.
With Tesla's stock at a record high close of $1,024.86, Musk's 23% stake in the newly minted trillion-dollar company is now worth about $230 billion, according to Refinitiv. 
That stake includes options worth over $50 billion that have vested under Musk's 2018 compensation package.
In addition, Musk is a major shareholder and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, a private company worth $100 billion as of an October secondary share sale, according to a CNBC report.
Musk receives no salary at Tesla: his pay package provides 12 options tranches that vest when Tesla's market capitalization and financial growth hit a series of rising milestones. The options let Musk buy Tesla shares at $70 each, a discount of more than 90% from their current price.

Last week, Tesla reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $3.2 billion, up 77% from the year before. That was enough to vest his seventh options tranche, worth over $8 billion as of Monday.
Tesla's six-month average stock market valuation is over $650 billion, clearing the way for all 12 of the options tranches in Musk's pay package, should the company reach increasingly higher targets related to revenue and adjusted EBITDA for the remaining five tranches.

1040,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2021 04:00PM ET</span>",PayPal says it is currently not pursuing Pinterest acquisition,"By Krystal Hu and Anirban Sen
(Reuters) -PayPal Inc said it is not pursuing an acquisition of Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) Inc at this time, after several media reported last week that it was in talks to buy the digital pinboard site for as much as $45 billion.
The latest development, which dashed the prospect of Pinterest getting access to PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL)'s massive user base, sent the social media platform's share price down over 12%. Reuters and other media reported on the deal talks https://www.reuters.com/technology/paypal-looking-buy-digital-pinboard-site-pinterest-bloomberg-news-2021-10-20 on Friday, when sources said that PayPal had offered $70 per share, mostly in stock, for Pinterest.
PayPal did not provide additional details Monday in its one-line statement. Both companies did not respond to further requests for comment.
Tien-tsin Huang, a payments analyst at JP Morgan, said that a Pinterest deal would bring ""significant integration risk"" for PayPal, notably in terms of culture and execution. 
""Running a platform primarily focused on driving user engagement and advertising would require PayPal to use muscles it isn’t accustomed to using,"" said Huang in a research note to clients.
Pinterest is grappling with the twin challenges of losing its co-founder Evan Sharp (OTC:SHCAY) and a slowdown in user growth that has hampered its future prospects. 
Some analysts now think Pinterest could attract interest from other bidders down the road. 
""We believe PINS is likely to still be viewed as a potential target given its reasonable valuation compared to other social media peers and sharp share decline the last several months, given an anticipated sharp deceleration in subscriber growth,"" said Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA, in a note on Monday.
Aided by a boost in online payments in e-commerce during the COVID-19 pandemic, PayPal's shares had risen over 35% in the past 12 months, giving it a market capitalization of nearly $320 billion, prior to the reports on its talks with Pinterest. 
Since then, PayPal's shares have shed 12% of their value, with experts and analysts blaming the poor investor reception for the talks collapsing, while others highlighted challenges around integrating Pinterest within PayPal. 
PayPal's shares rose 3.6% in following the company statement late on Sunday. Pinterest's shares, which had surged 13% after the deal talks were reported last week, gave up nearly all its recent gains and slumped about 12% to $51.1 per share. 
PINTEREST AT CROSSROADS 
Sharp founded the online scrapbook and photo-sharing platform in 2010 with Ben Silbermann, who is the company's chief executive officer, and Paul Sciarra, who left in 2012.
Earlier in October, Sharp said he would step down as chief creative officer to join LoveFrom, a firm led by Jony Ive, the designer of many Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) products.
As lockdowns have eased globally, Pinterest has warned about slowing user growth, especially in the United States, which accounts for a majority of its user base. Pinterest has said it expects growth mainly through deeper engagement with existing users, rather than new sign-ups. 
In the June quarter, Pinterest's overall monthly active users (MAUs), a widely watched metric, rose by only 9% to 454 million, after having jumped 30% in the prior quarter.
The Pinterest deal would have been the biggest acquisition of a social media company at the reported price and one of the largest tech deals in history, far surpassing  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s $26.2 billion purchase of LinkedIn in 2016. 
It would have also allowed PayPal capture more e-commerce growth, as more shoppers increasingly buy items they see on social media, often following ""influencers"" on platforms such as Instagram, TikTok and even Pinterest.

PayPal, among the big pandemic winners, has been on an acquisition spree of late, having bought Japanese buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) firm Paidy for $2.7 billion earlier this year. 
It also acquired Happy Returns, a company which helps online shoppers return unwanted merchandise, for an undisclosed sum in May to bolster its e-commerce offerings and to build on its $4 billion acquisition of online coupon finder Honey Science in 2019.

Investing.com — Shares of card issuing platform  Marqeta  Inc (NASDAQ:MQ) made strong gains Monday afternoon following news that it is partnering with Branch, a workforce payments platform, and Uber Freight.
Marqeta shares have gained over 12% on the news, climbing to around the $28.66 level.
The company said the partnership will see the them work together to bring faster, more reliable payments and carrier-first financial services to the logistics and transportation industries.
""Uber Freight is a leader in the transportation industry and their deep knowledge of logistics makes them a fantastic partner to bring our modern card issuing and Branch's accelerated payments to a new market,"" said Renata Caine, SVP of International, Strategy and Planning, at Marqeta.
Uber Freight is a logistics platform created using Uber's technology. It feels the partnership will allow them to build out their suite of carrier first tools. Using Marqeta's card issuing platform and Branch's digital wallet, Uber Freight said it will be able to pay carriers significantly faster than the industry standard, at no additional cost. 
The current payment process takes around 30 days or more. However, through the partnership, carriers on Uber Freight can get paid two hours after approved proof of delivery.
""This partnership allows us to continue building our suite of carrier-first tools and offer the small carriers on our platform — the mom and pop shops and new authority carriers just starting their businesses — the opportunity to take advantage of lightning-fast payments, fuel discounts, and other benefits typically reserved for larger carriers,"" said the Head of Uber Freight, Lior Ron."

Volvo had previously said the shares would be priced within a range of 53 crowns ($6.2) to 68 crowns per share, but the market for European IPOs has taken a turn for the worse in recent months as inflation and global supply chain crunches have increased stock market volatility.
Automakers have been particularly hurt by production disruptions due to a semiconductor shortage as several of them cut production targets and shut factories on concern that the crisis will run well into next year.
At the current price, Volvo Cars would be valued at just over $18 billion, down from as much as $23 billion it had expected at the top of the pricing range.
Volvo Cars said on Monday it was planning to raise around 20 billion Swedish crowns ($2.3 billion) in the IPO, down a fifth from its previous plans.
European and U.S. IPO markets have been hit by a slew of cancellations recently, while many more companies are believed to have pushed their plans back behind the scenes. 
Volvo Cars and its Chinese owner had tried to go public a few yeas ago but abandoned those plans in 2018 blaming trade tensions and a downturn in automotive stocks.
Political tension between China and Sweden still persist after Stockholm banned Huawei from its 5G networks and Swedish companies like Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) have lost business in the Asian country.
Geely, which paid Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co $1.8 billion for Volvo in 2010, would not exercise an over-allotment option, while the amended offering would result in a free float of between 16.0% and 17.9%.

1045,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2021 03:31PM ET</span>",Blackstone's co-head of hedge fund unit McCormick to leave firm,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) -John McCormick (NYSE:MKC), the co-head of Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX)'s $81 billion hedge fund unit, plans to leave the private equity firm in the coming months, a company representative said on Monday.
As the world's biggest hedge fund investor, Blackstone backs new hedge funds, invests alongside hedge funds, buys majority stakes in them and offers internally run hedge funds to clients like pension funds and foreign governments.
The unit, known as BAAM, is on track to post its best-ever year, with revenues and earnings topping last year's records and assets at a record high.
McCormick, 53, told the firm of his plans to leave last week and will stay on for a time to ensure a smooth transition, two sources familiar with the move said.
Since McCormick took the helm of BAAM in January 2018 all businesses have expanded. 
He replaced Tom Hill, who spent decades growing Blackstone into the world's most powerful hedge fund investor. The fund-of-funds portfolio, BAAM Principal Solutions, gained 13.3% over the last 12 months, outpacing the hedge fund industry benchmark. 
In January Blackstone hired Joe Dowling, a former endowment chief at Brown University, as the group's co-head. He will now run the hedge fund unit alone, one of the sources said.
The Wall Street Journal first reported news of McCormick's departure.
McCormick, who has worked at Blackstone for nearly 17 years, is the latest senior executive to announce plans to leave the storied private equity firm's hedge fund unit.
In the last months Gideon Berger, who led its funds-of-funds business; Brett Condron, who was head of individual investor solutions; and Scott Soussa, who headed the hedge fund and private equity stakes business, have departed.
A number of other executives have also left, creating some unease among investors. Some investors have asked for Blackstone to hand over organization charts so they can keep track of who has left, one of the sources said.
A trained lawyer, McCormick was widely respected by investors and colleagues for his cerebral, calm and considered approach. He launched the firm's data-science initiative and was a tireless backer of bringing hedge funds to the masses through mutual fund structures.
Dowling came to Blackstone as an outsider and leaned on his deep connections with stock-oriented fund managers. He has quickened the pace of sourcing managers and has shifted investments more to equity managers while curbing the exposure to credit managers, the sources said.

He has also helped launch Blackstone Horizon, a new investment platform run by Scott Bommer, which aims to deliver big returns by investing with fund managers targeting fast-growing public and private companies.
Blackstone has signaled to clients that it is not abandoning its focus on preserving capital but is also focusing on faster growth with products like the Horizon platform.

So far this earnings season, so good. Reuters reported that analysts expect S&P 500 earnings to rise 34.8% from the same period last year, citing data from Refinitiv.
Investors are also hearing about how management is dealing with supply chain issues and rising material costs. Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB), the maker of household paper products, cut its profit outlook for this year because of higher costs. 
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Facebook earnings

The company, backed by asset manager Franklin Templeton, is offering 19.2 million shares priced between $12 and $14 each, along with the selling stockholders. At the top end of that range, the IPO would fetch about $269 million.
As calls grow to limit global warming and switch to more environmentally friendly ways of living, companies have come under investor and activist pressure to contribute to the change.
Some startups that recently cashed in on the enthusiasm for such offerings were Oprah Winfrey-backed vegan milk maker Oatly Group (NASDAQ:OTLY) AB and Jessica Alba's Honest Co.
Allbirds was founded in 2015 by co-Chief Executive Officers Joseph Zwillinger and Timothy Brown, a former New Zealand soccer player. The duo researched and tinkered with the properties of merino wool to craft a fabric made specifically for footwear.
The company, which counts Oscar-winning actor Leonardo DiCaprio among its backers, also uses fiber derived from eucalyptus and other plant-based alternatives in its products.

Inflows so far this year hit $8 billion, far exceeding the record set for the whole of 2020 of $6.7 billion, the data showed as of the week ended Oct. 22.
Total assets under management also hit a new record of $79.2 billion, although it ended the week at $76.7 billion.
The bulk of inflows for the sixth straight week went to Bitcoin, with $1.45 billion, data showed. Inflows to the world's largest cryptocurrency year-to-date amounted to $6.1 billion.
The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF and the Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF debuted last week, a defining moment for the crypto industry that is expected to lure more inflows from big institutional investors.
That pushed bitcoin to an all-time peak of $67,016.50. It was last up 4.6% at $63,682.
""Bitcoin hitting new all-time highs shows both how far we've come and the capacity bitcoin has to upend the financial system and create a global economy, linking the developed and emerging markets like never before,"" said Ray Youssef, co-founder and chief executive officer of Paxful, a global peer-to-peer fintech platform.

Ethereum, meanwhile, saw outflows for a third consecutive week totaling $1.4 million. CoinShares believed that the outflows were due to minor profit-taking as the price approaches record highs. Ether, the currency for the Ethereum blockchain, last exchanged hands at $4,224.30, up 3.5%.

Other altcoins saw inflows. Solana, Cardano and Binance posted inflows totaling $8.1 million, $5.3 million and $1.8 million, respectively.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The head of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board on Monday criticized electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's decision to provide new self-driving software to vehicle owners without addressing safety concerns that the agency raised after a series of fatal accidents.
NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy wrote a letter to Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk about his decision to let drivers request access to ""Full Self-Driving Beta technology"" before the automaker addressed ""the very design shortcomings"" implicated in fatal crashes in Florida and California involving its Autopilot driver-assistance system. Beta refers to a trial version of a product.
""If you are serious about putting safety front and center in Tesla vehicle design, I invite you to complete action on the safety recommendations we issued to you four years ago,"" Homendy wrote.
The Full Self-Driving technology expands on the Autopilot software that helps with vehicle steering, accelerating and braking.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The NTSB previously urged Tesla to add system safeguards to limit the use of automated vehicle-control systems to designated conditions and to develop applications to ""more effectively sense the driver's level of engagement."" The agency makes safety recommendations and has no regulatory authority. 
Tesla has never officially responded to those recommendations.
Also on Monday, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which regulates auto safety, disclosed that Tesla has given the agency a partial response https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2021/INME-PE21020-1022.pdf to an information request issued as part of NHTSA's formal safety investigation into the automaker's Autopilot technology.
NHTSA said in an memo written last Friday and released on Monday that Tesla's response ""has been received and is being reviewed."" Tesla has asked NHTSA to keep its entire response confidential. 
The agency in August sent Tesla an 11-page letter with questions it was required to answer by last Friday. NHTSA this month asked Tesla why it had not issued a recall to address software updates made to Autopilot to improve the vehicles' ability to detect emergency vehicles.
NHTSA's investigation into 765,000 U.S. vehicles came after a series of crashes involving Tesla models and emergency vehicles. NHTSA has identified 12 crashes that involved Tesla vehicles using the advanced driver-assistance systems and emergency vehicles, with most of the incidents occurring after dark.
In a separate letter this month, NHTSA asked Tesla to provide answers by Nov. 1 on its semi-autonomous driving technology called ""Autosteer on City Streets"" that the company made available to vehicle owners last year. Tesla refers to this technology as FSD.
""Despite Tesla's characterization of FSD as 'beta,' it is capable of and is being used on public roads,"" NHTSA said.

Tesla on Sunday rolled back the latest version of this software, less than a day after its release, after users complained of false collision warnings and other issues.
NHTSA also raised concerns about limits that Tesla has compelled vehicle owners to accept on disclosure to the public of safety issues.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has named Janis Bowdler, a Latina activist and former head of the philanthropic arm of  JP Morgan Chase  (NYSE:JPM) as the first-ever counselor for racial equity at the Treasury Department, Yellen's deputy said.
A review during the first 200 days of the Biden administration showed the need for a champion to head economic policy initiatives to advance racial equity, a Treasury official said.
Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo confirmed the news, first reported by Reuters, in a blog published on Monday.
Bowdler will work to set up an external advisory committee at Treasury that taps the expertise of academics, researchers, community activists and advocates. She also will work with communities to identify and mitigate barriers hindering access to Treasury benefits and opportunities, the official said.
As part of Yellen's commitment to bolstering the diversity of Treasury's career staff, the department will also announce the appointment of Ventris Gibson as deputy director of the U.S. Mint, Adeyemo said.
A longtime federal career executive and U.S. Navy veteran, Gibson will assume the role of acting director, the first Black person to head that agency, the official said.
Adeyemo noted that 40% of Treasury's political appointees - and 50% of those in executive leadership roles - identified as people of color, but ""much more work"" needed to be done in diversifying the broader career staff. 
Treasury has a workforce of more than 95,000 employees in all 50 states and around the world. No data was immediately available on the percentage of people of color on staff overall staff.

Adeyemo said the department was working to step up recruitment among groups representing veterans, people with disabilities and other minorities.

The average overall survival for patients treated with eryaspase plus chemotherapy was 7.5 months compared to 6.7 months for those treated with just chemotherapy.
""Pancreatic cancer is a very challenging, heterogeneous disease, and the results of the TRYbeCA-1 Phase 3 trial have now also encountered this significant hurdle."" said Dr Iman El Hariry, the company's chief medical officer.

EmsanaRx, the PBM unit of the Purchaser Business Group on Health (PBGH) coalition, will provide employers a fixed price per prescription as well as guidance from a clinical pharmacist account manager.
PBMs serve as intermediaries between drug manufacturers, health insurance plans and pharmacies to negotiate prescription drug prices.
San Francisco-based PBGH has been assisting large employers and other healthcare consumers for over three decades in getting access to higher quality care and reducing costs.
Employers have been trying to reign in healthcare costs with limited success. 
Earlier this year, the joint venture of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) ceased to exist, three years after the companies came together hoping to clamp down escalating healthcare costs.
In November last year, Amazon launched an online pharmacy to deliver prescription medications in the United States.
PBGH is the majority owner of Emsana Health, the company that will house the PBM unit. The group also counts Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) among its members.

""For the first time, employers will own their own data and have the information and tools and clinical resources dedicated exclusively to their unique needs and patient populations,"" said Greg Baker, who would helm EmsanaRx.
 Cigna Corp  (NYSE:CI)'s Evernorth and UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH)'s unit Optum are among the largest providers of PBM services in the United States. Health conglomerate CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) also has a PBM business.

Read on.Popularity on social media platforms like Reddit and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), high short interest, and retail trader-driven short squeezes characterize most meme stocks. And while the hype surrounding some famous names has begun to fade, some new names are now making quite a buzz on the subreddit WallStreetBets (WSB).
Although the most popular meme stock GameStop Corporation (GME) is up 801.3% year-to-date, the company’s unstable financials and bleak growth potential may lead to a price pullback in the near term. In its last reported quarter, GME’s operating loss came in at $58 million and its net loss amounted to $61.6 million. Furthermore, analysts expect its EPS to decline 20.9% in the next quarter. The stock has declined 10.7% in price over the past month.
Therefore, we think fundamentally sound stocks Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:SIRI), and Goodrich Petroleum Corporation (GDP), which are being discussed heavily on subreddit WSB, could be better choices than GME for meme investors.

Investing.com – Whirlpool stock (NYSE:WHR) fell 1.6% Monday as RBC downgraded it to underperform believing the peak in profit per share of the home appliance-maker might be behind.
The new peg of $190 is 9.5% lower from the stock’s current level of $210.
The stock earlier had a sector perform rating from the brokerage with a target of $208.
Whirlpool Friday cut its annual sales guidance after third-quarter revenue fell behind expectations.
The maker of refrigerators and electric chimneys blamed supply chain issues for its shortfall, semiconductors particularly, according to Bloomberg, which quoted Whirlpool Chief Financial Officer Jim Peters.
The company now expects its full-year net sales to grow by around 13%, a figure it had marked for itself in April when times were better and it felt its initial aim of around 6% growth was not ambitious enough. As demand boomed in July, Whirlpool said 16% growth was achievable.
According to analyst Mike Dahl, margins will drop in the current quarter and next year as well. Carryover inflation is likely to be meaningful in 2022, while volume headwinds and a potential return of promotions may pressure margins, he said in his note.

The stop-and-start nature of the COVID-19 pandemic has snarled global supply chains that are optimized for just-in-time movement of goods, while labor and equipment shortages and a lack of space to store products have exacerbated the situation. 
Amazon, which plans to hire 150,000 seasonal workers in the United States during the holiday period, said it had also increased ports of entry across its network by 50%. 
The e-commerce giant is not the only company trying to use its scale and deep pockets to muscle its way through supply chain headaches.

The group, which makes tyres used in cars, aircraft, bicycles and industrial equipment, said sales totalled 6 billion euros ($6.98 billion) for July to September, up from 5.78 billion in the same period last year.
Analysts polled by the company had predicted quarterly sales of 5.80 billion euros.
The rise in sales came in spite of a global shortage in semiconductor chips, which has forced carmakers still recovering from coronavirus disruptions to cut production as they compete for supplies with the consumer electronics industry.
 Michelin  (PA:MICP)'s sales were still down from 6.12 billion euros in the third quarter of 2019, before the pandemic, and the group maintained its financial forecasts for 2021.
Chief Executive Florent Menegaux said the group posted ""a very solid performance,"" in spite of ""major disruptions in our supply chains and sharp spikes in energy and other costs.""
The group cited rising raw material costs and worsening labour shortages in North America and to a lesser extent in Europe.
However, rising grain and metals prices helped Michelin sell more tires for mining and farm machinery. 

Though demand for truck tyres grew in most of the world during the three months, it fell sharply in China following exceptionally high levels in 2020, when fleets upgraded ahead of new emission regulations, Michelin said.

Henry Hub gas for November delivery gained as much as 10.7%, the biggest gain in almost three weeks, to $5.844 per million British thermal units. Prices are bouncing back from recent declines, though they’re still shy of the seven-year high reached earlier this month. 
While mild October weather allowed producers to inject more gas into storage than usual, forecasts for a cooler early November in the Midwest and East are a reminder that supplies of the heating and power-generation fuel are still below normal. Meanwhile, the U.S. is expected to export every molecule it can to help ease shortages of gas in Europe and Asia. 
“There is terrific concern about sufficiency of supply”, said John Kilduff, founding partner at Again Capital, adding that the market remains sensitive to any cold forecasts. 
One sign of growing supply fears: The so-called widowmaker spread between March and April futures, essentially a bet on how tight inventories will be at the end of winter, widened to $1.481, the highest since Oct. 14.
Flows to liquefied natural gas terminals are seen at 11.3 billion cubic feet on Monday, up by more than 10% since Friday and the highest since May, according to BloombergNEF. Estimated volumes at Freeport LNG in Texas have rebounded after the terminal, one of the U.S.’s largest, faced issues with a wax buildup in its pipelines last week.
Traders positioning for the expiration of November options contracts could amplify volatility in gas prices in the next few days, EBW AnalyticsGroup said in a note to clients. November options expire on Tuesday.

Furthermore, because the EIA anticipates prices will remain high, at least through year’s end amid below-average inventories and rebounding demand, natural gas ETFs should benefit. We believe natural gas ETFs United States Natural Gas (UNG), United States 12 Month Natural Gas (UNL), and iPath Series B Bloomberg Natural Gas (GAZ), which have dipped in price lately, could be wise bets to capitalize on the favorable industry trends. Let’s discuss the funds.Natural gas prices are hovering near record high levels due to rebounding demand amid the global economy’s reopening. Below five-year average inventory levels are driving prices higher. In addition, U.S. gas futures recently touched 12-year highs. Gas futures rallied to hit $6.280 in September, more than twice the $3.0141 seasonally-adjusted 10-year average.
Because the winter season is nearing, demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) is also rising. U.S. exports of LNG are approaching a record high this year, and Energy Information Administration (EIA) anticipates new record high exports for next year. Moreover, the organization expects the winter heating season will face natural gas inventories that are 4.8% below the five-year average, which will contribute to U.S. natural gas prices remaining high through the winter.
We think natural gas ETFs, United States Natural Gas Fund LP (UNG), United States 12 Month Natural Gas Fund LP (UNL), and iPath Series B Bloomberg Natural Gas Subindex Total ReturnSM ETN (GAZ) are well-positioned to benefit from this solid backdrop. So, it could be wise to buy the recent dips in these ETFs.

1075,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2021 11:56AM ET</span>",Facebook ad revenue seen feeling brunt of Apple privacy changes,"By Sheila Dang and Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) - Ahead of  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)'s financial results on Monday, the social media giant is expected to be hurt more than others in big tech by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s iPhone privacy changes, investors fear, after  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) missed revenue targets last week.
The Apple privacy updates, which began rolling out in April and prevent advertisers from tracking iPhone users without their consent, has had investors in digital ad companies on edge for fear that reduced access to data would upend the nearly $100 billion mobile ad market.
Snap confirmed fears on Thursday when it reported the Apple changes hurt its ability to measure whether its ads led to website visits or sales, and a measurement tool provided by Apple did not perform as well as expected.
Snap's shares fell 25% and dragged down shares of Facebook,  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, which all earn revenue by selling digital ads.
There can be ""no more denying"" the ramifications of Apple's privacy push, Ygal Arounian, managing director of internet equity research at Wedbush Securities, said in a research note after Snap's results.
Ad revenue of Facebook, the second-largest digital ad platform in the world after Alphabet Inc's Google, is most likely to be hit compared with the company's tech peers, Evercore ISI analysts said in a research note.
Like Snap, the bulk of Facebook's ad business comes from direct response advertising, an industry term that refers to ad sellers and buyers who use data on information such as what devices consumers are using and what they are searching for, to place ads in front of interested audiences with the aim of quickly generating sales or website visits.
Analysts are targeting $29.5 billion in revenue for the third quarter, a 37% increase from the year-ago period, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Shares of Facebook have risen 19% year-to-date.
Last month, Facebook warned that the Apple changes caused it to under-report the results of its ads on iOS devices and said the changes had made it more expensive and difficult for brands to advertise on Facebook.
The social media network has been one of the fiercest critics of Apple's updates, arguing they would hurt small businesses that rely on personalized advertising to increase sales.
On the other hand, Twitter, which reports third-quarter results on Tuesday, is likely to be spared because the social networking site is mainly used for brand advertising, said Audrey Schomer, a senior analyst at research firm eMarketer.

Brand advertising, which Twitter said in July constitutes 85% of its ad business, is a strategy employed by firms to boost consumers' awareness of a company or its values. Such ads are not as highly targeted to specific users, and therefore less dependent on data from iPhones or a user's devices. 
Google is also shielded from the iPhone privacy changes because much of its usage comes from desktops, and promoted results placed on Google searches are not dependent on iPhone data, Arounian said. Alphabet will report third-quarter results on Tuesday.

David Kanen, whose Kanen Wealth Management owns 5.64% of the St. Louis headquartered company, said in a regulatory filing late Friday that he had sent a note to the board chairman ""apologizing for comments that appeared in a story published by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.""
In the filing, Kanen added that ""he is pleased to have reached an amicable agreement with the Issuer, is supportive of
CEO Albert Fouerti"" and wishes the company success.
A day earlier Kanen broke the accord the two sides had reached when he spoke to the newspaper. According to the published article, Kanen said ""the company let him pick two board members from a pool of candidates assembled in an ongoing 'refresh' process."" He also told the newspaper that he ""got the biggest thing he wanted in August,"" when Albert Fouerti became chief executive officer, replacing Doug Moore.
Kanen did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Kanen had asked for a board seat for himself when he launched the fight at the company, criticizing its financial performance. He has criticized a number of companies, including Build-a-Bear Workshop.
Settlement agreements are always carefully negotiated and traditionally neither side is permitted to make any public comments, much less give insight into how the decisions were reached.
Since January, Goedeker's stock price has dropped 63% but it caught the attention of investors on Reddit a few months ago when the stock price perked up and the company's valuation briefly surged to around $1.6 billion before dropping back to roughly $334 million.

(Reuters) -Burger King and Tim Hortons are struggling with a staffing crunch and the Delta variant keeping coffee-loving office workers at home, causing parent Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) Inc to miss estimates for quarterly revenue on Monday.
U.S.-listed shares shed 4.4% as same-store sales at its Burger King, Tim Hortons and Popeyes chains came in below expectations in the third quarter.
Restaurant Brands also faced stiff competition from McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) and Wendy's (NASDAQ:WEN) Co doubling down on marketing and launching new menu items.
Wendy's launched a new 'Big Bacon Cheddar Cheeseburger' and reformulated its french fries to keep them crispy for longer earlier this year, while McDonald's collaborated with boy band BTS and rapper Saweetie to draw customers.
""We saw a continued gap relative to our peers. We're keenly aware of this gap,"" Chief Executive Jose Cil told analysts while discussing Burger King's results. ""We also see clear opportunities across operations, digital, menu and image that can work together to reclaim market share.""
Analysts said marketing behind some Burger King products had been lackluster, with the brand singled out as the biggest drag on Restaurant Brands' performance.
But some analysts said Burger King can see a revival, like Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) Inc did around 2010, if its new operating chief and president overhaul marketing.
Restaurant Brands, whose hand-breaded chicken sandwich is considered a labor-intensive product, has also struggled to adequately staff its restaurants, particularly for night shifts at its Popeyes chain.
The company had to reduce operating hours and limit service modes at select restaurants, and CEO Cil said it would take time for the staffing situation to improve.

Many hourly workers have turned to higher-paying jobs in warehouses and other businesses.
Total revenue rose 11.8% to $1.50 billion, missing estimates of $1.53 billion. Adjusted per-share earnings was 76 cents, versus Refinitiv IBES estimate of 74 cents.

Investing.com – Restaurant Brands stock (NYSE:QSR) fell 4% Monday after the company’s third-quarter revenue fell short of expectations on a combination of factors ranging from the Delta variant of coronavirus keeping customers home to more aggressive competition.
July through September total revenue rose to $1.49 billion from $1.33 billion in the 2020 quarter. Analysts had estimated it to come in at $1.52 but sales were weaker as the Delta variant spread and sales fell short of expectations at its Burger King restaurants.
The company said certain markets continue to be affected, and it expects local conditions to continue to dictate limitations on restaurant operations, capacity, and hours of operation.
It said it expects to see a continued impact from Covid-19 on its results in 2021 and will invest more in its digital and marketing capabilities. For most retailers, while online sales have come off from the pandemic-time elevated sales, they continue to be higher than the pre-pandemic period, suggesting the online embrace is here to stay.
Adjusted profit rose around 10%, to $353 million.
Burger King has tried to compete with rivals like McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) but the effort has faced challenges, and not just from competition. Its newly launched hand-breaded chicken sandwich is considered a labor-intensive product, a tough proposition to straddle at the time of staff-crunches and higher salaries.
On its part, McDonald’s has toyed with its menu and been more aggressive with campaigns, collaborating with popular South Korean boy band BTS to pull in customers.
Same-store sales at coffee chain Tim Hortons, the biggest revenue-maker out of Restaurant Brands’ three brands, jumped around 9%, while Burger King’s rose nearly 8%.

And because the forthcoming holiday season is expected to increase the demand for transportation significantly, we think it could be wise to bet on quality transportation stocks Schneider National (NYSE:SNDR), Daseke (NASDAQ:DSKE), and  USA Truck  (NASDAQ:USAK). Read on.
Supply chain disruptions have caused shortages of goods ranging from household items to automobile parts, not just across the United States but worldwide. The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc on global supply chains because safety restrictions reduced the production of goods and services. But rising demand with the reopening of the economies and supply shortages have driven up the prices of goods and commodities.
Last week, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said that the global supply chain issues could remain through 2022. Against this backdrop, shares of transportation companies, such as shipping and trucking operators, have been attracting heightened investor attention because these companies are playing a vital role in addressing the supply disruptions. Investors’ interest in transportation stocks is evidenced by the iShares Transportation Average ETF’s (IYT) 8.8% returns over the past month compared to the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 3.5% gains.
So, as the demand for transportation services continues to rise amid the supply chain crisis, prominent players in this space Schneider National, Inc. (SNDR), Daseke, Inc. (DSKE), and USA Truck, Inc. (USAK) are expected to deliver significant returns to investors. Therefore, we think it could be wise to scoop up their shares now.

Russia last week said it would seek to fine the U.S. tech giant a percentage of its annual Russian turnover later this month for repeatedly failing to delete banned content on its search engine and YouTube, in Moscow's strongest move yet to rein in foreign tech firms.
Vasily Piskarev, a lawmaker who heads a parliamentary commission to investigate foreign interference in Russia, on Monday said Google's representatives had expressed a desire to engage in dialogue and the company had paid more than 32 million roubles in outstanding fines, news agencies reported. 
Marco Pancini, YouTube director for interacting with state authorities in EMEA, said in a blog post that Google had paid all enforced fines on time. These stood at 32.5 million roubles for this year, communications regulator Roskomnadzor said last week.
Roskomnadzor on Monday said it has the technical capability to slow down the speed of YouTube, Interfax reported, but that administrative measures are currently sufficient. 
In 2020, Google's compliance with requests to delete content was 96.2%, Pancini said, and in the first half of this year, it removed over 489,000 videos, but Russia said too much banned content still remained available. 
Piskarev said last week that this included child pornography. Russia has ordered other foreign tech firms to delete posts promoting drug abuse and dangerous pastimes, information about homemade weapons and explosives, as well as ones by groups it designates as extremist or terrorist.
Around 2,650 pieces of illegal content on Google's internet resources remained undeleted as of the start of October, the RIA news agency cited Piskarev as saying. 
""Work has been carried out, as we see, however it is still very far from ideal,"" he said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) aims to hasten its India expansion with smaller stores and drive-through outlets, the CEO of its local partner said on Monday, signalling the American coffee chain's bullish plans as the COVID-19 slowdown abates in the country.
Launched in India in 2012, Tata Starbucks - a joint venture between Starbucks and India's Tata Consumer Products - operates 233 outlets across 19 Indian cities.
Both the partners ""are driving Tata Starbucks to be far more aggressive in store openings, new formats, and in entering new cities,"" Sunil D'Souza, CEO of Tata Consumer Products, said in an interview on Monday.
""All we've got to figure out is how quickly we can scale,"" said D'Souza. ""We have got a window of opportunity because the competition is on the back foot."" 
India is one of Starbucks' fastest growing markets globally. The market for coffee shops in the country has surged even as tea remains a more affordable and popular beverage.
Despite this, a fascination for coffee brands like Starbucks and Costa Coffee remains high. Most Starbucks outlets in India are large-format and designed with rich wood-panelled decor. 
The company is now exploring smaller sized outlets as they can be opened faster and it is experimenting with concepts like drive-throughs after opening one in northern India last year, D'Souza said.
Tata Starbucks registered 128% revenue growth in the quarter ending September, during which it opened 14 new outlets. 
""Am I happy with 14? Absolutely not. The target's much more"" D'Souza said, adding the aim was to open some 40-50 outlets this year. 
INFLATION WORRIES 
Tata Consumer Products' consumer goods portfolio includes its eponymous salt and tea brands and other staples. It also owns the popular tea brand Tetley.
Recent inflationary pressure, driven by a surge in crude oil prices, has hit Tata and other competitors such as the local units of global consumer giants Unilever (NYSE:UL) and Nestle as freight and packaging costs have surged.
Flagging concerns about higher raw-material costs and energy prices, D'Souza said Tata Consumer Products will look to control marketing and other costs to offset the impact.
""At least in the short to medium-term ... we've got to live with it,"" he said, adding the company would look to raise prices slightly to boost margins, while cutting package sizes.

Even as such concerns weigh, Tata Consumer Products wants to increasingly focus on catering to Indians in rural areas, after long focusing on urban centres.
The company will increase its distributor network by around 20% in rural areas, where it plans to promote existing affordable brands, and launch new ones, D'Souza said.

A solid start to the third-quarter earnings season, a decline in the initial jobless claims, and declining COVID-19 cases are helping the major stock indexes perform well. Therefore, we think quality stocks Bristol-Myers (BMY), Biogen (BIIB), and Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) (ERIC), which look undervalued at their current price levels, could be solid bets now. Read on.
The major stock market indices finished last week higher, marking gains for three straight weeks. A solid start to the third-quarter earnings season, a decline in initial jobless claims, and declining COVID-19 cases have driven the performance of the stock market of late. According to FactSet, 23% of S&P 500 member companies had reported results for the third quarter as of October 22. Of these companies, 84% have surpassed consensus EPS estimates, besting the 76% five-year average.
While high inflation, a potential hike in corporate taxes, and supply chain bottlenecks continue to spook investors, an impressive earnings season should keep driving the market in the near term. Furthermore, U.S Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said yesterday that the United States was not losing control of inflation, and that she expects inflation levels to return to normal by the second half of 2022.
Given this backdrop, we think it could be wise to bet on quality stocks Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY), Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB), and Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (publ) (NASDAQ:ERIC), which look undervalued at their current price levels.

(Reuters) -A battle for control of the board of Rogers (NYSE:ROG) Communications Inc, one of Canada's largest telecoms companies, is headed to court after rival factions claimed they were in charge following a family feud that erupted into the open.
Last week, the company's board voted to remove Edward Rogers, son of the late founder Ted Rogers, as chair after he tried to replace CEO Joe Natale with another executive. The move put him at odds with his sisters and mother.
A Rogers Communications Inc spokesperson issued a statement on Sunday from Ted Rogers' widow and two daughters reiterating support for CEO Natale.
""We unequivocally support Joe Natale as CEO and support his management team,"" Melinda Rogers-Hixon, Martha Rogers and their mother Loretta Rogers said in the statement. They and five fellow board directors had voted on Thursday to remove Edward Rogers as chair.
While family differences and disagreements at a board level are not uncommon, a public spat is rare in Canadian corporate landscape. 
A reconstituted board under Edward Rogers held an initial meeting on Sunday and said in a statement it was disappointed that some within the company had resisted recognizing the change of directors that took effect on Friday.
Edward Rogers intends to initiate legal proceedings in the British Columbia Supreme Court to confirm the shareholder resolution that created his reconstituted board, the statement said.
Edward Rogers is chair and representative of the Rogers Control Trust, the family-owned entity which controls the majority of Rogers Communications shares.
He said last week he was removing the five directors who voted against him and replacing them with his own candidates.
But Rogers Communications said that this action was not valid, and on Sunday reiterated that no other individuals had the authority to act as the board of Rogers.

The fight comes as Rogers Communications' is seeking to buy Shaw Communications (NYSE:SJR) for C$20 billion ($16.2 billion) which has attracted the attention of regulators in Canada's highly concentrated telecoms market. Both sides of the family have said they support the deal.

The drug, Xipere, is injected to the back of the eye and delivers a version of a steroid commonly used for the treatment of uveitis, an inflammation of tissues in the eye.
Macular edema, a build-up of fluid in a part of the retina, is the leading cause of vision loss among people with uveitis.
Xipere achieved its main goal in Clearside's late-stage study, with nearly half the patients on the treatment showing improvement in the clarity of their vision. The drug was also shown to be generally well tolerated.
With Xipere, high levels of medication can be delivered to target tissues, such as the retina and the drug can treat the swelling, leading to visual improvement, Dr. Steven Yeh, the main investigator for the study, told Reuters in an interview.
The drug delivery approach is the first of its kind for the treatment of macular edema stemming from noninfectious uveitis, which affects about 300,000 adults in the United States, Dr. Yeh said.
Other drugs used to treat the condition in the United States include Bristol Myers (NYSE:BMY) Squibb's Kenalog, administered near the eye and  AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV)'s Ozurdex eye implant. There are some topical treatments as well.

In 2019, Bausch acquired the rights to develop and sell Xipere in the United States and Canada from Clearside.

Under the procedure, also known as a ""rolling review"", the European Medicines Agency (EMA) would assess data as soon as it becomes available, instead of waiting for a formal application when all required information has been gathered.
While vaccines are the main weapons against COVID-19, Merck's experimental pill molnupiravir could be a game-changer after studies showed it could halve the chances of dying or being hospitalised for those most at risk of contracting severe illness.
Merck, which is developing molnupiravir with partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, filed for U.S. emergency use authorization for the drug on Oct. 11. A panel of outside advisers to the U.S. health regulator are now slated to meet late in November to discuss whether to authorize the experimental antiviral pill.
Molnupiravir if approved by regulators, would be the first COVID-19 drug administered orally and also the first treatment for mildly ailing patients, whereas existing drugs are mostly used to treat the critically ill.

The drugmaker has a contract with the U.S. government to supply 1.7 million courses of the drug at a price of $700 per course. It also recently signed supply deals with countries including Britain, Malaysia and Singapore.
An EU official told Reuters earlier in the month that the bloc too was also considering signing a supply agreement for the antiviral pill, but would do so only after the company started the process of seeking approval.

U.S. cybersecurity officials could not be immediately reached to confirm the report.

U.S. officials confirmed to the Times that the operation was underway, with one unnamed senior administration official calling it ""unsophisticated, run-of-the mill operations that could have been prevented if the cloud service providers had implemented baseline cybersecurity practices.""

Investing.com – Tesla stock (NASDAQ:TSLA) climbed more than 4% in Monday’s premarket as a revived Hertz gave the company an order for 100,000 electric vehicles.
Tesla's cheapest Model 3 sedan starts at about $44,000. Ignoring the discount that large, negotiated orders tend to come with, the order is worth $4.4 billion, making it the largest ever for the EV-maker.
The cars have to be delivered by December next year, according to a note by Hertz.
Tesla shares also got a boost from news of Tesla’s Model 3 becoming the first electrical vehicle to top monthly sales of new cars in Europe.
Customers will be able to rent a Tesla Model 3 at Hertz airport and neighborhood locations in U.S. major markets and select cities in Europe.
Hertz is installing thousands of chargers, and customers who rent Model 3 will have access to 3,000 Tesla supercharging stations throughout the U.S. and Europe.
Hertz filed for bankruptcy protection last year. It was rescued by a group of investors including Knighthead Capital Management, Certares Opportunities and Apollo Capital Management."
1104,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 25, 2021 08:54AM ET</span>","Hertz Orders 100,000 Teslas in Rental-Market Shake-Up","(Bloomberg) -- Hertz Global Holdings (OTC:HTZGQ) Inc., barely four months out of bankruptcy, placed an order for 100,000 Teslas in the first step of an ambitious plan to electrify its rental-car fleet, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
It’s the single-largest purchase ever for electric vehicles and represents about $4.2 billion of revenue for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc., according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. While car-rental companies typically demand big discounts from automakers, the size of the order implies that Hertz is paying close to list prices. 
The cars will be delivered over the next 14 months, and Tesla’s Model 3 sedans will be available to rent at Hertz locations in major U.S. markets and parts of Europe starting in early November, the people said. Customers will have access to Tesla’s network of superchargers, and Hertz is also building its own charging infrastructure, they said. 
The electrification plan, which eventually will encompass almost all of Hertz’s half-million cars and trucks worldwide, is the company’s first big initiative since emerging from bankruptcy in June. And it signals that Hertz’s new owners, Knighthead Capital Management and Certares Management, are intent on shaking up an industry dominated by a handful of large players who are typically slow to change.
Tesla shares surged as much as 4.3% in premarket trading in New York, continuing the automaker’s push toward a $1 trillion valuation. There was no early movement in Hertz, which trades over the counter ahead of its relisting on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
By locking up so much of Tesla’s production -- the order is equivalent to about 1/10 of what the automaker can currently produce in a year -- Hertz may box out rivals from copycatting the strategy. Hertz also is breaking with tradition by paying full price for well-appointed cars rather than the typical base-model, heavily discounted sedans that populate rental lots.
A spokesman for Hertz declined to comment. Tesla didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.
In 2020, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). was Hertz’s biggest car and truck supplier, followed by Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co. and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. 
Teslas, with zero tailpipe emissions, will appeal to rental customers who want a green option or those eager to try out an battery-powered vehicle. Hertz may look to EVs because they’re less expensive to maintain and refuel, and they typically don’t lose as much value in the resale market as vehicles with internal combustion engines.
READ: Tesla  Target  (NYSE:TGT) Hiked at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) After ‘Extraordinary’ Sales
Earlier this month, Knighthead and Certares brought on Mark Fields, the former chief executive officer of Ford, as interim CEO of Hertz. They’ve also hired Tom Brady, the seven-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback, to star in Hertz ads showcasing the new Teslas, the people said.
Along with the Tesla rollout, Hertz, the biggest U.S. car-rental company after Enterprise Holdings Inc., is embarking on a broader revamp of its business around mobility and digitization, the people said. One component of that will be expedited rental bookings on the Hertz app.
Wild Journey
Electrification is the latest turn in Hertz’s wild journey through the Covid-19 pandemic. When demand for rental cars collapsed in early 2020, the company, whose brands also include Dollar, Thrifty and Firefly, was forced to file for bankruptcy and began liquidating its fleet.
Now, 17 months later, Estero, Florida-based Hertz is thriving thanks to a sharp rebound in travel and the global shortage of new cars. Day traders have embraced it as a meme stock.
As of June 30, Hertz had $1.8 billion in cash and its debt-to-equity ratio, a key measure of financial health, had improved to 2.4 from almost 10 at the end of 2019, according to an Oct. 15 regulatory filing.
Knighthead, a distressed-debt hedge fund, and Certares, a private equity firm specializing in travel, won the bankruptcy auction for Hertz in May with a $6 billion bid. It already looks like a bargain: The company has a market value of $11.6 billion in over-the-counter trading ahead of its relisting on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

UBS said it was selling UBS Gestion to Singular for an undisclosed sum. German newspaper Handelsblatt said Singular Bank will pay UBS between 200 million and 250 million euros ($291 million) for the subsidiary.
The deal follows UBS's exit from Austria last December, when it sold its operation catering for wealthy clients to Liechenstein-based private bank LGT.
UBS, the world's largest wealth manager with more than $3 trillion in invested assets, said the latest sale did not mean it was turning its back on the European market.
""European wealth management activities are and will remain a central and strategic core business for UBS,"" Christl Novakovic, chief executive of UBS Europe SE and Head Wealth Management Europe at UBS, said in a statement.
UBS's asset management and investment banking businesses in Spain were not part of the transaction, which was expected to be completed in the third quarter of next year.
The sale includes transferring all employees, client relationships, products, and services of the domestic wealth management business of UBS Spain to Singular Bank. 

UBS said its domestic wealth management business in Spain had been profitable in recent years, but it had agreed to sell it after deciding it was better off with a focused wealth manager based in the country.

Investing.com – Facebook stock (NASDAQ:FB) traded 0.5% lower in Monday’s premarket as a series of reports in The Washington Post over last week buttressed whistleblower Frances Haugen's claims that the social media giant puts profit before the safety of its users.
A new anonymous whistleblower, quoted by the Post, has cited examples showing Facebook officials’ casual approach towards probes by Congress.
According to an affidavit by the new whistleblower, in 2017 following the heat generated by accusations of Russian interference in the previous year’s Presidential elections, Facebook communications official Tucker Bounds allegedly said, “It will be a flash in the pan. Some legislators will get pissy. And then in a few weeks they will move onto something else. Meanwhile we are printing money in the basement, and we are fine.”
Other reports in the Post suggested founder Mark Zuckerberg having a say in every major decision at the company.
Similarly, according to another WaPo report today, at the time of Vietnam’s Communist Party congress in January, Facebook significantly enhanced censorship of “anti-state” posts. The report says Zuckerberg personally decided that Facebook would comply with Hanoi’s demands.
In a statement to the Post, the company sought to justify the censorship in Vietnam “to ensure our services remain available for millions of people who rely on them every day.”
That was part of a broader strategy of seeking to become the dominant source of news in developing countries through Facebook's 'Internet.org' campaign, which it originally styled as serving the under-connected in the digital age.
The latest accusations add to troubles at Facebook that’s grappling with reports of audience switching off the platform and Apple’s privacy changes hurting its advertising revenue. While those are still business issues, the company has also been accused of ignoring its own internal research when it suggested its Instagram platform is toxic for girls.

1109,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2021 08:05AM ET</span>",Airbus rejects pressure to curb record jet output goal,"By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) -Airbus has rebuffed calls by aircraft leasing companies to temper plans to almost double production of its best-selling A320 jet family, telling them its ambitions are justified by expectations for post-pandemic demand, industry sources said.
Major lessors have joined engine makers in warning Airbus that an aggressive output increase to a new peak above 70 aircraft a month could upset the market and hurt plane values while a recovery from the coronavirus crisis remains fragile.
The latest approach came in separate letters to Airbus from at least two of the world's largest leasing companies, the sources said, confirming a Financial Times report.
Airbus has responded by saying it is sticking to its plans, which involve a firm target of 64 A320-family jets a month in the second quarter of 2023, along with studies to raise monthly output to 70 in early 2024 and 75 by 2025. 
That compares with about 40 A320-family jets a month now and what was then a record level of 60 before the COVID-19 crisis.
Airbus told leasing companies complaining about the plans that ""demand is there"", two people familiar with the matter said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
An Airbus spokesperson declined to comment on confidential correspondence but said: ""We continue to work on our commercial aircraft production ramp-up in line with the planning communicated in May 2021.""
Shares in the planemaker fell more than 2% on Monday.
Representatives of lessors AerCap and Avolon, which are reported to have written to Airbus, were not immediately available for comment.
The exchange deepens a row over the speed of recovery from a pandemic-induced travel slump that led to thousands of planes being grounded in the past year. 
Although arguments over right levels of supply are common between jetmakers and lessors who rely on maintaining the value of planes, tensions have escalated since the pandemic as lessors have collectively overtaken airlines as the biggest buyers.
""It’s the normal tension, but Airbus have to play the game carefully,"" said one senior industry source. ""Lessors always take their aircraft; you don’t want to alienate them too much.""
Industry pioneer Steven Udvar-Hazy, executive chairman of Air Lease (NYSE:AL) Corp, warned of the dangers of overproduction at an Airline Economics conference last month.
NO SUPPLIER AGREEMENT
While most analysts agree that any recovery will benefit small jets such as the A320 and Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 first, the dispute focuses on whether it makes sense to raise output sharply before a glut of parked jets has returned to service - a step needed to rescue their earning potential for lessors and engine makers.
Airbus says its demand forecasts are based on verified contracts and that the supply chain needs transparency over its future production plans to finance future capacity.
However, it has yet to reach agreement with its suppliers over the most ambitious part of its plan.
""There is no agreement beyond 64 (a month); discussions are still happening,"" one supplier said. 
Others cautioned that even those output levels must confront post-crisis challenges over labour, shipping and inflation. 
Airbus aims to reach monthly output of 45 A320-family jets this quarter as a stepping stone towards its goals, but suppliers say the flow of parts is steady for now at about 40.
Suppliers are worried that they may be forced to invest in more machinery and factory space only to see demand fail to recover as quickly as Airbus hopes, while lessors fear that any excess output could chop years off the life of jets that they rent out, forcing them to take a hit on their balance sheets.
Engine makers fret that raising output of new jets too quickly could upset their own recovery by forcing existing jets into retirement rather than their repair shops.

Airbus this month suggested it would exploit competition between engine makers CFM and Pratt & Whitney to secure its output plans. 
Both  Safran  (PA:SAF), which co-owns CFM with  General Electric  (NYSE:GE), and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX), which controls Pratt, voiced concerns over jet output at mid-year.

That leaves Rome still struggling to find a solution for the Tuscan lender it has spent billions of euros on since the 2008 financial crisis. 
Here is a timeline of key events in the recent history of Monte dei Paschi (MPS), whose origins can be traced back to the 15th century, which have made it the epitome of Italy's banking nightmare.

1111,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2021 07:50AM ET</span>",Investors look beyond chip dent to German car earnings,"By Victoria Waldersee
BERLIN (Reuters) - German carmakers will reveal the extent of the dent a global chip shortage has made in their third quarter earnings over the next ten days, as investors fret over the next bump in the road.
The scarcity intensified in the three months to the end of September, with passenger car output at German plants 35% below 2019 levels, auto industry association data shows, hitting sales of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) and BMW.
But as they find ways around the chip roadblock, analysts are focused on rapidly depleting supplies of magnesium, which automakers use in everything from gearboxes to seat frames and is particularly practical for electric vehicles.
The lightweight material could pose the next supply chain challenge for the industry, analysts said, as China limits output to reduce its carbon emissions.
""We also think the Q3 results will not matter anymore... For us it is more the question, what happens thereafter?"" Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analysts said.
Daimler CEO Ola Kaellenius said last week that the company expected chip supply to stabilise in the fourth quarter, but warned a return to normality could take until 2023.
The luxury carmaker, scheduled to release results on Oct. 29, is still expected to post a 13% increase in third-quarter earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to 3.47 billion euros ($4 billion), Refinitiv estimates show.
Carmakers including Daimler prioritised high-margin vehicles when distributing the fewer chips they had, which helped them to post bumper first-half profits, with some even raising outlooks.
But BMW is expected to post a 9.3% fall in pre-tax profit to 2.23 billion euros on Nov. 3, Refinitiv estimates show.
Although it managed supply chain issues better than others, a lack of new models compared to Daimler and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) could make it hard to regain momentum, RBC analysts said.
Still, BMW is optimistic about its full-year outlook and lifted its annual profit margin forecast in September to 9.5-10.5% from a previous estimate of 7-9%.
Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess, meanwhile, has hammered home in recent weeks the urgency of keeping up with Tesla as the U.S. electric vehicle (EV) maker encroaches on German turf with a giant factory and battery plant.
Although Volkswagen dominates the European battery-electric vehicle market and is second in the U.S. to Tesla, Diess has called for a faster transition both within his firm and across Germany to ensure it remains ahead of the game.
Based on Refinitiv estimates, Volkswagen is expected to report pre-tax profits of 2.99 billion euros on Oct. 28, down from 3.2 billion euros last year, with a unit loss of around 500,000 vehicles this year so far.

""We expect a weak quarter,"" Stifel Research analysts said.

1112,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 25, 2021 07:50AM ET</span>","Trump-linked Digital World, Phunware Making Fresh Gains","By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Phunware (NASDAQ:PHUN) and  Digital World Acquisition  (NASDAQ:DWAC) stocks looked like extending their new-found celebrity status with fresh gains in Monday’s premarket trading.
Phunware rose 20% and DWAC 5% in volatile trading after closing Friday with gains of 471% and 107%, respectively.
It was DWAC first that shot into limelight Thursday after previous day’s announcement it would merge with Trump Media & Technology Group, an outfit set up by the former President to pursue opportunities in media. 
The heart of that business will be a new social media platform called ‘TRUTH Social,’ that he says will “stand up to the tyranny of Big Tech.”
Since the announcement, DWA stock rose 1,657% before closing Friday with gains of 846% over two days, reflecting anticipation that the president will be able to monetize his still-large public following through the business.
Even as DWAC was basking in its new-found status, the world discovered Phunware, catapulted into prominence by traders who dug out an old article by USA Today and circulated in social media. The May 2020 piece highlighted a partnership between Phunware and the Trump campaign of 2020.
According to that USA Today article, Phunware was associated with the Trump re-election campaign. Based on the article, the market speculated if Phunware would be the one developing Trump’s platform. There’s no final word yet on that though.
Phunware soared as much as 1,471% in just Friday’s session before giving up some of the gains.
The company operates a platform for mobile that provides companies products, solutions and data and services necessary to engage and make money off its mobile application consumer base.
Trump has been off social media as both Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and his then favorite, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), banned him from their platforms for his alleged role in inciting the January 6 Capitol riot. Since then, the former President has been exploring ways to revive social media presence, against a backdrop of reports that he will run again for President in 2024."
1113,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2021 07:46AM ET</span>",Analysis-From zero to $12 billion; investors chase Trump stock hype,"By Krystal Hu and Anirban Sen
(Reuters) - Donald Trump has united some of his supporters and detractors in buying shares in his new company and hoping to score a big win.
Anthony Nguyen, a 49-year-old software consultant from Austin, Texas, is a Republican who refused to vote for the former U.S. president in last year's election. 
Last week he joined the millions of online day traders who drove up the value of the company that will house Trump's new social media venture to almost $12 billion. The company's app has yet to be rolled out even on a trial basis, and Nguyen said he invested because he wanted to make a quick profit, not because he believed in the business. 
""Is Trump's social network going to work out? Probably not. But that doesn't mean you can't make money in the meantime,"" Nguyen said. 
Shares of Digital World Acquisition Corp have risen 842% since the blank-check acquisition company announced on Wednesday it would merge with Trump Media & Technology Group, which aims to launch a social media network called TRUTH Social.
Trump Media was worth $8.2 billion based on the closing price of Digital World shares on Friday, while the company that would be created with the merger would have a close to $12 billion valuation. This assumes Digital World valued its shares in the deal at $10, as is customary for special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs). A detailed regulatory filing that will allow a precise calculation is expected this week.
Many of the investors snapping up the shares are political supporters or fans of Trump. Shane Springer, a 28-year-old salesman from Norristown, Pennsylvania, is holding on to the $1,300 worth of stock he bought on trading app Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) last week until it goes ""to the moon"". He bought the shares for $13 and refused to sell even when they reached a high on Friday of $175.
""Trump has a strong history of making people a lot of money and winning. If this was an election I would have lost, but it's not, it's business,"" Springer said.
Nguyen, on the other hand, said he invested in the SPAC because he saw similarities with  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME), the video game retailer whose shares skyrocketed in January after an army of retail investors on Reddit and other social media platforms took on hedge funds betting against the company. The retail investors also piled into other ""meme"" stocks, from movie theater operator AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc to home supplies retailer  Bed Bath & Beyond Inc  (NASDAQ:BBBY).
Unlike GameStop and some other meme stocks, Digital World is a SPAC whose shares were not under pressure from hedge funds shorting them. But Nguyen said he detected the same exuberance for the Trump deal among retail investors. 
He bought $4,100 worth of Digital World shares at an average cost of $41 per share, sold half of them for $4,800 when the stock was at $96, and a quarter of them for $3,000 when the stock reached $120. He has 25 shares left.
""People like to jump on things and if you are nimble enough you get in, double your money and get out,"" Nguyen said. 
Spokespeople for Trump Media and Digital World did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the investor reaction to their deal.
Some investors are on the lookout for other stocks that could benefit from the hype. Last week Sam Nita, a 36-year-old construction worker in Portland, invested $2,800 in Digital World and $1,368 in U.S. software developer Phunware Inc, which worked on Trump's 2020 election campaign app. He heard about Phunware on trading app WeBull and made a $14,000 profit from the two stocks after Phunware shares rose as much as 1,471% on Friday.
""Everything MAGA (Make America Great Again) went nuts just like when Trump was president,"" said Nita, who voted for Trump in the past two elections. ""I'm hearing friends who don't even do stocks that want to know how to buy this Trump stock.""
Phunware chief operating officer Randall Crowder told Reuters he hoped ""the excitement about Phunware"" was because the company expected to deliver ""quarter over quarter growth of 50% in the third quarter and over 100% in the fourth quarter,"" and because it was building a truly decentralized data economy on blockchain.
BIGGEST SPAC RALLY EVER
Investors trying to predict where the SPAC's shares are heading next say they have little to go by. Many of them found a presentation that Trump Media released last week on its business plan to be voluminous in its aspirations but thin on financial details.
Those who argue the stock could go even higher point to the large social media following Trump enjoyed before he was banned for encouraging his supporters to participate in the U.S. Capital attack on Jan. 6. He had 89 million followers on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), 33 million on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and 24.5 million on Instagram, according to the presentation.
Investors bearish on the stock point to failures of other right-wing social media apps such as Parler. The fact that the rally in Digital World shares is already the biggest ever for a SPAC makes it more likely that people would be buying at the peak, they argue. 
SPACs had lost much of their luster with retail investors before the Trump media deal came along. Many of these investors were left with big losses after the companies that merged with SPACs failed to deliver on their ambitious financial projections.

Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida who focuses on capital markets, said a big risk for investors was the possibility that Digital World and Trump Media would seek to renegotiate the deal in light of the SPAC's stock rally, to keep more of the new company for themselves at the expense of retail investors.
""The higher the stock price goes, the more downside risk there is for investors,"" Ritter said.

1114,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2021 07:37AM ET</span>",France moves to shield its book industry from Amazon,"By Elizabeth Pineau
PARIS (Reuters) - Sophie Fornairon's independent bookshop has survived the rise of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) thanks to a French law that prohibits price discounting on new books, but she says the e-commerce giant's ability to undercut on shipping still skews the market against stores like hers.
Fornairon, who owns the Canal Bookstore in central Paris, now hopes that new legislation that would set a minimum price for book deliveries will even the contest further in the battle of neighbourhood stores against Amazon.
""It's a just return towards a level playing field,"" Fornairon, who employs four workers, said. ""We're not at risk of closing down any time soon, but Amazon is a constant battle"".
Amazon said the legislation, adopted by parliament but not yet enacted, would punish those in rural areas who cannot easily visit a bookstore and rely on delivery.
""Imposing a minimum shipping cost for books would weigh on the purchasing power of consumers,"" Amazon told Reuters in a statement.
That is an undesirable consequence government officials are wary of at a time President Emmanuel Macron administration is scrambling to head off growing discontent over rising energy prices six months from an election. 
In the country of Victor Hugo and Simone de Beauvoir, where local bookshops are held with special affection -- they were deemed 'essential businesses' during latter COVID lockdowns -- the move is the latest by the state to shield national culture against big tech firms.
More than 20% of the 435 million books sold in France in 2019 were bought online and the market share of France's 3,300 independent bookstores has been slowly declining because of competition from online retailers like Amazon, Fnac and Leclerc. 
Support from Macron helped push the legislation, which does not target Amazon by name, over the line. The minimum fee still has to be negotiated with the regulator. 
'DISTORTED COMPETITION'
French law prohibits free book deliveries but Amazon has circumvented this by charging a single centime (cent). Local book stores typically charge about 5-7 euros ($5.82-8.15) for shipping a book. 
Amazon's pricing strategy had resulted in the growing market share of a single operator, the Ministry of Culture said.
""This law is necessary to regulate the distorted competition within online book sales and prevent the inevitable monopoly that will emerge if the status quo persists,"" the ministry told Reuters.
Centre-right Senator Laure Darcos, who drafted the law, decided upon the minimum delivery charge when she observed how bookstores maintained 70% of their business despite being forced to shut during early COVID lockdowns, because the government reimbursed the shipping fees.
""It showed what a brake on business the postage costs are for local bookstores,"" Darcos said.
Amazon had lobbied hard against the legislation, worried the French move might set a precedent, the senator said.
France's bookstores are concentrated in towns and cities. Amazon said online sales of books had enabled consumers to have equal access, regardless of where they lived. 
Virtually-free delivery allowed book lovers in rural areas to buy books at the same price as someone who could walk into a bookstore -- precisely the spirit of the 1981 law, it said.
Asked when the legislation would be enacted, the Ministry of Culture declined to give a date, saying it was too early to say.
For Fornairon, the bookshop owner, the steady stream of U.S. tourists through her door were a constant reminder of the shield French legislation had already wrapped around stores likes hers.

""They say to me 'we didn't even know independent bookstores still existed',"" she said.

1116,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2021 07:22AM ET</span>",Analysis-A court battle raises the question - how far will Japan swallow poison pills?,"By Makiko Yamazaki
TOKYO (Reuters) - The fate of future hostile takeover bids in Japan could rest on an upcoming court ruling that will decide whether the country's top maker of newspaper printing presses can move forward with a poison pill against an unwelcome shareholder.
At issue is whether 105-year-old Tokyo Kikai Seisakusho Ltd will be allowed to not count votes from Asia Development Capital (ADC) - an investment firm that built up most of its 40% stake in a matter of weeks - when shareholders vote on issuing new stock that would dilute ADC's ownership.
A holding of more than 33% in Japan gives the stakeholder veto rights over important board decisions and sometimes de facto control.
ADC has sought an injunction and the Tokyo District Court's ruling - the first one to look at an attempt to exclude an investor from a shareholder vote on a poison pill - is expected sometime in the next week. A victory for Tokyo Kikai holds the potential to make it much easier for other Japanese companies to use poison pills. 
Tokyo Kikai, which has said ADC hurts its corporate value, will put the poison pill plan to a shareholder vote at an extraordinary general meeting on Friday.
The battle highlights both a rise in hostile takeovers in Japan over the past few years as the practice - once considered the domain of unscrupulous corporate raiders - loses its stigma as well as what some experts see as inadequate Japanese takeover rules that leave companies, small ones especially, too defenceless.
It also comes at a time when investors are watching to see if a drive by Japan's new prime minister, Fumio Kishida, to roll back some of the pro-market policies of former premier Shinzo Abe will impact corporate governance.
Corporate governance experts say it is too difficult to call which way the court might rule.
On one hand, ADC's argument that a ruling in Tokyo Kikai's favour would fly in the face of shareholder equality is a strong one as the principle is enshrined in Japanese corporate law, they say.
""If a target company can select who is allowed to vote on a poison pill, it will come up with all kinds of excuses to create a list of eligible shareholders who have the best chance of passing the pill,"" said Takumi Watanabe, executive officer at proxy advisory firm QuestHub.
QuestHub said it is not involved in the transaction.
But governance experts add the court might decide that ADC counts as an ""abusive buyer"" that could threaten the rights of minority shareholders, having rapidly built up its stake and not presented the company or other shareholders with a new management plan.
IT WOULDN'T HAPPEN OVERSEAS
Nearly a decade ago, more than 500 Japanese firms had a permanent poison pill, typically part of their company's articles of incorporation. But the practice - oft criticised for entrenching bad management - fell out of favour after corporate governance reforms pushed by Abe required institutional investors to disclose how they voted on agenda items at shareholder meetings, including poison pills. 
(GRAPHIC: Number of firms with anti-takeover measures in Japan - https://graphics.reuters.com/JAPAN-MA/gdpzywbelvw/chart.png) 
A poison pill that targets a specific bidder - called an emergency poison pill in Japan - was first successfully employed last year by Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Machine, renamed Shibaura Machine, in its fight against prominent activist investor Yoshiaki Murakami.
Since then at least five other firms including Tokyo Kikai have either introduced them or sought to introduce them. Among them, Shinsei Bank plans to seek shareholder approval https://www.reuters.com/business/shinsei-bank-plans-poison-pill-defence-against-sbis-11-bln-bid-sources-2021-09-17 for a poison pill to thwart online financial conglomerate SBI Holdings' $1.1 billion bid. 
Experts say the current wave of poison pill activity underscores a lack of clarity over what Japanese companies can do to block takeover bids.
They note Japanese small cap firms are particularly vulnerable to aggressive stake-building from unwelcome stakeholders. Tokyo Kikai, for example, has a market value of just 15 billion yen ($130 million).
Unlike the United States, Japanese company boards cannot swiftly adopt a poison pill to ward off a hostile suitor. Though not explicitly written in law, court precedents have led them to believe they must seek shareholder approval before adopting a poison pill - a time-consuming process.
In Europe, tender offers are usually mandatory for acquisitions of stakes beyond a certain threshold - 30% in the UK - a rule that would prevent cases like Tokyo Kikai's.
Wataru Tanaka, a corporate law professor at the University of Tokyo who submitted a letter of opinion to the court on behalf of Tokyo Kikai, believes the government should prioritise fixing the country's takeover rules.

""Poison pills are a second-best solution,"" he said.

1117,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 25, 2021 07:00AM ET</span>",U.S. Futures Edge Higher; Facebook Starts Tech Earnings Season,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening marginally higher Monday, starting the new week in cautious fashion ahead of the release of earnings reports from several tech giants, including Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) later in the session. 
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 5 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 Futures traded 4 points, or 0.1%, higher, while Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 20 points, or 0.1%.
Four out of the five FAANG stocks are set to report earnings during the week - Facebook after Monday’s close, followed by Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) on Tuesday, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are due Thursday.
Healthy growth in these heavily-weighted stocks have been behind much of the gains in the broader equities market over the last year, and strong earnings are likely to propel Wall Street even higher.
The major indices are coming off a winning week, with the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closing Friday at a record level having gained more than 1% last week. The broad-based S&P 500 rallied 1.7% last week, hitting an all-time high Friday, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.5%.
Also of interest Monday will be PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), after the payments company said over the weekend that it is not currently pursuing an acquisition of Pinterest (NYSE:PINS), responding to reports that it was in talks to buy the digital pinboard site for as much as $45 billion.
The economic data slate is largely empty Monday, but the third-quarter gross domestic product release on Thursday is expected to show growth slowing to 2.8% from 6.7% in the previous three months.
Other data to watch during the week includes reports on durable goods orders on Wednesday, initial jobless claims on Thursday and the core PCE price index on Friday, which will be the last big inflation data point before the Federal Reserve's November meeting next week.
Crude prices pushed higher Monday, climbing to multi-year highs with global supply remaining tight and demand strong as the economic recovery from Covid-19 continues.
Oil prices have also been bolstered by worries about coal and gas shortages in China, India and Europe, which have spurred fuel-switching to diesel and fuel oil in the limited number of places where that is practical.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.9% higher at $84.53 a barrel, just off the highest level since October 2014, while the Brent contract rose 0.7% to $85.27, just off the October 2018 high.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,801.60/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.1623.

Investing.com – HSBC stock (NYSE:HSBC) traded 0.7% higher in Monday’s premarket as the Asia-focused bank blew past third-quarter estimates and announced an up to $2-billion share buyback.
Driving the company’s doubling of profits in the September quarter was the release of reserves as the economy improved and so did the customer profile. The bank grew more confident about its balance sheet with expectations of only smaller defaults. This allowed it to release funds to the tune of $700 million. The bank said it expects to release some more amount in the ongoing quarter as asset quality improves.
In doing so, the bank joined its American rivals like JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) which have also benefited from an improving economy that allowed them to release the emergency funds.
The bank was able brush off concerns about pandemic-related bad loans and property problems in China. The bank has lent $19.6 billion to China's property sector, where the Evergrande Group is grappling with debts of $300 billion. There is no last word yet on the fate of the real estate developer, once China’s biggest by assets.
Commercial banking revenue rose while wealth and personal banking fell 3%. Revenue at HSBC’s investment banking unit also fell 3%, including a 46% fall at global debt markets -- a drop the bank attributed to last year’s strong result. Another reason was the bank’s decision to pull back some from deploying as much capital as it would otherwise.
HSBC posted a net profit of $4.2 billion for the quarter compared to $2 billion a year earlier.
Revenue came in at $12.2 billion, up from $11.9 in the September quarter of last year."
1120,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2021 06:20AM ET</span>",Dollars in the dirt: Big Ag pays farmers for control of their soil-bound carbon,"By Rod Nickel and Karl Plume
WINNIPEG, Manitoba/CHICAGO (Reuters) - The biggest global agriculture companies are competing on a new front: enticing farmers to join programs that keep atmosphere-warming carbon dioxide in the soil. 
Fertilizer producers  Nutrien  (NYSE:NTR) Ltd and Yara, agribusiness giant Cargill Inc, and seed and chemical dealers  Corteva  (NYSE:CTVA) Inc and  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) are paying growers for every acre of land dedicated to trapping carbon underground, known as sequestering it. The companies' ambitions stretch from the United States to Canada, Brazil, Europe and India, executives told Reuters.
Farmers capture carbon by planting off-season crops, tilling the ground less and using fertilizer more efficiently. They log their practices on digital platforms to generate a carbon credit. Agricultural companies use the credits to offset the climate impact of other parts of their businesses or sell them to companies looking to reduce their own carbon footprints.
Agriculture covers nearly 40% of the world's land and is responsible for 17% of global emissions, according to the United Nations. Changes to farm practices could sequester as much as 250 million tonnes of carbon dioxide annually in the United States, or 4% of the country's emissions, according to a 2019 report https://www.nap.edu/catalog/25259/negative-emissions-technologies-and-reliable-sequestration-a-research-agenda by the National Academy of Sciences. 
Agriculture is therefore increasingly seen as a potential ally as companies and governments attempt to meet lower greenhouse gas emission targets and fight global warming.
Some farmers view the programs run by the giant agricultural corporations with suspicion - as a method to harvest their data that will be used to sell them more products, according to interviews with more than a dozen farmers, analysts and farm groups. Other critics question whether it is even possible for farmers to guarantee they are keeping carbon underground because simply turning the soil can undo efforts to store it.
Sequestering carbon, however, can provide a new revenue stream for farmers looking to diversify in a volatile industry. The farming techniques required by such programs offer the additional promise of realizing higher yields from healthier soils that are less reliant on chemicals.
Hoping to be rewarded for reducing tillage and planting a cover crop on his central Illinois farm, Matt Tracy enrolled 548 acres in Cargill's RegenConnect program, choosing it over a similar one offered by Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) due to its short, single-season contract term.
He remains happy with his decision even after Bayer, whose program requires a 10-year commitment, began offering sign-up bonuses of up to $1,000.
""I didn't want to be tied up for too many years in a contract ... I want to see how it goes before I jump in whole-hog,"" he said. ""I think these programs could become more and more popular and we're going to get paid more than we are now.""
Agriculture companies can measure success through the number of acres farmers devote to their programs and commitments from other corporations to eventually buy the credits generated, said Alejandro Plastina, associate professor in economics at Iowa State University. Most of the corporate commitments are vague, however, and the acres in pilot projects remain small, he said.
For little cost, agriculture companies get to showcase their social responsibility, while securing farmers' loyalty to their digital platforms that can turn into greater farm supply sales down the road, Plastina said.
""It gives (ag companies) the opportunity to associate their brands with caring for the world,"" Plastina said. ""I don't expect them to make money on these projects anytime soon.""
EARLY LEADERS 
Bayer is an early leader with around 1.5 million acres enrolled in sustainable agriculture programs globally, mostly in the United States. 
Bayer's program is unique in that it compensates growers for planting cover crops and reducing tillage, rather than paying them for how many tonnes of verified carbon they sequester.
""The idea was to get something that farmers feel comfortable with and certain of so they can have a line of sight in terms of how much money they can make,"" said Leo Bastos, head of Bayer's carbon business.
Nutrien's program has secured 200,000 acres in the United States and Canada this year. Nutrien expects to make a profit from the start, because enrolment involves selling farmers high-margin products like crop treatments composed of insect-killing bacteria or controlled-release fertilizer, said Mark Thompson, the company's Chief Strategy and Sustainability officer.
Such products also generate higher yields for farmers, Thompson said. 
Cargill aims to reduce its supply-chain emissions 30% by 2030 in part by enrolling 10 million acres in small-scale regenerative agriculture programs. 
Corteva's partnership with farm technology and services provider Indigo Ag rewards farmers for better crop nutrient management, which could encourage purchases of products such as nitrogen stabilizers, which make more efficient use of fertilizer. 
""Corteva sees that as a way to deepen their relationship"" with farmers, said Chris Harbourt, Indigo's global head of carbon. 
Norway-based Yara is running a pilot program on 50,000 U.S. acres and plans to have 1 million U.S. acres under contract by year-end. 
Brazil and India, where farmers harvest multiple crops each year, could generate larger volumes of sequestered carbon than the United States under Yara's program in as little as three years, said Alex Bell, chief executive of the program, called Agoro Carbon Alliance. 
Agoro has an edge over some competitors because it is signing farmers to longer contracts, ten years, that should yield higher prices for their carbon, Bell said.
""It's a tough thing to ask of farmers, but that's what (credit) buyers actually value,"" Bell said. With the average U.S. farmer nearing retirement age, some are reluctant to lock in long-term, he said.
Yara is launching its program at a loss and may break even within three years, Bell said.
Farmers, however, give the programs mixed reviews. 
""I smell complete bullshit - it's a terrible idea,"" said Manitoba farmer Gunter Jochum, president of the Western Canadian Wheat Growers Association. In return for small payments to farmers, ag companies gain access to valuable data, he said.
The programs' principle is ""essentially unworkable,"" because carbon sequestration is not permanent, especially in a warming climate, Canada's National Farmers Union said in a submission to the Canadian government.

But North Dakota farmer Justin Topp decided to give carbon farming a try. He committed 12,000 acres, or 80% of his land to Nutrien's program, choosing it over four others. 
""Everybody's talking about it. I'm curious about what shakes out.""

1121,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2021 06:10AM ET</span>","GM, Ford results likely to reflect chip shortage's varying impacts on sector","By Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co are likely to show investors both the positive and negative financial impacts of the global semiconductor chip shortage when the U.S. automakers report third-quarter results on Wednesday.
GM and Ford have had to bring some assembly lines to a halt for lack of semiconductors, and contend with rising costs for other parts and raw materials as well as shipping. Lost production and rising supply-chain costs put pressure on profit margins. 
However, GM and Ford have been able to offset that pressure thanks to strong demand for their lucrative full-size trucks and SUVs, which has allowed them to cut back on discounts and maintain strong profits. 
Investors will be listening carefully to what GM and Ford's respective CEOs, Mary Barra and Jim Farley, say about how long they can protect profits from the supply-chain storm. 
Both GM and Ford have recently outlined strategies for generating more revenue from software-powered services, and argued their businesses deserve to be valued more like electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. 
But now and for the next several years, the Detroit automakers - like Tesla - will depend mainly on profit from selling hardware.
The chip shortage https://www.reuters.com/article/chips-shortage-explainer-int-idUSKBN2BN30J has hit sales hard as inventories on dealer lots dry up. U.S. new-vehicle sales in September dropped to a tepid annual rate of just over 12 million vehicles, and industry forecaster IHS Markit last month cut its 2022 global light vehicle production forecast by 8.5 million vehicles or 9.3%, citing the supply-chain disruptions.
Last month, GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson cautioned the company's third-quarter wholesale deliveries could be down by 200,000 vehicles because of chip shortages. 
Meanwhile, the rise in the price of steel and other commodities has been unrelenting. And the disruptions in the global supply chain, whether congested ports or a shortage of materials like resin and magnesium, have continued to drive up operating costs and interrupt production schedules.
Recent warnings about supply-chain disruptions from such suppliers as  Magna International  (NYSE:MGA), Continental, Autoliv (NYSE:ALV), Aptiv (NYSE:APTV) Plc,  Lear  (NYSE:LEA) Corp and ABB Ltd suggest the worst of the fallout could still lie ahead.

Several auto executives, including GM President Mark Reuss, have said they see the chip situation stabilizing next year, albeit at lower-than-desired levels. However, some executives including like  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn)'s chief executive, Ola Kallenius, feel the impact could last well into 2023.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) said earlier this month it expected GM and Ford to guide investors to the lower end of their financial forecasts for the year when they report.

HAMBURG (Reuters) - Aurubis AG, Europe's largest copper producer, remains confident it will achieve its forecast of higher operating profits this year despite the impact of the pandemic, the semiconductor crisis and higher energy prices, its CEO said. “Aurubis is in a good state and our performance is robust,” CEO Roland Harings said. “We are experiencing very good demand for our copper products, metal prices are at high levels which illustrates strength in the economy and we are achieving high production.” Aurubis in August forecast full-year group 2020/21 operating earnings before tax of 270-330 million euros ($314-$384 million), against 221 million euros in the previous year. “We are retaining this forecast and we remain hopeful we will be able to achieve the higher end of the range,” Harings said. “I am confident we will report a good performance for the current financial year."" Copper product demand is high despite production cuts in the automobile industry. “We are seeing strong product demand despite the chip crisis and supply chain problems in several industries,” Harings said. “We are seeing that the themes sustainability, electro-mobility, the expansion of renewable energy infrastructure are generating more demand.” “Although overall automobile production has been cut we have good order books from this sector. Electric vehicles have a considerably higher copper content and production of electric cars is increasing massively.” Aurubis is maintaining full output in the face of the surge in energy prices in past weeks. “We will continue full production, naturally rising energy costs are a factor we must face,” the CEO said. “We have extensive risk-management with long-term energy supply contracts.” “My opinion is that high energy costs are temporary because of several factors in the market.” Aurubis announced a 2022 copper premium for its customers of $123 per tonne above London Metal Exchange prices, up from $96 a tonne in 2021. “This reflects the firm demand we expect next year and also higher costs including for ocean shipping,” Harings said. “The 2021 level was perhaps rather low, announced during the uncertainty during the pandemic.” Annual treatment and refining charges (TC/RCs) for 2022 will be set by the global copper industry by the end of the year, with expectations of a rise. Miners pay TC/RCs to smelters to process their copper concentrate into refined metal. Charges typically rise when concentrate supply is large and mines have to compete for smelting capacity. “From my point of view, a rise in TC/RCs for 2022 would be justified by world market conditions,” Harings said. “High metal prices means mines have been increasing production and their output is expected to remain high in the new year.”

TOKYO (Reuters) -Panasonic on Monday unveiled a new large prototype battery designed to help Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc lower electric vehicle (EV) production costs, in a move the Japanese company's battery chief said would deepen business ties with its key U.S. customer.
During a media roundtable where Kazuo Tadanobu showed the battery that is around five times the size of those currently used by Tesla, he also said Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) had no plans to make cheaper Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) batteries for more affordable EVs.
Tesla's decision to diversify battery suppliers to companies such of South Korea's LG Energy Solution, and China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Co (CATL), and Panasonic's sale of Tesla shares had raised questions over the future of their decade-long partnership. 
But as the sole manufacturer of the 4680 format (46 millimetres wide and 80 millimetres tall) battery, Panasonic should remain a critical link in the EV maker's supply chain, at least for its pricier models.
""We have developed this because of the strong desire of the other party, and we think this can only lead to stronger ties,"" Tadanobu said. 
He did not say when Panasonic, which operates a plant in Nevada that supplies Tesla, would begin full-scale production.
Panasonic's decision to avoid LFP power packs means Tesla is buying those from CATL for some China-made Model 3 and Model Ys, and entry-level Model 3s in the United States. 
LFP batteries, 95% of which are made in China, are considered cheaper and safer than nickel-based batteries, but have less energy density and need be recharged more often. Panasonic's auto batteries are nickel-cobalt-aluminum (NCA).
Tesla wants the cheaper cobalt-free Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) batteries for its standard-range electric vehicles but needs to figure out how to overcome political tensions to get a Chinese partner to build the iron-based batteries near its U.S. factories.

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has also been in discussion with CATL and China's electric vehicle maker BYD about becoming LPF battery suppliers for its planned electric vehicle. Those talks, however have stalled https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/exclusive-apples-talks-with-chinese-battery-makers-catl-byd-mostly-stalled-2021-10-22 because the Chinese companies have refused to build plants in the United States, sources told Reuters last week. 
Tadanobu declined to say whether Apple had approached Panasonic about buying EV batteries.

SINGAPORE/LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC shrugged off concerns about pandemic-related bad loans and property problems in China on Monday with a surprise 74% quarterly profit jump and a $2 billion share buyback.
The British bank's profit growth was mainly driven by the release of cash reserves set aside in anticipation of pandemic-induced defaults, with HSBC's finance chief Ewen Stevenson telling Reuters that the worst of that impact is likely past.
""You should also look at the buyback as a measure of the confidence that we have at the moment that we are not unduly concerned about our exposures in China,"" Stevenson said.
The Asia-focused bank said it had $19.6 billion in lending to China's property sector, where China Evergrande Group is grappling with a $300 billion debt pile, stoking fears of further defaults and contagion risks.
HSBC CEO Noel Quinn, who was confirmed in the role in 2020 just as the pandemic-induced economic crisis began, is betting on Asia to drive growth, by moving global executives there and ploughing billions into lucrative wealth management. 
The bank could spend up to $1.5 billion more on acquisitions in that business after buying insurer AXA's Singapore assets for $575 million in August, Stevenson said.
""While we retain a cautious outlook on the external risk environment, we believe that the lows of recent quarters are behind us,"" Quinn said in a statement.
HSBC posted pretax profit of $5.4 billion for the quarter to September, versus $3.1 billion a year earlier and the $3.78 billion average estimate of 14 analysts compiled by HSBC.
Analysts at stockbrokers Goodbody said HSBC's revenue guidance and the reversal of expected credit losses ""should drive earnings upgrades while the capital beat and the $2bn buyback will be pleasing to investors.""
HSBC's London-listed shares rose 1% to their highest in four months. 
INFLATION FEARS
Despite the overall positive results, HSBC said its cost projections for 2022 had risen to $32 billion from $31 billion, due to global inflation pressures which would push up its $19 billion wage bill. 
Major companies worldwide have in recent weeks warned of the impact of rising costs driven by spiralling energy prices and supply chain disruption.
""A little bit of inflation is good for us as it should drive policy rates higher,"" Stevenson said. 
""However, we have a cost base of $32 billion of which $19 billion is compensation... so it doesn't take much (to push up costs), 2 or 3% inflation on the cost base is $400 to $600 million of additional costs,"" he added.
Set against those concerns, HSBC released $700 million in cash it had put aside in case pandemic-related bad loans spiked, as opposed to the same time a year earlier when it took an $800 million charge. 
INVESTMENT BANK
Another headache for HSBC is investment banking, where rivals such as  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) are riding an M&A boom https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-banks-beat-profit-estimates-economic-rebound-red-hot-markets-2021-10-14 to record-beating profits.
HSBC's investment bank saw income fall this year as it paid the price for its bias towards debt markets, which have been patchy amid low interest rates that crimped trading, while rivals' equities and merger-focused businesses have thrived.

It is the second big British bank to post strong quarterly results, after  Barclays  (LON:BARC) doubled profits on a strong performance by its investment bank advisory business.
HSBC's results will set expectations high for Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF), which focuses on similar markets and reports on Nov. 2.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Shares in China Evergrande Group's electric vehicles (EV) unit (HK:0708) rose on Monday as the embattled property developer moved to prioritise the growth of its nascent EV business over its troubled core real estate operations.
Evergrande , reeling under more than $300 billion in liabilities, averted a costly default last week with a last-minute bond coupon payment, buying it more time to head off a looming debt crunch with its next major payment deadline on Friday.
An announcement by its chairman, Hui Ka Yan, reported by state media on Friday, that it would make its new electric vehicle venture its primary business, instead of property, within 10 years, cheered investors on Monday.
Evergrande rose as much as 6% during the session before closing down 0.7%. China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group Ltd rose 11.4%. The benchmark Heng Seng Index was flat.
Raymond Cheng, CGS-CIMB Securities' head of China research, said the business shift makes sense given Beijing's growing support for EVs and its increased tightening of the frothy real estate sector.
""This is the best outcome, if it just focuses on existing developments and maintains the operation,"" Cheng said.
While the move would help Evergrande deleverage by gradually scaling down its massive undeveloped land holdings, Cheng said it was unclear how it would affect the company's planned disposals including stakes in the EV unit.
Evergrande's new vehicle business, founded in 2019, has yet to reveal a production model or sell a single vehicle https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/before-debt-woes-china-evergrandes-ambitious-car-making-goals-stunned-industry-2021-10-18. Last month, the unit warned it was still seeking new investors and asset sales, and that without either it might struggle to pay salaries and cover other expenses.
Hui expects property sales will slow to about 200 billion yuan ($31.31 billion) per year within the 10-year period, compared to more than 700 billion yuan last year, China's Securities Times reported on Friday.
NEXT HURDLES
News late last week that Evergrande had averted a default by securing $83.5 million for the last-minute payment of interest on a bond has lifted confidence the company may be able to avoid a messy collapse that would have significant ramifications for global financial markets.
On Monday, sources told Reuters some bondholders had received coupon payments they were owed last week, which suggested debt problems were being addressed.
Evergrande next needs to find $47.5 million by Friday and has nearly $338 million in other offshore coupon payments coming up in November and December. 
Broader concerns about China's real estate sector, which accounts for a quarter of gross domestic product, still loom large for investors and policymakers in the world's second-largest economy. 
Developer Modern Land has a $250 million bond maturing on Monday. It said last week it ended an attempt to seek bondholder approval to extend the maturity date of the notes by three months, citing liquidity issues. 
Calls to Modern Land's investor relations office were not answered when Reuters sought comment on whether the payment has been made. 
As liquidity concerns in the sector grow, property firms with large dollar-denominated debts will meet with the National Development and Reform Commission in Beijing on Tuesday to report their total issuance volume and repayment capability, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said. 
Media outlet Cailianshe first reported the meeting earlier on Monday. 
Separately, Evergrande said on Sunday work had resumed on more than 10 projects in six cities including Shenzhen. Many of its projects had been halted due to payments owed to suppliers and contractors.

Also lifting general confidence, state media outlet Xinhua in an article on Monday said the spillover effect of Chinese real estate companies' debt default risks to the financial industry would be controllable.
The report follows comments from senior officials including Vice Premier Liu He and central bank governor Yi Gang last week, who also said property companies were facing debt default issues because of poor management and a failure to adjust to market changes.

Hui expects property sales will slow to about 200 billion yuan ($31.31 billion) per year within the 10-year period, compared to more than 700 billion yuan last year, China's Securities Times reported on Friday.
NEXT HURDLES
News late last week that Evergrande had averted a default by securing $83.5 million for the last-minute payment of interest on a bond has lifted confidence the company may be able to avoid a messy collapse that would have significant ramifications for global financial markets.
On Monday, sources told Reuters some bondholders had received coupon payments they were owed last week, which suggested debt problems were being addressed.
Evergrande next needs to find $47.5 million by Friday and has nearly $338 million in other offshore coupon payments coming up in November and December. 
Broader concerns about China's real estate sector, which accounts for a quarter of gross domestic product, still loom large for investors and policymakers in the world's second-largest economy. 
Developer Modern Land has a $250 million bond maturing on Monday. It said last week it ended an attempt to seek bondholder approval to extend the maturity date of the notes by three months, citing liquidity issues. 
Calls to Modern Land's investor relations office were not answered when Reuters sought comment on whether the payment has been made. 
As liquidity concerns in the sector grow, property firms with large dollar-denominated debts will meet with the National Development and Reform Commission in Beijing on Tuesday to report their total issuance volume and repayment capability, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said. 
Media outlet Cailianshe first reported the meeting earlier on Monday. 
Separately, Evergrande said on Sunday work had resumed on more than 10 projects in six cities including Shenzhen. Many of its projects had been halted due to payments owed to suppliers and contractors.

Also lifting general confidence, state media outlet Xinhua in an article on Monday said the spillover effect of Chinese real estate companies' debt default risks to the financial industry would be controllable.
The report follows comments from senior officials including Vice Premier Liu He and central bank governor Yi Gang last week, who also said property companies were facing debt default issues because of poor management and a failure to adjust to market changes.

1130,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2021 05:10AM ET</span>",Shipping drifts off net-zero course without carbon levy -study,"By Stine Jacobsen
COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - The global shipping industry is on course to see its greenhouse gas emissions rise by around a fifth by 2050 if action including introducing a carbon levy on fuel is not taken, new research backed by industry leaders shows.
With about 90% of world trade transported by sea, global shipping accounts for nearly 3% of the world's CO2 emissions and the sector is under growing scrutiny to become cleaner.
""The transition doesn't happen by itself because the ways of decarbonising are more expensive than just continuing to run on fossil fuels,"" said Bo Cerup-Simonsen, head of the independent Maersk Mc-Kinney Moller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping, which published its research on Monday.
""If we don't do anything beyond what is just normal good practice then shipping is on a path which is very far from the pathway laid by IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) and the Paris Agreement,"" Cerup-Simonsen told Reuters.
He referred to a landmark report https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/un-sounds-clarion-call-over-irreversible-climate-impacts-by-humans-2021-08-09 by the U.N. climate panel published in August, which warned that global warming is dangerously close to spiralling out of control.
However, decarbonisation over the next three decades would in fact be possible if action, including a global carbon levy on shipping fuels, is taken to ensure that zero and low carbon fuels become economically viable and competitive to fossil fuels, he said.
Leading shipping associations in September proposed creating a global levy on carbon emissions from ships to help speed up the industry's efforts to go greener and submitted a proposal to the UN's shipping agency, the International Maritime Organization.
The Maersk Mc-Kinney Moller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping said such a levy could be introduced initially at as low as $50 per ton of CO2, with the revenue raised being earmarked for first-movers in the industry to incentivise research and development of alternative fuels. 
""You then have 99% (of the shipping industry) running on fossil fuel and they are paying for the 1% that are starting to run on the green fuels,"" Cerup-Simonsen said. 

The levy could then be gradually increased to $150 towards 2050, the centre says in its report. 
The Copenhagen-based non-profit centre was founded last year with funding by shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk's majority owner, the A.P. Moller Foundation, and partners include shipping lines Maersk and NYK, oil firm BP (NYSE:BP) Siemens Energy and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.

1131,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2021 05:05AM ET</span>","LG Chem Q3 results miss estimates, hit by GM Bolt recall cost","By Heekyong Yang and Joyce Lee
SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea's LG Chem Ltd posted a 20% fall in quarterly profit on Monday, hurt by a one-off expense associated with the recall of General Motors (NYSE:GM)' Bolt electric vehicles.
It reported an operating profit of 727 billion won ($617.55 million) for the July-September period, versus 904 billion won a year earlier and an average analyst forecast of 893 billion won compiled by Refinitiv SmartEstimate.
Earlier this month, LG Chem, which owns electric battery maker LG Energy Solution (LGES), said it would take a charge nL1N2R8085 of 620 billion won in its third quarter results in connection with the GM Bolt recall https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/chevrolet-bolt-fires-date-back-early-2019-gm-says-2021-09-13 due to the risk of fire caused by rare battery defects.
Revenue rose 41% to 10.6 trillion won, LG Chem said in a regulatory filing.
LG and GM settled a $2 billion cost deal on the Bolt recall earlier this month, paving the way for LG's battery unit to resume work on its suspended initial public offering.
""We expect that it is less likely that the company would face repetitive large-scale recalls related to battery safety issues in the future,"" LGES Vice President Chang Seung-se said in a call with analysts, citing the company's improved process to detect defective batteries. 
LGES is hoping to a ride a boom in soaring battery demand, as global automakers are investing billions of dollars to accelerate a transition to low-emission mobility and prepare for a progressive phase-out of internal combustion engines.
The company, which also supplies Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and Hyundai Motor Co, struck a deal last week with Stellantis NV to jointly produce EV batteries.
Before the third -quarter earnings results announcement, LGES named LG Corp Vice Chairman Kwon Young Soo as its new chief executive officer.
Asked about LG Chem's plans to develop cheaper lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) nL4N2PU1IWbatteries for electric vehicles, the company said it plans to supply LFP batteries for energy storage systems (ESS) first. 
Tesla said it plans to adopt LFP batteries in its fleet of standard-range vehicles globally.
LGES has been focusing on developing nickel-cobalt-manganese (NCM) batteries, which are more expensive but offer longer range. 
Japan's Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) said on Monday it had no nL1N2RL0CKplans to make LFP batteries for electric vehicles. 

Shares of LG Chem closed up 0.4%, versus the KOSPI's 0.5% rise.

1132,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 25, 2021 04:25AM ET</span>",European Stocks Mixed; HSBC Gains on 3Q Earnings,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets traded mixed early on Monday, with investors weighing strong results from banking giant HSBC as well as China’s latest Covid-19 outbreak.
At 4:30 AM ET (0830 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.2% higher, the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.5%, at a 52-week high, while the CAC 40 in France fell 0.1% .
HSBC (LON:HSBA) stock rose 0.2% after the U.K. banking giant, one of the largest in Europe, beat expectations with a 74% rise in third quarter profit, posting pretax profit of $5.4 billion versus $3.1 billion a year earlier.
As with Wall Street's results last week, these were helped by the release of cash set aside for expected bad loans that have not materialized. HSBC also announced a share buyback of up to $2 billion, but said it wouldn't restore its dividend yet.
Staying in the banking sector, Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MI:BMPS) stock fell over 5% after UniCredit (MI:CRDI), down 1.8%, and Italy's government called off negotiations over the sale of the ailing bank. 
Elsewhere, Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) stock rose 0.8% after the chief executive of the German airline said Monday that business air travel is recovering faster than expected and should remain solid through the winter.
Still, worries are growing that an increase in Covid-19 cases in China, one of the globe’s main growth drivers, will hit global demand.
China warned Monday that new infections will increase in the coming days after the latest outbreak expanded to 11 provinces, prompting the locking down of Ejin, a county in northwestern Inner Mongolia that has seen the most Covid-19 cases. China is one of the few countries still adopting a 'zero tolerance' attitude toward Covid, preferring economically costly lockdowns to acceptance that the disease will become endemic.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) downgraded its prediction for China’s economic growth at the weekend, saying it will likely expand 5.2% next year, down from a previous projection of 5.6%.  
Germany’s Ifo Institute released its October business climate survey earlier Monday, and the index slipped to 97.7, from a revised 98.9 the previous month. Elsewhere in Germany, Zooplus (DE:ZO1G) stock rose 0.6% after a takeover battle between two private equity houses for the pet supplies retailer ended with them making a joint bid that looks likely to be approved by its board.
Crude prices pushed higher Monday, climbing to multi-year highs with global supply remaining tight and demand strong as the economic recovery from Covid-19 continues.
By 4:30 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.9% higher at $84.47 a barrel, just off the highest level since October 2014, while the Brent contract rose 0.7% to $85.22, just off the October 2018 high.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,801.05/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1656.

""The biggest problem for SAS is costs, so that's where we have to start,"" SAS Chief Executive Anko van der Werff told the paper. ""Other airlines have cut costs and can fly more flexibly and efficiently. We need to be able to do that, too."" 
The negotiations could last three months, Jyllands-Posten reported.
Shares in SAS were down 8.9% in early trade on Monday. 
Nordnet analyst Per Hansen said the negotiations could be tough.
""After the strike in 2019, the pilots were able to negotiate large wage increases for which SAS had no finances at all,"" he said in a note. 

The airline, part-owned by the governments of Sweden and Denmark, has noted a gradual increase in demand from leisure travellers during the summer but business travel has yet to bounce back from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
""We are not going to make money in 2022 and we will also have challenges with 2023,"" Van der Werff told Jyllands-Posten. ""The pandemic will have an effect for at least three to four years, and that underlines the importance of us changing.""

Meanwhile private travel is seeing an ""extension of the summer season"" as people catch up on flights they were not able to take immediately after the onset of the pandemic, Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr told Austrian newspaper Kleine Zeitung.
""In addition, we are seeing a positive trend in business travel, which was still at a low level in the third quarter and is now picking up strongly,"" Spohr said in an interview.
Global air travel was brought to a standstill by the coronavirus pandemic, forcing Lufthansa into a multi-billion dollar bailout by the German government.
Lufthansa expects the level of business travel in the medium term to be around 90% or more of what it was before COVID-19.

""There will ... be no sudden drop in demand in winter this year,"" he said of the outlook for business travel as demand tends to fade less in that segment in winter and the ""good development"" in bookings is expected to last until December.
""Business travel has returned faster and more strongly than expected,"" Spohr said, adding that it was being felt in particular in the German, Swiss, Austrian, Belgian and northern Italian markets, where more flights have been added.

The company, whose customers include Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and several Formula One teams, presented 'Sensify', a pioneering braking system that can operate independently on each of a vehicle's four wheels.
It includes a digital ""brain"" that uses data to adapt braking to personal driving styles and changing road conditions.
Schillaci, an automotive industry veteran with previous stints at Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor and Toyota, said mechanics were still predominant in the Sensify system, compared with software content.
""But soon the mechanic and software contents will soon be equivalent and by the end of the decade software will become predominant in braking systems,"" he said.
""That's why we include tech companies among our eventual M&A targets, not necessarily large companies but also startups which could be interesting for us,"" Schillaci said. 
Brembo in the last year agreed to buy SBS Friction, a Danish maker of brake pads for motorbikes, and Spanish motorcycle brake maker J.Juan.
Schillaci said Brembo was not looking at acquisitions just to increase revenues.
""We look at M&A as a way to make our core business thrive. Recent deals show we want to be vertically integrated in what we do,"" he said.
By the end of this year, the company will open its first high technology lab in California's Silicon Valley to accelerate its digitisation strategy.
""We'll be in California to acquire know-how on latest artificial-intelligence technologies, but also to look around, if we see there are startups catching our attention,"" Schillaci said. 
Brembo shareholders have approved a loyalty share scheme that would allow its controlling family to retain that position as the company looks to make acquisitions.

Schillaci said Brembo was in talks with a major unidentified automaker to supply Sensify to its models starting from 2024, while adding he expected the system would become a ""standard feature,"" at least for premium platforms, by 2030.
All components of the Sensify system are designed internally, Schillaci said, adding Brembo was finalising partnerships with external providers ""to complete our know-how and to accelerate production scale-up when needed"".

A look at the day ahead from Danilo Masoni.
A wild week for global earnings kicks off today seemingly in a cautious fashion as profit revisions slow down while inflation and supply chain pressures risk squeezing margins in a season that could set the direction of travel in the weeks ahead.
The overall picture looks still strong though as the economy remains in recovery mode, offsetting for now angst over central banks tapering bond purchases and raising interest rates.
The S&P 500 is just below its record peak and the number of companies that have beaten expectations in the third quarter is now close to 84%, while STOXX 600 beats in Europe are past 60% so far, per Refinitiv I/B/E/S data.
But the wariness is justifiable, especially with Big Tech results packing the calendar this week just as investors fall out of love with pandemic darlings, lured by the attractions of cheaply valued stocks.
Eyes are on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which starts the season for the FAANG group today following a 26% drop in Snap (NYSE:SNAP) shares on Friday after the ad firm warned of a hit from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) privacy tweaks.
Meanwhile, a long unloved sector, banks, is finding fresh demand from the changing macro environment. HSBC surprised with a 74% rise in profit as concerns about pandemic-related bad loan receded, allowing it to announce a $2 billion buyback. Its shares rose to a 4-month high in Hong Kong.

Futures on main European and U.S. benchmark indexes were trading just a tad in the black, while crude oil prices continued their race to new multi-year peaks and U.S. 10-year treasury yields held a five-month high of 1.7% hit last week.

NEW YORK/ SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - U.S. electric car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc on Sunday rolled back the latest version of its Full Self-Driving (FSD) beta software, less than a day after its release, after users complained of false collision warnings and other issues. 
The setback comes as Tesla is under regulatory scrutiny over the safety of its semi-autonomous driving technology, which it calls ""FSD.""
""Seeing some issues with 10.3, so rolling back to 10.2 temporarily,"" Chief Executive Elon Musk said in a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) post on Sunday.
""Please note, this is to be expected with beta software. It is impossible to test all hardware configs in all conditions with internal QA (quality assurance), hence public beta,"" he said.
Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment outside regular U.S. business hours.
The release of the new driving assist system to some owners of Tesla models, which the company said featured several improvements, had been announced for Friday, Oct 22.
On Saturday, Musk said the release would probably be delayed by a day.
""Regression in some left turns at traffic lights found by internal QA in 10.3. Fix in work, probably releasing tomorrow,"" he tweeted on Saturday.
The Tesla vehicles with the latest 10.3 software repeatedly provided Forward Collision Warnings when there was no immediate danger, according to video postings of beta users. Some vehicles also automatically applied brakes without reason, users said on social media posts.

1141,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 25, 2021 02:09AM ET</span>",European Stock Futures Steady; HSBC Results Impress,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open in a steady manner Monday, with investors weighing strong results from banking giant HSBC as well as China’s latest Covid-19 outbreak.
At 2:10 AM ET (0610 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% lower, while CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.2% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.1%.
HSBC (LON:HSBA), one of the largest banks in Europe, beat expectations with a 74% rise in third quarter profit, posting pretax profit of $5.4 billion versus $3.1 billion a year earlier, helped by the release of cash set aside for expected bad loans that have not materialized. It also announced a share buyback of up to $2 billion but said it wouldn't restore its dividend yet.
Also helping the tone in Europe were gains in China  Evergrande  Group (HK:3333) stock in Asia after the embattled property developer averted a costly default last week with a last-minute bond coupon payment. The group also moved Monday to prioritize growth of its electric vehicles business over its troubled core real estate operations.
That said, there are also worries that an increase in Covid-19 cases in China, one of the globe’s main growth drivers, will hit global demand.
China warned Monday that new infections will increase in the coming days after the latest outbreak expanded to 11 provinces, prompting the locking down of Ejin, a county in northwestern Inner Mongolia that has seen the most Covid-19 cases. China is one of the few countries still adopting a 'zero tolerance' attitude toward Covid, preferring economically costly lockdowns to accepting that the disease will become endemic.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) downgraded its prediction for China’s economic growth at the weekend, saying it will likely expand 5.2% next year, down from a previous projection of 5.6%. 
Back in Europe,  Michelin  (PA:MICP) will also be in the spotlight after the French tire manufacturer releases its earnings, while the Italian banking sector will be in focus after the Italian government on Sunday ended talks with UniCredit (MI:CRDI) over the rescue of commercial bank Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MI:BMPS). 
Germany’s Ifo Institute will also release its October business climate survey.
Crude prices pushed higher Monday, climbing to multi-year highs with global supply remaining tight and demand strong as the economic recovery from Covid-19 continues.
Oil prices have also been bolstered by worries about coal and gas shortages in China, India and Europe, which have spurred fuel-switching to diesel and fuel oil in the limited number of places that that is pracitcal.
By 2:10 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1% higher at $84.58 a barrel, just off the highest level since October 2014, while the Brent contract rose 0.8% to $85.34, just off the October 2018 high.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,799.50/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1659.

1142,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2021 01:06AM ET</span>",Rocky Mountain high: U.S. looks to Colorado for methane emissions policy,"By Valerie Volcovici and Nichola Groom
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. environmental regulators are expected to base new rules for controlling methane emissions from oil and gas operations on the nation-leading policies of a state that has been tamping down on the potent greenhouse gas for seven years - Colorado.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is likely to unveil the rules, which will have major repercussions for oil and gas drillers, this week, according to sources familiar with early versions of the proposed regulations.
The proposal, which will be rolled out just days before the start of the United Nations conference on global warming https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/cop26-glasgow-who-is-going-who-is-not-2021-10-15 in Glasgow, is a key pillar of the Biden administration's broader crackdown on climate change.
While drillers from major producing states like Texas and North Dakota are bracing for a raft of new requirements, for companies in Colorado, stiffer government rules around methane emissions are business as usual.
The state has both strong environmental ambitions and a large oil and gas industry. It first put state-level methane regulations into place in 2014, and has gradually expanded those requirements in efforts to cut methane emissions from the drilling sector by more than half of 2005 levels by 2030.
“Colorado regulations are the toughest on the planet,” Dan Haley, president of the Colorado Oil and Gas Association, said, adding that the rules were crafted with industry input.
Methane https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/save-planet-focus-cutting-methane-un-climate-report-2021-08-09, a gas that leaks from oil and gas infrastructure, livestock farming and landfills, is the second-biggest cause of climate change after carbon dioxide. It has a higher heat-trapping potential than CO2 but it breaks down in the atmosphere faster, so rapid reductions of methane emissions https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/save-planet-focus-cutting-methane-un-climate-report-2021-08-09 can quickly have a large impact on slashing greenhouse gases.
The U.S. and European Union last month kicked off an effort https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/us-eu-line-up-over-20-more-countries-global-methane-pact-2021-10-11 by two dozen nations to slash methane emissions 30% over the next decade. 
Current federal rules limit methane emissions from new sources, leaving existing operations unregulated in states that do not have their own standards. 
Colorado's rules require oil and gas companies to find and fix methane leaks and install technologies to limit or prevent emissions at existing operations. Since 2019, it has required semiannual leak detection, tank controls and performance standards for transmission. The rules, which also apply to low-production, or so-called marginal wells, also ban routine flaring of methane and require the installation of valves that reduce emissions.
SOARING PRODUCTION
Oil production in Colorado surged 57% between 2015 and 2019 due to the rise of horizontal drilling techniques that underpinned the U.S. shale gas boom before slipping in 2020 at the outset of the coronavirus pandemic, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data. 
Methane emissions growth lagged the production increases, climbing 9% in the 2015 to 2019 period, according to the state. In the Permian Basin, meanwhile, the nation's largest and most productive oil field which covers portions of Texas and New Mexico, methane emissions from oil production soared by more than a quarter during that time at large facilities that report to the EPA, federal data shows.
""It's noteworthy that Colorado emissions have remained fairly stable despite an increase in oil and natural gas production,"" Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment spokesperson Andrew Bare said in an emailed statement. He added the 2019 figures do not reflect expected emissions reductions from additional policies the state has crafted since.
“Since 2014 it feels like we've been engaged in almost continuous rulemaking,” said Garry Kaufman, director of the CDPHE’s air pollution control division.
The state has been deploying overflights and ground-based measurements to try to refine its measurement of methane emissions. 
The EPA examined a number of state programs and spoke with state regulators, including Colorado’s, as it evaluated new methane rules, according to EPA spokesperson Nick Conger.
THE CLEANER GAS ADVANTAGE
    Some Colorado drillers have embraced the opportunity to market what they bill as lower-emitting natural gas to customers eager to tout their environmental credentials.
“Being a Colorado operator has really given us a tremendous advantage relative to the rest of the United States in terms of the environmental quality of our operations,” Brian Cain, vice president of government affairs for Denver-based Extraction Oil and Gas Inc, said in an interview. 
His company, which produced an average of 88,907 barrels of oil equivalent per day last year, is merging with two others to form Civitas Resources Inc and focus on lower-emission drilling in Colorado's Denver-Julesburg Basin.
Jon Goldstein of green group Environmental Defense Fund says the state's production increases since 2014 ""show the fallacy in the oil and gas industry myth about strong, comprehensive methane rules putting industry out of business.""
Others say the new rules have made doing business in the state untenable, particularly for smaller, less well-capitalized producers. Some have started to look elsewhere for future operations, said Trisha Fanning, who leads the Colorado Small Operator Society, representing 60 oil and gas companies. 
“Some operators are no longer able to economically operate within the state,” she said. This does not bode well for small operators nationwide, Fanning added, since “we expect the federal methane rule to possibly take several aspects from Colorado.”
Industry players voiced concern that the EPA may follow Colorado’s lead and apply methane rules to small production or ""marginal"" wells, which environmental groups say are a significant source of methane emissions, according to sources who saw earlier versions of the proposal.

Research by EDF (PA:EDF) this year found there are 565,000 actively producing marginal U.S. well sites, which represent 5.8% of combined oil and gas production but an outsized share of emissions. For example, in the Appalachian Basin, gas wells that account for 0.2% to 0.4% of production account for 11% of federal methane emissions, according to EDF. 
Kathleen Sgamma, president of the Western Energy Alliance, said federal marginal well regulations would affect 20% of current oil and gas production. ""A lot of those wells would have to be shut in,"" she said.

1143,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 25, 2021 12:36AM ET</span>",Emerging-Market Stocks Roar Higher on Signs of Best Earnings Since 2018,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors in emerging-market stocks are finally getting rewarded, as promising signs for company earnings prompt the longest weekly rally since June.
For the first time in three years, developing-nation companies are beating profit forecasts, with average earnings coming in 3.6% above analysts’ projections, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That helped to deliver a third week of gains for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. Traders are now awaiting results from index heavyweights including Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co., China Construction Bank (OTC:CICHF) Corp., and Sberbank of Russia, all scheduled to report this week. 
It’s a key moment for emerging equities, which have struggled with risks ranging from Chinese regulatory crackdowns to the threat of stagflation. The index was little changed on Monday as traders weighed inflation risks and a Covid-19 outbreak in China.
Investors that track the MSCI index are barely breaking even, with the gauge poised for its worst annual performance since 2018. But a strong earnings season could make all the difference. 
For Malcolm Dorson, whose emerging-market stock fund has outperformed 94% of peers over the past three months, the prospects for certain sectors look especially good. 
“Vaccine rates picked up and economies reopened, which should be positive for consumer earnings,” said Dorson, a money manager at Mirae Asset Global Investments in New York. “Emerging-market interest rates picked up and provisions came down, which should be a positive for bank earnings. And commodity prices have surged, which should be positive for energy and materials earnings.”

While weakness from South Korea’s Samsung (KS:005930) was one of the top contributors of negative returns for the MSCI gauge in the third quarter, preliminary results from the technology company have already set the stage for a solid quarter. China Construction Bank’s earnings are expected to show a 10% climb in 2021 after a 1.6% gain in 2020, and consensus forecasts for Russia’s Sberbank revenue rose by about 3% in the past three months, with further upgrades possible. The three companies are among the top 20 holdings for MSCI’s equity gauge. 
Tension still lies in results from Chinese companies, which have been hit especially hard by anxiety over the government’s regulatory tightening and concern over Evergrande’s debt troubles. Stocks from the world’s second-largest economy make up about 31% of the developing-nation benchmark, making their performance critical for broader emerging markets.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) expects the MSCI EM index to reach 1,475 points in the next 12 months, or 11% higher in local currency terms, largely in line with gains forecast for developed markets. The firm is focused on shares that will benefit from “domestic reflation” trends in emerging markets outside of northern Asia.
“We are comforted to see these parts of the equity market with very steady earnings-per-share growth and performance in recent months, despite the macro headwinds from the Chinese property market and U.S. interest rate policy,” Goldman strategist Caesar Maasry said in a note.
Following are key data to look out for this week:

By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) -The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) said on Thursday it would launch in early 2022 a fund to channel global central bank reserves to green projects in the Asia Pacific region.
The fund, called Asian Green Bond Fund, would provide a pipeline for central banks to invest in bonds issued by sovereigns and corporates that comply with strict international green standards, the BIS said in a statement.
""The fund will work closely with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other development financial institutions as well as other issuers,"" the statement said.

The new fund will follow two other green bond funds the BIS already launched over the past two years, underscoring the increasing focus central banks are putting in supporting efforts to fight climate change.
The Bank of Japan, for one, decided in July to start buying green bonds using its foreign reserves, largely as a symbolic move to raise awareness on the need to promote green finance.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean steelmaker  POSCO  (NYSE:PKX) reported its highest-ever quarterly operating profit in the third quarter, as a surge in steel prices was fanned by reduced supply from China. 
POSCO, the world's sixth-largest steelmaker, said on Monday its consolidated operating profit for the July-September quarter was 3.1 trillion won ($2.63 billion), matching its forecast earlier this month. 
It reported 667 billion won in operating profit a year earlier.
Revenue rose 45% to 20.6 trillion won in the third quarter.
On Monday, POSCO revised up its consolidated 2021 revenue target to 74.1 trillion won from 66.4 trillion won previously, as it expected tight steel supply to continue for the rest of the year. 
China, the world's top steel producer, saw September daily crude steel output fall to its lowest since December 2018, due to environmental curbs to reduce smog and carbon emissions as well as a power crunch in many areas.

POSCO shares rose 1.3% after the earnings results were published, while the wider market was down 0.1%.

SANTA FE, N.M. (Reuters) - The dusty desert landscapes of New Mexico have provided the perfect backdrop for Hollywood Westerns, but the state also has served as a filming location for everything from drug-dealing drama ""Breaking Bad"" to sci-fi mystery ""Stranger Things.""
New Mexico's role in the TV and movie business was thrust into the spotlight last week when cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was fatally shot on the set of ""Rust"", a Western that was being filmed at the Bonanza Creek (NYSE:BCEI) Ranch outside Santa Fe. Actor Alec Baldwin fired the prop gun that killed Hutchins after being told it was not loaded https://www.reuters.com/world/us/alec-baldwin-fired-prop-gun-that-killed-crew-member-movie-set-authorities-2021-10-22, according to authorities.
""Rust"" was just one of many projects being filmed around the state, which has become a key hub for Hollywood by offering producers a generous 25% to 35% refundable tax credit. Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA)'s NBCUniversal have established production studios in Albuquerque.
A pool of experienced workers has helped attract Hollywood to the state, filmmakers and TV executives say. About 9,000 people who live in New Mexico work in the industry, earning an average salary of $56,000, according to the New Mexico Film Office.
Bill Horn, a set decorator who has worked on projects for Netflix, Sony Corp (T:6758) and ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) Inc's Paramount Pictures, has witnessed the expansion in recent years.
When he joined the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) union's Local 480 chapter more than a decade ago, it had fewer than 600 members. Now its membership tallies more than 1,500, he said. 
""It's growing a lot,"" said Horn, who is currently working on Fox drama ""The Cleaning Lady"". Local educational options for specialized film work has expanded, he said, and new apprenticeships have been discussed. ""We're pretty desperate for training,"" he said.
Other projects underway in the state include Netflix series ""Trigger Warning"" and ""Dead for a Dollar"" starring Christoph Waltz, Willem Dafoe and Rachel Brosnahan. Forty-eight movies and TV shows were produced in New Mexico in September, state statistics showed.
Spending from film and TV production reached a record $623 million in the state from July 2020 to July 2021, the film office said. Some politicians have complained about offering tax breaks to Hollywood corporations.
CAMERAS KEEP ROLLING
The Bonanza Creek Ranch, where filming on ""Rust"" has been suspended, has been used as a Hollywood set for decades since Jimmy Stewart's ""The Man From Laramie"" in 1955 and ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" in 1968. 
The sprawling site offers five different sets, including a 24-building town with an Old West-style saloon, blacksmith shop, train station and barn, plus free-roaming cattle. 
More recent productions there included last year's Tom Hanks movie ""News of the World.""
A day after the ""Rust"" accident, cameras were rolling to capture nighttime scenes on the ranch for another project. The site also offers film-related tours and rental options for private parties and corporate retreats.
Besides the ranch, sound stages abound in the area. Netflix operates one of the largest after buying Albuquerque Studios, where the AMC network had filmed ""Breaking Bad"" in 2018. Two years later, the streaming giant announced it would expand the facility and promised to spend $1 billion on production in the state. 
Since the ""Rust"" tragedy, media outlets have reported of discontent about working conditions on that set. People who worked on other projects in New Mexico said the sets always adhered to strict safety and security protocols and they were dumbfounded by how the shooting could have occurred.
""There is everything in place to not let this happen,"" said Jesse Casias, who builds sets. ""There is not any reason for this.""
About 200 industry workers, from costume designers to prop makers and location scouts, gathered Saturday night at a candlelight vigil for Hutchins https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/director-gutted-by-death-cinematographer-accidental-shooting-2021-10-23 in Albuquerque. Many talked about the sense of family that develops during the long hours spent on sets.

Actor Jon Hamm, who is filming a movie in nearby Belen, said he and his ""Mad Men"" co-star John Slattery attended the vigil ""to support our community"". Slattery, who is directing the new film, said members of his crew were close friends with Hutchins. 
Others said they felt the loss even if they had no connection directly to Hutchins. ""It's just a sad day for everybody,"" said Horn, the set decorator. ""Hearts are broken.""

LONDON/MILAN (Reuters) -Italy on Sunday ended talks with UniCredit over the sale of Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS) in a major setback to years-long efforts by the Rome government to return the ailing Tuscan bank to private hands.
Failure to bridge a multi-billion euro valuation gap between the parties leaves Italy unable to complete the restructuring of its banking system which it started six years ago.
The announcement confirmed what Reuters had exclusively reported from sources on Saturday.
Rome will now seek an extension of deadlines agreed with European Union authorities to re-privatise MPS and a Treasury official said it did not expect discussions to be difficult.
The Treasury will do its part to recapitalise MPS and plans to go ahead with the measures to improve the balance sheet which it had offered to UniCredit after MPS emerged as the most vulnerable euro zone lender in this summer's health check of the sector.
""The postponement will be accompanied by managerial measures that will strengthen the bank,"" the official said.
""European authorities are fully aware that we have seriously tried to conclude a transaction at market terms within the end of the year, and that this has not been possible, because the proposal we have received is not acceptable,"" he added. 
Italy had started working towards re-privatising MPS not long after rescuing it in 2017 for 5.4 billion euros ($6.3 billion), proceeding as a first step to rid of most of its remaining soured debts. 
Rome saw a merger with a stronger peer as the best way to fix the country's biggest banking woes and had singled out UniCredit after rival heavyweight Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) pushed its market share to antitrust limits with last year's UBI takeover. 
""Despite the effort from both sides ... the negotiations pertaining to the potential acquisition of a defined perimeter of Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena will no longer continue,"" UniCredit and the Treasury said in a joint statement.
The news is likely to rock shares in the two banks on Monday and hit in particular MPS' riskier debt, which has suffered in recent months due to worries MPS' junior bondholders will be called to bear losses under European Union rules on state aid for banks if Italy puts more taxpayer money into MPS. 
Early discussions to cut the state's 64% stake in MPS through a deal with UniCredit started more than a year ago, but the ousting of CEO Jean Pierre Mustier brought them to an abrupt halt.
In agreeing to enter exclusive talks with the Treasury in July, new UniCredit Chief Executive Andrea Orcel demanded the deal targeted only parts of MPS, in addition to being neutral for UniCredit's capital and offering a 10% earnings boost.
The Treasury calculated the assets selected by UniCredit had a market value of between 3.6 billion and 4.8 billion euros given 600 million euros in annual net income, a person with knowledge of the matter said.
That opened a yawning gap with UniCredit's 1.3 billion euro valuation of the same assets, the source added. UniCredit declined to comment.
The Treasury also opposed accounting adjustments UniCredit had factored into its 6.3 billion euro capital request on the basis of its own more conservative risk models, sources have said.
With the parties at odds also over the assets to be sold and the Treasury pushing UniCredit to take on MPS units it did not want, Rome concluded a merger was too costly an alternative for taxpayers. 
MPS has plans to raise 2.5 billion euros in capital if it failed to find a buyer and the Treasury official said the government was ready to do its part on the basis of ""a credible business plan"". 
Italy is likely to overhaul MPS' leadership to deliver the scheme devised as part of the UniCredi deal, which would see the bank's remaining soured loans transferred to state-owned bad loan manager AMCO and its legal risks carved out and guaranteed by the state, this source said.

The European Central Bank (ECB), which is yet to see a standalone plan according to a source close to the matter, has no immediate concern over MPS' capital position.

Evergrande added that its efforts to guarantee construction would shore up market confidence and included several photos of construction workers on different projects, stamped with the time and date.
China's second-largest property developer last month also promised potential buyers it will complete building of their homes and said that work on one of the world's biggest soccer stadiums in the southern city of Guangzhou was proceeding as planned.

Highlighting the stresses on its core business, Evergrande also announced on Friday plans to give future priority to its electric vehicles business over real estate.

Evergrande's woes have reverberated across the $5 trillion Chinese property sector, which accounts for a quarter of the economy by some metrics, with a string of default announcements, rating downgrades and slumping corporate bonds.
Its debt crisis is also being widely watched by global financial markets concerned about broader contagion.

Zurich-based lawyer Andreas Josephsohn confirmed his client was one of three individuals targeted by the proceedings, speaking on condition his client wouldn't be named.
Swiss newspaper NZZ am Sonntag was first to report that the former head of security services was a target of the investigation. 
""As a matter of principle, we do not comment on specific FINMA enforcement matters nor on any speculation related to third parties, former or current employees,"" a Credit Suisse spokesperson said.
FINMA said last Tuesday that it found ""serious organizational shortcomings"" surrounding how the bank managed and controlled the observation of some of its top executives and former employees between 2016 and 2019 in its proceedings against the bank that have now concluded.

It opened an investigation looking at the knowledge and conduct of three unnamed individuals to determine their responsibility in the context of violations of supervisory law FINMA identified at the Swiss bank.
In October 2019, the bank's chief operating officer at the time, Pierre-Olivier Bouee, and the head of global security services resigned over a snooping affair that ultimately also triggered the departure of former Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam.

RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's push for firms to set up regional headquarters in Riyadh is proving successful and is not aimed at dismantling corporate operations elsewhere, a senior Saudi official said.
The world's top oil exporter and largest Arab economy has given foreign firms until the end of 2023 to set up headquarters or risk losing out on government contracts as it competes for foreign capital and talent.
Fahd al-Rasheed, president of the Royal Commission for Riyadh City, told Reuters there has been ""a lot of success"" in attracting multinationals and that details would be announced at Saudi's flagship investment forum FII which starts on Tuesday.
""Companies want to move here. Once they learn about the investment opportunities and the kinds of full offer that we provide them, they immediately decide to (come),"" Rasheed said, speaking on the sidelines of a Saudi climate forum on Saturday.
""It's not about dismantling what companies are doing in other cities in the region,"" he said, also urging multinationals without a regional presence to set up shop.
Saudi Arabia has yet to disclose how many companies have relocated under the drive by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to make the kingdom a regional business hub, putting it in competition with commercial centre the United Arab Emirates.
Several foreign companies, including PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) and Bechtel, agreed earlier this year to set up regional offices in Saudi Arabia rather than overseeing operations remotely from Dubai.
Saudi media companies in Dubai have also started to move staff to Riyadh, sources said last month.
""We're giving incentives per sector, it's not a blanket incentive process,"" Rasheed said, adding that it would be ""super easy"" to lure the investment banking sector.
He cited Prince Mohammed's plan to wean the economy off oil by building new industries and launching megaprojects, and a specific strategy for Riyadh due to be announced soon. 

""Just the Riyadh Sustainability Strategy, it's a $40 billion investment opportunity for the private sector. This needs to be structured by investment banks, so the opportunity is unprecedented across the globe,"" he said.
Saudi Arabia plans in the next decade to double the population and economy of its capital city, currently home to some 7 million people, and has moved to improve quality of life.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Investors are homing in on a flood of earnings reports from Wall Street’s tech and Internet giants, as the high-growth stocks that have led markets higher for years face pressures from regulation, supply-chain snags and rising Treasury yields.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) are all set to report earnings next week. Collectively, those five names account for over 22% of the weighting in the S&P 500, giving their stock moves enormous sway over the broader index.
Overall, companies representing 46% of the S&P 500's market value are due to post quarterly results next week, according to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
Strong earnings reports have helped lift the S&P 500 to fresh record highs, with the benchmark index rising 5.5% so far in October. In September, the index posted its biggest monthly percentage drop since the pandemic began in March 2020.
While investors expect most of the big technology firms to show robust profits, many will also be listening for indications of whether they will be able to sustain that growth. Also in focus will be any forecasts regarding supply bottlenecks, such as the chip shortage that has affected a broad swath of global industries, as well as their views on how sustainable the recent surge in consumer prices will be.
There have already been some signs that tech companies may have a high bar to clear. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) fell sharply after their reports disappointed this week.
Meanwhile, shares of Facebook fell 5% on Friday after  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP), the owner of photo messaging app Snapchat, said privacy changes implemented by Apple on iOS devices hurt its ability to target and measure its digital advertising.
""I would expect the potential for more volatility,"" said James Ragan, director of wealth management research at D.A. Davidson. ""We just might get the possibility for some of these big companies to disappoint a little bit.""
The market's gains this month have been led by sectors seen as particularly sensitive to swings in the economy, including energy and financials, which have gained 11% and 8%, respectively. The S&P 500 technology sector is up 6% month-to-date.
Many tech-focused companies received a boost in the wake of the pandemic, amid a shift in consumer behavior amid economic lockdowns and a move to working from home.
""The question then becomes, can they keep it up?” said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute. ""What do the growth rates look like for large tech?""
A BofA Global Research survey showed earlier this month that fund managers are slightly underweight technology relative to their average positioning of the past 20 years. At the same time, they named “long tech” as the market’s most crowded trade for the fourth straight month.
Supply-chain issues including the semiconductor shortage are sure to be a topic for iPhone maker Apple, while Amazon could give a window into how the holiday shopping season may be hit by logistics snags.
""If ... Apple says, 'Yeah, we would have sold a lot more phones except for the chip shortage,' you think it’s really severe then because they are probably first in line to get chips from everybody,” said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel.
The prospect of U.S. government regulatory intervention, also hangs over these behemoth companies, so investors will be keen for any insight.
This week, the U.S. consumer watchdog said it has demanded information from a number of tech giants on how they gather and use consumer payment data.

A sustained rise in Treasury yields, which move inversely to bond prices, may also pose a longer-term threat to technology and other growth shares. Valuations of those companies rely more on future cash flows, which are discounted more acutely in standard models when yields rise. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note has risen about 35 basis points in the past month to 1.64%.
""It hasn’t been all good news on the earnings front,"" wrote Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. ""So far the good news has won the tug of war against the bad, but we have a long and potentially bumpy road in front of us.""

1158,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 24, 2021 06:37AM ET</span>",Picasso artworks in Las Vegas fetch more than $100 million,"(Reuters) - Eleven Picasso paintings and other works that helped turn Las Vegas into an unlikely destination for art were sold at auction on Saturday for more than $100 million.
The Sotheby's auction was held at the Bellagio hotel in Las Vegas, where the works had been on display for years, and took place two days before the 140th birthday of the Spanish artist on Oct. 25.
Five of the paintings had hung on the walls of the Bellagio's fine dining restaurant, Picasso. The restaurant will continue to display 12 other Picasso works.
The highest price was fetched by the 1938 painting ""Femme au beret rouge-orange"" of Picasso's lover and muse Marie-Therese Walter, which sold for $40.5 million, some $10 million over the high pre-sale estimate.
The large-scale portraits ""Homme et Enfant"" and ""Buste d'homme"" sold for $24.4 million and $9.5 million respectively, while smaller works on ceramic, like ""Le Dejeuner sur l'herbe"" which sold for $2.1 million, went for three or four times their pre-sale estimate.
The buyers' names were not disclosed.
Saturday's sale was part of a bid by casino and hotel group MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) to further diversify its vast collection to include more art from women, people of color and emerging nations as well as from LGBTQ artists and artists with disabilities.
American museums and art galleries have been working to broaden their collections in the wake of the widespread cultural reckoning in 2020 over racism at all levels of U.S. society. 

A 2019 Public Library of Science study of 18 leading U.S. museums found that 85% of the artists on display are white and 87% are men.
The MGM Resorts Fine Arts Collection boasts about 900 works by 200 artists, including modern pieces by Bob Dylan and David Hockney. It was started more than 20 years ago by Steve Wynn, former owner of the Bellagio and former chief executive of Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN).

The court in China's southern island of Hainan, where the group is based, said the vote had been conducted in accordance with the country's bankruptcy laws. 
HNA was placed in bankruptcy administration in February and a working group was created by the Hainan government to address the company's liquidity problems.
HNA will receive strategic investment of 38 billion yuan ($5.88 billion) after its restructuring, which will go to 11 of its entities including its flagship carrier Hainan Airlines.
In the 2010s, HNA used a $50 billion global acquisition spree, mainly fuelled by debt, to build an empire with stakes in businesses from  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) to Hilton Worldwide.

But its spending drew scrutiny from the Chinese government and overseas regulators. As concerns grew over its mounting debts, it sold assets such as airport services company Swissport and electronics distributors Ingram Micro to focus on its airline and tourism businesses.
HNA Group told a meeting of creditors in June that some 67,400 parties were seeking a total of 1.2 trillion yuan, a person who attended the online meeting told Reuters at the time.

The sources said MTS CEO Fabrizio Testa, 53, was set to replace Raffaele Jerusalmi as the CEO of Borsa Italiana.
Both Euronext and Borsa Italiana declined to comment.
The appointment could be announced when Euronext unveils a new business plan in Milan on Nov. 9.
The news was first reported by Corriere della Sera daily on Saturday.
Euronext - which runs stock markets in Amsterdam, Brussels, Dublin, Lisbon, Milan, Oslo and Paris - completed in April its acquisition of the Milan stock exchange in a 4.3 billion euro ($5.00 billion) deal that has turned Italy into the main trading venue for the group and a key revenue engine.
The takeover of Borsa Italiana, previously part of the London Stock Exchange, has been a sensitive political matter in Italy, mostly due to Borsa's ownership of MTS where Rome's 2.7 trillion euro government bonds are traded.
As part of the deal, Italian state investor CDP and the country's biggest bank Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) have joined the ranks of Euronext's core shareholders.

The sources said that Euronext's new business plan would not include significant job cuts at Borsa Italiana, contrary to media reports that had raised alarm in Italy over the summer.

(Reuters) - ""Fortnite"" creator Epic Games on Friday opposed Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s efforts to put on hold orders handed down in an antitrust trial as a potentially lengthy appeals process plays out.
U.S. district Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers (NYSE:ROG) in September struck down https://www.reuters.com/article/apple-epic-games-idTRNIKBN2G61IK some of the iPhone maker's App Store rules, including a prohibition on developers directing their users to other payment options beside Apple's in-app payment system, in a partial win for Epic and other app makers.
Apple has until Dec. 9 to comply with the injunction, but earlier this month the company said it will appeal the ruling and asked Gonzalez Rogers to put her order on hold as the appeals process, which could take more than a year, unfolds.
Epic on Friday argued in a court filing that Apple has not met the legal standard for that pause, which requires Apple show that it will be irreparably harmed by even temporarily complying with the order if the injunction is later reversed on appeal. 
Epic said that Apple's positive comments about the ruling shortly after it landed, and its delay in asking for a pause, showed that it would not be harmed by enacting the orders. 
""The public interest favors denying (Apple's request); an injunction is the only path to effective relief,"" Epic wrote. ""History shows ... that in the absence of an injunction, Apple will not make any changes.""

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Shareholders in Tokyo Kikai Seisakusho Ltd approved a ""poison pill"" measure on Friday aimed at blocking a takeover attempt by its top investor, setting up a court battle that will have sweeping implications for hostile bids in Japan.
Tokyo Kikai, a little known company that is the country's largest maker of newspaper printing presses, said a majority of its shareholders approved a measure that would dilute Asia Development Capital's (ADC) 40% stake.
ADC was excluded https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/court-battle-raises-question-how-far-will-japan-swallow-poison-pills-2021-10-21 from the vote and has already sought an injunction to nullify it. Had investors voted on Friday against the poison pill it would have handed ADC a victory.
About 79% of the votes supported the poison pill, Tokyo Kikai said in a statement. ADC said Tokyo Kikai would have lost if ADC had not been excluded, as the number of votes cast for the poison pill were fewer than those ADC could have cast alone. 
Now, focus will turn to the injunction and the Tokyo District Court ruling expected next week that will be the first to examine an attempt to exclude an investor from a shareholder vote on a poison pill.
A victory for Tokyo Kikai would potentially make it easier for other Japanese companies to use poison pills.

Tokyo Kikai has said ADC hurts its corporate value, while the fund argues that a ruling in Tokyo Kikai's favour would fly in the face of shareholder equality.
The battle highlights both a rise in hostile takeovers in Japan over the past few years and what some experts see as inadequate takeover rules that leave companies, especially small ones, with few defences against hostile bids.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Scientists at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said on Friday that the likely benefits of giving the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to 5 to 11 year olds clearly outweigh the risks of rare cases of heart inflammation.
Earlier on Friday, the vaccine makers said their shot showed 90.7% efficacy against the coronavirus in a clinical trial of children 5 to 11 years old.
The details were in briefing documents published ahead of a meeting of a panel of outside experts scheduled to vote on Tuesday whether to recommend the FDA authorize the shots for the young age group.
If the FDA authorizes the Pfizer/BioNTech immunization for children 5 to 11 years old, it would be the first COVID-19 vaccine for the age group and shots could be available in the United States in early November.
Both the Pfizer/BioNTech and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc vaccines have been linked to rare cases of heart inflammation called myocarditis, especially in young men.
The FDA staff said that, assuming the number of myocarditis cases observed in the younger age group would be similar to that seen in 12 to 15 year olds, the number of COVID-19 related hospitalizations prevented would outnumber myocarditis-related hospitalizations in most scenarios analyzed.
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) suggested in its own briefing documents that the rate of myocarditis in the age group was likely to be lower than observed in vaccinated 12 to 15 year olds, in part because the younger children were given a lower dose. 
The 5 to 11 year olds were given two shots of a 10-microgram dose, a third of what was given to people 12 years and older.
Sixteen children in the trial who had received a placebo got COVID-19, versus three who were vaccinated, Pfizer said in briefing documents submitted to the FDA. 
Because more than twice as many children in the 2,268-participant trial were given the vaccine than placebo, that equates to better than 90% efficacy.
Pfizer's clinical trial in those 5 to 11 years old was not primarily designed to measure efficacy against the virus.
Instead, it compared the amount of neutralizing antibodies induced by the vaccine in the children to the response of older recipients in their adult trial.
Based on those results, Pfizer and BioNTech said last month that their COVID-19 vaccine induced a robust immune response in the children. The FDA staff said the vaccine met the agency's criteria for the immune response it generated in the children.
EXPANDED TRIAL
Pfizer also said on Friday that it had expanded its clinical trial to improve its safety data, more than doubling the number of children enrolled.
According to Pfizer, the adverse event profile in the expanded group did not suggest any new safety concerns from the vaccine. The company had said previously that the safety profile in the age group was generally comparable to 16 to 25 year olds.
The second cohort of children have been observed for a shorter time. All of them had received their second dose and more than 70% were more than two weeks post dose two.
The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine already has U.S. regulatory authorization for people who are at least 12 years old, including full FDA approval in August for those 16 and up.
Around 190 million people in the United States are fully vaccinated, including more than 11 million who are 12 to 17 years old that have received the Pfizer vaccine.

If the FDA authorizes the vaccine for 5 to 11 year olds, a group of advisers to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will meet on Nov. 2-3 to make recommendations to the agency on how the shots should be administered. 
Most states wait for the CDC to sign off on recommendations for vaccines before they begin administering shots.

The CBP said in a statement on Thursday that effective Oct. 21 its officers at all U.S. ports of entry would detain fresh tomatoes produced by the tomato farm Agropecuarios Tom S.A. de C.V., and Horticola S.A de C.V., and their subsidiaries.
CBP issued a withhold release order against Agropecuarios, Horticola and their subsidiaries based on information that reasonably indicates the use of forced labor against its workers. 
Mexico's labor ministry said it has asked the economy ministry to open a communication channel with the companies, in coordination with the National Agricultural Council, and to carry out the corresponding investigations.
""If any breach of labor regulations is identified, a plan is established to guarantee the protection of workers' rights,"" the labor ministry said.
Following the CBP's order, ""the tomato companies have the right to appeal the decision to the U.S. customs authority and present evidence that demonstrates their compliance with labor regulations, in order for the sanction to be lifted,"" the ministry added.
The administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has said addressing forced labor allegations are a priority in its trade relations with Mexico.

Homeland Security Department Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said on Wednesday the administration wanted to make ""clear that products made in whole or in part by forced labor will not be allowed into the United States... We will remove it from American supply chains.""
The International Labor Organization estimates that 25 million workers suffer under conditions of forced labor worldwide, according to the Biden administration.

""The question then becomes, can they keep it up?” said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute. ""What do the growth rates look like for large tech?""
A BofA Global Research survey showed earlier this month that fund managers are slightly underweight technology relative to their average positioning of the past 20 years. At the same time, they named “long tech” as the market’s most crowded trade for the fourth straight month. 
Supply-chain issues including the semiconductor shortage are sure to be a topic for iPhone maker Apple, while Amazon could give a window into how the holiday shopping season may be hit by logistics snags. 
""If ... Apple says, 'Yeah, we would have sold a lot more phones except for the chip shortage,' you think it’s really severe then because they are probably first in line to get chips from everybody,” said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel. 
The prospect of U.S. government regulatory intervention, also hangs over these behemoth companies, so investors will be keen for any insight. 
This week, the U.S. consumer watchdog said it has demanded information from a number of tech giants on how they gather and use consumer payment data.

A sustained rise in Treasury yields, which move inversely to bond prices, may also pose a longer-term threat to technology and other growth shares. Valuations of those companies rely more on future cash flows, which are discounted more acutely in standard models when yields rise. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note has risen about 35 basis points in the past month to 1.64%.
""It hasn’t been all good news on the earnings front,"" wrote Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. ""So far the good news has won the tug of war against the bad, but we have a long and potentially bumpy road in front of us.""

1168,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2021 06:20PM ET</span>","Nasdaq, S&P 500 end lower, dragged down by communications services","By Shreyashi Sanyal, Devik Jain and Sinéad Carew
(Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed lower on Friday as disappointing quarterly reports from  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) and  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) put pressure on the communications and technology sectors and investors turned skittish as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell discussed stimulus tapering. 
The Dow managed to end the day with a record closing high for the first time since Aug. 16, but all three indexes had lost ground in morning trading while Powell was speaking but went on to pare losses in a choppy session. 
Powell said the U.S. central bank was ""on track"" to begin reducing its purchases of assets.
Sean Sun, portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management in Santa Fe, New Mexico said Powell ""didn't appear incrementally more hawkish."" 
But Sun said investors were ""really anxious"" about weaker than expected earnings at Snap, which attributed some weakness in its advertising business to global supply-chain disruptions and labor shortages that caused brands to pull back on their advertising spending.
Snap shares fell more than 25% and its report caused shareholders to exit bigger advertising dependent communications companies such as  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR), which both closed down around 5%. 
As a result the S&P's communications services index was the biggest drag on the benchmark index.
""Consumers want to open their wallets and buy things but they can't if goods are stuck on container ships. And advertisers aren't going to advertise things they can't sell,"" said Sun, noting that growth stocks were down in sympathy.
""Investors are now thinking about risk reward and valuations in growth stocks leave less room for disappointment.""
Intel shares tumbled almost 12% after the computer chip maker missed third-quarter sales expectations, while its chief executive officer pointed to shortages of chips holding back sales of its flagship processors.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 73.94 points, or 0.21%, to 35,677.02, the S&P 500 lost 4.88 points, or 0.11%, to 4,544.9 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 125.50 points, or 0.82%, to 15,090.20.
Still, all three indexes notched a third straight week of gains for the first time since early July, with the S&P adding 1.6% for the week while the Dow climbed 1.1% and the Nasdaq advanced by 1.3%. 
Among the S&P's major sectors on Friday, consumer discretionary was a drag as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) fell and Intel helped push down the high-profile technology index. 
The financial sector was helped, however, by strong gains in  American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP), which rose 5.4% after it beat profit estimates for the fourth straight quarter.
Analysts increased their expectations for S&P 500 earnings growth for the third quarter, forecasting an increase of 34.8% year-on-year, up from an expected 31.9% rise at the beginning of the week, according to data from Refinitiv. 
But some investors were already looking beyond the impressive earnings numbers, according to Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network, an independent broker-dealer in Waltham, Massachusetts.
""The real question around whether we can push higher is going to be whether economy is going to get better, because the earnings are backwards-looking,"" McMillan said.
Data showed U.S. business activity accelerated in October, as COVID-19 infections subsided, though labor and raw material shortages held back manufacturing.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.08-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.30-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 88 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 142 new highs and 137 new lows.
On U.S. exchanges 11.03 billion shares changed hands compared with the 10.38 billion moving average for the last 20 seconds.

1169,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2021 05:46PM ET</span>",SPAC linked to Trump's social media venture surges for second day,"By Medha Singh and Sinéad Carew
(Reuters) - Shares of the blank-check acquisition company that plans to publicly list former U.S. President Donald Trump's new social media venture soared again on Friday, more than doubling in value with trading halted multiple times due to volatility.
Digital World Acquisition, a Miami-based special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), closed up 107% at $94.20 on Nasdaq after earlier hitting a high of $175.
Digital World soared more than 350% on Thursday, a day after the deal was announced, giving it a market capitalization of almost $1.5 billion on news it would merge with Trump's media company to create a social media app called TRUTH Social.
Its recent trading was reminiscent of the meme stock frenzy earlier this year, when an army of retail investors coordinated on online forums to drive shares of  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME), AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings and other stocks.
""This feels like a meme stock. This looks like AMC and GameStop all over again,"" said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. 
Data from brokerage Fidelity showed Digital World was the most traded stock on its platform on Thursday. It was the most discussed stock on trading-focused social media site Stocktwits, a platform commonly seen as a measure of interest from retail investors. Message volumes on Stocktwits related to the SPAC were up more than 9,000%.
Social media giants suspended Trump's accounts after his supporters rioted at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. In a press release announcing the deal, Trump said, ""I'm excited to soon begin sharing my thoughts on TRUTH Social and to fight back against Big Tech.""
With almost 500 million shares changing hands on Thursday, Digital World topped GameStop trading volume of 197 million at the peak of the meme stock frenzy in January.
The stock traded about 130 million shares on Friday, surpassing the free float of 22.8 million shares, based on Refinitiv data.
""There's a tremendous amount of Trump supporters in the country who are going to just clamor to get some exposure to Donald Trump in whatever way they can,"" said Eric Diton, managing director of investment advisory firm The Wealth Alliance.
The shares of at least one other company linked to the Republican former president also saw large gains. Phunware Inc, a software company hired by Trump's 2020 presidential re-election campaign to build a phone app, had its share price rise as much as 1,471% on Friday. It closed up around 471% at $8.74.
Hedge funds that invested in Digital World are set to make five times their investment, regulatory filings showed, while Patrick Orlando, who backs the SPAC, is likely to see a $420 million windfall from the surge in shares.
But not all were buyers. Hedge fund manager Boaz Weinstein said that he sold his firm Saba Capital Management's holdings in Digital World early on Thursday as news emerged that it was merging with Trump's new media venture.

""I knew that for Saba the right thing was to sell our entire stake of unrestricted shares, which we have now done,"" Weinstein said in a statement. ""Many investors are grappling with hard questions about how to incorporate their values into their work. For us, this was not a close call.""
Trump Media and Technology Group said it would receive $293 million in cash that Digital World had in a trust if no shareholder of the acquisition firm chose to cash in their shares.

(Reuters) -Roche Holding AG on Friday won approval from the U.S. health regulator for its eye implant to treat a chronic disorder causing blurred vision, giving patients an alternative to receiving monthly eye injections with existing treatments.
The surgically implantable device Susvimo is intended to treat wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), a disorder caused by the leak of fluid or blood from abnormal blood vessels into an area near the retina called the macula.
The device is designed to continuously deliver a customized version of the Swiss company's drug ranibizumab, branded as Lucentis, which is an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy. 
Anti-VEGF therapies, the current standard of care for wet AMD, work against a protein said to play a key role in the disease. They require patients to receive eye injections as often as monthly to preserve vision.
Susvimo is intended for those who have previously responded to at least two anti-VEGF injections and needs to be taken only twice a year, reducing the treatment burden for patients.
Roche said Susvimo, which includes the implanted device and medicine, would be priced at $9,250 for the first six months. Refills are priced at $8,000 for every six months. 
More than 98% of patients treated with the device were able to go six months before needing a refill in the company's late-stage study last year. 
""This device will be a first-of-its-kind alternative to the current standard of care injections for patients with wet AMD,"" Levi Garraway, Roche's chief medical officer, said in an interview with Reuters before the approval.
The device has an exchange mechanism that automatically refills a new batch of medicine while the residual drug is being removed, Garraway said.

UBS analyst Michael Leuchten estimates that the U.S. market size for AMD is roughly $3.5 billion.
Susvimo's approval comes with a warning that the implant was associated with a three-fold higher rate of eye infection endophthalmitis than monthly injections of Lucentis.

(Reuters) -  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) received reports of more than 4,000 instances of sexual assault on its ride-hailing platform between 2017 and 2019, it said, detailing the data in a safety report it had promised to publish about two years ago.
The company report, issued late on Thursday, showed sexual assault reports on its platform had increased from around 1,100 in 2017 to some 1,800 in 2019. But it said bookings increased at a higher rate during that time, resulting in a 19% drop in the overall incident rate.
Lyft said more than 99% of its journeys had occurred without any safety incident.
""While safety incidents on our platform are incredibly rare, we realize that even one is too many. Behind every report is a real person and real experience, and our goal is to make each Lyft ride as safe as we possibly can,"" Jennifer Brandenburger, head of policy development and research, said in a company blog post.
The company said it has invested in safety features, employed rigorous driver background checks and consulted sexual assault experts.
Lyft had committed to releasing its report at the end of 2019, when its larger rival Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc provided the ride-hailing industry's first detailed safety report.
Uber at the time disclosed it had received some 6,000 reports of sexual assault related to 2.3 billion trips in the United States in 2017 and 2018.

Lyft, which services significantly fewer trips than Uber, did not disclose the total number of rides it completed in its Thursday safety report, but at 0.0002% the incident rate was the same as Uber's.
Unlike Uber, Lyft did not disclose what share of incidents resulted in drivers being harmed. Uber's report showed riders accounted for roughly half of the accused in sexual assault reports.

Reuters reported in March that Sono is exploring a U.S. stock market listing that may value the company at more than $1 billion, citing people close to the matter.
Sono was founded in 2016 by four friends from a small garage in Munich, and is developing the Sion, a fully-electric vehicle that has solar cells integrated into its bodywork. The car has a range of up to 305 kilometers (189.52 miles) and can be charged via solar power or from conventional power outlets.
It intends to begin delivering the cars in the first half of 2023, the company said in its filing.
Sono reported more than 14,000 reservations with advance payments, resulting in total net cash inflows of 38.8 million euros ($45.16 million) from its customers by August-end, up from total net cash inflows of 37.9 million euros at the end of June.

WASHINGTON/OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canada said on Friday that U.S. proposals to create new electric vehicle tax credits for American-built vehicles could harm the North American auto industry and fall foul of trade agreements, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
Separately, a Canadian government source expressed confidence a solution would eventually be reached but said Ottawa might have to launch a challenge through the United States-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade deal.
In the letter dated Oct. 22, Canadian Trade Minister Mary Ng told U.S. lawmakers and the Biden administration that the credits, if approved, ""would have a major adverse impact on the future of EV and automotive production in Canada.""
She said this would raise the risk of severe economic harm and tens of thousands of job losses in one of Canada's largest manufacturing sectors, adding that U.S. companies and workers would not be immune from the fallout. The auto industry in both nations is highly integrated.
Ng said the proposed credits were inconsistent with U.S. obligations under the USMCA and the World Trade Organization.
The Canadian government source insisted Ottawa did not want to mount a USMCA challenge but said ""it is entirely conceivable that that's a tool we would look at"" if need be. The source requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation.
A U.S. House panel in September approved legislation to boost EV credits to up to $12,500 per vehicle, including $4,500 for union-made vehicles produced in the United States and $500 for batteries made in the United States. Starting in 2027, vehicles would need to be assembled in the United States to qualify for all of the $12,500 in tax credits. 
The credits would disproportionately benefit Detroit's Big Three automakers - General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Chrysler parent Stellantis - because they all assemble their American-made vehicles in union-represented plants.
The province of Ontario, home to much of Canada's auto industry, is geographically close to U.S. automakers in Michigan and Ohio. GM, Ford and Stellantis have all announced plans to make electric vehicles at factories in Ontario.
The U.S. arms of foreign automakers have criticized the tax incentive. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc has also been critical, though the tax credit is strongly supported by the United Auto Workers union.
The Canadian government source said Cabinet ministers would step up their lobbying efforts.
""I think we will eventually reach a resolution - it just depends on what timeline. Ideally we would be able to change the legislation before it gets passed,"" said the source.
Ng said Canada is deeply concerned about the ""protectionist elements"" of the proposed tax credits, saying they discriminate against EVs and parts produced in Canada. 

""Canada is also necessary for the United States to achieve its electric vehicle objectives in the future,"" she wrote, adding that Canada is the only country in the Western Hemisphere that has all the critical minerals required to manufacture EV batteries.
She said the U.S. and Canadian automotive industries rely on each other for both finished vehicles and components, with total automotive trade averaging more than $100 billion a year.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) tested a version of the Better Homes and Gardens-branded spray and found Burkholderia pseudomallei, which causes the potentially fatal condition melioidosis. 
The CDC has been investigating four confirmed cases of melioidosis, including two deaths, the CPSC said https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2022/Walmart-Recalls-Better-Homes-and-Gardens-Essential-Oil-Infused-Aromatherapy-Room-Spray-with-Gemstones-Due-to-Rare-and-Dangerous-Bacteria-Two-Deaths-Investigated. 
The health agency did not confirm the source of the infections, but said it had found the spray in the home of a Georgia resident who had earlier fallen ill with melioidosis.
Person-to-person spread of melioidosis is extremely rare and about 12 cases of it are reported in the United States annually, the CDC said. The illness is predominantly found in tropical climates, especially Southeast Asia and northern Australia.
The agency is working with state health departments of Kansas, Minnesota and Texas, where the other cases were found, to determine if those patients had also used similar products.
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) sold the spray, made in India, at about 55 stores and on its website between February and October. 

The U.S. retailer said in an emailed statement that it would continue assisting the agencies in their investigation.
The CDC recommended that buyers wash sheets or linens with detergent and wipe down with disinfectants counters and surfaces that the product might have been sprayed on.

Moreover, because EV companies are investing to increase their production, the demand for lithium is rising. Consequently, lithium prices have recently skyrocketed. Therefore, we think fundamentally sound lithium stocks  Albemarle  Corp (NYSE:ALB),  Livent Corp  (NYSE:LTHM), and Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) could be solid buys now to take advantage of the rising prices. So, let's discuss.Lithium has become increasingly popular, given zero-emission initiatives worldwide and the growing electric vehicle (EV) market. Lithium is a key component used in electric vehicle (EV) batteries. The U.S. is narrowing the gap with China, which dominates the $46 billion lithium-ion battery industry, supported by President Biden’s emphasis on EV growth and significant investments by its automotive industry giants. Consulting firm AlixPartners expects companies to invest $330 billion globally in the EV supply chain over the next five years.
Lithium prices are skyrocketing, driven by heightened demand. The Mineral Intelligence index of lithium carbonate and hydroxide prices has more than doubled over the past year. In addition, the Global X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF (LIT) has gained 108.1% over the past year compared to the 32.4% gains of the broader SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) over the same period.
Hence, we think it could be wise to invest in fundamentally sound lithium stocks Albemarle Corporation (ALB), Livent Corporation (LTHM), and Lithium Americas Corp. (LAC) to take advantage of the rising prices.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 retreated from all-time highs to close lower Friday, as a slump in Snap triggered a sea of red in tech just as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell attempted to quell concerns about the prospect of earlier rate hikes.
The S&P 500 closed down 0.1% at 4,544.98 just shy of its closing record of 4,549.78, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.2%, or 74 points, the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.82%.
""It is time to taper, not to raise rates,"" Powell said. The remarks arrived against the backdrop of growing concerns the Fed may be forced to hike rates sooner rather than later to curb inflation pressures.
The Fed chief continued to suggest the pace of inflation remains transitory, though said the central bank would use its tools to “guide inflation back down to 2% over time.”
“At the same time, we think we can be patient and allow the recovery to take place and allow the labor market to heal,” he added.
Tech, which has played a big role in the recent market melt-up, was under pressure after Snap’s warning on slowing revenue growth following Apple’s privacy-related changes to its mobile operating system, iOS.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced earlier this year that, as part of the iOS 14 update, it will give users the option to block apps from accessing the IDFA, or tracking advertiser on their iPhones.
Snap (NYSE:SNAP) also blamed supply chain headwinds as another factor for the below-consensus 4Q21 guidance.
But both supply issues and events “should ultimately prove transitory as advertisers progressively adopt new tools to more accurately measure events in a post-IDFA world and also as issues such as port congestion and labor shortages revert back to pre-pandemic levels,”  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) CSGN said in a note.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), and Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) were down more than 4%.
Financials, meanwhile, were pushed higher by better-than-expected quarterly results from regional banking stocks and  American Express  .
SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) raised its full year 2021 growth outlook following third-quarter results that beat on both top and bottom lines, sending its share more than 6% higher.
“This is the strongest preliminary guide the company has introduced in many years […],” Wedbush said as it raised its price target on the stock to $800.00 from $775.00.
“Highlights include average loan growth in the mid 20s percentage range, net interest income in the mid 30s percentage range (we had previously assumed 24%), core fee income in the mid 20s percentage range…” it added.
American Express (NYSE:AXP) closed about 5% higher after the credit card reported that third quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street estimates, and guided 2022 earnings per share within the top of its guidance range.
In China, meanwhile, real estate property Evergrande looks set to avert default after reportedly meeting a key debt payment before a default deadline.

Those figures are up from the 411,010,650 vaccine doses the CDC said had gone into arms by Thursday out of 498,702,405 doses delivered. 
The agency said 219,900,525 people had received at least one dose, while 190,179,553 people are fully vaccinated as of 6:00 a.m. ET on Friday. 

The CDC tally includes two-dose vaccines from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and Pfizer/BioNTech, as well as Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s one-shot vaccine.
About 12 million people received a booster dose of either  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) or Moderna's vaccine since Aug. 13, when the United States authorized a third dose of the vaccines for people with compromised immune systems who are likely to have weaker protection from the two-dose regimens.

1186,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2021 03:51PM ET</span>",COVID-19 vaccines not linked to pregnancy loss; mixing vaccines may confer greater protection,"By Nancy Lapid
(Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that have yet to be certified by peer review.
COVID-19 vaccines not linked with pregnancy loss
Two studies in major medical journals add to evidence that COVID-19 vaccines are safe before and during pregnancy. One study, published in The New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday, tracked nearly 18,500 pregnant women in Norway, including about 4,500 who had miscarriages. Researchers found no link between COVID-19 vaccines and risk of first-trimester miscarriage, regardless of whether the vaccines were from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA),  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech, or AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN). Overall, the women with miscarriages were 9% less likely to have been vaccinated, according to the researchers' calculations. In a separate study published on Thursday in The Lancet, researchers tracked 107 women who became pregnant while participating in trials of AstraZeneca's vaccine in the UK, Brazil and South Africa. Seventy-two of the women had received the vaccine while the others got a placebo. AstraZeneca's vaccine had no effect on the odds of safely carrying the pregnancy to term, the researchers reported. ""It is important that pregnant women are vaccinated since they have a higher risk of hospitalizations and COVID-19-complications, and their infants are at higher risk of being born too early,"" the authors of the Norwegian study wrote. ""Also, vaccination during pregnancy is likely to provide protection to the newborn infant against COVID-19 infection in the first months after birth.""
Vaccine combinations with different technologies may be best
Healthcare workers in France who got a first shot of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine and then the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for their second shot showed stronger immune responses than those who had received two shots of the Pfizer vaccine, in a recent study. Combining different technologies is known to boost immune responses to other viruses, and the current study suggests it may be true for the coronavirus as well. Both vaccines in the study deliver instructions that teach cells in the body to make a piece of protein that resembles the spike on the coronavirus and that triggers an immune response. But they do it in very different ways. Both protocols provided ""safe and efficient"" protection, said Vincent Legros of Universite de Lyon in France, coauthor of a report published on Thursday in Nature. But combining the AstraZeneca shot with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine ""conferred even better protection"" than two doses of Pfizer's shot, including against the Delta variant, Legros said. The two technologies combined induced an antibody response of better quality, with more neutralizing antibodies that could block the virus, and more cells that have been ""trained"" by the vaccine to have increased defense potential, he said. Combination vaccination ""is safe and may provide interesting options... for clinicians to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection,"" Legros concluded.
Cognitive problems seen in middle-aged COVID-19 survivors 
A ""substantial proportion"" of middle-aged COVID-19 survivors with no previous dementia had cognitive problems more than half a year after diagnosis, researchers have found. They looked at 740 people who ranged in age from 38 to 59. About half were white, and 63% were female. On tests of thinking skills, 20% had trouble converting short-term memories to long-term memories, 18% had trouble processing information rapidly, and 16% had trouble with skills needed for planning, focusing attention, remembering instructions, and juggling multiple tasks. The average time from diagnosis was 7.6 months. About one-in-four patients had been hospitalized, but most of them were not critically ill. ""We can't exactly say that the cognitive issues were lasting because we can't determine when they began,"" said Dr. Jacqueline Becker of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, who co-led the study published on Friday in JAMA Network Open. ""But we can say that our cohort had higher than anticipated frequency of cognitive impairment"" given that they were relatively young and healthy, Becker said.
Data support use of Pfizer vaccine in children and teens

The Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine showed 90.7% efficacy against the coronavirus in a trial of children ages 5 to 11, the U.S. drugmaker said on Friday in briefing documents submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration but not formally published. The children were given two shots of a 10-microgram dose of the vaccine - a third of the strength given to people 12 and older. The study was not primarily designed to measure efficacy against the virus. Instead, it compared the amount of neutralizing antibodies induced by the vaccine in the children to the response of recipients in their adult trial. Pfizer and BioNTech said the vaccine induced a robust immune response in the children. Outside advisers to the FDA are scheduled to meet on Tuesday to vote on whether to recommend authorization of the vaccine for that age group. A separate study from Israel conducted while the Delta variant was prevalent and published on Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, compared nearly 95,000 12- to -18-year-olds who had received Pfizer's vaccine with an equal number of adolescents who had not been vaccinated. The results show the vaccine ""was highly effective in the first few weeks after vaccination against both documented infection and symptomatic COVID-19 with the Delta variant"" in this age group, the research team reported.

Investing.com — Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stock has fallen as much as 11.8% on Friday to levels not seen since January.
The lower open was in reaction to the company's third-quarter earnings. While it posted relatively stable numbers, the company's revenue and data center sales fell short. It also warned that its gross margin and free cash flow would fall over the next two to three years as it invests in research and development and builds new factories.
Intel shares fell around 8% after hours Thursday and opened up Friday at $50.39 but are now trading around the $49.38 level.
Its earnings also triggered a flood of downgrades and lower price targets, which helped increase the pressure on its shares. 
Analysts at UBS, Morgan Stanley, and Mizuho downgraded the stock.
UBS cut Intel to neutral from buy, with analyst Timothy Arcuri reducing the price target to $58 from $73, saying that its unexpected disclosure around the new long-term financial model pushes out its free cash flow recovery.  
Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh said Intel's capital-intensive foundry shift adds ""uncertainty."" Rakesh downgraded Intel from buy to neutral, lowering the price target to $55 from $70. 
Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore lowered his firm's price target on Intel stock to $55 from $67, downgrading the company to equal weight from overweight. Moore said the quarter was fine, and the product pipeline is strong, but the growth forecast seems challenging.
A string of other analysts lowered price targets on Intel, including Citi, which dropped their PT to $52 from $57, Goldman Sachs lowered Intel's price target to $44 from $51, BMO Capital reduced their price target to $60 from $70, and Truist decreased their price target on Intel shares to $52 from $60."

(Reuters) -Duke Energy Corp is in advanced settlement talks with Elliott Management Corp that could see the U.S. power utility add two directors backed by the activist investment firm to its board, people familiar with the discussions said on Friday.
One of the directors would join after the agreement is formalized, while another would be recruited at a later date, the sources said. Both would be chosen by Duke but have the blessing of Elliott, the sources added.
An agreement that would avert a board challenge could be secured before the end of the year, the sources said. They cautioned however, that no deal is certain and that terms could change. They asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential.
Duke and Elliott declined to comment.
Shares in Charlotte, North Carolina-based Duke briefly spiked to a six-week intraday high on the news, before giving up some of the gains. It was up 0.8% in mid-afternoon trade, giving Duke a market value of around $80 billion.
Elliott earlier this year pressed Duke to conduct a strategic review, suggesting it split into three companies focused on the Carolinas, Florida and the Midwest. The hedge fund said this plan should create $12 billion to $15 billion of near-term value for shareholders.

In response, Duke said there was no strategic logic to breaking the company apart. It argued the move would burden each entity with extra costs that would negatively impact services and threaten Duke's ability to pay its shareholder dividend.
Elliott's push at Duke follows campaigns at other companies in the sector including  Sempra Energy  (NYSE:SRE) and Evergy (NYSE:EVRG) Inc.

Read on.The upbeat corporate earnings season so far is driving bullish trends in the U.S. stock market. The benchmark indices have delivered a stellar performance this week. The S&P 500 notched its seventh straight win on October 21, marking a record close at 4,549.78. The index also hit a 4,551.44 intraday high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose to its all-time high on October 20, although it retreated slightly to close at 35,603.08 in its last trading session.
Solid corporate earnings reports have eased investors’ worries about inflation and a possible decline in Federal Reserve’s bond-buying. “There are no signs of widespread erosions of margins at the moment,” said Jim Reid, head of thematic research at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).

Both iron and steel prices are at historic highs currently. Furthermore, because President Biden plans to close an infrastructure deal by the end of this month, iron and steel companies should benefit from the potential spending it includes. Given this backdrop, we think it could be wise to buy low-priced iron/steel stocks of Usiminas (OTC:USNZY), Champion Iron (CIAFF), and Mechel PAO (MTL), which are rated ‘Strong Buy’ or ‘Buy’ in our POWR Rating system.
Last year, the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected the metal market, causing acute declines in metal prices as demand swooned. The sector was also hampered by supply chain disruptions owing to the mine closures and spending cuts. However, the industry’s rebound has so far been better than expected, with iron ore prices reaching historic highs, driven primarily by government stimulus.
Steel prices are currently at historic highs, with China cutting back production and rising demand with the resumption of construction activities. American Iron and Steel Institute CEO Kevin Dempsey expects 5 million tons of additional steel demand for every $100 billion in new infrastructure investment. In addition, steel's prospects are promising, with the global steel market expected to grow at a 4.1% CAGR to 2.2 billion metric tons by 2026.
Therefore, we think steel stocks,  Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais  S.A. (Usiminas) (USNZY), Champion Iron Limited (CIAFF), and Mechel PAO (MTL), which are currently trading below $5, should be solid buys now, given their fundamental strength.

DETROIT (Reuters) -  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) Chief Executive Ola Kaellenius told Reuters on Friday the automaker hopes to stabilize its supply chain for semiconductors during this quarter, but expects real relief from shortages of chips will not arrive until 2023.
Kaellenius, who is visiting Mercedes operations in the United States, said production of Mercedes vehicles during the fourth quarter will be lower than a year ago, which was an unusually strong quarter as the company began recovering from pandemic shutdowns.
""We cannot have 100 percent certainty"" about supplies of semiconductors, Kaellenius said. COVID-related shutdowns this summer at Malaysian plants that process semiconductors set back the auto industry's efforts to recover production lost earlier in the year.
""We hope to be able to stabilize the situation in the fourth quarter, and take that to the next level in 2022,"" he said. However, he said, major chip producers are saying restrictions in supply could continue into 2023.
""We have to stay flexible,"" Kaellenius said.
Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) is managing supply-chain disruptions on top of planning for a split of the company into a standalone luxury vehicle company, Mercedes-Benz, and a separate commercial truck business. Mercedes is accelerating its shift to an all-electric lineup by 2030.

1194,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2021 02:35PM ET</span>",Explainer-Americans wonder: Which COVID-19 booster is best?,"By Julie Steenhuysen
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Americans this week were handed a big decision when it comes to getting a COVID-19 vaccine booster. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Thursday said individuals who qualify could choose a different vaccine from the one they received for their initial inoculation.
For Americans asking how to choose, the following is what some experts advise:
THE LATEST CDC GUIDELINES ON BOOSTERS
The CDC now recommends that everyone 18 and older who got the Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) vaccine at least two months earlier should receive any one of the authorized COVID-19 boosters.
Those who got either of the messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech or  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) who are 65 or older are eligible for a booster. So are those ages 18-64 who are at risk because of where they work or live or because of health issues that put them at risk of serious illness, such as diabetes.
OPTIONS FOR J&J RECIPIENTS
Although the choices may seem confusing, Dr. Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease expert at the University of California, San Francisco, tried to break it down as simply as possible. 
""Fundamentally, you can get whatever you want for your booster, except for something very particular: Johnson & Johnson should be followed by an mRNA, period.""
The FDA cleared a second J&J shot based on data showing it increased vaccine efficacy against COVID-19 disease to 94%, up from 72% as a single-dose vaccine.
But a U.S.-government study of mixed booster shots found that people who followed a J&J shot with an mRNA booster had significantly higher levels of protective neutralizing antibodies.
MAKE IT EASY
The CDC's recommendations reflect the agency's desire to make it easy to administer the shots. It gives physicians more leeway to advise patients who are at risk for certain side effects to try a different vaccine. 
For example, younger men, particularly those aged 12-29 who have a higher risk of rare heart inflammation side effects linked with mRNA vaccines, now have the option of receiving a J&J booster. 
Likewise, younger women, who are at higher risk of rare but life-threatening blood clots from the J&J vaccine, can now choose an mRNA booster.
It also allows for the possibility that not every pharmacy or doctor's office will carry all three types of boosters.
PFIZER OR MODERNA?
For those who got mRNA vaccines, the evidence suggesting a need for a booster is strongest for older adults who got the Pfizer/BioNTech shots, said Dr. Paul Offit, an infectious disease expert at the University of Pennsylvania and a member of the FDA's vaccine advisory panel.
For younger individuals initially vaccinated with an mRNA vaccine, the decision is more nuanced. Protection from the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine appears to wane more quickly than the Moderna shots, but both still do a good job at preventing hospitalization and death. 
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s initial two-dose regimen was administered three weeks apart, and Moderna's was given with a four-week gap. That longer spacing may be contributing to that difference rather than any inherent strength of the vaccine, experts said. 
Pfizer's shot contains 30 micrograms of vaccine and so does its booster. Moderna's original shots were 100-microgram doses, but the booster is approved as a half dose. It is not yet known whether Moderna's lower-dose booster will have the same durability as the original shots. 

Kathryn Edwards, a vaccine researcher at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said the lower dose may reduce the short-term side effects such as fever and body aches associated with the higher-dose Moderna shot. 
Gandhi recommends that people over 65 who got the Pfizer vaccine spaced three weeks apart should get a third shot of either one. Anyone else should consult with their doctor for a more personalized discussion of risks and benefits.

The S&P 500 Index was down 0.2% on Friday, a day after closing at a record high. Though many investors have worried over how stocks will react when the Fed begins to taper its $120 billion in monthly government bond purchases, the so-far sanguine trading in the options market suggests that market participants are not rushing to buy insurance against volatility over the next few weeks.
The Fed has suggested it will likely announce a taper at the conclusion of its next policy meeting on Nov 3.
""It definitively points towards investors being more comfortable with the Fed,"" said Chris Murphy, equity derivative strategist at Susquehanna International Group.
""The Fed has done a really good job telegraphing all their moves, making everyone comfortable with what's going to happen,"" Murphy said.
That is not to say things couldn't change as investors get more details on the Fed's plans to withdraw monetary support and eventually raise rates.

The VIX briefly spiked to a four-day high of 16.39 on Friday after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that the U.S. central bank is ""on track"" to begin reducing its purchases of assets, and noted that he expects inflation to abate next year as pressures from COVID fade. 
VIX futures expiring in coming months have been slower to pull back relative to the spot VIX, signaling a fair bit of anxiety about how stocks will perform in coming months, analysts said.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) may meet next week with negotiators following rejection of a company contract proposal by Beaumont, Texas, refinery workers, the United Steelworkers union (USW) said on Friday. 
Union workers turned down a proposed six-year contract on Tuesday, leaving a lockout in place while the two sides seek an agreement. Exxon said after the vote it would leave the last offer on the table until Nov. 1. 
Exxon has told the USW it might be willing to meet next week, said USW International union representative Bryan Gross, after passing up a chance for talks this week.
""After notifying the corporation that their proposal had been rejected, USW leadership reached out to Exxon Mobil to meet this week, including nights or weekends, only to have Exxon Mobil decline to meet this week,"" a union Local 13-243 statement said.
An Exxon spokesperson was not immediately available to comment.
The plant's union could face a separate decertification vote next month. A petition seeking to remove the union from the facility is before the National Labor Relations Board. 
""They are dragging things out to see what happens with the decertification petition or get to the Nov. 1 deadline,"" the USW's Gross said. ""They're going to have to realize they can't take their ball and go home.""

Exxon on May 1 locked out 650 hourly workers at the 369,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery and adjoining lubricant oil plant, continuing to operate with managers and temporary employees. Its proposed contract provisions are needed to assure profitability in even low-margin environments, the company has said. 
If a new contract is not reached by Nov 1, Exxon has said it would eliminate worker pay raises for this year, remove a contract signing bonus and some job-protection provisions.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -A global trade union for the services sector on Friday urged European authorities to widen their antitrust investigation of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) to assess if the company engaged in creating knockoff goods and rigging search results on its platform.
The demand by the UNI Global Union was triggered by a Reuters report https://t.co/PiVEqAgjY6 last week based on internal Amazon documents that showed the e-commerce company ran a systematic campaign of copying products and manipulating search results to boost its own private brands such as AmazonBasics in India, a key growth market.
In a letter dated Oct. 22 to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and also copied to EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager, the union body's European arm said authorities there must investigate if Amazon engaged in ""similarly damaging behaviour within the European Union.""
""As further revelations of the scale of Amazon’s operations to undermine that level playing field surface, further action is needed to ensure it is held accountable at every turn,"" the letter, seen by Reuters, said. It cited the Reuters story.
The union body has been a vocal critic of Big Tech's business practices around the world. UNI Europa says it represents about 7 million workers and counts several companies' labour unions among its members, including those representing warehouse employees of Amazon in Spain, Germany, France and Italy.
Amazon did not respond to requests for comment. 
A spokesperson for the European Commission said in a statement it had received the union body's letter to which it would reply in due course. 
""The Commission has already announced ... that it takes issue with Amazon systematically relying on non-public business data of independent sellers who sell on its marketplace, to the benefit of Amazon's own retail business, which directly competes with those third party sellers. The Commission investigation is ongoing,"" it added.
European authorities have been investigating Amazon’s position as both a marketplace for merchants and a rival seller.
Last year, the Commission accuse https://reut.rs/2GNsvR3d the U.S. company of using its size, power and data to gain an unfair advantage over smaller merchants that sell on its online platform. At the time, Amazon said the company represented less than 1% of the global retail market and there were larger retailers in every country it operates in.
The Amazon documents reviewed by Reuters showed how the company's private-brands team in India secretly exploited internal data from its India unit to copy products sold by other companies, then offered them on its platform. The company also promoted sales of its private brands by rigging search results on its India platform, the documents showed.
In response to the report, Amazon said it believes ""these claims are factually incorrect and unsubstantiated."" The company did not elaborate. The company said the way it displays search results doesn't favour private-brand products.

After the Reuters story was published last week, five members of the U.S. House Judiciary committee wrote to Amazon CEO https://reut.rs/3n44LJp Andy Jassy, accusing the company's top executives of either misleading Congress or possibly lying to it about Amazon's business practices. 
U.S. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, a prominent critic of Amazon, called for breaking up the company https://reut.rs/3BBUY3k after the report, while in India, a group representing millions of brick-and-mortar retailers has asked the government to take action against Amazon.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Thursday recommended J&J and Moderna's booster shots and said Americans can choose a different shot from their original inoculation as a booster.
CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) also said booster shots of Moderna's vaccine were available at select stores, but not J&J's. In August, the company stopped offering J&J shots at its pharmacies. 
""We will provide Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine booster shots to eligible individuals who received the Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) vaccine as their primary vaccination,"" a CVS spokesperson said on Friday.
Walmart and Sam's Club pharmacies are ready to administer all three authorized booster shots, the company said. 
Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) Corp did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment on their plans to roll out J&J and Moderna vaccine boosters. 
U.S. health regulators have recommended a second dose of J&J's single-dose COVID-19 vaccine for 18-year olds and above who received the first shot at least 2 months earlier. 
They also recommended a third shot of Moderna's two-dose vaccine six months after the second dose for people aged at least 65 and those at high risk of severe disease and exposure to the virus through their jobs.
The FDA and CDC last month signed off on booster shots of the COVID-19 vaccine from  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) for the same groups as for Moderna.

U.S. pharmacy chains including Walgreens, Rite Aid and CVS began administering booster doses of Pfizer/BioNTech at their stores on Sept. 24.
About 11.6 million people have received additional doses of Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines since Aug. 13, when immunocompromised Americans started receiving additional doses.

(Reuters) -A U.S. appeals court ruled on Friday that state-owned Turkish lender Halkbank can be prosecuted over accusations it helped Iran evade American sanctions.
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said even if the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act shielded the bank, the charge against Halkbank falls under the commercial activity exception.
Robert Cary, an attorney at Williams & Connolly which represents Halkbank, declined to comment. There was no immediate comment from the Turkish foreign ministry. 
""We will be asserting all our legal rights for appealing the Second Circuit's denial order,"" Halkbank said in a statement.
Prosecutors accused Halkbank of converting oil revenue into gold and then cash to benefit Iranian interests and documenting fake food shipments to justify transfers of oil proceeds.
They also said Halkbank helped Iran secretly transfer $20 billion of restricted funds, with at least $1 billion laundered through the U.S. financial system.
Halkbank has pleaded not guilty to bank fraud, money laundering and conspiracy charges over its alleged use of money servicers and front companies in Iran, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates to evade sanctions.
The bank had argued it is immune from prosecution under the federal Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act because it was ""synonymous"" with Turkey, which has immunity under that law.
The court said Halkbank was conflating its purpose - to act as a repository for the Turkish government's Iranian oil and gas proceeds - with its action, which was a scheme to participate in money laundering.
The appeals court said that even if the law ""confers sovereign immunity in criminal cases, the offense conduct with which Halkbank is charged falls within FSIA’s commercial activities exception to sovereign immunity.""
Halkbank had been appealing an Oct. 1 ruling by U.S. District Judge Richard Berman allowing it to be prosecuted.
Berman has overseen several related cases, including the conviction of former Halkbank executive Mehmet Hakan Atilla and a guilty plea by Turkish-Iranian gold trader Reza Zarrab.

Halkbank's case has complicated U.S.-Turkish relations, with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan backing Halkbank's innocence in a 2018 memo to then-U.S. President Donald Trump.
The case was decided by Judges Amalya Kearse, Joseph Bianco and Jose Cabranes, who wrote the opinion. The lower court had scheduled a trial to start for May 3, but the proceeding was stayed during the appeal and a new trial has yet to be scheduled.

With rising demand from major end-markets, such as automotive and construction, the industry should benefit handsomely in the near term. Therefore, we think it could be wise to bet now on fundamentally sound copper-related stocks BHP (BHP), Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO), Glencore (OTC:GLNCY), and Southern Copper (NYSE:SCCO). Read on for an examination of these names.A rapid rebound of copper prices following the pandemic-led economic slowdown has been driven primarily by high demand and a supply crunch. Copper is currently trading near-record highs, just below $10,000 per tonne, as inventories have fallen to 15,225 tonnes, their lowest level since 1974.
This surge in copper prices has fostered heightened investor interest in this space, as is evident in the United States Copper Index Fund’s (CPER) 13% gains over the past month, versus SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust’s (SPY) 3.9% returns.
And the demand for copper is expected to increase in the coming months with the increasing demand for copper by major end markets, such as automotive and construction. President Biden’s $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure plan is also expected to boost the demand for copper. Given this backdrop, we think it could be wise to scoop up the shares of BHP Group (NYSE:BHP), Rio Tinto Group (RIO), Glencore plc (GLNCY), and Southern Copper Corporation (SCCO), which are well-positioned to benefit from the red-hot copper market.

The move brings Italy's top insurer a step closer to controlling its smaller rival after Generali announced a 1.17 billion euro ($1.36 billion) buyout offer on Cattolica in May to further strengthen its domestic market leadership.
The Trieste-based company became Cattolica's single largest shareholder with a 23.7% stake last year, relegating Berkshire Hathaway to second place when excluding the 12.3% held by Cattolica itself.
Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has tendered its 6.93%, the source said, confirming an earlier report by news agency Radiocor.
So far, 24.77% of the shares subject to the offer, or 18.9% of the total capital, have been tendered in the bid, which ends on Oct. 29, Borsa Italiana said in a statement without giving further details.

That implies that Generali would hold at least 42.6% of Cattolica, nearing the 50% plus one share threshold that the company has set as a condition of the offer.

(Reuters) - Shares of  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) plunged on Friday, dragging down other ad-dependent tech firms, after the photo messaging app owner warned of a prolonged hit from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s privacy changes on iOS devices. 
Snap shares were down nearly 20% at $60.8 before the bell, on track to open at a near three-month low. Shares of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) were down between 2% and 4%. 
Apple's privacy updates, which were rolled out in June and July, prevent advertisers from tracking iPhone users without their consent. As a result, advertisers ended up spending much less than expected as the tweaks make it difficult to measure and manage their ad campaigns. 
More than 10 analysts who cover Snap's stock cut their price target by at least $4 and as high as $25, with many warning the impact of Apple's move would linger till next year as Snap rolls out tools of its own to attract advertisers.
""Apple iOS ad changes played out worse than virtually anyone had expected in Snap's Q4 outlook,"" Doug Anmuth, a J.P. Morgan analyst said in a note.
Anmuth expects the near-term impact of the privacy changes to be more acute for Snap than for Facebook, Alphabet or Twitter. The brokerage estimates at least two-thirds of Snap's fourth-quarter revenue will be shaved off as a result.

Santa Monica, California-based Snap, which earns the vast majority of its revenue from selling digital advertising on the app, said the issue was compounded by global supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, and caused brands to pull back on their advertising spending.
""All three of these issues are industry-wide problems, not Snap-specific problems, and we expect to hear them raised consistently throughout the Q3 EPS season,"" Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney said.

The ICE (NYSE:ICE) engines currently made in Munich will be produced in BMW's factories in Austria and the UK in future, production chief Milan Nedeljkovic said, though cars using the engines will still be assembled at the Munich plant.
Still, by 2023 at least half the vehicles produced in Munich would be electrified - either battery electric or plug-in hybrid, the company said.
BMW has set itself a target for at least 50% of new global car sales to be electric by 2030, and CEO Oliver Zipse said at a conference last week the company would be ready with an all-electric offering if any market banned ICEs by then.
The i4 battery-electric car was made on a joint assembly line with ICE and hybrid models such as the BMW 3 Series Sedan and Touring, the company said, a shift that cost 200 million euros ($233 million) of investment in production infrastructure.
A similar mixed assembly line is already under way at the automaker's Dingolfing plant, which produces the BMW iX alongside hybrid and ICE models. 
The new model will be prioritised in decision-making over where to allocate scarce chips, the plant chief Peter Weber said. The company was well-stocked in other raw materials, Nedeljkovic added.
BMW has previously said it expects to produce 70,000 to 90,000 fewer cars than it could have sold this year because of the chip shortage that has plagued automakers worldwide.
It also committed to reducing emissions from transport logistics at the Munich plant, the company's biggest, to zero in the next few years, without giving a specific date.

This will be achieved by making greater use of rail transport and battery-powered trucks to transport vehicles in and around the plant, it said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Business information provider S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Inc on Friday moved a step closer to market-leading duo Bloomberg and Refinitiv after gaining EU antitrust approval for its $44 billion takeover of IHS Markit.
S&P announced the proposed deal last November, continuing sector consolidation as companies sought to create one-stop shops to attract the biggest clients and invest in artificial intelligence and machine learning.
The European Commission approved the deal on condition S&P sells IHS Markit's U.S Oil Pricing Agency Oil Price Information Service (OPIS), PetroChemWire and its coal, metals and mining businesses to resolve overlaps in price assessments for oil, coal, biofuels and petrochemicals.
S&P had already clinched a deal in August to sell these assets to News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) for $1.15 billion.
It also agreed to sell its CUSIP issuance and data licensing business and leveraged loan 100 index family and its leveraged loan market intelligence product Loan Commentary and Data (LCD). 
""With this conditional approval the problematic overlaps in commodity price assessments, and also in the area of loan identifiers and indices, are fully removed,"" European antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.
Reuters exclusively reported on Oct. 12 that S&P would win EU approval for the deal.

S&P Global is a distant third behind Bloomberg and Refinitiv in terms of annual revenue, based on data from market research firm Burton-Taylor.

The company, which gets the bulk of its revenue from retailing, has suffered from a weakening trend of people stockpiling faux meat burgers and sausages at home as they started dining out. 
It also said new orders from a distributor servicing one of the company's large customers did not materialize, while severe weather caused damage to inventory stored at one of its facilities. 
Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND)'s forecast cut comes a few months after the company said its restaurant customers were placing more conservative orders due to uncertainty over to the Delta variant of the coronavirus. 
The red-hot faux meat startup is also facing other challenges including growing competition from Impossible Foods and others, and surging raw material prices. 

Beyond Meat said it now expects third-quarter net revenue of about $106 million, compared with its prior forecast of $120 million to $140 million.

(Reuters) -The ousted chairman of Canada's Rogers (NYSE:ROG) Communications Inc laid out plans to regain control of the board in the latest twist to a feud over who should lead one of Canada's biggest telecoms companies.
The aggressive move late Thursday by Edward Rogers, the only son of late founder Ted Rogers, comes just hours after the company's board voted to remove him as chairman while family members fight among themselves for control of the company.
Rogers will remain a director, the company said. He also chairs the Rogers Control Trust, the family-controlled entity that holds voting control in Rogers Communications.
He proposed the removal of five directors, including John MacDonald who replaced him as chair, with his own candidates, saying that as the chair of the trust he ""believes that it would be in the best interests of RCI to reconstitute the Board"".
Rogers' exit adds another layer of uncertainty for the company after he attempted to replace Chief Executive Officer Joe Natale with the company's now former chief financial officer in late September. The move put him at odds with his sisters and mother, all of whom are fellow board directors and said they supported Natale.
The family spat, rare in the Canadian corporate landscape, sparked a review of Rogers' corporate governance, with experts saying the tussle highlighted the need for strong independent directors.
Rogers also proposed the removal of John Clappison, David Peterson, Bonnie Brooks and Ellis Jacob.
Peterson, Brooks and Jacob were not immediately available for comment.
""The Control Trust Chair looks forward to welcoming Michael Cooper, Jack Cockwell, Jan Innes, Ivan Fecan and John Kerr on the board of RCI,"" Edward Rogers said in a statement.
The company said it was concerned about the Trust's decision. ""The company has not received any documentation or resolution from Mr. Rogers or the Rogers Control Trust with respect to this matter,"" Rogers Communications said in a statement.
""The company is not aware of this mechanism ever having been utilized in respect of a public company in Canada.""
Earlier on Thursday, Natale told analysts that the board meeting to consider third-quarter earnings had ""a very strong, collaborative and thoughtful discussion"" on the future of the business, including the C$20 billion ($16.2 billion) bid for smaller rival Shaw Communications (NYSE:SJR).
That deal would further boost its position in Canada's highly concentrated telecoms market and has attracted scrutiny from multiple government regulators over whether it will decrease competition.
PATRIARCH'S ABSENCE 'CREATES VACUUM'
In documents released alongside its third-quarter earnings results, the board said it had created a committee comprised of three directors, including Melinda Rogers-Hixon, sister of Edward Rogers, to ""establish clear protocols for interactions between the Chair and members of management.""
The board would also undertake a corporate governance review, it said.
The review is essential, said Richard Leblanc, a professor of governance, law and ethics at York University in Toronto, adding that having an independent chair ""from the get-go"" could have avoided the whole situation.
""It's hard when the patriarch isn't there,"" Leblanc said, referring to the late Ted Rogers. ""It creates a vacuum. That's when independent directors really need to step up and earn their pay.""
He noted many of the directors are either family members or longtime friends of the Rogers family. Ted Rogers, who passed away in 2008, founded the company in 1960.
On Tuesday, Edward Rogers said there was ""room for improvement"" in the company's long-term performance following a report he had held talks with potential candidates to replace board members.
Apart from the core telecoms business, Rogers owns a variety of businesses, including the Toronto Blue Jays baseball team, a franchising agreement with the National Hockey League, and a stake in Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment Ltd, which owns the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team and the Toronto Raptors basketball team.

Rogers added 175,000 subscribers who pay a monthly bill as demand rebounded on easing pandemic-led travel restrictions, while wireless service revenue increased 3%.

1212,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2021 12:57PM ET</span>",Analysis-Investors denied their Ever-grande finale...for now,"By Marc Jones and Andrew Galbraith
LONDON/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Investors who have watched China's property sector crisis play out in recent months have just been denied their Evergrande grand finale as the world's most indebted developer dodged a $19 billion default, but they might not have too long to wait.
China Evergrande Group's woes have been snowballing for months. Dwindling resources set against 2 trillion yuan ($305 billion) of liabilities have wiped out 80% of its value this year, and there is still a stream of bills to be paid.
Economists are worried an implosion of the super-sized builder may be impossible to control, toppling other developers and turning an already-defining crisis for the world's second largest economy into a full-blown disaster.
For now, its decision to transfer the $83.5 million needed to pay a month overdue bond coupon has staved off disaster.
""There is a positive out of this, they have not defaulted,"" said Himanshu Porwal, corporate credit analyst at Seaport Global in London.
""But they are not out of the woods. There is a huge ticking time bomb of $37 billion of short-term debt.""
Evergrande still needs to make overdue coupon payments of $195 million, with the next major deadlines to avoid default on Oct. 29 and Nov. 10. It then has a further $340 million of international market bond payments due this year and another $6.1 billion next year, plus tens of billions for local bonds and bank loans.
A number of smaller developers have already been forced to the wall, and with roughly a third of the sector's $232 billion of cross-border bonds needing to be refinanced by the end of next year according to Fitch, borrowing markets need to be prised back open.
That requires confidence, which has been almost completely drained by the Evergrande saga. If the company is to survive it will need to quickly sell its assets, which will be tricky.
Just this week a $2.6 billion stake sale fell through and plans sell its Hong Kong headquarters have also collapsed.
Still, Hayden Briscoe, head of Asia-Pacific fixed income at UBS Asset Management, thinks Evergrande's assets are still worth more than its battered bond prices of 20-27 cents on the dollar reflect.
""The surprise factor here is actually skewed in the opposite direction, upside surprise.""
LEHMAN MOMENT 
Omotunde Lawal, head of emerging-markets corporate debt at asset manager Barings, said the darkest moment was when amid the Evergrande turmoil, another sizable property firm, Fantasia, defaulted out of the blue.
Although the worst of the rout has been mainly confined to Asia's high-yield markets, the risk premiums, or spread, investors were demanding to hold Asian property firms' bonds rocketed to an almost unprecedented 1200 basis points.
""It felt like we were back at a Lehman sort of moment,"" Lawal said, referring to the collapse of the investment bank in 2008. ""So it gives you a sense for just how much capitulation and how much destruction there was in the real estate sector.""

GAME-CHANGER
Founded in Guangzhou in 1996, Evergrande epitomised China's freewheeling era of borrowing and building, now brought to an end by hundreds of new rules designed by Beijing to curb developers' debt frenzy and promote affordable housing.
Analysts say the bigger picture now is what happens to Evergrande's assets and the more than 1,300 real estate projects it has in over 280 cities, and the impact on the wider property sector that accounts for a quarter of China's economy should it default or restructure. 
A leaked 2020 document, written off as a fabrication by Evergrande but taken seriously by analysts, showed liabilities extending to more than 128 banks and more than 121 non-banking institutions. 
Graphic: Evergrande crisis causes major property sector bond sell off https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xmvjolqqopr/Pasted%20image%201634852333461.png 
Evergrande's woes have also reignited the debate about whether some Chinese firms are really too big to fail, especially after Beijing's clampdowns on tech giants like  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent wiped nearly a trillion dollars off its markets earlier this year. 
Amundi's Co-Head of EM Corporate & EM High Yield, Colm d’Rosario said both cases show the government's focus is now on ""common prosperity"" while its acceptance of uninhibited corporate debt accumulation has changed. 
Debt analysts hope any damage from Evergrande might not be too widespread. Although China accounts for just over a quarter of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s $1.4 trillion CEMBI index, a benchmark for emerging market corporate debt buyers, just $6.75 billion of Evergrande's $19 billion of international bond debt is included.
""If you had an assumption of too big to fail in a high-yield sector, You didn't think about it properly,"" said veteran emerging market crisis watcher Jeff Grills, who heads EM fixed income at U.S. fund Aegon (NYSE:AEG) Asset Management.
""China's government has wanted to see excess risk controlled and they also do not want to see a property bubble."" 

He said that while some money managers may recalibrate their risk metrics, the current crisis shouldn't put people off investing in China altogether.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Department of Justice is launching a nationwide initiative to combat discriminatory lending practices, Attorney General Merrick Garland said on Friday.
Garland said the illegal practice of ""redlining,"" or avoiding lending to minority neighborhoods, remained a persistent problem, and the federal government was devoted more resources to identifying it and punishing lenders.
""Today, we are committing ourselves to addressing modern-day redlining by making far more robust use of our fair lending authorities,"" he said. The new initiative will tackle fair lending issues ""on a broader geographic scale than the Justice Department has ever done before,"" he added.
Specifically, Garland said authorities nationwide are partnering with banking and consumer regulators, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which monitors national banks.
The government already has several fair lending probes open, and expects more to come shortly, he said.
Garland also announced the first settlement under the initiative, of $8.85 million, with Tennessee's TrustMark National Bank, which the government said avoided offering home loans in predominantly Black and Hispanic neighborhoods.

Officials said they would focus on modern ways lenders could discriminate against borrowers. Rohit Chopra, director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, singled out ""digital redlining disguised through so-called neutral algorithms.""
""Algorithms can help remove bias, but black box underwriting decisions are not necessarily creating a more level playing field,"" he said at the announcement. ""We will not allow robo-discrimination to proliferate.""

1214,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2021 12:46PM ET</span>","China's troubled property behemoth averts default, signals business shift","By Clare Jim and Andrew Galbraith
HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China Evergrande Group appeared to have averted default with a last-minute bond coupon payment, a source said on Friday, buying it another week to wrestle with a debt crisis looming over the world's second-biggest economy.
The property developer also announced plans to give future priority to its electric vehicles business over real estate. 
Facing a deadline on Saturday to pay interest on a U.S. dollar bond, Evergande sent $83.5 million to a Citibank trustee account on Thursday, the person with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
That brought relief for investors and regulators worried about fallout for global markets and added to reassurances from Chinese officials that creditors would be protected.
Still, the world's most indebted property firm - with more than $300 billion in liabilities - needs to make payments on a string of other bonds, with the next major deadline to avoid default on Oct. 29.
With little known about its ability to pay and property sales tumbling 30% in the last 12 months, there is deep scepticism over Evergrande's capacity to ride out the crisis.
The company, once China's top-selling property developer, did not respond to a request for comment on debt payment.
Citibank declined to comment. 
Evergrande chairman Hui Ka Yan said on Friday the company would aim to make its new electric vehicle venture its primary business instead of property within 10 years.
Property sales will slow to about 200 billion yuan ($31.31 billion) per year by that time, compared to more than 700 billion yuan last year, he was quoted as saying by the state-backed Securities Times.
Evergrande's new vehicle business, founded in 2019, has yet to reveal a production model or sell a single vehicle. Last month, the unit warned it was still seeking new investors and asset sales, and that without either it might struggle to pay salaries and cover other expenses.
'BIT OF A RELIEF'
Evergrande's overall woes have snowballed for months and its dwindling resources set against its vast liabilities have wiped out 80% of its value.
Founded in Guangzhou in 1996, the developer epitomised a freewheeling era of borrowing and building. But that business model has been scuttled by hundreds of new rules designed to curb developers' debt frenzy and promote affordable housing.
It was not clear how cash-strapped Evergrande was able to raise funds to pay the bondholders or whether any had already received the money. Evergrande next needs to find $47.5 million by Oct. 29 and has nearly $338 million in other offshore coupon payments coming up in November and December.
""While obviously a positive, the coupon payment does not address the overall concerns about Evergrande's sustained liquidity through the first maturity in Q2 2022 and beyond,"" said John Han, a partner at law firm Kobre & Kim in Hong Kong.
""This only shows that the company is not yet ready for the house to come down completely through a massive cascade of cross defaults. Time is needed for what is planned next.""
If it fails to make next week's payment, or any other final deadlines in coming weeks, defaults would be triggered on all $19 billion of its bonds in international capital markets. 
That would be the second biggest emerging market corporate default after Venezuela's state-owned oil firm.
Evergrande missed coupon payments totalling nearly $280 million on its dollar bonds on Sept. 23, Sept. 29 and Oct. 11, beginning 30-day grace periods for each.
DISTRESSED LEVELS
Evergrande's dollar bond prices surged on Friday morning after news of the transfer, with its April 2022 and 2023 notes jumping more than 10%, data from Duration Finance showed, though they still traded at deeply distressed levels of less than a quarter of face value.
Those gains evaporated on Friday afternoon in Asia, however, pushing several of the company's other bonds down more than 6%.
Evergrande's shares rose as much as 7.8% before closing up 4.3%, but still finished a shortened week down 8.8%. 
Evergrande's woes have reverberated across the $5 trillion Chinese property sector, which accounts for a quarter of the economy by some metrics, with a string of default announcements, rating downgrades and slumping corporate bonds.
Chinese property companies could now be locked out of offshore debt markets until early next year.
Still, Friday's news helped the Hang Seng mainland properties index rise 3.3%.
In mainland markets, the CSI300 Real Estate index finished up 2.4%, and an index tracking the broader property sector added 2%.
Asked whether it would step in to help its rival ease its liquidity crisis, the chairman of China's third-biggest developer, China Vanke Co Ltd, said developers needed to ensure their own safety first.
""Everyone feels the chill as 'winter' arrives for the sector,"" Chairman Yu Liang told a company forum.
Any prospect of Evergrande's demise raises questions over more than 1,300 real estate projects it has in some 280 cities.
Bank exposure to developers is also extensive. 

A leaked 2020 document, branded a fake by Evergrande but taken seriously by analysts, showed the company's liabilities extended to more than 128 banks and over 121 non-banking institutions.
""Given that we have little clarity on how bank financing is going for stalled real estate projects, but we know that project pre-sales are down a lot, the onshore business is unlikely to be supplying cash to Evergrande near-term,"" said Quiddity's Lundy.

The new price still carries an upside potential of around 28% from the stock’s current level of $31.34.
Analyst Paul Lajuez said the target was being lowered only to reflect more conservative estimates, but the risk-reward the stock still holds couldn’t be ignored.
While supply chain concerns are warranted, sales downside is limited, and margins should remain strong, Lajuez said.
The analyst said the market already discounts an EPS number closer to Citi’s.

1216,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2021 12:36PM ET</span>","In corporate crackdown, U.S. SEC takes aim at executive pay","By Chris Prentice
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The new Democratic leadership of the U.S. securities watchdog has a message for Corporate America's highly paid executives: if your company screws up, your pay is at risk.
    Clawing back compensation is shaping up to be a key part of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) agenda as it cracks down on corporate misconduct, raising the stakes for thousands of executives who could potentially lose millions of dollars in bonuses and stock sale profits.
""Clawbacks can be an important factor in accountability,"" said John Coffee, a professor at Columbia University Law School. ""If properly implemented, they can be much more effective than they currently are.”
    Last week, the SEC said it would revive a rule left unfinished from the 2007-09 financial crisis that would require U.S.-listed companies to implement a plan to recoup executive compensation in the event they have to correct financial statements due to compliance failures.
    But in behind-the-scenes enforcement talks with companies, the SEC has already dusted off a narrower clawback power created in 2002 following the Enron and WorldCom accounting scandals, according to four lawyers familiar with the private discussions.
    That rule allows the SEC to force a public company's chief executive or chief financial officer to return bonuses or other incentive-based pay in the event the company restates its results due to misconduct. 
In 2016, a federal court settled a lingering question over whether the SEC could recoup pay from executives who were not directly accused of wrongdoing. It said the agency could, because the executives should not profit from the proceeds of foul play. 
    In nearly two decades, however, the SEC has used the 2002 clawback power sparingly overall, despite potentially hundreds of opportunities to so, and just 15 times to penalize executives who were not directly accused of misconduct, according to a new analysis by law firm Covington and Burling LLP.
Gerald Hodgkins, a partner in the firm's Washington office and a former associate director in the SEC's enforcement division, said it was unclear why the SEC had pursued so few such actions, but that ""perceived unfairness"" was one potential reason. 
The SEC appears to be shifting its stance on the issue. 
Its enforcement staff have recently proposed using the clawback power in private settlement negotiations over cases involving financial restatements where the CEO and CFO are not accused of misconduct, said four attorneys involved in the separate cases, in what appears to be a change in strategy.
Among them is Joseph Dever, a lawyer with Cozen O'Connor LLP and a former SEC enforcement attorney.
""Staff seems to be raising this remedy far more frequently now than in the past,” he said.
On one occasion, staff proposed clawing back an executive's compensation after the issue with the company had been resolved, said one of the three other attorneys, adding that was highly unusual.
The three attorneys asked to remain anonymous to discuss private matters. 
Reuters could not ascertain how frequently overall the SEC was proposing clawbacks in settlement discussions.
But Allison Lee, a Democratic Commissioner who was a senior enforcement attorney with the agency from 2015 to 2018, told Reuters in an interview that the 2002 power has been ""underutilized.""
    While Lee said she could not comment on enforcement probes, she said of the power: ""I'd like to see us ensure we are vindicating the recourse it provides for shareholders."" 
ACCOUNTABILITY 
Cracking down on corporations is a priority for Democrats who say the SEC has long been too soft on big business. 
When properly enforced, clawbacks can improve accountability in an era where writing checks to appease regulators is seen by companies as a cost of doing business, say advocates. 
Over the past decade, investors have pushed for corporate clawback policies for a range of missteps, but companies have struggled to get the cash back once it is out the door, said Coffee.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS), for example, failed to recoup compensation from former Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn over the Wall Street bank's involvement in Malaysia's 1MDB sovereign fund corruption scandal. He gave the money to charity instead. A representative for Cohn declined to comment for this story.
That is why tougher regulatory clawback tools are important, say experts. 
Last week, the SEC reopened to public comment an additional clawback rule it first proposed in 2015 but never finalized. The comment period closes on Nov. 22.
Required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, that rule would go further than the 2002 power, capturing a broader range of corporate roles and situations in which incentive-based compensation could be recouped. 

While it puts the responsibility of implementing and enforcing the clawbacks on companies and exchanges, Lee said it could be a ""powerful"" accountability tool. 
""It's based on the common-sense notion that you shouldn’t get to keep incentive-based comp that wasn’t actually earned,"" she said in a follow-up statement. ""I’m glad we’re finally moving toward implementing that mandate.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Washington, D.C.-area subway system said on Friday it will continue sharply reduced subway service through at least Oct. 31 as it works to finalize plans to return most of its railcars to service after an Oct. 12 derailment.
The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) on Sunday was ordered to indefinitely remove about 60% of the subway system's railcars following inspections after the derailment.
The subway system, known as the Metro and which serves the U.S. capital and parts of Maryland and Virginia, has urged commuters to take buses or use other transit modes.
""We are working to restore full service on the system as quickly as possible but will only do so when it is safe to do so,"" said WMATA Chief Executive Paul Wiedefeld in a media briefing.
Average Metrorail weekday ridership has fallen about 25% this week to 157,000, WMATA said, down from an average of 213,000 last week excluding Monday's U.S. government holiday.
The Washington Metrorail Safety Commission (WMSC) said Sunday it had ordered WMATA's 748 7000-Series trains removed from service after the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) ""identified safety concerns related to the spacing of wheels on 7000-Series railcar axles.""
The NTSB on Monday said WMATA had been aware of wheel assembly issues since 2017 like the one that was involved in the recent derailment just outside Washington in Arlington, Virginia.
The NTSB said preliminary data showed that since 2017, there had been 31 WMATA wheel assembly failures, including 18 this year, and 21 failures were uncovered during recent inspections.
The Oct. 12 derailment did not injure any of the 187 passengers onboard, but NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy said the incident could have been ""catastrophic.""

Let’s discuss.All the three major stock market indexes are on track to close the week higher. A solid start to the third-quarter earnings season has helped the indexes rally lately. According to FactSet, the third-quarter net profit margin for S&P 500 member companies is 12.3% higher than the 10.9% five-year average net profit margin.
However, an increase in the Consumer Price Index, continued supply chain disruptions, and the possibility of the Fed tightening its monetary policy in the near term could keep the market volatile in the near term. Therefore, we think it would be wise to scoop up the shares of fundamentally strong large-cap stocks because large-cap stocks are less sensitive to market volatility than mid-cap or small-cap stocks.

One potential concern is that inflation has remained stubbornly elevated and begun to materially impact some companies’ results.

(Reuters) -European stocks rose on Friday on a surge in technology stocks, strong earnings from France's L'Oreal and a broad boost to sentiment provided by a surprise interest payment from debt-ridden China Evergrande Group. 
The STOXX 600 added 0.5% to close at over six-week highs and logged its third consecutive week of gains, up 0.5%. 
News that the Chinese property developer had made a bond payment to avert a default lifted the mood globally. Worries about contagion from a potential default have rattled markets recently.
France's blue-chip CAC 40 rose 0.7% and outperformed its European peers, riding on a 5.1% surge in L'Oreal shares following the cosmetics company's strong results.
Shares in Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML and German software firm SAP rose 3.2% and 1.2% respectively, after stumbling earlier this week following their results. The tech sector rose 1.5%. 
Investors appeared to look past a survey that showed growth in euro zone business activity slowed in October as firms face soaring costs due to supply-chain constraints, while the bloc's dominant service industry struggled amid ongoing COVID-19 concerns.
Automaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Continental both flagged chip-shortage hitting output and margins.
""We've lots of earnings beats on lowered expectations, and then you're getting comments from CEOs suggesting supply chains are damaged - but certain firms have said that they're on top of it,"" said Keith Temperton, sales trader at Forte Securities. ""That's hopeful for the markets.""
A bunch of upbeat earnings lifted Wall Street's S&P 500 to a record high, while its European counterpart is less than 1% shy of its August peak.
Europe Inc is expected to see a 47.6% rise in third-quarter profit to 96.1 billion euros ($112 billion), latest data from Refinitiv I/B/E/S showed, a slight improvement from last week's 46.7% growth forecast. 
Euro zone inflation expectations hit their highest levels in years, putting additional pressure on the European Central Bank over its insistence on maintaining crisis-era stimulus. The central bank is set to meet next week. [GVD/EUR]
""That inflation is transitory does not necessarily mean that it is short-lived. An adjustment of supply to the changes in patterns of demand caused by the pandemic may be slow, and keep upward pressure on prices for longer,"" strategists at Citi wrote in a note. 

Swedish mining firm Boliden dipped 6.8% as its third-quarter operating profit fell below market forecasts.
Remy Cointreau rose 1.8% after it said it was growing increasingly confident about its full year outlook after second-quarter sales beat expectations.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) lacks effective oversight controls to ensure that American Airlines’ corrective actions for maintenance issues address root causes, a government watchdog report said on Friday.
The Transportation Department Inspector General's office said in 171 of 185 of cases sampled, FAA inspectors accepted root cause analyses by American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) ""that did not identify the true root cause of the problem"" and the agency ""closed compliance actions before the air carrier implemented its corrective actions.""
The FAA said it ""agrees with many of the recommendations in the report and is taking steps to address them.""
American Airlines said it welcomed the report. ""We plan to work with the FAA to ensure we take positive action and continuously refine and improve our safety controls,"" an airline spokeswoman said.
The report found that in one instance American ""flew an aircraft with an inoperable emergency evacuation slide for 877 days before reporting the non-compliance to FAA.""
American said it reported the slide issue as soon as it was discovered as part of its maintenance program that requires intentional slide deployments. It added it ""then worked with the vendor to develop an audit system.""
The report said that if American Airlines had categorized the slide as a more serious issue it would have prompted different corrective actions.
The FAA did not evaluate whether American’s ""risk ratings adequately captured the level of risk for these findings,"" the report found.
The report said ""ineffective root cause analysis and the associated corrective actions may have contributed to a number of repetitive non-compliances"" issues at American.
Without verifying corrective actions, ""FAA cannot reasonably ensure that American Airlines is sufficiently identifying root causes and mitigating future maintenance non-compliances,"" the report added.

The FAA, it added, ""could not verify whether the 73% of findings that American Airlines rated as 'low' or 'very low' were indeed low risk.""
It also said FAA inspectors were not adequately trained on root cause analysis or how to review airline risk assessments.

1227,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2021 11:51AM ET</span>",Exclusive: SoftBank in talks to sell French robotics business to Germany's United Robotics -sources,"By Sam Nussey
TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp is in talks to sell the Paris-based robotics business behind its Pepper android to Germany's United Robotics Group, according to sources and documents reviewed by Reuters, scaling back a business it once touted as a major growth driver.
The talks are ongoing and plans could change, said two sources familiar with the matter, who declined to be named as they are not permitted to speak to the media. It is not clear whether SoftBank will retain a stake in the business, nor how much the deal would be worth.
United Robotics Group, which is backed by German industrial robot maker Hahn, became the European master distributor for SoftBank's struggling Pepper and Nao robots in October.
United Robotics declined to comment. SoftBank has said it remains committed to the Pepper business. 
Reuters reported in June https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-softbank-shrinks-robotics-business-stops-pepper-production-sources-2021-06-28 that SoftBank had stopped production of Pepper and slashed jobs at its robotics business globally. Roughly half of 330 staff positions were cut in France, where operations date back to the 2012 acquisition of start-up Aldebaran, which custom-designed Pepper for SoftBank. 
Additional staff have quit because of low morale, forcing SoftBank to advertise positions to fill core functions, according to the sources and a review of job postings.
United Robotics has offices in Germany and Austria, according to its website. Recently departed SoftBank staff in areas such as sales have been hired by the company, according to the sources. 
SoftBank, which is riven by a culture divide between its European workforce and Japanese managers, has a dwindling stock of aging Pepper units https://www.reuters.com/article/us-softbank-group-pepper-focus-idCAKBN2ER0JK and components approaching obsolescence, Reuters reported previously.
In addition to selling Pepper and Nao, a small humanoid robot, United Robotics also markets robots like Sawyer, an industrial robot that can operate alongside humans.
The restructuring comes as SoftBank focuses on selling third party hardware following the commercial failure of Pepper.
The conglomerate has created a parallel sales operation in Britain, reducing its reliance on the Paris-based business. 

SoftBank engineers in France have been working on a secret project to design a serving robot called Plato, according to the sources and documents reviewed by Reuters. 
However, managers in Japan have put off ordering the robot, the sources said. At the same time, SoftBank has struck deals to sell similar robots from outside firms, diminishing the commercial viability of its own product.

1228,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2021 11:48AM ET</span>",No 'Squid Game': South Korea's real-life debt trap,"By Cynthia Kim
SEOUL (Reuters) - Many small business owners in South Korea recognise themselves in the cash-strapped characters of the wildly popular Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) drama 'Squid Game', who vie desperately for a chance to win $38 million, exposing a debt trap that is all too familiar.
Nearing retirement at 58, Yu Hee-sook paid off her debts long ago, but still gets calls from collection agencies threatening to seize her bank accounts, as the loans got securitised and sold to investors without her knowledge.
""In Korea, it's like the end of the world once you become a credit delinquent,"" said Yu, who got by on small jobs, such as writing for movie magazines, during the 13 years it took to pay off the debts she incurred over a movie that flopped in 2002.
""All I wanted was chances to repay debt, but banks don't let you make money,"" added Yu, who feels trapped in an unforgiving life-long ordeal, just like the 456 game show contestants of the 'Squid Game'.
While foreigners may associate South Korea with the boyband BTS and sleek Samsung (KS:005930) smartphones, the drama points to a dark flipside of rising personal borrowing, the highest suicide rate among advanced nations, and the rarity of getting free of debt. 
Record household borrowing is fuelling private investment and housing growth, but unforgiving social mores about debt often blur the line between personal and business loans, burdening those who run small businesses. 
Personal bankruptcies soared to a five-year high of 50,379 last year, court filings show.
The proportion of those falling behind on more than one type of personal debt payment has risen steadily to reach 55.47% by June from 48% in 2017, figures from the Korea Credit Information Services show. 
""If Donald Trump was a Korean, he probably couldn't have become the president, having been bankrupted many times,"" said a lawyer in Seoul, who specialises in personal bankruptcy.
""In the United States, corporate debt is more separated from personal debt.""
An inadequate social safety net for small entrepreneurs and the lack of a rehabilitation programme for failures spell risks that could drive some South Koreans desperate, and banks often ignore a five-year limit to destroy insolvency records.
""Due to traditional practices in the banking industry, business owners in South Korea face high likelihood of taking the debt burden from the business they run,"" said bankruptcy judge Ahn Byung-wook.
Banks often demand that business owners stand as joint surety for the firm's borrowing, a practice the government banned for public financial institutions in 2018, although three owners told Reuters some providers persist. 
Applicants for business loans who have poor credit ratings or a history of default need guarantees from state-run financial institutions in South Korea.
""Culturally, failed entrepreneurs are socially stigmatised, so starting over is hard, as people don't trust them,"" added Ahn, who has spent four years at the Seoul Bankruptcy Court.
""On top of that, those who file personal bankruptcy face a long list of restrictions on employment.""
The numbers of South Korea's self-employed rank among the world’s highest, forming a quarter of the job market, making it vulnerable to downturns. A central bank study in 2017 showed that just 38% of such businesses survive three years.
Still, as economic prospects dwindle, with South Koreans chasing fewer good jobs amid surging home prices, many are betting that speculation is the only route to wealth, and have taken on more debt than ever to buy stocks and other assets. 
Household borrowing is roughly equivalent to GDP at a record 1,806 trillion won ($1.54 trillion) in the June quarter.
""The government encourages startups but they don't take care of the failed businesses,"" said Ryu Kwang-han, a 40-year old entrepreneur who exited the debtor rehabilitation programme in 2019 but still struggles to get loans.

""How is this different from 'Squid Game' if there's no second chances?"" 
The global sensation has been watched by 142 million households since its Sept. 17 debut, the world's largest streaming service has said, helping Netflix to add 4.38 million subscribers.

Investing.com — Shares of  Ocular Therapeutix Inc  (NASDAQ:OCUL) tumbled over 34% Friday after the failure of its Phase 2 clinical trial of OTX-CSI to treat dry eye disease.
Ocular Therapeutix shares are trading around the $7.09 mark, its lowest level in over a year. 
The Massachusetts-based company said the trial did not meet its primary endpoint of increased tear production at 12 weeks as measured by the Schirmer's Test. 
The goal of the Phase 2 U.S.-based clinical trial of OTX-CSI was to assess the safety, tolerability, durability, and efficacy of two different formulations of OTX-CSI by measuring signs and symptoms of dry eye disease in 140 subjects treated in both eyes over 16 weeks.
""While we are disappointed by these results, demonstrating clinical benefit in patients with dry eye disease remains a significant unmet need and we will continue to review the data for additional information that may inform future development of this program,"" said Antony Mattessich, president and CEO of Ocular Therapeutix.
""We remain confident in the potential of our hydrogel-based formulation technology and its ability to deliver innovative ophthalmology therapies,"" he added. 
H.C. Wainwright analyst Yi Chen recently increased Ocular Therapeutix's price target to $18 from $17, reiterating a buy rating after the FDA approved Dextenza to treat ocular itching."

(Reuters) -American Express Co reported a higher profit that topped Wall Street estimates for the fourth straight quarter, as higher usage of its cards, particularly by millennial and Gen Z customers, fueled a strong recovery in overall spending.
After months of stagnation, credit-card issuers like AmEx are starting to see a turnaround in spending with resumption of social activities made possible by a rise in the number of fully vaccinated people. 
Three out of every four new Gold and Platinum consumer cards in the U.S. came from these age cohorts, Chief Executive Officer Stephen Squeri said on Friday.
AmEx's Platinum card comes with a spate of travel rewards including access to airport lounges and other benefits at hotels and resorts globally.
""It's that younger generation that is just more comfortable, continuing to live their lives as they were pre-pandemic than the older baby boomer generation, which continues to react much more cautiously,"" Chief Financial Officer Jeff Campbell told Reuters. 
Millennials and Gen Z users spent 48% more on their cards than they did last year, and 38% more than in the third quarter of 2019, AmEx disclosed. Its shares were up 4% at a record-high.
ABOVE PRE-PANDEMIC LEVELS
Spending at restaurants through AmEx cards grew above pre-pandemic levels, and is now the largest category in the travel and entertainment business, the company said.
""Our view remains that across all customers across all geographies, spending on travel and entertainment is going to come back to where it was pre-pandemic,"" Campbell said. 

Net income came in at $1.83 billion, or $2.27 per share, for the third quarter ended Sept. 30, up 70% from last year and beating analysts' estimates of $1.80 per share, according to Refinitiv data.
AmEx also released $393 million of reserves in the quarter. Excluding interest expense, the company's total revenue rose 25%.

(Reuters) -VF Corp missed Wall Street estimates for quarterly results on Friday, as the Vans owner grappled with a resurgence of COVID-19 infections in Vietnam and China and disruptions to its supply chain that led to product delays.
The Delta variant-driven spike in coronavirus cases has shut factories in Vietnam, a key manufacturing hub for several brands including VF (NYSE:VFC),  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) and Adidas AG (DE:ADSGN), forcing them to halt production or operate with drastically fewer workers.
""Virtually all of our brands are experiencing delayed collections, styles and, in some cases, insufficient size assortment,"" VF's Chief Financial Officer Matt Puckett said on an earnings call.
The Denver-based company's shares were down 3.3% at $71.62 on Friday, as the company said demand for its sneakers and clothing in China also softened due to rising COVID-19 cases.
Revenue from Greater China in the quarter grew only 9%, compared with a 16% rise last year, mainly due to lower demand for the Vans brand.
Results at VF's largest and highest-margin brand Vans were ""underwhelming"" and ""particularly disappointing since the brand should have had a strong back-to-school season"", Wedbush analyst Tom Nikic said.
Adding to the company's woes, soaring freight costs, labor shortages and higher prices for raw materials such as cotton and oil have also been pinching the margins of clothing labels.
Last month, Nike flagged product delays for the crucial holiday season due to the supply chain crunch, while  Crocs  (NASDAQ:CROX) Inc said on Thursday it plans to shift some of its production from Vietnam to China, Indonesia and Bosnia.

Still, VF, which owns Timberland and The North Face brands, maintained its revenue and profit outlook for fiscal 2022, saying the factory closures were chiefly concentrated in southern Vietnam, which accounts for about 10% of its sourcing.
The company reported an adjusted profit of $1.11 per share and revenue of $3.20 billion, both missing Refinitiv IBES estimates.

Investing.com — Shares of  Beyond Meat Inc  (NASDAQ:BYND) took a tumble on Friday after the plant-based food company lowered its third-quarter net revenue outlook.
Beyond shares fell over 13% at the open. They are currently sitting at around the $96.10 level, down over 11.5%.
Based on preliminary results, Beyond said it now expects third-quarter net revenue of approximately $106 million compared to prior guidance of $120 million to $140 million. Wall Street analysts were anticipating its revenue to be $133.1 million.
""Although the company's previous third-quarter guidance anticipated a sequential decline in net revenues, the deceleration was larger than anticipated. Multiple factors contributed to the shortfall during the quarter,"" stated Beyond.
The company said that it believes demand was affected by continuing macro and micro-economic factors, such as the effects of the Covid-19 Delta variant.
Other factors include a decrease in retail orders that persisted longer than expected from a Canadian distributor, expected incremental orders that did not materialize from a change in a distributor servicing one of the company's large customers, and labor shortages.
Beyond said it also experienced difficulties in operations that resulted in unfulfilled orders, with severe weather as a fundamental driver.
However, the various challenges were partially offset by accelerated orders from an international customer during Q3.

Investing.com – Phunware stock (NASDAQ:PHUN) was defying all conventions Friday as it rose 1,468% on speculation that the company is being tapped to build former U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposed social media platform.
Trading in the stock was halted later. It jumped 1,000% after it resumed.
The stock touched a high of $24.04 during the session. It had closed at $1.53 Thursday.
More than 197 million shares of the company changed hands on Nasdaq in less than an hour of trading.
The speculation has its roots in a USA Today article from May 2020 highlighting a partnership between Phunware and the Trump campaign of 2020. The piece was circulated by traders today.
According to that USA Today article, Phunware announced a partnership with American Made Media Consultants for ""the development, launch and ongoing management of the Trump-Pence 2020 Reelection Campaign’s mobile application portfolio for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iOS and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android smartphones.""
Phunware operates a platform for mobile that provides companies products, solutions and data and services necessary to engage and make money off of its mobile application consumer base.
Phunware is the second stock to have climbed stratospheric proportions this week because of an association with Trump. The stock of a special purpose acquisition company called  Digital World Acquisition  (NASDAQ:DWAC) is skyrocketing for the second-straight day after it announced it would merge with a company that is going to manage Trump's proposed social media site.
The deal aims to set up an alternative media platform as Trump claims the current offerings are against him. Trump has been off social media since Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and his then favorite, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), banned him after the January 6 Capitol riot. Since then, Trump has been exploring ways to restore his once-sizable social media presence.
Shares of DWAC have climbed 1,630% since it closed at $9.96 Wednesday. The stock touched a high of $172.36 today, before giving up some of the gains and trading 151% up at $114.

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) is more than halfway through shipping newly-assembled pickups that it had parked due to a shortage of semiconductor chips, a top executive at the No. 1 U.S. automaker said on Friday.
""We've made great progress,"" Steve Carlisle, GM's North American chief executive said at the Reuters Events Automotive Summit. ""We're a bit better than halfway through that at the moment and our goal would be to clear out our '21 model years by the end of the year. We'll have a bit of a tail of '22 model years into the new year but not for too long.""
The global chip shortage has forced automakers like GM to idle production or in some cases mostly build vehicles and then park them until the necessary chips can be installed, allowing those vehicles to be then shipped to dealers.
Last month, GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson cautioned that GM's third-quarter wholesale deliveries could be down by 200,000 vehicles because of chip shortages. He did not break out what share of that was trucks.
To expedite transportation of newly-built vehicles to dealers, Carlisle said GM bought a number of car haulers to deliver them from factories or distribution centers. The Detroit automaker has also allowed dealers to pick the vehicles up themselves in some locations.

Carlisle said new vehicle inventories have shrunk to below 20 days in the United States due to the supply chain disruptions, but the company wants to get that back up to 30 to 45 days with some getting to 60 days depending on the product line.
GM sees sales of gasoline-powered vehicles being steady over the decade and real growth opportunity in electric vehicles and software, with one not undermining the other, he said.

1239,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2021 10:41AM ET</span>","Italy, UniCredit in deadlock over MPS as deadline nears","By Valentina Za, Pamela Barbaglia and Giuseppe Fonte
MILAN (Reuters) - UniCredit boss Andrea Orcel and Italy's government are poles apart over the terms of a deal to buy ailing bank Monte dei Paschi (MPS), people involved in the talks say, with the state balking at capital demands surpassing 7 billion euros ($8 billion).
Negotiations are expected to go down to the wire given that many issues remain unresolved but pressure has mounted to get to a conclusion. 
Italy has long pointed to a merger with a healthier rival as the only way to draw a line under a decade-long crisis which has made MPS the epitome of the country's banking woes.
UniCredit, on the other hand, has few options at home if it wants to bridge a gap with rival heavyweight Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY), whose market share last year became twice that of UniCredit after the takeover of mid-sized peer UBI.
UniCredit would like to have a decision in hand by when its board meets to approve quarterly results on Oct. 27, but sources on both sides say that may now not happen, with a risk the three months' old talks could break down entirely. 
In entering exclusive negotiations on July 29 to buy ""selected parts"" of MPS, UniCredit had stipulated the deal needed to leave its capital unaffected and boost earnings per share by 10%.
Italy's only bank of global systemic relevance said it targeted only MPS' branches in wealthier northern and central regions and would leave behind any soured or risky loans as well as legal risks stemming from mismanagement.
After concluding its due diligence analysis in September and leaving things to rest until after local elections earlier this month, UniCredit has only recently presented the Treasury with detailed demands and the ministry is still going through the documents, two of the sources said.
The main stumbling block is the cash Italian taxpayers will need to inject into MPS to return it into private hands only four years after spending 5.4 billion euros to rescue it.
MPS has plans to raise 2.5 billion euros in capital next year if it fails to find a buyer, but UniCredit believes even a capital raising twice that size would be only a stopgap solution, a person close to the matter told Reuters.
Rome disagrees with fair value adjustments UniCredit is requesting after applying its internal risk models to MPS' balance sheet, one source said. UniCredit declined to comment.
The source said the Treasury, which has already lined up tax breaks worth around 2 billion euros to ease the UniCredit-MPS deal, is reluctant to spend more than 3.5 billion euros to beef up MPS' capital reserves and fund staff exits.
HIGH STAKES
To bring MPS' efficiency levels in line with its own, UniCredit needs to send 7,000 employees into early retirement, more than twice what MPS had planned to cut under a draft business plan through 2025.
The stakes are high for both parties were negotiations to fail.
The government of Prime Minister Mario Draghi faces a commitment to re-privatise MPS by mid-2022 at the latest, a lender which the European Banking Authority this summer identified as the most vulnerable in the euro zone in a stress test of the sector.
Orcel, the former investment banking chief at UBS, is hard pressed to boost UniCredit's revenues and profits after his predecessor focused on cleaning up the balance sheet and bolstering its capital reserves.
He has opened the door to potential mergers and acquisitions to accelerate growth but there are few domestic targets while cross-border deals remain a tall order. 
Orcel has studied a possible move on Banco BPM, another mid-tier bank, two people familiar with the matter said.
He has put the dossier on hold to focus on MPS, which he has described as the best deal on the table for UniCredit.

In the meantime shares in Banco BPM have rallied 64%, against a 37% gain in Italy's banking index since the start of the year.
UniCredit's own shares, analyst say, have been lifted in part by expectations of a market-friendly deal with the Treasury, which in 2017 gave Intesa 3.5 billion euros in cash to convince it to buy for 1 euros the good assets of two local banks being liquidated.

WASHINGTON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) -A U.S. regulator has handed a record reward of almost $200 million to a whistleblower who provided key information about global benchmark manipulation, with sources familiar with the matter identifying the recipient as a former  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) employee.
The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced the award on Thursday, without disclosing details about the whistleblower or the case. It said the award was for ""nearly $200 million"".
Law firm Kirby (NYSE:KEX) McInerney LLP said one of its clients received the record bounty after providing extensive information and documents in 2012 that ""catalyzed"" investigations by the CFTC and a foreign regulator into benchmark manipulation.
A Kirby McInerny attorney declined to identify the whistleblower or the case.
Two sources told Reuters the whistleblower had previously worked for Deutsche Bank. Spokespeople for the German bank and for the CFTC declined to comment.
In the past decade, authorities globally have levied multibillion-dollar fines and pursued criminal charges against banks and traders for banding together to rig global benchmarks, most notoriously the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). U.S. and British authorities fined https://www.reuters.com/article/us-deutschebank-libor-settlement/deutsche-bank-fined-record-2-5-billion-over-rate-rigging-idUSKBN0NE12U20150423 Deutsche Bank $2.5 billion in 2015 over the rate-rigging scandal.
David Kovel, the whistleblower attorney from Kirby McInerney, said: ""The whistleblower award amount may seem shocking but it's because the ability to manipulate and make huge profits is shocking. It follows from the misconduct.""
The unprecedented scale of the award wreaked havoc at the CFTC, threatening to bankrupt its whistleblower program and forcing U.S. lawmakers to authorize emergency funding in July. The Wall Street Journal first reported https://www.wsj.com/articles/cftc-whistleblower-program-in-peril-over-potential-100-million-plus-payout-11620732600?mod=article_inline the issues in May, and at the time identified Kovel as the attorney for the ex-Deutsche Bank tipster.

The largest whistleblower award given by the CFTC's larger and better-funded counterpart that oversees securities markets, the Securities and Exchange Commission, totaled over $114 million, by comparison.
The amount, the largest for any government whistleblower program, was ""mind-blowing"", Erika Kelton, a whistleblower attorney with Phillips & Cohen LLP, said in a statement.

1241,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2021 10:22AM ET</span>",Exclusive-Italy woos Intel over multibillion-euro chip plant -sources,"By Giulio Piovaccari and Giuseppe Fonte
MILAN/ROME (Reuters) - Rome is drawing up an offer to try to convince Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) to invest billions of euros in an advanced chipmaking plant in Italy, as Germany emerges as frontrunner to land an even bigger megafactory planned by the U.S. company, three sources said.
The plants would be part of a drive by the U.S. group to build cutting-edge manufacturing capacity in Europe to help avoid future supply shortages of the kind currently crippling the automotive industry in particular. 
Rome is already in talks with Intel about the potential investment, which according to preliminary estimates would be worth more than 4 billion euro ($4.7 billion), the sources who are involved in the discussions said.
One of them said the total could even reach around 8 billion euros, depending on Intel's plans.
They declined to be identified because the details are confidential.
Rome is ready to fund part of the overall investment with public money and offer favourable terms to Intel, including on labour and energy costs, the sources said.
The factory would create more than 1,000 direct jobs in Italy, they added. 
""The government is preparing a very detailed offer with the aim of clinching a deal by the end of the year,"" one of the sources told Reuters. 
""Discussions with Intel are at an advanced stage. There is no deal yet, but if the government works hard on this it has a good chance of bringing the plant to Italy.""
Potential sites include Turin's Mirafiori area, the Italian home of carmaker Stellantis, and Catania in Sicily, where French-Italian chipmaker STMicroelectronics already operates, the sources said.
Intel declined to comment on its plans.
The U.S. group's biggest project in Europe is a planned megafactory, where Dresden in Germany has emerged as a leading candidate site, the sources said. They are not directly involved in talks about the choice of site for the megafactory.
No final decision has been made for either site and plans could change in the coming weeks, the sources said.
FROM U.S. TO EU
The Italian factory would be an ""advanced packaging"" plant that uses new technologies to weave together full chips out of tiles produced by Intel and other chipmakers, the sources said. 
Intel is using the technology to draw in new customers such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s cloud computing unit, but its only sites are in the United States.
France is also seen as contender for the megafactory, while Italy faces competition from Poland, where Intel also has a presence, for the packaging facility.
Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said last month the company would announce the locations of two major new EU chip fabrication plants by year-end as it looks to spend 80 billion euros over the next decade on the continent.
CHIPS ARE DOWN
The plans come as the European Union aims to reduce its dependence on semiconductor supplies from the United States and China, and the chip supply crisis shows no signs of abating.
Chipmakers are scrambling to boost output after the work-from-home trend during the pandemic led to explosive demand for consumer electronics such as smartphones and computers.
The shortages have hit the automotive industry - a major pillar of the European economy - the hardest, as chipmakers have generally preferred consumer electronics customers because they buy more advanced, higher-margin chips. 
Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said this week the EU needed to act ""now and decisively"" to increase output to meet its target of producing 20% of the world's semiconductor output by 2030.
""China and the U.S. are already investing tens of billions each in this sector,"" he said.
Still, building the megafactory and packaging plant will take years and is unlikely to help European automakers in the short term.
For that, Gelsinger has said Intel plans to reserve capacity at its chip factory in Ireland for automakers and help them shift to using its technology, but that too could take time.
GERMANY IN THE LEAD
Talks could speed up after a new government is formed in Germany, following September's federal elections. 
The EU's biggest economy, with a large car industry, is in the lead to land the ""megafab"" plant, the sources said, though France remains in the running.

One of the sources said Italy also had ""cards to play"" to obtain a research centre, which is another part of the overall investment Intel is preparing for Europe.

The White House made the request to automakers, chip companies and others last month, saying the information would boost supply-chain transparency and help understand where bottlenecks exist. The deadline for firms to respond is Nov. 8. 
""Companies including Intel, GM, Infineon, and SK Hynix, have indicated that they plan to be very forthcoming with their data. We are very appreciative of their efforts and encourage other companies to follow suit,"" a Commerce spokesperson told Reuters. 
""The (request for information) is voluntary, but this information is crucial to addressing concerns about transparency in the supply chain. Whether or not we have to use compulsory measures depends on how many companies engage and the quality of the data shared.""
The request has caused concern in Taiwan that companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), the world's largest contract chipmaker and a major Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier, would have to hand over sensitive data. TSMC said earlier this month it would not leak any sensitive company information.
TSMC said in a statement to Reuters it is preparing and will respond to the U.S. request for information.
""TSMC has been actively supporting and working with all stakeholders to overcome the global semiconductor supply challenge,"" it said.
""Looking forward, to increase the demand visibility in this complex supply chain should be the path to avoid such shortages from happening in the future. We have been a strong partner in this effort and will continue taking actions to address this challenge.""
A GM spokesperson confirmed the Commerce Department statement, saying the company ""will submit data within the requested timeframe,"" while Infineon declined to comment on ""ongoing communications with governments."" Intel and SK Hynix did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
South Korea's trade ministry has also expressed concern over the request.
""The scope of the requested data is vast and a number of operational secrets are included, which is a big concern in South Korea,"" it said in an Oct. 6 statement. 

However, South Korea's trade minister, Moon Sung-wook, told a parliamentary committee on Thursday that companies were preparing to review and submit data that can be provided without violating contractual confidentiality provisions or domestic laws.
Automakers, including GM,  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp and  Renault  (PA:RENA), have slashed output and sales forecasts due to scarce chip supplies, made worse by a COVID-19 resurgence in key Asian semiconductor production hubs.

Investing.com – Boston Beer stock (NYSE:SAM) fell more than 3% Friday as the volumes it had built up in anticipation of strong sales of its hard seltzer brand Truly weighed on costs in wake of poor sales in the third quarter.
The company closed the quarter in the red compared to a profit a year ago.
Sales of hard seltzers were strong in the pandemic and the company stocked up to meet demand that it expected to only rise. A rude shock awaited the company as on-premise demand for hard seltzers was much slower than at-home consumption. That outcome left it with huge inventory the company is now forced to account for.
""While Truly has continued to grow, gain share and solidify its long-term position, the slower category performance has reduced our full-year growth expectations for Truly to be between 20-25% year-over-year,” President and CEO Dave Burwick said in a note.
But the company is not giving up yet. Burwick said the category will remain a very important segment of the drinks market in the future.
Gross margin of around 31% decreased from the nearly 49% realized in the third quarter of 2020, primarily due to $84.9 million direct and indirect volume adjustment costs, a result of the hard seltzer slowdown and higher materials costs.
Third-quarter net revenue fell 14% to $561.6 million.
Third quarter net loss of $58.4 million or $4.76 per diluted share represented a decrease of $139.2 million or $11.27 per diluted share compared to net income in the third quarter of last year.
Net loss was $58.42 million compared to a profit of $80.76 million in the same quarter last year."

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Friday, with the S&P edging to a new all-time high, but with some big-name technology stocks lagging after flashing warning signs in their quarterly updates. 
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the S&P 500 was up 4 points, or 0.1%, at 4,554 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 118 points, or 0.3%. By contrast, the NASDAQ Composite was down 0.2%, as poor results from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Snap (NYSE:SNAP) weighed on a technology sector whose valuation doesn't allow for disappointments. 
Snap stock fell 21% after revealing a big hit to revenue from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s new privacy settings, which have deterred advertisers from paying big money to place ads, given that they can no longer be precisely targeted. The parent company of Snapchat had warned three months ago that such a hit was likely, but the stock had still held up, supported not least by the belief that social media companies were immune to pressures from supply chain disruptions in manufacturing and retail. 
Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock meanwhile fell 10.8% after falling short of consensus forecasts in the third quarter, with further evidence of loss of market share in the key datacenter segment. Intel noted that the problems of other chip makers were affecting the ability of manufacturers to ship finish products, in turn depressing their demand for Intel's chips.
Both companies were put completely in the shade by  Digital World Acquisition  Corp (NASDAQ:DWAC), which was suspended limit up after nearly tripling at the open. It had already more than quadrupled on Thursday after the Special Purpose Acquisition Company was announced as the vehicle through which Donald Trump's new social media company will go public. The circuit-breakers kicked in at $131.90, a rise of 190% on Thursday's close. When trading resumed, the shares were immediately suspended again at $175.
Another stock sucked up in anticipation of the launch of Trump's TRUTH Social platform was Austin-based software company Phunware (NASDAQ:PHUN), which had collaborated with the Trump/Pence campaign in building its app for the 2020 election. Speculation was rife that Trump will pick the Phunware to build the platform's app. Phunware stock trading was halted up over 1000% at $18.35, giving the 58-person company a market value of $1.4 billion.
The business model of TRUTH Social is far from clear, beyond its stated aim of disrupting what its founder sees as a liberal-dominated social media space. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) banned Trump from their networks not least because of boycott pressure against their advertisers, something sure to be repeated if they place ads on TRUTH Social. Facebook and Twitter stock had shown little reaction to the news of TRUTH Social's creation initially, falling much more sharply on the back of Snap's news about the effects of Apple's privacy regime. Facebook stock was down 5.3%, while Twitter stock was down 3.1%."

Investing.com – Whirlpool stock (NYSE:WHR) fell nearly 4% in Friday’s premarket trading as the company cut its sales guidance for the year after third-quarter revenue fell behind expectations.
The maker of refrigerators and electric chimneys blamed supply chain issues for its shortfall, semiconductors particularly, according to Bloomberg, which quoted Whirlpool Chief Financial Officer Jim Peters.
“There have been times when we’ve had to air-freight components in from other locations to work around that. We’ve put product from China to Europe on rail instead of ships,” he said.
Retailers and manufacturers like Whirlpool and  Nike  (NYSE:NKE), while rolling in heightened consumer demand for their wares, have not been fully able to meet the demand for want of raw materials and shipments stuck at ports. Higher wages and labor shortage have hurt, too.
The company now expects its full-year net sales to grow by around 13%, a figure it had marked for itself in April when times were better and it felt its initial aim of around 6% growth was not ambitious enough. As demand boomed in July, Whirlpool forecast that 16% growth was achievable.
It raised its target for adjusted profit per share, now pegging it around $26.25.
Whirlpool’s net sales in the third quarter rose by around 4% to $5.48 billion. It set out a long-term net sales growth target of around 5.5% at midpoint."

According to the letter, ASIC's investigation covered directors duties like care and diligence and operating in good faith, obligations of honesty, and true and correct books and records. It closed the investigation on all individuals involved. 
""ASIC has concluded its investigation on the basis that there is insufficient evidence to establish to a court that there has been a breach of the law,"" the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) said in the letter, dated Oct. 19 and addressed to Davies.
""As I said in 2016, Rio Tinto did have no grounds to dismiss me and that continues to be my view,"" Davies told Reuters.

ASIC acknowledged the letter, saying it would not take enforcement action. ""We've noted that ASIC may recommence its investigation, or commence enforcement action, if circumstances change,"" a spokesperson said.

GIS delivered better-than-expected financials in its last reported quarter, and Citi analysts expect the stock to “continue to improve upon its market-share gains while raising prices to offset inflation.”
Current rising inflation is in-part due to supply chain disruptions at a time when demand is rebounding driven by the economic recovery. So conditions bode well for consumer defensive stocks. Global food prices shot up nearly 33% year-over-year in September 2021 and more than 3% since July, reaching their highest levels since 2011. GIS should gain substantially from the rising food prices. Furthermore, because consumer defensives perform relatively better in inflationary conditions, GIS stock should attract significant investor attention.

However, given weak analyst sentiment regarding the company’s forthcoming earnings release, will the stock be able to sustain its momentum? Read more to find out.Regions Financial Corporation (NYSE:RF) in Birmingham, Ala., is one of the nation’s largest full-service providers of consumer and commercial banking, wealth management, and mortgage products and services. It caters to customers in the South, Midwest, and Texas, and operates more than 1,300 banking branches and 2,000 ATMs.
RF’s stock has soared 82% in price over the past year and 21.8% over the past month to close yesterday’s trading session at $23.28, driven by the company’s strategic acquisitions and competitive edge in delivering real-time financing, seamless loan applications, and a prudent approach to risk management.
However, RF’s loan operations look uncertain. The bank's loan-to-deposit ratio is 63.9% currently, implying that only around two-thirds of the bank's deposits have been used to issue loans. Furthermore, the company’s total revenue declined 2% year-over-year to $1.58 billion in the second quarter, ended June 30, 2021. In addition, analysts have reduced their estimates for the company’s forthcoming third-quarter earnings report. So, we think these factors combined could impact RF’s current price rally.

The Nordic country has so far only recommended using the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to minors. 
The health ministry said there was no urgency given that children have a low risk of falling seriously ill from COVID-19 and because a single dose of a vaccine offered a protection rate of 85% against the disease for up to 16 weeks.
""A second vaccine dose is also linked with a higher risk of pericarditis and myocarditis, especially among young men and boys,"" the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) said in a statement.
Pericarditis is inflammation of the outer lining of the heart, while myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle.
The FHI will assess the situation again in early 2022 after it has gathered more information from studies currently being conducted in the Nordics, it said. 
Norway's move is akin to Britain, which decided in September that this age group would only receive one dose for now.

Separately, Norway said it would donate more than 620,000 doses of  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) vaccines it has no use for. The doses will not be given via the COVAX mechanism but via the European Union to third countries.
Non-EU member Norway is part of the single European market and has received its vaccines against COVID-19 via the EU.

""It's generally recommended that you get the booster that is the original regimen that you got in the first place,"" Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in an interview with CNN.
""But for one reason or other - and there may be different circumstances with people, availability or just different personal choices - you can, as we say, mix and match,"" Fauci said in an interview with CNN.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Thursday recommended the COVID-19 vaccine boosters for recipients of the  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) shots, and said Americans can choose a different shot from their original inoculation as a booster. 
Fauci's comments contrasted with the recommendations from the CDC and Food and Drug Administration this week, which said that Americans should get boosters but did not specify which combinations would be best.
The recommendations also opened the door for recipients of the one-shot J&J vaccine to get a dose of the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) or Moderna vaccines that have been shown to afford greater protection in a variety of studies.
""You can now mix and match one with the other, but in general it just makes sense to go with what your original regimen was,"" Fauci said.
U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy echoed the suggestion.
""If you got a Pfizer/Moderna and if you did well with your primary series, I think it's quite reasonable to stick with what you got originally,"" he said in an interview with CNBC. 
Studies have shown that boosters from Pfizer, Moderna and J&J all enhance protection against the virus, he said.

""The bottom line is: We have good options now, we have flexibility in terms of which vaccine you get,"" Murthy said.
Although these vaccines have been highly effective in preventing serious illness and death, some government scientists have suggested that boosters are needed to keep immunity high, especially as the extremely contagious Delta variant can cause breakthrough infections among some who are fully vaccinated.

(Reuters) -Top oilfield firm Schlumberger NV (NYSE:SLB) reported a rise in third-quarter adjusted income on Friday, buoyed by higher demand for its services and equipment, as producers capitalize on a rebound in crude prices.
Global oil prices have climbed nearly 64% since the start of 2021 to over $85 a barrel on the back of a vaccine-fueled demand recovery. The worldwide rig count was 1,448 at the end of the third quarter, compared with 1,019 a year earlier, according to Baker Hughes data.
""The industry macro fundamentals have visibly strengthened this year, particularly in recent weeks- with demand recovery, oil and gas commodity prices at recent highs, low inventory levels, and encouraging trends in pandemic containment efforts,"" Schlumberger Chief Executive Officer Olivier Le Peuch said in a statement, adding he expects those conditions to materially drive investment over the coming years. 
Schlumberger reported net income of $550 million, or 39 cents per share, for the quarter, edging past Wall Street estimates of 36 cents each, according to Refinitiv IBES. Revenue of $5.8 billion fell short of analysts expectations of $5.9 billion, but was up 11% year-over-year. 
Excluding charges & credits, net income came in at $514 million, or 36 cents per share, for the three months ended Sept. 30, higher than $228 million, or 16 cents per share, a year earlier.
Wall Street analysts said the results were positive, pointing to improved higher margins, which topped expectations. 
""These results are a wonderful breath of fresh air,"" analysts for investment firm Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co wrote in a note that called the start to oilfield earnings season ""rough"".

Rivals Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and Baker Hughes both posted quarterly profit from year-ago losses this week but results were snagged by Hurricane Ida-led disruptions and supply chain woes.
Its shares were flat in pre-market trading at $34.30. They are up 57.12% year-to-date, outpacing gains in Baker Hughes and Halliburton.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU enforcers are planning a series of raids against companies suspected of illegal price-fixing, Europe's anti-trust chief warned on Friday, as she also sounded the alarm about competition in labour markets due to ""no-poach"" deals.
The European Commission last week raided Europe's largest pulp producers Stora Enso (OTC:SEOAY) and UPM, and Metsa Board unit Metsa Fibre, the first in two years as the COVID-19 pandemic halted such actions.
Companies suspected of taking part in other cartels should soon see officials knocking on their doors, EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said.
""And that's just the start of a series of raids that we're planning for the months to come – you'll understand if I don't say exactly when or where they're going to happen,"" she told a conference organised by the Italian anti-trust authority in Rome.
Companies found guilty of taking part in cartels face fines as much as 10% of their global turnover. Whistleblowers are rewarded with immunity from sanctions while those who provide crucial information can get hefty reductions in their penalties.
She said regulators may sweeten such so-called leniency deals with companies as the growth in private damages claims from customers deter many from sharing key data with enforcers.
Vestager also criticised ""no-poach"" agreements between companies, saying that this could create a cartel, a sign that she may be mulling action. 

Individuals are directly effected ""when companies collude to fix the wages they pay or when they use so-called 'no-poach' agreements as an indirect way to keep wages down, restricting talent from moving where it serves the economy best"", she said.
No-poach agreements, in which companies agree not to hire each others' workers, and non-compete agreements, in which workers sign contracts pledging not to leave to work for a rival, have in recent years drawn criticism.

Investing.com –  Digital World Acquisition  (NASDAQ:DWAC) stock was up 85% in Friday’s premarket trading following a 357% rise on Thursday triggered by the news of the SPAC’s merger with former U.S. President Donald Trump’s planned social media platform.
At one time, the stock was up more than 420% Thursday and touched a high of $52 before giving up some of the gains. More than 476 million shares of the company exchanged hands on the Nasdaq in the previous session as sharp spikes led to trading in the counter being halted several times.
Trump Media & Technology Group, a new outfit set up by the former President for his latest foray, announced the combination Wednesday. Trump also said he would roll out the platform ‘TRUTH Social,’ that he says will “stand up to the tyranny of Big Tech.”
Trump has been off social media as both Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and his then favorite, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), banned him from their platforms for his alleged role in inciting the January 6 Capitol riot. Since then, Trump has been exploring ways to restore his once-sizable social media presence.
In a sign that the stock has already developed the backing of retail traders, the stock featured among the top 10 most popular names on Reddit’s WallStreetBets, whose members were behind the meteoric rise of meme stocks like GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC).
A SPAC, or special purpose acquisition company, is a blank-check company that uses proceeds from an IPO to take private firms public. It is usually set up by high profile people with relevant industry experience and that’s what gets it the initial valuation with the subsequent transaction bringing it the final value.

Closed ports due to a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in Asia, aggravated by the fast-spreading Delta variant, and labor shortages have strained global supply chains as well as led to a surge in raw material prices.
Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON) said a shortage of parts had curtailed production in its biggest segment, the aerospace unit. It also said an electronic component shortage was hurting its safety and productivity solutions unit, which houses the automation equipment business used by customers including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).Com Inc.
The company cut its full-year sales estimates to between $34.2 billion and $34.6 billion, compared with its prior forecast of $34.6 billion to $35.2 billion to ""reflect the persistent effects of the macro-challenged environment"".
Analysts, on average, had expected full-year sales of $35.10 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES estimate.
Honeywell also narrowed full-year profit forecast range to $8.00 to $8.10, from $7.95 to $8.10 earlier.
Shares of the company fell 1.6% premarket. They have risen nearly 6% for the year.

Excluding one-time items, Honeywell earned $2.02 per share, beating estimates of $1.99 per share for the third-quarter ended Sept. 30, benefiting from a rise in commercial and business aviation.
Net sales rose to $8.47 billion from $7.80 billion a year earlier, but missed analysts' average estimate of $8.65 billion.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Qantas Airways Ltd said on Friday it would speed up plans to restart flights to many destinations and use some bigger planes amid ""massive demand"" for international flying as quarantine restrictions ease for Australian citizens.
All 11,000 of the airline's staff idled without pay, around half its workforce, will return to work by early December as domestic and international flying returns to more normal levels, the airline said.
Qantas will bring back two of its flagship Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) A380 super-jumbos in April - three months earlier than planned - and is in talks with Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co about the delivery of three new 787-9s in storage to accelerate its international flight plans.
Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce said that for four of the last five weeks, the airline's international sales were stronger than domestic sales for the first time since the pandemic began.
""There is massive demand for Australians wanting to see their family and relatives,"" he told reporters. ""There is massive demand for loved ones wanting to get together for Christmas. There is demand for people wanting to take that holiday that they have been looking forward to for nearly two years.""
The state of New South Wales, home to Sydney, last week said it would allow the entry of fully vaccinated travellers from overseas from Nov. 1 without the need for quarantine, although the easing of strict entry controls will initially benefit only citizens and permanent residents.
Qantas said it would launch a new route from Sydney to New Delhi on Dec. 6 and bring forward plans for flights to Singapore, Fiji, Johannesburg, Bangkok and Phuket due to the New South Wales rule change.
Neighbouring Victoria state, home to Australia's second-largest city Melbourne, on Friday announced a similar policy from Nov. 1.
Qantas said it would bring forward the start of flights from Melbourne to London by six weeks to Nov. 6 and to Singapore by three weeks to Nov. 22. It will look at bringing forward other destinations if possible.
Joyce said Qantas was also hopeful Indonesia would relax quarantine rules for Australians, allowing its low-cost arm Jetstar to begin flights to Bali by Christmas.
""It will be in the early new year at the latest, I think, and we've got aircraft ready to go,"" he said. 

For the airline to make a full recovery in its loss-making international business, Australian rules will need to be eased further to allow international students, business travellers and tourists to enter the country. 
Hong Kong and mainland China have also maintained tight quarantine rules that have stopped Qantas from resuming flights.

Lemonaid Health offers patients direct online access for a number of common conditions, from consultation through treatment. It also offers free and fast delivery of prescription medications. 
""By starting with genetics as the foundation, we will give patients and healthcare providers better information about health risks and treatment,"" 23andMe Chief Executive Officer Anne Wojcicki said in a statement. 
Sunnyvale, California-based 23andMe is known for its genetic ancestry tests but also aims to develop treatments for diseases such as cancer and respiratory disorders.
The company said it would pay 25% of the total deal value in cash and the rest in shares.

The deal is expected to close by the end of 2021. 
23andMe went public in February through a blank-check firm, backed by Virgin Group founder Sir Richard Branson, in a deal that valued the merged entity at $3.5 billion.

LONDON (Reuters) -Renault said on Friday it would cut output by 500,000 cars this year, more than double its previous forecast due to a crippling global semiconductor shortage, but maintained its profit outlook helped by higher car prices and cost cuts.
During a presentation to analysts,  Renault  (PA:RENA) Chief Financial Officer Clotlide Delbos said the carmaker's visibility on the chip shortage in the fourth quarter was ""still very poor because the information coming from suppliers is very unreliable.""
Delbos said the chip shortage should ease a little by the end of the year with the end of a COVID-19 lockdown in Malaysia, central to global chip supplies, but said it would remain constrained throughout much of 2022.
When asked about other raw materials, she said Renault was not seeing shortages but was facing price increases.
The shortage of chips, used in everything from brake sensors to power steering to entertainment systems, has led automakers around the world to cut or suspend production, pushing up vehicle prices.
Like its peers, Renault has focused production on more profitable models. 
The French carmaker's gloomy forecast is more than double the 220,000 units forecast in early September and represents about 13% of the 3.75 million vehicles Renault sold in 2019 before the pandemic.
Sources close to the firm told Reuters this week production losses would be much higher than previously forecast.
The company's shares were down 1.7% at 0831 GMT, the biggest faller on the Paris blue-chip CAC-40 stock market, which was up 1%.
WAITING TIME
The carmaker said its order book hit a 15-year high by the end of September for the equivalent of 2.8 months worth of sales. 
CFO Delbos said the wait time for the Dacia Sandero, a popular, low-cost city car, was now six months.
During the third quarter, fully electric, plug-in hybrid and hybrid models made up more than 31% of sales, Renault said. 
The carmaker is on track to meet more stringent 2021 European CO2 emission targets, it added. 
Renault said third-quarter revenue had fallen by 13.4% to 8.98 billion euros ($10.4 billion) from 10.37 billion a year earlier, with higher car prices helping offset some of the 22.3% drop in global sales.
The company reiterated that its full-year operating margin would be around the same as the 2.8% it reported for the first half of the year. That compared to a loss margin of minus 0.8%.
CFO Delbos said the company would complete a 2 billion euro cost cutting plan in coming weeks, more than a year ahead of schedule and aimed to speed up further cost cutting plans.
The carmaker said it would achieve positive free cash flow for its automotive business for 2021, excluding changes in working capital requirements. That cash flow target would be boosted by a 930 million euro dividend from its financing arm RCI Banque, Delbos said.

Renault said vehicle inventories had fallen to 340,000 cars at the end of the quarter from 470,000 a year earlier.

(Reuters) -A merger with former U.S. President Donald Trump's new social media venture has delivered a potential windfall of $420 million for a former finance executive who has been trying for a decade to reinvent himself as a serial dealmaker. 
Benessere Capital CEO Patrick Orlando's stake in Digital World Acquisition Corp, the Miami-based blank-check acquisition firm he is leading, was worth $423 million on Thursday after his deal to merge with Trump Media and Technology Group was announced, according to a regulatory filing and Reuters calculations.
Orlando invested only $3 million in Digital World, and is set to receive the windfall because the deal entitles him to additional compensation in shares as sponsor of the firm, the filing shows. Digital World shares ended trading on Wednesday up 357% after the deal was announced, giving the firm a market value of close to $1.5 billion.
To be sure, these gains are on paper. The terms of the SPAC do not allow Orlando to cash out until six months after the merger has been completed. 
It is nonetheless a remarkable reversal of fortune for the former Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB) derivatives banker who worked in Peru's biofuel industry and for a U.S. sugar trading company before trying his hand at special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs).
He launched Benessere in 2012 to advise other companies on their deals but it was not until last year that he launched four SPACs with the help of Shanghai-based investment bank ARC Capital.
He struggled to gain traction. One of his SPACs, which was based in Wuhan, China, failed last month to complete a merger with Giga Energy Inc that would have valued the transportation solutions provider at $7.3 billion, because it could not deliver the cash required, according to regulatory filings.
Orlando did not respond to requests for comment. 

Trump Media said it would receive $293 million in cash that Digital World had in a trust if no shareholder of the acquisition firm chose to cash in their shares.
The company said it planned a trial version of its social media app next month and a full roll-out in the first quarter of 2022.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening mixed Friday, with the tech sector likely to underperform on the back of some disappointing earnings reports.
At 7:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 55 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 Futures traded 4 points, or 0.1%, higher, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 30 points, or 0.2%.
The major averages on Wall Street have been on the rise of late, with the broad-based S&P 500 closing 0.3% higher on Thursday at a new record peak, its seventh consecutive positive session. 
Helping the tone has been a broadly positive start to the third-quarter earnings season. FactSet reported Thursday that over 80% of the 101 S&P 500 companies which have reported so far beat expectations.
However, that mood partly changed late Thursday after Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) reported disappointing third-quarter sales after the close, causing its stock to fall nearly 10% in premarket trading. The semiconductor company cited supply shortages which were holding back sales of the company's flagship processor chips.

SINGAPORE/HONG KONG - Unless China Evergrande Group takes quick steps for an orderly restructuring of its debt pile and steps up asset sales, its last-minute bond interest payment this week will do little to shore up creditors' support for the developer, analysts and lawyers said. 
In an unexpected move, Evergrande wired an $83.5 million coupon payment due to offshore bondholders, days before a 30-day grace payment period ends on Saturday, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said on Friday.
With more than $300 billion in liabilities, Evergrande, once China's top-selling property developer, faces deep scepticism on whether it can make more near-term coupon payments with its property sales tumbling 30% in the year to Oct. 20.
""While obviously a positive, the coupon payment does not address the overall concerns about Evergrande's sustained liquidity through the first maturity in Q2 2022 and beyond,"" said John Han, a partner at law firm Kobre & Kim in Hong Kong.
""This only shows that the company is not yet ready for the house to come down completely through a massive cascade of cross defaults. Time is needed for what is planned next,"" Han said.
Evergrande faces coupon payments totalling nearly $340 million between Nov. 1 and Dec. 28 on its offshore bonds, on top of outstanding missed payments.
The developer has nearly $20 billion in offshore debt.
""Evergrande will still have many debts to be repaid in the short term in the future, and its fundamentals such as (home) sales have not seen any obvious signs of improvement,"" said Kenny Ng, an analyst at Everbright Sun Hung Kai. ""At the same time, the current price of Evergrande's bonds still reflects the lack of confidence in the market for its future,"" he said. Evergrande's shares closed 4.3% higher on Friday, but are still down 82% so far this year. Its dollar bond prices rose, with its April 2022 and 2023 notes jumping more than 10%, data from Duration Finance showed, though they still traded at deeply distressed levels of around a quarter of their face value.
""Its sale of the (property) services unit failed and its September and October sales were getting worse and worse,"" Castor Pang, head of research at Core Pacific. ""It has very little cash.""
Nomura credit analyst Iris Chen said in a note that it was hard to fully understand the logic behind the latest payment unless Evergrande is able to pay more coupon payments till mid-November.
Terming an Evergrande default as inevitable, Chen said: ""we actually think it is better for the company to default earlier rather than later to prevent repayment of onshore debt using offshore assets.""
Evergrande formally abandoned plans to sell a $2.6 billion stake in one of its key units on Wednesday.
The main unit of Evergrande said on Friday that it had not made substantial progress in disposing of the developer's assets.
Hengda Real Estate Group Co said China Evergrande cannot guarantee it will be able to continue to meet financial obligations under contracts, in a statement posted on the website of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange that echoed one from Evergrande earlier in the week. 

""Multiple financing channels are effectively closed to developers in response to the policies implemented by the government. For those channels to reopen, investors have to believe these companies can remain going concerns,"" said Paul Lukaszewski, head of corporate debt, Asia Pacific, at abrdn.
""This means they (property developers) need to have sufficient access to their own cash flows and to refinancing options to address their debt as it becomes due,"" he said.

1272,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2021 06:50AM ET</span>",Remy confident on outlook after firm flags 'exceptional' first half profit growth,"By Dominique Vidalon
PARIS (Reuters) -Remy Cointreau said on Friday it was growing increasingly confident about its full year outlook after second-quarter sales beat expectations on the back of strong demand for its premium cognac in the United States, China and Europe.
Finance Chief Luca Marotta told analysts he was now ""relatively comfortable"" with a consensus for full year 2021/22 current operating profit growth of 21%, up from a ""mid-teens"" forecast in July.
Marotta was speaking after the maker of Remy Martin cognac and Cointreau liquor forecast ""exceptional"" current operating profit growth in the first half of its 2021/2022 fiscal year, which began in April, with sales up almost a quarter in the three months to end-September, albeit from a low base last year during the pandemic.
""Remy Cointreau reiterates its confidence in its ability to outperform the exceptional spirits market and anticipates strong growth in sales, mainly driven by the performance in the first half,"" the company said in a statement.
It has already said it plans to substantially increase marketing spending during the second half.
By 0928 GMT, Remy shares were up 1.6% at 176.30 euros.
""We believe the group is well placed to continue to surprise to the upside on earnings through the remainder of the year,"" Citi analysts wrote in a note.
Second quarter sales totalled 352.2 million euros ($409.4 million) - a like-for-like rise of 23.7%, which beat analysts' expectations for a 20.8% growth - reflecting a strong demand rebound in bars and restaurants as COVID-19 restrictions eased around the world, and resilient at-home consumption.
Cognac sales alone reached 265 million euros, a like-for-like rise of 26.9%, which notably reflected a very strong performance in China during the Mid-Autumn Festival.
Marotta said the group was quite optimistic about prospects for Chinese New Year celebrations in February, but in the United States, where cognac demand was underpinned by a thirst for premium spirits, the low inventory levels were leading to supply tensions.
Group sales grew 52% in the first half on a like-for-like basis, including a 55.2% jump for cognac.

Larger rival  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) on Thursday said solid sales growth could moderate in the 2022 fiscal year, after strong demand in China, the United States, India and Europe helped it post above-forecast sales in its first quarter.

Investing.com – Intel stock (NASDAQ:INTC) plunged 10% in Friday’s premarket trading as third-quarter revenue fell short of its own guidance and the chipmaker predicted lower margins in the years ahead.
Lower revenue from the key segment of datacenter chips weighed especially on the results, as the company appeared to fall further behind the likes of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD). Third-quarter revenue from the segment fell 10% to $6.5 billion. In comments to Reuters, CEO Pat Gelsinger attributed this to new rules in China that hurt orders from Cloud vendors there.
Gelsinger told Reuters the company has resolved shortages facing its own internal manufacturing operations, but those lack of supplies of other products such as power management chips and WiFi chips were stopping its customers from shipping PCs and servers. That in turn ate into their demand for Intel's.
In a conference call with investors, Intel said gross profit margins are likely to be between 51% and 53% over the next two to three years. It sees adjusted gross margins of 53.5% in the ongoing quarter, lower sequentially as well as year-on-year basis. It was 57.8% in the quarter ended September 25.
According to Reuters, Intel is working on introducing several new generations of chipmaking-technology by 2025. Technologies tend to be less efficient early on and become more profitable as chipmakers finetune their processes.
Intel forecast at least $74 billion in revenue in 2022 while also spending big -- capital expenditure could hit $28 billion next year and rise subsequently. The company is spending $20 billion on setting up two new chip plants in Arizona under Gelsinger’s plans.
The company expects current-quarter revenue to be $18.3 billion on adjusted basis compared to $20 billion in the same period last year.
Third-quarter adjusted revenue was higher by 5% at $18.1 billion, around $100 million less than the company's guidance."

1277,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2021 06:31AM ET</span>",Tesla looks to pave the way for Chinese battery makers to come to U.S,"By Hyunjoo Jin and Subrat Patnaik
(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc wants to shift to a less expensive battery for its electric vehicles but first needs to figure out how to overcome political tensions to get a Chinese partner to build the iron-based batteries near its U.S. factories.
The world's two biggest economies have yet to resolve disputes over tariffs, intellectual property rights and Chinese incursions into Taiwan's air defense identification zone. And China's sweeping regulatory crackdown, aimed largely at the technology sector, could pose yet another hurdle.
China adopted the technology early and makes 95% of the world's Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) batteries, but key patents expire soon and Tesla said it plans to adopt LFP batteries in its fleet of standard-range vehicles globally and move battery production closer to its factories.
""Our goal is to localize all key parts of the vehicles on the continent,"" Drew Baglino, senior vice president of powertrain and energy engineering at Tesla, said on an earnings call on Wednesday. Tesla is building factories in the United States and Germany.
""We're working internally with our suppliers to accomplish that goal, and not just at the end-assembly level but as far upstream as possible.""
Tesla currently uses LFP batteries from China's CATL in some China-made Model 3 and Model Ys, and in the United States it started sales of entry-level Model 3 sedans with LFP. 
The company did not respond to a request for comment. 
LFP technology is considered to be cheaper and safer than nickel-based batteries, although they lack the same energy density as nickel-based ones to allow cars to travel farther on a single charge.
The technology has garnered interest from EV makers and Reuters reported in June that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in early stage talks with China's CATL and BYD to get LFP batteries for its planned electric vehicles and wants them to build factories in the United States.
But CATL was reluctant to build a factory in the country due to political tensions between Washington and Beijing as well as cost concerns, people said at that time.
""We are evaluating the opportunity and possibility of manufacture localization in North America,"" CATL said in a statement on Friday. 
""You cannot discount the whole geopolitical aspect of it,"" Sanjiv Malhotra, founder of battery startup Sparkz and former U.S. Department of Energy executive, told Reuters.
""Our customers, they do not want to be caught in this political crossfire,"" said the U.S. startup, which is looking at setting up LFP production lines in the United States to challenge China's dominance.
CATL is probably better off manufacturing in China, where they have access to the world's lowest-cost materials, Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin said.
""A U.S. facility would need a better U.S. supply chain to get similar to the low cost available in China.""
'PRIDE AND JOY OF CHINA'
President Joe Biden has made it a priority to support the rollout of electric vehicles to combat climate change, but battery constraints could remain a key hurdle to his ambitious plan.
China is the largest global EV market and dominates the supply chain for the manufacture of lithium-ion batteries, including the processing of minerals and raw materials.
""I call LFP the battery of China, because you really only have CATL and BYD. So these are really the kind of pride and joy of China,"" said Taylor Ogan, chief executive of Snow Bull Capital.
Electric Last Mile Solutions Inc (ELMS), a commercial electric vehicle company which currently imports CATL'S battery packs, is in talks with the company about the possibility of sourcing batteries at CATL's potential U.S. factory. 
Last year, CEO Elon Musk said Tesla would use LFP batteries for its China-made Model 3, saying the move would free up battery capacity for the Semi truck and other vehicles that require higher-density, long-range batteries based in nickel.

Since then, Musk has pledged to use the tech in more vehicles and energy storage systems. A Houston energy project will use LFP batteries. 
The company is facing higher costs primarily due to cobalt prices rising around 70% so far this year, with nickel up around 20% and aluminum up around 50%. Tesla uses these materials to make its batteries.

The firms informed Apple sometime in the past two months that they were not able to meet its requirements, the people said. But the U.S. company has not given up hope of resuming talks with either CATL or BYD, according to one source.
Chinese battery makers are more advanced than rivals in the development of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries which are cheaper to produce and sources have previously said Apple favours this battery technology.
CATL, the world's No.1 maker of batteries for EVs, has been reluctant to build a U.S. factory due to political tensions between Washington and Beijing as well as cost concerns, said one of the people with direct knowledge of the talks. 
The Chinese firm has also found it impossible to set up a separate product development team exclusively working with Apple due to difficulties in finding sufficient personnel, the person added. 
BYD, which has an iron-phosphate battery plant in Lancaster, California, declined to build a new factory and team that would solely focus on supplying Apple, said two of the sources.
The stalled discussions have meant that Apple has been considering Japanese battery makers and it sent a group of people to Japan this month, they added.
Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) Corp is one of the companies that Apple is considering, said one of the people.
The sources declined to be identified as the talks were confidential. Apple, BYD and Panasonic declined to comment.
CATL said in a statement to Reuters that it denied ""the relevant information"".
""We are evaluating the opportunity and possibility of manufacture localization in North America,"" the statement said, adding that it has a dedicated professional team exclusively for each customer.
Sources told Reuters last year Apple was aiming to launch an electric car by 2024 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-autos-exclusive/exclusive-apple-targets-car-production-by-2024-and-eyes-next-level-battery-technology-sources-idUSKBN28V2PY. Apple has not publicly disclosed its plans. 
The stall in discussions comes at a time when U.S. President Joe Biden is seeking to make the United States a powerhouse in electric cars, setting a goal https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/biden-set-target-50-evs-by-2030-industry-backs-goal-2021-08-05 of having half of all new vehicles sold in 2030 electric. 
Any delays in securing battery supplies could further impede EV development for Apple which last month lost the head of its car project, Doug Field, after he decided to return to Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, which has been making some of its Model 3 and Model Y cars in China with LFP batteries from CATL, said this week it intended to use that battery chemistry outside China as well.
CATL and BYD use a type of battery pack technology to improve the performance of LFP batteries. Without that, LFP batteries usually offer much shorter driving ranges and lower energy density than the more expensive lithium batteries that use cobalt and nickel.

Broader investment flows went into sectors which would be the best cushioned against any surprise increase in interest rates, such as financials, bank loans and U.S. inflation-protected securities. Inflows into credit funds stalled.
""Investors do not fear Fed or other central banks and do not believe central banks turn hawkish,"" analysts led by Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at the bank, said in the note.
BofA analysts noted the UK base rate, which stands at 0.1%, is currently is the lowest in 300 years. Some investors believe that a 15 bps rate hike priced in by the markets for this year would represent a ""policy mistake"".

The analysts also noted that Turkey's massive 200 bps rate cut on Thursday was the 1000th central bank rate cut since the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in 2008.
BofA's Bull & Bear indicator rose a notch to 5.2, in the middle of the range, but remained well below a peak of 7.2 hit in January 2020.

(Reuters) -London Stock Exchange Group said it was on track to achieve cost savings from the integration of data platform Refinitiv after a steady third quarter, but warned supply chain shortages could impact the timing of its technology spending. 
The exchange said pro forma underlying income was 1.78 billion pounds ($2.46 billion) in the three months to the end of September, up from 1.75 billion a year earlier, helped by a rise in stock trading volumes and initial public offerings. 
Its data and analytics unit, which houses Refinitiv, posted a 0.3% decline in pro forma income, with a dip in earnings from its Trading & Banking solutions business. 
""We are making excellent progress on the integration of Refinitiv and are comfortably on track to achieve 125 million pounds of cost synergies in 2021, ahead of our original phasing,"" Chief Executive David Schwimmer said in a statement.
LSEG shares fell as much as 4.2% and were last down 3.5%. 
LSEG said it expected year to April income to grow by between 4-5%, but for income in the fourth quarter to not grow as fast as it did in the third quarter on a constant currency basis.
There was no change to previous cost or capital expenditure plans, though supply chain pressures ""may impact the timing of some of the technology spend this year"", it said, without giving further detail.
Refinitiv was carved out from  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI), parent of Reuters News, in 2018 by a consortium led by Blackstone (NYSE:BX) before being bought by LSEG in a $27 billion deal finalised in January 2021.
With the takeover, Schwimmer is trying to transform LSEG into a one-stop shop for data, trading and analytics, though the costs of absorbing the data provider have worried some investors.
LSEG's shares are down around 17% since the start of March, when comments about the cost of the Refinitiv integration spooked some investors. 

Thomson Reuters now holds a minority stake in LSEG and Refinitiv pays Thomson Reuters for news it distributes.

Investing.com – Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) shares were under pressure in Friday’s premarket trading in a read across from Snap's (NYSE:SNAP) badly-received third-quarter numbers late on Thursday.
Facebook stock traded 3.6% lower and Alphabet stock down 1.8%. Snap, with a much smaller market cap, plunged nearly 20% premarket. 
Snap Thursday reported a 57% increase to $1.07 billion in third-quarter revenue but that was below expectations and illustrated the damage that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s new privacy rules are posing to apps dependent on advertising revenue. 
The update to Apple's privacy policy, rolled out in the June quarter, make it tougher for apps to track users and source their personal data for ad targeting. Users now have to opt-in to let apps track them, thus making it more difficult to measure the effectiveness of ad-spend. Short of adequate data, companies are reluctant to spend big money to advertise. 
“While we anticipated some degree of business disruption, the new Apple-provided measurement solution did not scale as we had expected, making it more difficult for our advertising partners to measure and manage their ad campaigns for iOS,” CEO Evan Spiegel said.
The company had warned pf the impact when it published its second-quarter earnings, but the stock had held its ground, supported by confidence that social media companies were largely immune to the problems of supply chain disruption that have plagued retailers and manufacturers in recent months.
The company said fourth-quarter revenue should be around $1.18 billion, as the privacy changes exert a continued drag on performance.
Facebook too has warned of the rules posing a challenge to it and its advertisers though comments made by a senior executive last month seemed to provide some succor.

The tie-up comes less than a week after the world's fourth largest automaker signed a similar agreement https://www.reuters.com/technology/stellantis-lg-energy-form-battery-production-jv-2021-10-18 with South Korea's LG Energy Solution (LGES), as it rolls out its 30 billion euro ($35 billion) electrification plan.
Automakers are investing billions of dollars to accelerate a transition to low-emission mobility and prepare for a progressive phase-out of internal combustion engines. 
Stellantis, which was formed in January via the merger https://www.reuters.com/article/us-stellantis-deal-idUSKBN29L001 of Italian-American automaker Fiat Chrysler and France's PSA, earlier this year announced it would invest more than 30 billion euros through 2025 on electrifying its vehicle line-up.
The two battery deals will support its goal to have EVs account for over 40% of its U.S. sales by 2030, providing an annual battery production capacity of up to 80 gigawatt hours (GWh), which could power about 1.2 million electric vehicles. 
Martino De Ambroggi, an analyst at broker Equita, said the joint ventures with Samsung SDI and LSEG Stellantis would secured the needed capacity to meet the company's U.S. electrification target.
Stellantis has said it wants to secure more than 130 GWh of global battery capacity by 2025 and over 260 GWh by 2030. 
As part of this plan Stellantis has said it will build three battery plants in Europe - in Germany, France and Italy - and two in North America. 
The group, whose brands include Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY), Fiat, Opel and U.S. best-sellers Jeep and Ram, also aims to have more than 70% of its sales in Europe be of low-emission vehicles by 2030.
The Stellantis-Samsung SDI venture aims to start operations by the first half of 2025 with an initial annual battery production capacity of 23 GWh, while it could increase to 40 GWh in the future, the two companies said in a joint statement.
They did not provide any financial details.
The batteries produced at the U.S. joint venture will be supplied to Stellantis' factories in the United States, Canada and Mexico. The location of the factory is under review. 
Samsung SDI, an affiliate of South Korean tech giant Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF), already has EV battery plants in South Korea, China and Hungary, which supply customers such as BMW and Ford Motor (NYSE:F).
By 0905 GMT Milan-listed shares in Stellantis were up 0.6%, broadly in line with Italy's blue-chip index. Samsung SDI shares closed up nearly 2%.

SEOUL (Reuters) - The ""Made in Korea"" green tracksuits and pink jumpsuits worn by characters in Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s global hit ""Squid Game https://www.netflix.com/kr-en/title/81040344"" have proven a pre-Halloween bright spot for a South Korean garment industry struggling during the pandemic.
A 500-square-metre (598-square-yard) garment factory in the Seongbuk district of the capital Seoul was humming this week, green and pink thread flying off stacked spools off serger machines with loud knocking noises in a race to meet orders.
""October is usually a slow month for the sewing industry, but thanks to Squid Game and Halloween, we are scrambling to stitch,"" factory owner Kim jin-ja, 54, told Reuters. ""We are now sewing 6,000 teal-green tracksuits for toddlers and children.""
Kim says her annual sales of 1.5 billion won ($1.27 million) plummeted to a third of what she used to make after the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Most of her orders came from Japan but travel restrictions forced her to shut down in August and September. 
She now hopes orders will last past Halloween and sees better chances of renewed exports with ""Made in Korea"" labels.
The South Korean garment industry had been in decline even before the pandemic with higher wage levels making it difficult to compete with China, Vietnam or Indonesia.
Of the 2,144 manufacturing businesses in Seongbuk, 70% - or 1,510 - are apparel companies, Seoul Fashion Textile Sewing Association chairman Oh Byung-yeol told Reuters.
""The two years of COVID have been a tough time for domestic fashion corporations,"" said Seongbuk Mayor Lee Seung-ro. ""(But) Squid Game, which has become a global sensation, has also made tracksuits popular domestically, leading to a flood of orders.""
A child's Squid Game tracksuit was selling for 30,000 won ($25.50) in Namdaemun Market, the country's largest traditional market where stock ranges from kitchenware to jewellery. 
A garment vendor in the market said he and others did not have enough tracksuits to meet soaring demand.
Squid Game has been watched by 142 million households since its Sept. 17 debut, according to Netflix, the world's largest streaming service, helping it add 4.38 million new subscribers.

Many small business owners in South Korea recognised themselves in the cash-strapped characters of the wildly popular thriller, who vie desperately for a chance to win $38 million, exposing a debt trap that is all too familiar.

(Reuters) -IHG said on Friday it was seeing encouraging signs of recovery in business and international travel, with strong corporate bookings in the United States as the Holiday Inn owner's room revenue inches closer to pre-pandemic levels.
The owner of the Crowne Plaza, Regent and Hualuxe hotel chains said hotel room revenue (RevPAR), a key performance indicator, rose 66% in the third quarter, with the United States down just 7% from 2019 levels after a busy summer season.
""Domestic leisure demand was particularly strong in a number of markets over the summer, where occupancy and rate climbed back to 2019 levels,"" Chief Executive Officer Keith Barr said.
IHG said it was encouraged by signs of an uplift in business travel, group bookings and international trips during September.
Companies in the travel and hospitality industry around the world are recovering from the pandemic, as higher vaccination rates and an easing in restrictions spur an uptick in business and leisure travel.
However, renewed lockdowns due to the spread of the highly-contagious Delta variant, together with pre-flight COVID-19 tests as well as remote work options, still pose a significant constraint for the sector. 
Revenue in IHG's Americas region, which account for the bulk of the group's revenue, rose 76% in the quarter and was down 10% compared to 2019.
In China, like other hotel operators such as Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR), IHG saw a hit in August from new restrictions. 
IHG shares were down 1.5% by 0725 GMT, with Citi analyst James Ainley saying it reflected the company's underperformance as compared to industry data. 
""(IHG's) key Crowne Plaza and Holiday Inn brands in particular weak relative to their segments,"" Ainley added.

IHG has been reviewing around 200 Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza hotels to save cost and position itself for growth post COVID-19. It has exited or confirmed the exit of 90 hotels already, it said on Friday.
It is targeting an additional $25 million in cost savings this year.

Aluminum fell by the daily limit in Shanghai as coal futures extended a retreat.
The global energy shortage, fueled by record coal and gas costs, has forced metal output cuts from China to Europe, depleting inventories. Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) Inc., the world’s largest publicly traded copper miner, reported less than expected third-quarter production from its mines in the Americas, adding to concerns over a drum-tight market that’s fueled a historic squeeze and seen prices surge back toward record levels.
China’s Jiangxi province has started power rationing to industrial sectors including steel, aluminum and copper, according to researcher Mysteel. The southern province, a major producer of refined copper and copper products, is the latest to battle a power shortage that could worsen in winter heating season. 
Chinese provinces have been rushing to meet annual energy intensity reduction goals by shutting down industrial plants. More than 30% of capacity in the steel, aluminum and cement industry must meet the government’s most stringent standards for emissions and energy efficiency by 2025, according to longer-term guidelines released on Thursday night.
After hitting a record high last week, the LMEX Metals Index -- which tracks six metals -- retreated this week, driven by rising concerns around China Evergrande Group (OTC:EGRNY). While the indebted real-estate developer’s cash crisis has created a threat to the Chinese economy, risk-exposed assets received some relief on Friday on reports that Evergrande may meet a key payment deadline.
Copper Futures rose 0.9% to $9,920.50 a ton on the London Metal Exchange as of 6:50 a.m. local time, following a 3.5% slump the prior day; it’s down about 3.7% this week. Aluminum fell with contracts slumping as much as 6.6% to a daily down limit of 21,405 yuan on the Shanghai Futures Exchange before trading at 21,660 yuan. Aluminum fell along with coal futures after Chinese authorities continued to take action to tackle the nation’s energy crisis. 
In the ferrous market, Iron ore  gained 1.3% to $117.95 a ton in Singapore, after falling 4.1% on Thursday. The material surged 6% in Dalian, recouping most of Thursday’s losses, while rebar futures slipped further in Shanghai.

The two banks announced they were in talks about the deal in April, just weeks after NatWest began winding down its Ulster Bank business in the Irish Republic. The departures leave Ireland with just three retail banks.
Bank of Ireland, the country's largest bank by assets with a loan book of 77 billion euros, said it would acquire 8.8 billion euros of performing mortgages, 100 million euros of performing commercial and consumer loans and 4.4 billion euros of deposits. 
A portfolio of around 300 million euros of non-performing mortgages would also be acquired as part of the transaction, the joint statement from the two banks said. 
""Today's agreement with Bank of Ireland Group regarding the sale ... of substantially all of the performing loan assets and deposits of KBC Bank Ireland ... represents an important step in KBC Group (OTC:KBCSY)'s withdrawal from the Irish market,"" KBC Group Chief Executive Johan Thijs said in a statement. 
The transaction remains subject to regulatory approvals.
Exits by KBC and NatWest look set to further strengthen Bank of Ireland and main rival Allied Irish Banks' grip on their home market. AIB bought 4.2 billion euros of corporate and commercial loans from NatWest and is in talks to add some mortgage loans.
The smaller permanent TSB has also taken advantage, buying 25 of Ulster Bank's 88 branches and 7.6 billion euros of the former number three lender's gross performing loans. 

Bank of Ireland said it was acquiring the performing mortgages for 103.6% of par value and that it expected incremental net interest income of around 160 million euros in 2023 as a result of the deal. 
The exact size of the portfolio and consideration payable could vary between now and completion based on normal business flows, but is not expected to be materially different, the statement said.

1287,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 22, 2021 03:49AM ET</span>","European Stocks Higher; Evergrande News, L'Oreal Results Help","By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Friday, helped by an easing of worries surrounding embattled property group China Evergrande as well as positive corporate earnings, notably French cosmetics giant L'Oreal.
At 3:50 AM ET (0750 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.4% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.8% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.3%.
China Evergrande remitted $83.5 million in coupon payments to a trustee account at Citibank on Thursday, according to a report from Reuters, meaning the deeply indebted company will be able to pay interest to all bondholders before the expiry of a 30-day grace period on Oct. 23.
Although it wasn’t clear how the money was raised and there is still no sign of a comprehensive restructuring of its $300 billion in liabilities, this news has reduced the immediate chance of contagion, raising the global risk appetite.
Back in Europe,  Remy Cointreau  (PA:RCOP) stock rose 1.3% and L’Oreal (PA:OREP) stock soared 6% after the two French luxury goods retailers posted strong quarterly revenue growth, benefiting from continued strong demand from primarily Chinese consumers.
 Essity AB B  (ST:ESSITYb) stock climbed over 5% after the Swedish tissue maker reported a higher-than-expected rise in quarterly profit, thanks to the growing awareness of the importance of hygiene.
On the flip side,  Renault  (PA:RENA) stock fell 0.7% after the French auto giant warned that its production losses in 2021 would be far larger than previously forecast because of a global semiconductor chip shortage.
Evidence of the difficulties facing the semiconductor sector came from U.S. company Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) late Thursday, when it issued a weaker than expected sales report late Thursday citing an industry-wide chip shortage for its revenue miss.
 London Stock Exchange  (LON:LSEG) stock fell 3.7% after the exchange posted a small rise in revenue in the third quarter as it continues to try and integrate data platform Refinitiv.
The economic data slate offered up less impressive news, with U.K. retail sales falling unexpectedly for a fifth month in a row in September, dropping 0.2% on the month, adding to signs Britain's economic recovery is losing momentum.
Still to come are the purchasing managers indices from consultancy IHS Markit for the majority of Europe, while EU leaders continue their summit meeting in Brussels.
Crude prices edged lower Friday, continuing the previous session’s selling after Russian President Vladimir Putin indicated that a group of top producers, known as OPEC+, could increase supply by more than had previously been announced.
Still, these comments came after oil rallied to the highest level since 2014 earlier this week as a global energy crunch, prompted by coal and gas shortages in China, India and Europe, led to power providers switching to diesel and fuel oil. This has coincided with a broader economic recovery from the pandemic. 
By 3:50 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% lower at $82.42 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.1% to $84.53.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.7% to $1,793.75/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.1645.

1291,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2021 03:36AM ET</span>","U.S. CDC signs off on Moderna, J&J COVID-19 vaccine boosters, mix-and-match shots","By Manas Mishra and Julie Steenhuysen
(Reuters) - The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Thursday recommended the COVID-19 vaccine boosters for recipients of the  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) shots, and said Americans can choose a different shot from their original inoculation as a booster.
CDC director Rochelle Walensky signed off on the recommendations late on Thursday, aligning the agency with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's authorization on Wednesday for the additional boosters and ""mix-and-match"" dosing.
Walensky said that vaccines authorized in the United States ""are all highly effective in reducing the risk of severe disease, hospitalization, and death, even in the midst of the widely circulating Delta variant"" of the coronavirus.
A panel of advisers to the CDC had unanimously backed COVID-19 vaccine boosters earlier on Thursday. 
Still, health officials and public health experts said the booster rollout could be confusing.
The panel struggled with trying to make the language of its recommendations as clear as possible, and also offer flexibility for patients to get a vaccine of their choice.
""A really important aspect of all of this is being clear and not dancing on the head of a pin, so that we don't further confuse the American people,"" said Dr. Beth Bell, a panel member and clinical professor in the department of global health at the University of Washington in Seattle.
The recommendations also open the door for recipients of the one-shot J&J vaccine to get a dose of the  Pfizer  or Moderna vaccines that have been shown to afford greater protection in a variety of studies.
Although these vaccines have been highly effective in preventing serious illness and death, some government scientists have suggested that boosters are needed to keep immunity high, especially as the extremely contagious Delta variant can cause breakthrough infections among some who are fully vaccinated.
ACIP voted to recommend booster doses for everyone 18 and older who received a first dose of Johnson & Johnson's vaccine at least two months earlier. 
For those who received their second dose of Moderna's vaccine at least six months earlier, ACIP recommended a third shot for those age 65 and over, as well as some individuals at risk or severe illness and those at high risk of exposure to the virus through their jobs.
Dr. Helen Talbot, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University and a panel member, said she voted for the recommendation, but cautioned, ""Moderna has very good vaccine efficacy. There will be some confusion with the higher versus lower dose.""
Booster doses of the Moderna vaccine will be 50 micrograms, half the strength of the original shots. 
""Those not at high risk should be really thoughtful about getting the higher dose. I do think we need to be very aware of potential complications.""
Experts said communicating those risks could be an issue, especially given the flexibility of allowing people to choose a different vaccine from their original series. 
""At the end of the day, even that phrase 'mix and match' pretty much gives people the latitude to ... do pretty much anything,"" Glen Nowak, a risk communication professor at the University of Georgia and former communications director for CDC’s National Immunization Program said after the meeting. ""I think that's going to be an issue.""
The FDA and CDC previously signed off on booster shots of the COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE) and partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) for the same groups included in the Moderna recommendations.
Pfizer released data on Thursday suggesting that a booster dose was highly protective for those age 16 and older compared with protection nearly a year after receiving the two-dose regimen due to waning efficacy over time.
About 11.6 million people have so far received a booster dose, according to data from the CDC. 

The FDA and CDC have been under pressure to authorize the additional shots after the White House announced plans in August for a widespread booster campaign. 
Other countries such as Israel have begun offering boosters to a broad population, but it is not yet known whether the United States will follow suit.

In the U.S. breakeven rates rose to their highest since 2012, while in Britain a record proportion -- 48% -- of the British public thinks inflation will accelerate over the next 12 months, according to data, amid ongoing energy price spikes and disruption in the supply chain.
But if the potential for self-fulfilling price rises is troubling the world's central banks as they look for ways to tame inflation without choking off economic growth, financial markets appear to be taking it all in their stride.
The S&P clocked up a new record close on Thursday, while Asian stocks -- given a boost by indebted developer Evergrande making a surprise interest payment -- rallied on Friday.
World stocks are now up 4.6% in October and just 1% off record highs as investors shrug off the spectre of higher inflation and tighter monetary policy and instead cheer another round of forecast-busting corporate earnings.
On Friday, European stocks looked mix at the open and Wall Street futures traded slightly below their record high.
Flash purchasing managers index survey data for October for the euro zone, Britain and the United States and due later will be watched closely by investors as a gauge of economic health.
Oil prices dipped while 10-year U.S. Treasury yields flirted with 1.7%, the highest levels since May.
In company specific news, French carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) said its production losses in 2021 because of a global semiconductor chip shortage would be far larger than previously forecast but maintained its profit outlook. Drinks maker Remy Cointreau forecasted an ""exceptional"" current operating profit growth in the first half of its 2021/2022 fiscal year.
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Friday:
-Japan CPI
-Flash PMIs everywhere

While the developer does not have any more onshore or offshore bonds maturing this year, it still faces coupon payments on its offshore bonds totalling nearly $340 million between Nov. 1 and Dec. 28, on top of $195 million in outstanding missed payments.

1295,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2021 03:05AM ET</span>",Explainer-How China Evergrande's debt troubles pose a systemic risk,"By Clare Jim
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China Evergrande Group has supplied funds to pay interest on a dollar bond, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Friday, days before a deadline that would have seen the developer plunge into formal default.
News of the remittance will likely bring relief to investors and regulators worried about a default's wider fallout in global markets, adding to reassurance from Chinese officials who have said creditors' interests would be protected.
WHAT IS EVERGRANDE?
Chairman Hui Ka Yan founded Evergrande in Guangzhou in 1996. It is China's second-largest property developer, with $110 billion in sales last year, $355 billion in assets and more than 1,300 developments nationwide. It listed in Hong Kong in 2009.
Evergrande grew rapidly through a loan-supported land-buying spree and selling apartments quickly at low margins. It employed 163,119 staff as of June-end, its interim report showed.
Slowing growth has seen it branch into businesses such as insurance, bottled water, soccer and electric vehicles (EVs).
HOW DID CONCERNS ARISE OVER DEBT?
In September last year, a leaked letter showed Evergrande pleading for government support to approve a now-dropped backdoor stock market listing. Sources told Reuters the letter was authentic; Evergrande called it fake.
In June, Evergrande said it did not pay some commercial paper on time, and in July a court froze a $20 million bank deposit held by the firm at the bank's request.
The firm in late August said construction at some of its developments had halted due to missed payments to contractors and suppliers. It sought repayment extension for a trust loan in early September, sources told Reuters, and media reports said Evergrande would suspend interest payments due on loans to two banks that month.
Liabilities, including payables, totalled 1.97 trillion yuan ($306 billion) at end-June - equivalent to 2% of China's gross domestic product.
HOW HAS EVERGRANDE REDUCED DEBT?
Evergrande accelerated efforts to cut debt last year after regulators introduced caps on three debt ratios, dubbed the ""three red lines"". It has been aiming to meet those requirements by the end of 2022.
It offered steep discounts on residential developments to spur sales and sold the bulk of its commercial properties. Since the second half of 2020, it has had a $555 million secondary share sale and raised $1.8 billion by listing its property management unit, while its EV unit told a $3.4 billion stake.
On Sept. 14, it said asset and equity disposal plans had failed to make material progress.
WHAT'S THE RISK?
China's central bank said in 2018 companies including Evergrande might pose systemic risk to China's financial system.
The firm's liabilities involved as many as 128 banks and over 121 non-banking institutions, the leaked letter showed.
Late repayments could trigger cross-defaults as many financial institutions are exposed via direct loans and indirect holdings through different financial instruments.
OPERATIONS OUTSIDE MAINLAND CHINA?
In Hong Kong, Evergrande owns an office tower and residential development as well as two nearly completed residential developments, plus a vast undeveloped land parcel.
It has spent billions of dollars acquiring stakes in automobile technology developers, including Sweden's NEVS, the Netherlands' e-Traction and Britain's Protean. It also has joint ventures with Germany's Hofer and Sweden's Koenigsegg.
WHAT DO REGULATORS SAY ABOUT EVERGRANDE, PROPERTY?In comments reported by state media Xinhua and echoing words from the central bank, Vice Premier Liu He told a Beijing forum on Wednesday that the risks were controllable and that reasonable capital demand from property firms was being met.
The chairman of China's securities regulator, Yi Huiman, said the authorities would properly handle the default risks and look to curb excessive debt more broadly.
Central bank Governor Yi Gang said on Sunday the world's second-largest economy is ""doing well"" but faces challenges such as default risks for certain firms due to ""mismanagement.""
Yi said China will fully respect and protect the legal rights of Evergrande's creditors and asset owners, in line with ""repayment priorities"" laid out by China's laws.
WHAT'S NEXT FOR EVERGRANDE? 
Evergrande remitted $83.5 million to a trustee account at Citibank on Thursday, the source told Reuters, allowing it to pay all bondholders before the payment grace period ends on Saturday.
Still, the developer will need to make payments on a string of other bonds, with the next major deadline to avoid default only a week away and little known about whether it is in a position to pay those debts.

Evergrande missed coupon payments totalling nearly $280 million on its dollar bonds on Sept. 23, Sept. 29 and Oct. 11, beginning 30-day grace periods for each.
After a grace period ends, non-payment would result in formal default and trigger cross-default provisions for its other dollar bonds. Evergrande's next payment deadline is Oct. 29, with the expiration of the 30-day grace period on its Sept. 29 coupon.

1297,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2021 02:27AM ET</span>","Australia's central bank tells 'buy now, pay later' firms to drop surcharge ban","By Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia's central bank said buy now, pay later (BNPL) firms will no longer be able to prohibit merchants from passing on surcharges for their services, robbing the fast-growing sector of one of its key advantages.
Following a two-year review, the Reserve Bank of Australia said on Friday it was now engaging with Treasury on ""regulatory approaches"" to enforce its decision - a move fiercely opposed by the industry.
The central bank noted BNPL services tend to be quite expensive for merchants to accept and it ""has now concluded that there is a public interest case for BNPL providers to remove their no-surcharge rules.""
Australia is home to some of the world's biggest BNPL firms including Afterpay Ltd, which this year agreed to be bought by  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ) https://www.reuters.com/technology/square-buy-australias-afterpay-29-billion-2021-08-01 for $29 billion. Afterpay's shares were slightly lower in Friday trade while shares of rivals Zip Co Ltd and Sezzle Inc fell 1.8% and 0.7% respectively.
Analysts at Bernstein and UBS said the RBA's new position was likely to affect Afterpay the most, given its reliance on high merchant fees to fund its business model. UBS also said there was a ""strong risk"" that overseas regulators could impose similar restrictions on the BNPL industry.
Matthew Wilson, an analyst at Evans and Partners Ltd, said the changes would be a ""minor issue"" for Afterpay because its platform was already entrenched in Australia and valued among merchants.
Afterpay said such changes were not expected to have a material impact, but that any reform should be subject to ""policy processes"" of government and parliament.
The RBA's move is a step in levelling the playing field with banks and credit card providers, who cannot ban merchants from passing on their fees to customers.
However, the BNPL sector is still not bound by Australia's credit or responsible lending laws, primarily because it does not charge interest. 
A 2019 survey conducted by the RBA found about half of BNPL users would switch to an alternative payment method if faced with a hypothetical surcharge on BNPL payments.
Zip Co said it recognised ""the RBA's new position on surcharging and will engage with Treasury on what this may entail"".
The RBA also said it would force eight banks and debit card issuers with about A$4 billion in annual debit transactions to give merchants a multiple network option that would allow payments to be processed more cheaply.

A multiple network option allows businesses to choose cheaper domestic systems instead of the prevalent but more expensive  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V) and Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) networks.
Other changes include requiring offshore firms to publish interchange fees on transactions on foreign-issued cards on their websites ""which will be a low-cost way of shining a light on these relatively high fees,"" its 108-page report https://www.rba.gov.au/payments-and-infrastructure/review-of-retail-payments-regulation/conclusions-paper-202110/pdf/review-of-retail-payments-regulation-conclusions-paper-202110.pdf said.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open higher Friday, helped by gains in Asia on reports that embattled property group China  Evergrande  was set to pay interest on a dollar bond, just in time to avoid a formal default.
At 2:10 AM ET (0610 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded largely flat, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.5% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.3%.
China Evergrande Group (HK:3333) remitted $83.5 million in coupon payments to a trustee account at Citibank on Thursday, according to a report from Reuters, meaning the deeply indebted company will be able to pay interest to all bondholders before the expiry of a 30-day grace period on Oct. 23.
Back in Europe, U.K. retail sales fell by 0.2% on the month in September, dropping 1.3% on the year, a weaker result than expected, with the country seeing a surging number of Covid infections, including a slowly increasing number of hospitalizations and deaths.
Also of interest later Friday will be the release of October PMI data for Germany, France, the U.K. and the European Union.
In the corporate sector,  Renault  (PA:RENA) will be in the spotlight after the French auto giant warned that its production losses in 2021 because of a global semiconductor chip shortage would be far larger than previously forecast.
Evidence of the difficulties facing the semiconductor sector came from U.S. company Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) late Thursday, when it issued a weaker than expected sales report late Thursday citing an industry-wide chip shortage for its revenue miss.
On the flip side,  Remy Cointreau  's (PA:RCOP) sales rose by a stronger-than-expected 23.7% in the second quarter, boosted by strong demand for its premium cognac in the United States, China and Europe. 
Late Thursday, L'Oreal posted better-than-expected third-quarter revenue growth, with the world’s largest cosmetics company boosted by continued strong demand from Chinese consumers.
Crude prices edged lower Friday, continuing the previous session’s selling after Russian President Vladimir Putin indicated that a group of top producers, known as OPEC+, could increase supply by more than had previously been announced.
Still, these comments came after oil rallied to the highest level since 2014 earlier this week as a global energy crunch, prompted by coal and gas shortages in China, India and Europe, led to power providers switching to diesel and fuel oil. This has coincided with a broader economic recovery from the pandemic. 
By 2:10 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% lower at $81.81 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.9% to $83.86.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.4% to $1,788.35/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1625.

1300,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2021 01:16AM ET</span>",Haynesville assets hit the block as natural gas prices rally,"By Jessica Resnick-Ault
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Private equity firms are looking to sell companies and land they own in the second-largest U.S. natural gas producing formation, where values have surged along with gas prices worldwide and booming U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG). 
So far this year, the Haynesville formation in Northwest Louisiana and East Texas has had four deals totaling $1.65 billion, according to Andrew Dittmar, director at Enverus. Next month, the Haynesville is expected to produce a record 13.6 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd), about 15% of U.S. shale gas output.
U.S. gas futures recently touched 12-year highs, and prices have skyrocketed even more in Europe and Asia, where buyers are desperate to lock down supply to deal with growing needs for power. 
Smaller firms see the natural gas rally as a chance to divest assets they have held for three years or more. There are several big transactions in the offing, each estimated at over $1.5 to $3 billion, as well as buyers looking to purchase smaller assets from individual holders, according to advisors. 
The sellers include private equity companies that held off from selling when prices plunged last year early in the coronavirus pandemic. 
""They were planning a 2020 exit three years before and then 2020 just didn't materialize,"" said Brock Hudson (NYSE:HUD), managing director at Carl Marks Advisors, an investment bank that provides financial and operational advisory services. 
Gas futures have rallied this year, touching a high of $6.280 last month, more than twice the seasonally-adjusted 10-year average of $3.0141. 
There is additional space on pipelines from the Haynesville to export hubs on the Gulf Coast including Sabine Pass, Louisiana, and Freeport, Texas. By comparison, lines running from the Marcellus shale in Pennsylvania are near capacity. The United States now exports roughly 10 billion cubic feet of gas daily as LNG, with several companies expected to add more space in coming months and years.
Haynesville producer Rockcliff Energy, a private-equity backed firm with over 1 bcfd of production, is expected to go on the block by the end of this year, according to people familiar with the company. 
Rockcliff offered high-yield debt last month, a move some companies have taken to improve balance sheets before pursuing strategic options, such as a sale of the company. Rockcliff did not respond to requests for comment. 
Reuters previously reported that Haynesville producers such as GeoSouthern are already on the block.
Dollar-per-acre values have risen substantially, said Dittmar at Enverus. Comstock bought Haynesville producer Covey Park in 2019 at $3,000 per acre adjusted for production. This year, two deals were valued at nearly four times as much per acre. 
Companies eager to produce gas as a cleaner alternative to oil, like  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX), have also expressed interest in the Haynesville.
Buyers have turned to the Haynesville as acreage deals became harder to come by in the Permian basin of Texas and New Mexico, said Ben Heinzelmann, president at Energy Domain, a marketplace for sellers to market their mineral, royalty, and non-operated working interests.   

Gas exporters like Tellurian (NASDAQ:TELL) Inc say they are among the potential buyers for gas assets coming to market. The company is boosting gas production in the Haynesville ahead of plans to start construction on its Driftwood LNG export plant in Louisiana in March 2022. 
""We are aggressively pursuing upstream acquisitions,"" said Charif Souki, co-founder and executive chairman of U.S. LNG developer Tellurian. ""There are plenty of targets in the Haynesville that make sense.""

Amazon has been locked in a tussle https://www.reuters.com/technology/singapore-arbitration-panel-says-indias-future-retail-is-party-dispute-with-2021-10-20 with Future and accuses it of breaking contracts when it sold its retail assets to Indian market leader Reliance last year. Future denies any wrongdoing.
After the Singapore arbitrator put the deal on hold in October 2020 in an interim decision, Future had appealed to revoke it. The panel has rejected that application, Future said in a statement to Indian stock exchanges on Friday. 
""The arbitration tribunal has passed a decision dismissing the application to vacate the interim award,"" Future's statement said. ""The Company would be deciding on its future course of action based on the legal advice and available remedies in law.""
The dispute started after Future, India's second-largest retailer with over 1,700 stores, entered into a deal last year to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and certain other businesses to Reliance, after COVID-19 hit its operations hard.

Amazon had its sights on ultimately owning some of Future's retail assets itself. It has argued a 2019 deal it had with a Future unit contained clauses prohibiting the Indian group from selling its retail assets to anyone on a ""restricted persons"" list that included Reliance.
Amazon brought proceedings against Future before a Singapore arbitration panel, and the dispute is also being fought in various Indian legal forums.

Investing.com – China  Evergrande  Group (HK:3333) has reportedly provided the funds to pay interest on a dollar bond, just in time to meet the deadline and avoid a formal default.
The developer’s Hong Kong shares rose 4.26% to HK$2.69 ($0.35) by 12:17 AM ET (4:17 AM GMT), after jumping as much as 7.8% earlier in the session.
The news, reported by Reuters, corroborated a Securities Times story that stated that China Evergrande remitted $83.5 million in coupon payments to a trustee account at Citibank on Thursday. The remittance means that the company will be able to pay out to all bondholders before the expiry of a 30-day grace period on Oct. 23.
Investors breathed a sigh of relief as the payment averts a default and the ensuing contagion.
""They seem to be avoiding short-term default and it's a bit of a relief that they have managed to find liquidity,"" a Hong Kong-based restructuring lawyer representing some bondholders told Reuters.
However, China Evergrande still has to make good on coupon payments totaling nearly $280 million on its dollar bonds on Sep. 23, Sep. 29 and Oct. 11.
""China Evergrande does need to restructure its debt. This payment might be a way for them to get some sort of buy-in with stakeholders before the heavy work needed on the restructuring,” said the lawyer.
The next payment deadline is on Oct. 29, as the 30-day grace period on the Sep. 29 coupon expires.
However, to other investors, the news was a positive surprise considering that a default had been widely expected.
“There are many coupon payments due ahead. If China Evergrande pays this time, I don't see why it won't pay the next time,"" GaoTeng Global Asset Management Ltd portfolio manager James Wong told Reuters."

Ping An Bank's outstanding special-mention loans - debts that could potentially turn sour - rose by 37.3% in the third quarter from the end of 2020, while outstanding loans and interests overdue within 90 days increased 32.5%, according to the bank's earnings report released on Wednesday. 
""A major client, which is Baoneng, has led to the increases of the indicators (of special-mention and overdue loans),"" Guo Shibang, Vice President of Ping An Bank, told investors and journalists on Thursday.
The bank had been aware of the risks of Baoneng from the beginning of the year and had made provisions to prepare for any default of the loans, which have enough collateral of properties in Shenzhen and Hangzhou, Guo added. 
The ultimate risk of Baoneng would be controllable and the quality of the bank's loans in the property sector overall is still good, he said. 

Baoneng was famous for launching a hostile, highly leveraged takeover bid in 2015 for what was then the biggest publicly traded developer, China Vanke Co Ltd. The attempt failed after Shenzhen Metro became Venke's biggest shareholder, diluting the holdings of Baoneng. 
Guo also said Ping An Bank could collect back all the principal and part of the interest of the loans to HNA Group under its current restructuring plan.

1305,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 21, 2021 11:45PM ET</span>","Evergrande Repayment Lifts Chinese Developers, Asia Junk Bonds","(Bloomberg) -- A relief rally boosted risk-sensitive assets including Chinese developers, junk bonds and the Australian dollar after China Evergrande Group paid interest on one of its dollar bonds. 
The Shanghai Stock Exchange Property Index climbed as much as 4.6%, while high-yield dollar bonds rose three cents on the dollar. Leveraged funds bought the Aussie on the repayment report, a trader said, though the currency later pared gains. 
The repayment helps soothe concerns that the world’s most indebted developer is heading to a default after a plan to sell a stake in a unit collapsed this week. Contagion fears had gripped traders across markets, even as Chinese policyholders said the crisis will be contained and acted to ease pressure on other real estate companies.  
“Evergrande’s debt pile is massive, and while the bond payment is anecdotally positive, it’s still only a tiny portion of what’s due over time,” said Derek Tay, head of investments at Kamet Capital Partners Pte. “Its debt woes will still linger especially since its asset sales efforts to raise funds or deleverage haven’t been quite successful.”
 
Real estate companies in China were also lifted by comments Thursday from the nation’s banking regulator calling for support for first-home purchases. The sector’s rally could extend into November, rising by another 10% to 15%, according to  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). analysts including Griffin Chan.
Seazen Holdings Co. jumped by a 10% limit in Shanghai, while China Resources Land Ltd. advanced 7.5% to be one of the top contributors on Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index.

However, real estate is after all, not an area to expect high growth in the years to come.”
High-yield junk bonds in the region gained, according to credit traders. In China, they rose as much as 3 cents on the dollar, leaving them up about 4.5 cents this week, which would be the biggest weekly gain since 2012.

Evergrande transferred an $83.5 million coupon payment within the 30-day grace period, the paper reported, citing “relevant channels”. The bond had been trading as low as 23 cents on the dollar on expectations of a looming default after the company missed the initial payment due Sept. 23.
Evergrande’s stock jumped as much as 7.8% in Hong Kong to HK$2.78, paring this year’s loss to 82%. The firm’s 8.25% note maturing in March jumped 1.3 cents on the dollar to 25.7 cents as of 10:31 a.m.
The payment offers some temporary relief for Evergrande, giving it more time to sell assets and raise cash to pay creditors and suppliers. The reprieve may be short-lived however, with more than $300 billion in liabilities still to be paid, analysts said. 
“We have seen this before - one bond repayment does not solve the company’s problem and does not change the fact that it is the living dead,” said Justin Tang, head of Asian research at United First Partners in Singapore.
China’s banking regulator meanwhile dismissed concerns that the crisis enveloping Evergrande will have any major impact on the the sector as a whole, even as shares of the developer nosedived on Thursday.
Evergrande is an “individual” case, Liu Zhongrui, an official at the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, said at a briefing in Beijing.

Offshore Creditors May Seek Talks After Grace Period (1:20 p.m. NY)
Offshore creditors to Evergrande may seek a standstill and debt talks with the firm if it fails to make an interest payment by a Saturday grace period deadline, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
Bondholders, some of whom are getting advice from Kirkland & Ellis and Moelis (NYSE:MC) & Co., aren’t planning to demand immediate repayment after the deadline in hopes that the company will come to the table to discuss options for the missed payment, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential matters.
Evergrande has now met the deadline, according to a report in the Securities Times.
Hopson: Evergrande’s Requests to Change Terms Unacceptable (Noon NY)
Hopson Development says Evergrande requested substantial changes to an agreement on the sale of a stake in its property-management arm after it was signed, including terms of payment, according to a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange.
China Vows to Keep Property Curbs; Evergrande Risk Limited (4:25 p.m. HK)
China’s banking regulator vowed to keep its curbs on the nation’s property market, dismissing concerns that the crisis enveloping Evergrande will have any major impact on the credit profile of the sector as a whole.
The property controls have achieved good results and the government will refrain from using the real estate sector as a short-term economic stimulus measure, Liu Zhongrui, an official at the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, said at a briefing in Beijing on Thursday. Evergrande is an “individual” case and won’t hurt the overall credibility of Chinese firms, which is backed by the country’s economic stability, he said.
China Property Purge Hammers Weak Players While the Strong Gain (4:07 p.m. HK)
China’s property sector is undergoing its biggest credit-market shakeout in years as policy makers try to clamp down on over-indebted developers without infecting their healthier rivals.
Companies with the worst balance sheets are getting crushed by a spike in borrowing costs, a phenomenon that’s intensifying this month as bills come due. At least three Chinese developers have defaulted in October, one may struggle to pay interest due Friday and another failed to get a three-month extension for a note maturing Monday. 
Evergrande Secures Extension on Jumbo Fortune Bond: REDD (1:15 p.m. HK)
Evergrande has secured agreement for an extension of more than three months on a $260 million bond issued by Jumbo Fortune and guaranteed by the developer, according to a REDD report citing two sources briefed by the bondholders. The agreement was reached earlier this week after Evergrande agreed to provide extra collateral and the developer will seek the Guangdong government’s opinion before making the delayed dollar coupon payments, the report said without identifying the source of the information.

1307,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2021 11:11PM ET</span>","Huawei, SMIC suppliers received billions worth of licenses for U.S. goods -documents","By Karen Freifeld and Alexandra Alper
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Suppliers to Chinese telecoms giant Huawei and China's top chipmaker SMIC got billions of dollars worth of licenses from November through April to sell them goods and technology despite their being on a U.S. trade blacklist, documents released by Congress showed on Thursday.
According to the documents, first obtained by Reuters, 113 export licenses worth $61 billion were approved for suppliers to ship products to Huawei while another 188 licenses valued at nearly $42 billion were greenlighted for Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC).
The data also showed that more than 9 out of 10 license applications were granted to SMIC suppliers while 69% of requests to ship to Huawei were approved over the same period. 
The U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs committee on Thursday voted to grant a request by its top Republican member Michael McCaul to release the licensing data, which it received from the Commerce Department in May.
The numbers enraged China hawks in Washington, who have made a concerted effort to deprive Chinese companies of access to advanced U.S. technology.
Republican senator Marco Rubio told Reuters he thinks President Joe Biden needs to explain why the companies have continued to receive ""waivers.""
""It is just another example of President Biden not taking the economic and security threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party seriously,"" he said.
McCaul said in a statement that ""It's clearly in our national interest to increase transparency and public scrutiny on how our nation transfers its technology to an adversary,"" 
""ARBITRARY SNAPSHOT""
However, the Commerce Department said that the release of an ""arbitrary snapshot"" of license approvals ""risks politicizing the licensing process and misrepresenting the national security determinations"" made by the government.
It also stressed that approved license applications do not represent actual shipments and around half of all licenses are used. It added that license applications involving Huawei and SMIC are processed under policies developed by the Trump administration and maintained by the Biden administration.
A former senior Commerce Department official in the Trump administration who declined to be named echoed the agency's view. 
""This very small period of license activity is not an accurate window into the Huawei and SMIC license process,"" he said, noting that the goal of preventing the companies from obtaining leading edge technology without unnecessarily harming U.S. exports of other goods had been successful. ""This [document release] seems designed to mislead people and generate headlines,"" he added. 
Huawei declined to comment, while SMIC did not respond to a request for comment. 
Huawei was placed on a trade blacklist in May 2019 over national security concerns, forcing its U.S. suppliers and others to obtain a special license to ship goods to it. SMIC was added to the so-called entity list in December 2020, over fears it could divert advanced technology to military users. 
A majority of the licenses granted did not authorize shipments of sensitive items. Of the 113 licenses approved for Huawei during the period, 80 were for non-sensitive goods that only required a license because the recipient was blacklisted. For SMIC, the figure was 121 of 188.

Licenses are generally good for four years.
Reuters reported earlier this year that, during the Trump administration, $87 billion worth of licenses https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-huawei-tech/biden-administration-adds-new-limits-on-huaweis-suppliers-idUSKBN2B3336 for Huawei were approved after it was blacklisted.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Pentagon's hypersonic weapon programs suffered a setback on Thursday when a booster rocket carrying a hypersonic weapon failed, people briefed on the test result said.
The test was intended to validate aspects of one of the Pentagon's hypersonic glide vehicles in development, two of the people said. 
Hypersonic glide vehicles are launched from a rocket in the upper atmosphere before gliding to a target at speeds of more than five times the speed of sound, or about 3,853 miles (6,200 kilometers) per hour.
In a separate series of tests conducted on Wednesday, the U.S. Navy and Army tested hypersonic weapon component prototypes. That test successfully ""demonstrated advanced hypersonic technologies, capabilities, and prototype systems in a realistic operating environment,"" the Pentagon said in a statement.
The United States and its global rivals have quickened their pace to build hypersonic weapons - the next generation of arms that rob adversaries of reaction time and traditional defeat mechanisms.
U.S. President Joe Biden expressed concern on Wednesday about Chinese hypersonic missiles, days after a media report that Beijing had tested a nuclear-capable hypersonic glide weapon.

Glide bodies are different from their air-breathing hypersonic weapon cousins which use scramjet engine technology and the vehicle's high speed to forcibly compress incoming air before combustion to enable sustained flight at hypersonic speeds. An air-breathing hypersonic weapon was successfully tested in September.
Companies such as  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) are working to develop the hypersonic weapon capability for the United States.

The Japanese carmaker has informed suppliers that it will build a total of 583,000 cars during the two-month period, the Nikkei said, without saying where it obtained the information.
""We acknowledge that the semiconductor supply shortage is still in a difficult situation,"" a spokesperson from Nissan said, although she declined to comment on the reduction reported by the newspaper. The company will give an update when it release its latest earnings results next month, she added. 

Like other carmakers, Nissan has been forced to curtail production despite a rebound in demand in key auto markets, including China and the United States. The pandemic has both squeezed output at component suppliers and stoked demand for electronic devices that has intensified competition for chips.
 Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, the world's biggest car manufacturer, this month announced a 15% cut in November output, following reduced global production in September and October, due to a slowdown at component plants in Malaysia and Vietnam.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Friday morning, with China  Evergrande  Group (HK:3333) reportedly making funds available ahead of its looming payment deadline.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.70% by 9:59 PM ET (1:59 AM GMT). Data released earlier in the day showed that the national core consumer price index (CPI) grew 0.1% year-on-year in September. The national CPI grew 0.4% month-on-month and 0.2% year-on-year.
The data also showed that the manufacturing purchasing manager’s index (PMI) was 53 in October.
South Korea’s KOSPI inched up 0.05% while in Australia, the ASX 200 edged down 0.14%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.21%.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched up 0.03% while the Shenzhen Component was up 0.24%, with the deadline for China Evergrande to pay an $83.5 million bond coupon coming up this weekend. The developer made funds available for a bond coupon due Sep. 23 to a trustee account on Thursday ahead of the expiration of a 30-day grace period for the payment, according to Reuters.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Reserve is moving closer to beginning asset tapering, with bets on whether this will be followed by interest rate hikes also increasing. In Asia Pacific, the Reserve Bank of Australia bought bonds to defend its yield target.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will take part in a policy panel discussion later in the day, and investors will be paying attention to his comments.
Global shares are set for a third weekly advance, with the ongoing economic recovery from COVID-19 providing a boost. However, potentially fast-than-expected asset tapering to curb inflationary pressures as a global energy crunch and supply chain bottlenecks continue could slow the pace of the rally.
“The U.S. economy is still on solid footing, but now inflation remains the biggest threat,” Oanda Corp. senior market analyst Edward Moya said in a note, which added that investors are waiting for more earnings reports as well as the final shape of U.S. President Joe Biden’s economic agenda.
Congressional Democrats have failed to reach consensus over both the tax and spending sides of a bill to enact the majority of Biden’s agenda. The ability to strike a deal as the week closes is also now in question, with Biden himself telling CNN that he does not expect Congress to pass an increase in corporate tax rates."
1311,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2021 08:57PM ET</span>","Low global copper supply imperils climate goals, Freeport CEO says","(Reuters) -Low global supplies of copper - a key metal used in wiring, electric vehicles and other electronics - will crimp global climate ambitions unless regulators green light more mines, the chief executive of Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) Inc said on Thursday. 
The warning comes as global leaders plan to discuss climate mitigation efforts later this month at the COP26 conference https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/cop26-glasgow-who-is-going-who-is-not-2021-10-15, even as some host communities and environmentalists increasingly oppose new mines for so-called strategic metals.
""There's going to be a time when the world is going to be very short of copper,"" Freeport CEO Richard Adkerson told investors after the company posted better-than-expected quarterly results. ""Supply is a real issue for this industry.""
In an early warning sign, stockpiles of available copper https://www.reuters.com/article/global-metals-idUKL1N2RF0H7 in the London Metal Exchange's global warehouse system fell last week to levels not seen for more than 25 years https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/london-metal-exchange-has-restrain-disorderly-copper-andy-home-2021-10-21.
Governments in Peru and Chile https://www.reuters.com/business/freeport-ceo-encouraged-after-talk-with-perus-castillo-2021-10-08 - the world's two largest copper producers - have recently threatened to increase mining taxes and regulations. 
U.S. President Joe Biden's administration on Wednesday took steps to block https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/blow-twin-metals-us-proposes-mining-ban-boundary-waters-2021-10-20a Minnesota copper mine from  Antofagasta  (LON:ANTO) Plc, the latest in a string of mining projects his administration https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/biden-looks-abroad-electric-vehicle-metals-blow-us-miners-2021-05-25 has moved against. 
Adkerson, who also chairs a global mining industry trade group, described the political situation in Washington as a ""head-scratcher.""
Biden officials understand the importance of copper to climate goals, Adkerson said, but are not likely to lessen mine permitting standards ""because that just runs against the grain of their political situation.""
Copper prices https://www.reuters.com/article/global-metals-idUKL1N2RF0H7 meanwhile are up 10% this month due to that low supply, with analysts expecting demand will increase alongside the global economy.
RISING COSTS
Freeport itself is not immune to that price rise. The Phoenix-based company aims to switch its truck fleet from diesel power to either electric or hydrogen. Adkerson said the move will ""involve a lot of cost.""
He said the switch was essential for the industry to show it is serious about fighting climate change via its own operations, which will soon include recycling operations in Spain. Freeport is also studying ways to leach copper out of waste rock piles stored at its mine sites across the globe, Adkerson said.
""The world needs more copper. And yet, more copper, until technology breaks through, is going to result in more carbon emissions,"" he said.
Freeport's average realized price for a pound of copper rose about 40% during the third quarter, while production of the metal increased about 17% to 987 million recoverable pounds.
The company's adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders was $1.3 billion, or 89 cents per share, compared with $430 million, or 29 cents per share, a year earlier.

Analysts on average had estimated a profit of 81 cents per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Shares of Freeport fell about 2% on Thursday afternoon as copper prices pulled back from their recent gains. The company's stock has more than doubled in the past year.

1312,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2021 08:26PM ET</span>",Analysis-A court battle raises the question - how far will Japan swallow poison pills?,"By Makiko Yamazaki
TOKYO (Reuters) - The fate of future hostile takeover bids in Japan could rest on an upcoming court ruling that will decide whether the country's top maker of newspaper printing presses can move forward with a poison pill against an unwelcome shareholder.
At issue is whether 105-year-old Tokyo Kikai Seisakusho Ltd will be allowed to not count votes from Asia Development Capital (ADC) - an investment firm that built up most of its 40% stake in a matter of weeks - when shareholders vote on issuing new stock that would dilute ADC's ownership.
A holding of more than 33% in Japan gives the stakeholder veto rights over important board decisions and sometimes de facto control.
ADC has sought an injunction and the Tokyo District Court's ruling - the first one to look at an attempt to exclude an investor from a shareholder vote on a poison pill - is expected sometime in the next week. A victory for Tokyo Kikai holds the potential to make it much easier for other Japanese companies to use poison pills. 
Tokyo Kikai, which has said ADC hurts its corporate value, will put the poison pill plan to a shareholder vote at an extraordinary general meeting on Friday.
The battle highlights both a rise in hostile takeovers in Japan over the past few years as the practice - once considered the domain of unscrupulous corporate raiders - loses its stigma as well as what some experts see as inadequate Japanese takeover rules that leave companies, small ones especially, too defenceless.
It also comes at a time when investors are watching to see if a drive by Japan's new prime minister, Fumio Kishida, to roll back some of the pro-market policies of former premier Shinzo Abe will impact corporate governance.
Corporate governance experts say it is too difficult to call which way the court might rule.
On one hand, ADC's argument that a ruling in Tokyo Kikai's favour would fly in the face of shareholder equality is a strong one as the principle is enshrined in Japanese corporate law, they say.
""If a target company can select who is allowed to vote on a poison pill, it will come up with all kinds of excuses to create a list of eligible shareholders who have the best chance of passing the pill,"" said Takumi Watanabe, executive officer at proxy advisory firm QuestHub.
But governance experts add the court might decide that ADC counts as an ""abusive buyer"" that could threaten the rights of minority shareholders, having rapidly built up its stake and not presented the company or other shareholders with a new management plan.
IT WOULDN'T HAPPEN OVERSEAS
Nearly a decade ago, more than 500 Japanese firms had a permanent poison pill, typically part of their company's articles of incorporation. But the practice - oft criticised for entrenching bad management - fell out of favour after corporate governance reforms pushed by Abe required institutional investors to disclose how they voted on agenda items at shareholder meetings, including poison pills. 
A poison pill that targets a specific bidder - called an emergency poison pill in Japan - was first successfully employed last year by Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Machine, renamed Shibaura Machine, in its fight against prominent activist investor Yoshiaki Murakami.
Since then at least five other firms including Tokyo Kikai have either introduced them or sought to introduce them. Among them, Shinsei Bank plans to seek shareholder approval https://www.reuters.com/business/shinsei-bank-plans-poison-pill-defence-against-sbis-11-bln-bid-sources-2021-09-17 for a poison pill to thwart online financial conglomerate SBI Holdings' $1.1 billion bid. 
Experts say the current wave of poison pill activity underscores a lack of clarity over what Japanese companies can do to block takeover bids.
""Right now, officials at companies are scratching their heads over what's allowed or not,"" said Atsuko Furuta, director at investor relations consulting firm IR Japan.
They note Japanese small cap firms are particularly vulnerable to aggressive stake-building from unwelcome stakeholders. Tokyo Kikai, for example, has a market value of just 15 billion yen ($130 million).
Unlike the United States, Japanese company boards cannot swiftly adopt a poison pill to ward off a hostile suitor. Though not explicitly written in law, court precedents have led them to believe they must seek shareholder approval before adopting a poison pill - a time-consuming process.
In Europe, tender offers are usually mandatory for acquisitions of stakes beyond a certain threshold - 30% in the UK - a rule that would prevent cases like Tokyo Kikai's.
Wataru Tanaka, a corporate law professor at the University of Tokyo, believes the government should prioritise fixing the country's takeover rules.

""Poison pills are a second-best solution,"" he said.

(Reuters) -Western Digital Corp's talks to merge with Japanese chipmaker Kioxia Holdings Corp have stalled, according to two people familiar with the matter, highlighting challenges in completing deals in the evolving semiconductor sector.
The talks reached a standstill in recent weeks over a series issues, including valuation discrepancies, uncertainty over securing approval from the Japanese government and an ongoing strategic review at Kioxia shareholder Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp, the people said.
 Western Digital  (NASDAQ:WDC) is still keen to persue the deal with the right conditions, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss private matters.
A Kioxia spokesperson said the company did not comment on speculation, while Western Digital was not immediately available for comment.
Earlier in August, media outlets including Reuters reported that Western Digital was in advanced talks for a possible $20 billion stock merger with Kioxia, in a move that would create a NAND memory giant to rival Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF).
Kioxia, sold by Toshiba in 2018 to a consortium led by Bain Capital, shelved plans for an initial public offering last year after U.S.-China trade tensions slammed Huawei, one of Kioxia's biggest clients. 
The spokesperson for Kioxia said the company it is still considering the appropriate timing for an IPO. A public market listing, if happens, will likely be next year, sources said. 
Kioxia's business has benefited from pandemic-fuelled purchases of electronic devices and longer-term demand for new chip technology, including 5G connectivity. 
A combined Kioxia-Western Digital would control a third of the NAND flash market, putting it on par with South Korea’s Samsung (KS:005930) Electronics.

Any tie-up between the Japanese and U.S. companies should ensure critical operations are split equally between the two countries, a senior member of Japan’s ruling party told Reuters last month. 
The Wall Street Journal first reported the stalled talks earlier on Thursday.

The company posted third-quarter net profit of 760.6 million pesos ($36.8 million) compared with 3.350 billion pesos in the same period last year, falling short of a  Barclays  (LON:BARC) estimate of 933 million pesos.
Televisa said its bottom line took a hit from the Mexican peso's 3.7% depreciation versus the U.S. dollar during the quarter.
Revenue grew 9.1% to 26.128 billion pesos, from 23.943 billion pesos in the year-earlier period. That was above a Barclays prediction of 24.5 billion pesos. 
Televisa operates several television channels along with other media including a cable broadband and direct-to-home satellite pay television. In recent years it has been under pressure to meet the challenge of streaming services which have drawn away viewers. 
However, advertising revenues jumped in the quarter, up 25% over the previous three month period, and 16% over the same period in 2020, led by a recovery in private sector advertising spending. 
To battle rivals such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Televisa and leading U.S. Spanish-language broadcaster Univision announced in April they would merge content through the creation of a new Spanish language media company, in which Televisa will be the largest shareholder. 
The new firm, called Televisa Univision, will launch a global streaming platform with content from both. 
Mexico's telecommunications regulator, IFT, last month authorized the tie-up. The transaction is expected to close this year, Televisa said.
In September, Televisa said the sale of its 40% stake in Ocesa Entertainment to U.S. firm Live Nation would move forward, a move that would support Televisa's deleveraging efforts, according to S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings.

WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Two major U.S. airlines and the White House said they do not think the Biden administration's executive order mandating federal contractors require employee vaccinations by Dec. 8 will impact holiday travel or result in employees leaving.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) announced earlier this month they would comply with the mandate that employees be vaccinated by Dec. 8 unless they receive a religious or medical exemption.
Some airlines and industry-watchers had initially feared an exodus of unvaccinated airline or government employees involved in travel just before the Christmas season but airlines later said that would not happen and cited comments from the White House this week.
Southwest Airlines Chief Executive Gary Kelly said on Thursday: ""We are not on a campaign here to force everybody to get vaccinated ... We want our employees to know that nobody is going to lose their job on December 9 if we're not perfectly in compliance.""
He added: ""We're not going to fire anybody who doesn't get vaccinated."" He said the vaccination issue will not disrupt travel.
White House COVID-19 coordinator Jeff Zients on Wednesday told reporters the vaccine requirements for federal employees and federal contractors would not impact holiday travel.
""Vaccination requirements will not impact holiday travel,"" Zients said.
Some lawmakers including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer have raised concerns about the impact on the Transportation Security Administration and travel.
""The requirements for federal workers and contractors will not cause disruptions to government services that people depend on. Agencies have the flexibility necessary to enforce the mandate without impacting critical operations,"" Zients said. 
Zients added, ""the point here is to get people vaccinated, not to punish them. So agencies will not be removing employees from federal service until after they've gone through a process of education and counseling.""
American Airlines Chief Executive Doug Parker said on an earnings call on Thursday he does not expect any employees to leave as a result of the vaccine mandate.
""We think we're not going to see anyone leaving American. I don't think anyone's going to want to leave American because either they choose not to get vaccinated or they don't have a religious or medical (exemption),"" Parker said.
Parker said the airline is ""highly confident"" it will have everyone needed to fly its holiday schedule even if some unvaccinated employees with approved exemptions face new testing requirements.
""We don't anticipate any operational impact,"" Parker said.
The Cargo Airline Association, a group representing FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX),  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) and other cargo carriers, said in letter to the White House on Monday that ""it will be virtually impossible to have 100% of our respective work forces vaccinated by Dec. 8 ... Sliding this date into the first half of 2022 will allow association members to meet the demands of the e-commerce revolution during the holiday season.""

(Reuters) -Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc beat estimates for quarterly same-store sales on Thursday, as customers returned to eating inside restaurants and paid more than ever for a new meat - smoked brisket - and other menu items.
The burrito and bowl chain has raised regular menu prices twice and its delivery prices three times since August 2020. Prices are now about 10% higher - which includes a total 17% hike in items for delivery - to offset rising beef, freight and labor costs.
CEO Brian Niccol told Reuters that customers can still get a lot of value out of a Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) meal, noting that its chicken burrito is still priced under $8 in many places.
""Because we've got such a strong value proposition, we like to take things in phases to make sure that the pricing we're taking is balanced with the growth that we're experiencing and that the cost is really not a transitory cost but a new, permanent cost,"" he said.
Overall, fast-food chains have raised menu prices by 6.7% over the last 12 months, and other restaurants by 5.2%, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Oct. 13. 
Some of Chipotle's price hikes will roll off this quarter and customers have not resisted paying more for their quesadillas, Niccol said.
More customers are also coming to Chipotle restaurants as seating areas reopen, and the chain is still on track to build 200 new locations this year, he said. 
Chipotle's limited-time smoked brisket, which launched in September, costs $10.25 on average as an entree in restaurants, its most expensive new meat ever.
The fast-casual chain posted a 15.1% surge in comparable sales for the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with analysts' average estimate of 13.4% growth, according to Refinitiv data.
The company also forecast sales growth in the low to mid double-digits range in the current quarter, compared with estimates of 14% growth.
Americans who were cooking more in their kitchens during the pandemic-induced, work-from-home situation are now grabbing burritos and bowls on the way to work and social gatherings, and are trying new dishes.

Sales from digital orders - as opposed to those placed in person - grew 8.6% and accounted for 42.8% of sales.
Chipotle also said its board increased its share repurchase authorization by $100 million, with $209.8 million available to buy back shares as of Sept. 30.

1320,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2021 07:08PM ET</span>",Tech stampede as investors hunt Latin American unicorns,"By Carolina Mandl and Anirban Sen
(Reuters) - When Sebastian Kanovich co-founded Latin American digital payments startup dLocal in Montevideo in 2016, he struggled to get global retailers to take him seriously.
""It took us a lot of No's before getting the first Yes,"" he told Reuters. ""We were not only from Latin America, but from Uruguay, not known for technology.""
Five years on, it's a different story.
dLocal listed on the Nasdaq exchange in New York in June and is now worth $16 billion, thanks to partnerships with the likes of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Uber (NYSE:UBER) in 30 countries, and other Latino tech firms are riding the wave.
In the first nine months of 2021, Latino startups from Brazil's online lender Nubank to Colombian delivery firm Rappi raised $14.8 billion in new money, a jump of 174% since last year, data provided to Reuters by CBInsights showed.
The Latino boom has caught the eye of some of the biggest names in private equity and venture capital such as SoftBank Group Corp, General Atlantic and Sequoia Capital. Now Wall Street's banks are looking to tap into the gold rush by taking more Latino ""unicorns"" public in the United States.
At least 10 Latin American tech startups including Brazil's apartment rental service QuintoAndar as well as Mexico's used-car dealer Kavak and fintechs Clip and Creditas are preparing initial public offerings (IPOs) for next year, six people with knowledge of the deals told Reuters. 
All the sources requested anonymity as the discussions about the planned listings are confidential. 
Kavak, QuintoAndar and Clip declined to comment. Creditas said it could not share any information about an IPO at this time.
Nubank, which counts Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc as an investor, is aiming for a valuation above $55 billion in a U.S. IPO next year to become the region's most valuable financial institution, Reuters reported in August. 
Dealmaking boom in Latam https://graphics.reuters.com/LATAM-TECH/byprjrmeape/chart.png 
GLOBAL ASPIRATIONS
The rise of Latin American unicorns - private firms worth at least $1 billion - is being driven by a once-in-a-generation internet boom that has accelerated under pandemic lockdowns as more shoppers move online, bankers and deals lawyers say.
""Companies in the region have matured in the last five years and now we think there will likely be between two and three IPOs by Latam tech companies per quarter by next year,"" said Rodrigo Maldonado, executive director at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in Brazil, referring to U.S. listings. 
While Latin America still lags Asia, Europe and the United States in terms of volumes of tech startups, the widespread and increasing use of smartphones, wireless networks and payments cards has created a ready demand for new digital services.
Smartphone-savvy consumers in the region have become increasingly comfortable with digital wallets and even starting to make virtual doctor appointments with smartphone apps.
That's why venture capitalists are still minting tech unicorns in Latin America, and some more established startups are pushing ahead with U.S. listing plans despite the recent market sell-off that hit technology stocks.
""If you look at the pipeline from Latam now, it is pretty amazing what could come from the region - not only from Brazil, but also from countries like Mexico, Colombia, and Peru,"" said Alex Ibrahim, head of International Capital Markets at the New York Stock Exchange.
""And a number of those high-growth startups from those countries are betting on big global markets like the United States,"" he said.
Many stock markets in Latin America are dominated by more traditional companies such as banks and commodities players, which is pushing startups to look north for listings. Tech firms account for less than 10% of Brazil's benchmark Ibovespa index, for example, whereas they make up nearly a third of the S&P 500.
Gone are the days, though, when Latino startups were seen as a cheaper entry point for investors than U.S. ones. Most financing is now at valuations on a par with Silicon Valley rivals, investment bankers and venture capitalists told Reuters.
""I see multiples for startups in Brazil and Mexico as very similar to those elsewhere, (especially) if the company has global growth aspirations,"" said Martin Escobari, co-president at U.S. growth investor General Atlantic, which has a dozen Latin American startups in its portfolio. 
Latino unicorns https://graphics.reuters.com/LATAM-TECH/zdvxoorropx/chart.png 
There are still challenges for tech companies to overcome in the region, including a paucity of engineering talent. 
General Atlantic estimates Latin America's universities train 40,000 software developers a year, far below the 100,000 it estimates the fast-growing tech sector needs annually.
Other factors such political and economic instability are also making investors more cautious when looking for businesses they believe will be resilient.
The region has a history of going from boom to bust too, such as in 2014-15 when a number of large investors pulled back following an economic downturn that doomed the prospects of several fledgling tech ventures.
But deep-pocketed investors, such as SoftBank and Sequoia, are betting this time is different, and are poised to rake in big returns from some early bets. Eye-popping gains are, in turn, inspiring a new generation of tech founders and investors.
""Tech companies first emerged in the region roughly 20 years ago, but only now all the building blocks are in place: infrastructure, entrepreneurs, venture capital investors and capital markets,"" said General Atlantic's Escobari.
FINTECH FAVORED
Startups focused on financial technology, or fintech, are mopping up much of the funding with a 40% share of the overall pot in 2020, according to LAVCA, the association for private equity in Latin America. 
Many of them sell financial services to the ""unbanked"", or those unable to access traditional banking, and Brazil's Nubank, C6Bank, which is backed by JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), and SoftBank's Creditas have benefited most from the investor interest.
With fintech in vogue, non-financial startups such as Kavak and QuintoAndar have started offering financial services to consumers including car loans and insurance.
Sequoia has only made a half dozen Latin American investments - including Nubank and Rappi - but Sonya Huang, a partner at the venture capital firm, said it planned to back one or two companies a year, in sectors such as finance, e-commerce, health and education.
""The region is very different from the U.S. or Europe, but there are some big theses which have proved right globally - like digital or mobile-first banking - and they can be applied in the region,"" Huang told Reuters.
Japan's SoftBank renewed its bets on Latin America with a $3 billion fund last month, less than three years after launching its first regional fund. Since 2019, it has invested in roughly 50 Latino startups, said Alex Szapiro, SoftBank's head of Brazil and operating partner. 

""Now, capital is basically a commodity for the region.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global stock indexes mostly climbed and the S&P 500 posted a record closing high on Thursday, helped by gains in consumer discretionary and technology shares, while U.S. Treasury yields jumped.
The dollar also strengthened, boosted by better jobs and housing data, including data showing the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped last week to a 19-month low, pointing to a tighter labor market.

The union workers' activities were ""unwarranted, impermissible and unlawful,"" Marlita Grave, Chief District Judge of Iowa's Seventh Judicial District wrote in a Wednesday order.
While the injunction does not entirely forbid the strike, the judge limited the number of picketers to no more than four at each gate of the facility.
When asked for a comment, Brian Rothenberg, a spokesman for the UAW union that represents the workers, said the union does not discuss ongoing legal matters.
Deere in a statement said the injunction was put in place to provide safe entry and exit to the facility.
""Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) was granted (the order) to maintain a safe environment for all our employees and contractors – including those reporting to work and those exercising their right to strike,"" the company said in a statement.
The ruling is the latest step in a fight over pay, benefits and better working conditions, with Deere employees joining thousands of other U.S. workers who have gone on strike in recent months.

It also comes in the middle of the U.S. corn and soybean harvest season, at a time when farmers are struggling to find parts for tractors and combines.
Earlier this month, Deere and the UAW reached a six-year collective bargaining agreement after weeks of negotiation on wages and other benefits, but 90% of the union's workers voted against the deal.

1323,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2021 07:02PM ET</span>",Intel shares sink as third-quarter sales miss estimates,"By Stephen Nellis and Tiyashi Datta
(Reuters) - Shares of  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) sank on Thursday as the company reported third-quarter sales that missed expectations, with Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger telling Reuters that shortages of ancillary chips needed to make full computers are holding back sales of the company's flagship processor chips.
The company's leaders also said that margins will be lower for several years and that it will spend heavily to revamp its chip factories. Shares of Santa Clara, California-based Intel, the world's biggest maker of central processors at the heart of PCs and data center servers, fell 9% in extending trading.
Gelsinger said Intel has resolved shortages facing its own internal manufacturing operations, but that shortages of other chips such as power management chips and WiFi chips were stopping its customers from shipping PCs and servers, reducing the need for Intel's chips.
""That's a direct result of the overall supply challenges of the semiconductor industry,"" Gelsinger told Reuters in an interview.
Gelsinger's plan to remake the company by fixing its internal manufacturing issues while opening its doors to outside customers has largely gone over well with investors, with shares rising about 11% this year before Thursday's results.
Giving an unexpected long-range forecast on an investor call Thursday, Intel said that it expects at least $74 billion in revenue in 2022, higher than analyst estimates of $73 billion. But the company also plans to spend heavily, saying that capital expenditures could be $25 billion to $28 billion in 2022 and higher in subsequent years.
On an operational level, Intel said gross margins are likely to be between 51% and 53% in the next two to three years, below the 56.2% that analysts expect for 2021, according to Refinitiv data.
Meanwhile, rivals like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) who make faster chips by leveraging outside contract manufacturers are continuing to eat into Intel's market share.
Intel missed estimates for its data center segment, with sales of $6.5 billion compared with estimates of $6.6 billion, according to Refinitiv data. Gelsinger told Reuters some of the data center results were because of Chinese cloud computing vendors - major customers of Intel - adjusting to new rules from the Chinese government. 
Atlantic Equities analyst Ianjit Bhatti said the lower sales to cloud computing groups reflected market share gains by AMD. Shares of AMD and Nvidia were up slightly after Intel's results. 
Intel reported adjusted sales for the third-quarter ended Sept. 25 of $18.1 billion, missing estimates of $18.24 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Intel reported adjusted profits of $1.71 per share, compared with Wall Street estimates of $1.11 per share, according to Refinitiv data.
Intel Chief Financial Officer George Davis, who Intel said on Thursday will retire in May 2022, said about 14 cents of the outperformance came from demand for higher-margin products and operational gains, while the rest came from one-time items like tax restructuring.

Intel forecast fourth-quarter revenue slightly above Wall Street expectations. The company expects fourth-quarter revenue of about $18.3 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $18.25 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

1324,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2021 07:01PM ET</span>",Hedge funds score unprecedented gains on Trump's SPAC deal,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
(Reuters) - Hedge funds that invested in the blank-check acquisition company that made a $875 million deal to merge with former U.S. President Donald Trump's new social media venture are set to make five times their investment, regulatory filings show.
It is the biggest gain investors in so-called special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) have ever recorded on the first day after a deal was announced, according to SPAC Research.
Nearly a dozen hedge funds invested in the SPAC, Digital World Acquisition Corp, in its initial public offering (IPO) in September, according to the filings. Like other SPACs, Digital World did not disclose which company it was seeking to buy. 
Hedge funds have pumped hundreds of billions of dollars into these types of vehicles in the past two years.
The investor excitement had fizzled in the past few months as some companies that merged with SPACs failed to deliver on their bullish projections and retail investors nursed losses. Stock market reaction has been so poor to recent deals that some hedge funds only make pennies on the dollar by buying into the IPOs of SPACs and then selling their shares in the stock market or redeeming them for their IPO price.
But the hedge funds that invested in Digital World's IPO are set to quintuple their investment after Digital World's shares jumped more than 400% after the deal with newly launched Trump Media and Technology Group was announced. They were hovering around $50 in late afternoon trading on Thursday, giving Digital World a market value of $1.7 billion.
The hedge funds included D.E. Shaw, which oversees $60 billion in assets, and Yakira Capital Management, which invests some $472 million, according to a regulatory filing. 
Meteora Capital Partners, an affiliate of heavy SPAC investor Glazer Capital LLC, Sander Gerber's Hudson (NYSE:HUD) Bay Capital, Boothbay Fund Management, Boaz Weinstein's Saba Capital, Shaolin Capital Management, K2 Principal Fund and Radcliffe Capital Corp, another heavy SPAC investor, also put in money, the filings show.
Representatives for the firms either did not respond to requests seeking comment or declined to comment.
The rally in Digital World shares is also a boon to Trump because most stock market investors who buy the shares for much more than their $10 IPO price will not seek to redeem them at that price, ensuring that Trump Media and Technology Group will receive most if not all of the $293 million it is entitled to under the merger.
Some founders of the hedge funds donated to the Democratic Party, including to President Joe Biden, who defeated Trump in the 2020 U.S. election. Others backed Republican candidates including Trump. 
Hudson Bay's Gerber donated to Trump in last year's election and backed the two Republican candidates for Senate in Georgia. Weinstein donated to Biden and supported the Democratic candidates in Georgia, among other donations. 
David Shaw, who founded DE Shaw, donated millions of dollars to liberal political action committee Priorities USA Action, filings show. Representatives for the firms either did not respond to a request for comment or declined to comment. 

Most hedge funds invest regardless of party affiliation.

The acquisition will let Macquarie Asset Management tap into the growing market of providing easy access to alternative assets such as private equity and real estate to high net-worth individuals, who currently allocate less than 5% of their wealth to such investments, said Graeme Conway, the firm's chief commercial officer.
""We see this market quadrupling in the next few years,” Conway said.
High net-worth individuals, who have assets worth up to $25 million, are estimated to control investments valued at more than $19 trillion, according to consulting firm McKinsey.
Terms of the transaction were not disclosed. 
Founded in 2006, New York-based Central Park Group provides a platform for high net-worth individuals to invest in private equity, hedge funds, real estate, fund-of-funds, and other so-called alternative investment products. It has $3.5 billion in assets under management and its acquisition by Macquarie is expected to close in early 2022.

Macquarie Asset Management has about $520 billion in assets under management spread across Australia, the Americas, Europe, and Asia.

1326,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2021 06:52PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Governments turn tables on ransomware gang REvil by pushing it offline -sources,"By Joseph Menn and Christopher Bing
(Reuters) - The ransomware group REvil was itself hacked and forced offline this week by a multi-country operation, according to three private sector cyber experts working with the United States and one former official.
Former partners and associates of the Russian-led criminal gang were responsible for a May cyberattack on the Colonial Pipeline that led to widespread gas shortages on the U.S. East Coast. REvil's direct victims include top meatpacker JBS. The crime group's ""Happy Blog” website, which had been used to leak victim data and extort companies, is no longer available.
Officials said the Colonial attack used encryption software called DarkSide, which was developed by REvil associates.
VMWare head of cybersecurity strategy Tom Kellermann said law enforcement and intelligence personnel stopped the group from victimizing additional companies.
""The FBI, in conjunction with Cyber Command, the Secret Service and like-minded countries, have truly engaged in significant disruptive actions against these groups,” said Kellermann, an adviser to the U.S. Secret Service on cybercrime investigations. “REvil was top of the list.” 
A leadership figure known as ""0_neday,"" who had helped restart the group's operations after an earlier shutdown, said REvil's servers had been hacked by an unnamed party. 
""The server was compromised, and they were looking for me,"" 0_neday wrote on a cybercrime forum last weekend and first spotted by security firm Recorded Future. ""Good luck, everyone; I'm off.""
U.S. government attempts to stop REvil, one of the worst of dozens of ransomware gangs that work with hackers to penetrate and paralyze companies around the world, accelerated after the group compromised U.S. software management company Kaseya in July. 
That breach opened access to hundreds of Kaseya's customers all at once, leading to numerous emergency cyber incident response calls. 
DECRYPTION KEY
Following the attack on Kaseya, the FBI obtained a universal decryption key that allowed those infected via Kaseya to recover their files without paying a ransom. 
But law enforcement officials initially withheld the key for weeks as it quietly pursued REvil's staff, the FBI later acknowledged. 
According to three people familiar with the matter, law enforcement and intelligence cyber specialists were able to hack REvil's computer network infrastructure, obtaining control of at least some of their servers.
After websites that the hacker group used to conduct business went offline in July, the main spokesman for the group, who calls himself ""Unknown,"" vanished from the internet.
When gang member 0_neday and others restored those websites from a backup last month, he unknowingly restarted some internal systems that were already controlled by law enforcement. 
“The REvil ransomware gang restored the infrastructure from the backups under the assumption that they had not been compromised,” said Oleg Skulkin, deputy head of the forensics lab at the Russian-led security company Group-IB. “Ironically, the gang's own favorite tactic of compromising the backups was turned against them.”
Reliable backups are one of the most important defenses against ransomware attacks, but they must be kept unconnected from the main networks or they too can be encrypted by extortionists such as REvil.
A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council declined to comment on the operation specifically.
""Broadly speaking, we are undertaking a whole of government ransomware effort, including disruption of ransomware infrastructure and actors, working with the private sector to modernize our defenses, and building an international coalition to hold countries who harbor ransom actors accountable,"" the person said.
The FBI declined to comment.
One person familiar with the events said that a foreign partner of the U.S. government carried out the hacking operation that penetrated REvil's computer architecture. A former U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the operation is still active.
The success stems from a determination by U.S. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco that ransomware attacks on critical infrastructure should be treated as a national security issue akin to terrorism, Kellermann said.
In June, Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General John Carlin told Reuters the Justice Department was elevating investigations of ransomware attacks to a similar priority.

Such actions gave the Justice Department and other agencies a legal basis to get help from U.S. intelligence agencies and the Department of Defense, Kellermann said.
""Before, you couldn't hack into these forums, and the military didn't want to have anything to do with it. Since then, the gloves have come off.""

(Reuters) -Shares of  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) plummeted 25% on Thursday after the owner of photo messaging app Snapchat said privacy changes implemented by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) on iOS devices hurt the company's ability to target and measure its digital advertising.
The Santa Monica, California-based company, which earns the vast majority of its revenue from selling digital advertising on the app, said the issue was compounded by global supply chain disruptions and labor shortages and caused brands to pull back on their advertising spending.
The results for Snap, which is the first of the major social media companies to report earnings, cast a shadow over  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR), which release third quarter results next week.
Snap's results also knocked Facebook shares down 6%, Twitter down 7% and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) fell 3% on Thursday.
The Apple privacy updates were rolled out broadly in June and prevent digital advertisers from tracking iPhone users without their consent. 
A new ad measurement tool provided by Apple hampered the ability for companies to measure the performance of their ads, upending many of the ways advertisers have been accustomed to doing business for decades, said Snap Chief Executive Evan Spiegel during a conference call with analysts.
""This has definitely been a frustrating setback for us,"" he said. 
Snap added it expects the Apple privacy changes and global supply chain disruptions to linger through the fourth quarter, which is typically the highest-earning period for social media companies when brands ramp up marketing for the holiday season.
Many of the advertisers who place ads on Snapchat are in the beauty, fashion and consumer goods industries.
Snap said the supply chain disruptions affected a wide variety of advertisers across industries and regions.
Revenue for the third quarter ended Sept. 30 was $1.07 billion, missing consensus estimates of $1.1 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Daily active users, a metric watched closely by advertisers and investors, rose 23% year-over-year to 306 million, beating analyst estimates of 301.9 million.
Snapchat has worked to attract and retain users by building new features like the ability to discover restaurants and stores through a map feature, or play virtual games with friends.

The net loss during the quarter was $72 million, or 5 cents per share, narrowing from $199.9 million, or 14 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.
Snap forecast fourth quarter revenue between $1.16 billion to $1.2 billion, and daily active users between 316 million to 318 million.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Walmart's Mexico unit on Thursday said it focused on its low-price strategy as inflation rose in the third quarter, helping the retailer's net profit rise more than 20%.
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) de Mexico, the biggest retailer in Mexico, posted net profit of 11 billion pesos ($535 million) while revenue rose 6.4%, to 176 billion pesos. 
""In moments of high inflation, our low price value proposition becomes even more relevant for our customers,"" Chief Executive Guilherme Loureiro said in a webcast to discuss third quarter results.
He added that the company, known locally as Walmex, was ready for the holiday season despite global supply chain snags, in part because about 93% of its goods are locally sourced. 
""We've been working with national suppliers and logistics providers to secure capacity ... we will continue monitoring delays at ports and other factors in the supply chain,"" Loureiro said. 
Walmex's costs in the third quarter grew 5.5% but still came in below revenue growth, while the retailer's profit margin expanded to 8.8%, the company said. 
In the July-to-September period it opened 31 stores, mostly in Mexico, and a ""Walmart Fulfillment Services"" warehouse in Mexico City for outside merchants that sell via the Walmex website. https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/how-pandemic-helped-walmart-battle-amazon-marketplace-sellers-2021-04-14

By Shreyashi Sanyal, Devik Jain and Sinéad Carew
(Reuters) - The S&P 500 boasted a record closing high and its seventh straight session of gains on Thursday while the Nasdaq was boosted by such high-profile stocks as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) but a tumble in  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) shares weighed on the Dow. 
After hitting an intraday record the previous day the Dow was in the red for most of Thursday's session as IBM fell 9.6% after missing Wall Street estimates for quarterly revenue as orders in one business segment declined ahead of a spinoff next month.
Among the S&P's 11 major sectors, the biggest boost for the benchmark came from consumer discretionary stocks and the technology index, while energy stocks were the biggest drag as crude oil futures fell on concerns about demand. 
""For the most part you're dealing with a slightly risk-off day with people going back to more defensive sectors"" including big technology companies, said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
""You're seeing oil down a little bit today so potentially there's some global growth concerns. You're seeing some inflation concerns as well.""
However, the CBOE Volatility index, also referred to as Wall Street's fear gauge, closed at its lowest level since February 2020. Shortly after that date, the volatility index had climbed as COVID-19 brought the global economy its knees.
The VIX's low level implies that investors do not see a big decline or upswing for stocks ahead despite widespread concerns about supply-chain problems hiking costs, according to Shawn Cruz, senior market strategist at TD Ameritrade. 
""The market may be saying the supply-chain issues that are driving up costs are going to be transitory because markets are discounting mechanisms,"" pricing in what investors expect to happen in the future, Cruz said. 
The strategist also pointed to earlier data showing that the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped to a 19-month low last week, suggesting a tightening labor market. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 6.26 points, or 0.02%, to 35,603.08, the S&P 500 gained 13.59 points, or 0.30%, to 4,549.78 and the Nasdaq Composite added 94.02 points, or 0.62%, to 15,215.70.

(Reuters) -Mattel Inc on Thursday raised its 2021 sales forecast, saying it would overcome industry-wide shipping disruptions to ring in a strong holiday season steered by Barbie and Hot Wheels, driving its shares 6% higher in extended trading. 
The company has pulled forward production, contracted more ocean freight capacity and secured access to additional ports to keep up supply during the most crucial time of the year for toymakers, Chief Executive Officer Ynon Kreiz told Reuters.
While demand for toys is at an all-time high, severe global supply chain bottlenecks have threatened to keep store shelves empty this holiday season, leaving retailers and suppliers scrambling for ways to speed up product shipments. 
""We've been working through supply chain disruptions, it's not a normal year. But even with that, we expect to have lots of toys under trees this Christmas holiday,"" Kreiz said.
Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) said it expects full-year constant currency net sales to increase about 15%, compared with its prior forecast for a 12% to 14% rise.
James Zahn, deputy editor at trade magazine The Toy Book, said supply chain issues affecting the industry also give large toymakers an opportunity to take market share from smaller players during the holiday season.
""Larger players in the business, Mattel and Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) being the biggest of the bunch, have much deeper pockets and can throw more money at the problem than a lot of independent toy companies,"" Zahn said. 
Mattel's net sales rose 8% to $1.76 billion in the third quarter, helped by higher prices and as customers looking to keep their children entertained during the pandemic snapped up Hot Wheels cars and Barbie dolls. 

Analysts had estimated sales of $1.69 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Excluding items, the company earned 84 cents per share, beating estimates if 72 cents per share.

1331,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2021 06:11PM ET</span>","Pfizer, BioNTech say COVID-19 booster shot showed high efficacy in large study","BERLIN (Reuters) - A booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine developed by  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and German partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) was 95.6% effective against the coronavirus when compared to a vaccinated group that did not get the third shot, data from a large study released by the companies showed on Thursday. 
The companies in a release said the booster was tested on 10,000 participants aged 16 and older who had received two doses in its earlier trials. A booster administered about 11 months after the second shot had a favourable safety profile and worked against the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus, they said. The data has not been submitted for peer review.
The trial results come a day after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized booster doses U.S. FDA clears  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), J&J COVID-19 boosters, backs use of different vaccine for boost of the COVID-19 vaccines from Moderna Inc and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and said Americans could choose a different shot from their original inoculation as a booster.
An panel of expert advisers to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention made a similar recommendation on Thursday, clearing the way for a final approval from its director that would allow such shots in the coming days. 
The U.S. agencies previously authorized boosters of the Pfizer/BioNTech shot at least six months after the first round of shots to increase protection for people aged 65 and older, those at risk of severe disease and those who are exposed to the virus through their work.
Dr. Walid Gellad, a professor at University of Pittsburgh's medical school, said there seems to be a benefit of having the third dose to prevent symptomatic COVID-19, but questioned if the booster was helping younger people as well as older people. 
""I'm just still very curious if this is primarily in people who are much, much older. Because what we don't want to do is run out and give boosters to 25-year-olds who had COVID before and got two doses of the vaccine, just based on this press release,"" Gellad said.
Pfizer had said its two-shot vaccine's efficacy wanes over time, citing a study that showed 84% effectiveness from a peak of 96% four months after a second dose. Some countries have already gone ahead with plans to give booster doses.
The drugmakers said on Thursday the median time between the second dose and the booster shot or the placebo in the study was around 11 months. There were only five cases of COVID-19 in the booster group, compared with 109 cases in the group that received the placebo shot.
The median age of the participants was 53 years, with 55.5% of participants between 16 and 55 years, and 23.3% at 65 years or older.
Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Michael Yee said the trial results add to mounting data that boosters could help in providing long-lasting protection from symptomatic infection. 

There were no reported cases of severe disease, suggesting robust protection from infection with only the primary vaccination series, Yee wrote in a note. 
The companies said they would submit detailed results of the trial for peer-reviewed publication to the FDA, the European Medicines Agency and other regulatory agencies, as soon as possible.

Therefore, we think it could be wise to bet on quality shipping stocks ZIM Integrated (ZIM),  Matson  (NYSE:MATX), and Star Bulk Carriers (NASDAQ:SBLK) at their current, slashed price levels. Let’s discuss.Factors including slowing industrial production in China, surging oil prices, and a critical oil spill in Southern California have caused considerable disruptions in the global supply chain, increasing shipping costs to record highs lately. Consequently, the shipping industry witnessed a sell-off earlier this month.
However, because the demand for shipping remains elevated amid the global economic recovery, the industry should witness a solid rebound. Supply chain disruptions and higher shipping costs are expected to last until 2022, but governments worldwide are taking various steps to address these headwinds.

1334,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2021 05:46PM ET</span>",Trump's social media deal ignites 350% gain in SPAC's shares,"By Medha Singh and Sinéad Carew
(Reuters) -Former U.S. President Donald Trump's deal to create a social media app after  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) barred him won an exuberant endorsement from investors, with shares in a shell company backing the plan closing up more than 350% on Thursday after rising more than 400% earlier in the day.
Trump Media and Technology Group and Digital World Acquisition Corp, a Special Purpose Acquisition Vehicle (SPAC), announced on Wednesday https://www.reuters.com/world/us/former-us-president-donald-trump-launches-new-social-media-platform-2021-10-21 they would merge to create a social media app called TRUTH Social. Trump's company said it plans a beta launch - unveiling a trial version - next month and a full roll-out in the first quarter of 2022. 
SPACs use money raised through an initial public offering to take a private company public. This deal's announcement lacked the trappings of the detailed business plans Wall Street is accustomed to in SPAC mergers, from naming a leadership team to giving detailed financing earnings and projections.
Even so, shares of Miami-based Digital World closed up 356.8% at $45.50 a share on Nasdaq after soaring more than 400% earlier in the session. At the closing price, its market capitalization stood at $1.47 billion, up from $321 million on Wednesday.
With volume of more than 477 million shares, it was the most actively traded stock on the exchange, drawing chatter on forums such as Reddit, where retail investors have driven so-called meme stocks to values not supported by mainstream financial analysis. On Twitter and Stocktwits, some users cheered the rally with posts displaying rocket ships and GIFs of Trump.
The venture may provide the first real test of the power of right-wing social media https://www.reuters.com/technology/what-is-trumps-new-venture-what-are-its-odds-success-2021-10-21 with the full force of Trump's support. Questions remain about how it plans to make money and avoid the same issues that led major social media platforms to banish him.
Some investors marveled at the rally and wondered whether the gains would last.
""I have never seen anything like this, such share reaction based on hopes and dreams,"" Kristi Marvin, a former investment banker who founded research firm SPACInsider, told other investors on a Twitter Spaces discussion.
Others said the market reaction reflected support for Trump as well as a bet that a platform with him would draw followers. 
""Up to this point there hasn't been a publicly traded vehicle for those that support the former president,"" said Jake Dollarhide, co-founder of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Stamford, Connecticut, said not just Trump supporters but also opponents, media and investors would want to get on the platform to keep track of what Trump says. 
Still, its future is far from certain. Digital World, led by former investment banker Patrick Orlando, has launched at least four SPACs and plans to launch two more but none of them have completed a deal yet. Orlando did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
DIRECT AND UNFILTERED
People close to the Republican former president, speaking on condition of anonymity, have said Trump has sought to set up his own social media company since leaving the White House. Trump, contemplating another White House run in 2024, has been frustrated that he does not have a direct and unfiltered connection with his millions of followers after Twitter and Facebook barred him, these people said.
Social media giants suspended Trump's accounts after his supporters rioted at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 following an incendiary speech he gave repeating false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him through widespread voting fraud. 
Twitter found that Trump posts violated its ""glorification of violence"" https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/suspension policy. Facebook found that Trump praised violence https://about.fb.com/news/2021/06/facebook-response-to-oversight-board-recommendations-trump in connection with the deadly attack in which rioters sought to block the formal congressional certification of his election loss to President Joe Biden.
In a press release announcing the deal, Trump said, ""I'm excited to soon begin sharing my thoughts on TRUTH Social and to fight back against Big Tech."" 
Facebook shares were up 0.3%. Twitter shares were down 0.6%.
Trump Media said it would receive $293 million in cash that Digital World Acquisition had in a trust if no shareholder of the acquisition firm chooses to cash in their shares.
The soaring share price could increase the likelihood of a deal closing. Investors in the SPAC must eventually choose whether to redeem their shares at the IPO price of $10 per share, which is now much lower than the level at which what many would have bought. 

Attempts to float alternatives to Twitter and Facebook have faltered in the past. Parler, a social media app backed by prominent Republican Party donor Rebekah Mercer and popular with U.S. conservatives, had several tech companies cut ties with it https://www.reuters.com/technology/parler-returns-apples-app-store-names-new-ceo-2021-05-17 after the Jan. 6 riot. 
GETTR, a Twitter-style platform started by former Trump adviser Jason Miller, claimed more than 1.5 million users in its first 11 days after being launched https://www.reuters.com/world/us/former-trump-aide-miller-launches-social-media-site-gettr-2021-07-01 in July.

The agency staff found that some companies collected data about browsing histories, what is streamed, sensitive characteristics like race and sexual orientation and real-time location, which it found were sometimes shared with third parties.
The report also found that some ISPs kept consumer data for a set period of time but others said they kept it as long as needed. 
""The report found that even in instances where internet service providers purported to offer customers some choice with respect to how their data was collected or used, in practice users were often thwarted by design decisions that made it complicated, difficult or near impossible to actually escape persistent tracking,"" Khan said.

Global food prices have shot up significantly from last year, creating growth opportunities for the agricultural industry. Given the rising inflation, we think fundamentally strong agricultural stocks of Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM),  Corteva  (NYSE:CTVA), AGCO Corporation (AGCO), and Intrepid Potash (NYSE:IPI) could be solid buys now. Let’s pore over these names.The supply chain disruptions amid rebounding demand as the global economy recovers from the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have led to increased commodity prices, which is contributing to inflation. The annual U.S. inflation rate came in at 5.4% in September, rising from 5.3% in the preceding month. In line with this rise, food prices jumped 4.6% year-over-year in September. Meat, poultry, fish, and egg prices have increased more than 15% from pre-pandemic levels.
According to the UN Food and Agricultural Organization’s (FAO) monthly Food Price Index, global food prices in September have inflated 33% from the past year and 3% since July, reaching its highest levels since 2011. This has created solid growth opportunities for the agricultural industry. The global agriculture market is expected to grow at a 7% CAGR to $13.13 trillion by 2025.
Given this backdrop, we think agricultural stocks of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM), Corteva, Inc. (CTVA), AGCO Corporation (AGCO), and Intrepid Potash, Inc. (IPI) will gain substantially. Thus, these stocks could be solid bets now.

(Reuters) - U.S. carriers American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) on Thursday warned mounting inflationary pressures could overshadow strong holiday demand and delay a complete return to profit.
Both the Texas-based carriers posted a smaller-than-expected loss in the third quarter, but said rising fuel prices as well as higher labor costs are hurting earnings in the quarter through December.
Oil prices have surged to multi-year highs this year, threatening a fragile recovery in the airline industry. American, for example, spent nearly 70% more on jet fuel in the latest quarter than a year ago. Southwest's fuel costs surged by 154% from a year ago.
Higher fuel costs tend to lead to result in less flown capacity and higher fares. Rival Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL), which expects fuel prices to result in a pre-tax loss in the current quarter, has suggested that it might pass along the increased costs to consumers.
Carriers are also trying to hire workers amid a pick-up in travel demand. 
Southwest said it was aggressively hiring, with the aim of having about 5,000 new employees by the end of this year. However, a tight labor market is forcing the company to offer higher wages and better benefits to attract talent.
The airline has had to cancel flights en masse partly due to staff shortages, having earlier added more flights to its schedule to capitalize on a hoped-for recovery in air travel as pandemic restrictions eased.
Such cancellations earlier this month are expected to result in a $75-million hit to Southwest's October revenue.
""I would be the first to admit that things are messy,"" Chief Executive Gary Kelly said on an earnings call. ""We've gone from not enough to do to too much to do in a very short period of time.""
The company is also worried that the White House's vaccine mandate could worsen its staffing problem. Kelly said he is empathetic with those employees who don't want to get vaccinated against COVID-19, assuring the company won't fire any one for defying the mandate.
Southwest has adjusted its flight schedules in accordance with the staffing situation.
It expects its capacity in the December quarter to remain below the corresponding period in 2019. In the first quarter of 2022, its capacity is estimated to be about 6% lower than the pre-pandemic levels.
American said its capacity in the current quarter is expected to be down about 11% to 13% versus the fourth quarter of 2019. While revenue in the fourth quarter is estimated to recover to 80% of the 2019 levels from 75% in the September quarter, it forecast a pre-tax margin of minus 16% to minus 18%, excluding special items.
TRAVEL REBOUND
Both the carriers said the impact of the Delta variant of the coronavirus on travel bookings has bottomed out. 
American expects domestic leisure revenue to surpass 2019 levels in the December quarter. It predicted that business revenue would fully recover to 2019 levels by the end of 2022.
Southwest said ticket sales for the upcoming holiday season are in line with 2019 levels. Still, it expects the Delta variant to result in a $100 million hit in the current quarter.
Its adjusted loss for the third quarter came in at 23 cents per share, compared with $1.99 per share last year. Analysts on average expected Southwest to report a loss of 27 cents per share, according to Refinitiv data.

American reported an adjusted loss of 99 cents per share in the third quarter, smaller than a loss of $5.54 a year ago and a loss of $1.04 estimated by analysts in a Refinitiv survey.
Southwest's shares fell 1.5% and American's rose 1.3%.

Investing.com -- Stocks wavered after a disappointing quarter for International Business Machines put pressure on the technology sector. Still, the S&P 500 touched an all-time high intraday and was positive heading into the last few minutes of the trading session.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 have stood up as investors absorb comments from corporate executives about supply chain disruptions, rising costs, and labor shortages. 
International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) shares fell 7% after missing estimates because of a decline in orders in its infrastructure business. 
It has been a mostly positive earnings season so far, however. And analysts expect the profit of S&P 500 companies to rise 33.7% from a year earlier, Reuters reported, citing Refinitiv data.
Two splashy debuts hit the market on Thursday:  WeWork  Inc (NYSE:WE), the flexible office space operator, began trading with a valuation of $9 billion, its stock rising about 10%. It’s been about two years since the company’s ill-fated attempt at an earlier IPO.
And, in the most actively traded stock of the day,  Digital World Acquisition  Corp (NASDAQ:DWAC) shares jumped nearly 400% after announcing a plan to merge with Trump Media & Technology Group, a social media firm backed by former President Donald Trump, who says he’s starting a new platform. 
Trump has been kicked off  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR)and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and has been trying to find a new social media platform since leaving office. 
On the jobs front, weekly data showed the number of people filing new jobless claims last week dropped to another 19-month low.
Travel and leisure stocks have been particularly hard hit by the pandemic, and airlines have been trying to bounce back amid a surge in coronavirus cases, labor shortages, and a sluggish rebound in business travel. That said,  American Airlines Group  (NASDAQ:AAL) reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss, and Southwest Airlines Company (NYSE:LUV) posted a smaller loss.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Schlumberger earnings
Schlumberger NV (NYSE:SLB)will report its third-quarter earnings Friday. The company is expected to report profit per share of 35 cents on revenue of $5.94 billion, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com.
2. Honeywell earnings
Honeywell International Inc (NASDAQ:HON)’s third-quarter earnings per share are seen coming in at $1.99 and revenue at $8.65 billion.
3. Amex earnings
 American Express  Company (NYSE:AXP)’ third-quarter revenue is expected to touch $10.54 billion with profit per share coming in at $1.77.

BERLIN (Reuters) -SAP said on Thursday demand for its cloud business database was growing as the German business software group confirmed its preliminary third-quarter results and full-year guidance boosted by big returns from its ties to a venture capital firm.
Last week, the company had forecast cloud revenue to grow by 16%-19% in the year as a whole, helping its overall cloud and software revenue to increase by 2%-4%.
Cloud backlog for flagship database S/4HANA was up 58% at constant currencies and current cloud backlog - a measure of incoming business - grew 22% in the third quarter.
""Our cloud revenue now represents 35% of our total revenue and that's driving up our share of more predictable revenue, which rose by 3 percentage points year over year to 77%,"" Chief Financial Officer Luka Mucic said on a call with journalists.
Shares of the software maker, however, fell 3.4% to the bottom of Frankfurt's blue-chip index after traders pointed to Mucic confirming the group's forecast for flat or slightly lower 2022 profits in a separate call with analysts.
""If the market was thinking this was going to be the EU tech play for 2022, they may now have other ideas,"" a trader said.
SAP still raised its forecast for cloud and software revenue for the full year by 200 million euros ($232 million) to 23.8 billion-24.2 billion euros.
Adjusted revenue rose 5% to 6.68 billion euros ($7.70 billion) for the third quarter ended Sept. 30, and adjusted earnings per share rose 2% to 1.74 euros.
Quarterly results were also lifted by the company's venture capital arm, Sapphire Ventures, which accounted for a quarter of SAP's more than 2 billion-euro profit in the third quarter, underscoring the fund's recent success in backing small tech startups.
The VC firm, spun out of SAP in 2011, has backed high-profile startups such as Square, Box, Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) and Wise.
Some analysts say they do not take into account in their forecasts the fund's performance, preferring to focus on the more predictable results of its cloud offering.
But year-to-date the business has contributed about 1.8 billion euros to earnings, up by 1 billion year-on-year, Mucic said on the call with journalists.
""Our typical check size is $10 to $60 million, but we can go all the way up to $100 million,"" Andreas Weiskam, co-founder and partner of Sapphire Ventures, said in an interview with Reuters.
Weiskam said the fund's assets under management currently stands at more than $6.8 billion. SAP had committed $1.75 billion last quarter.

""Sapphire Ventures gives SAP tail wind. But it also means volatility - depending on the capital markets,"" said Knut Woller at brokerage Baader Helvea.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said on Thursday that both the driver and passenger seats were occupied during an April 17 fatal crash of a Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model S in Spring, Texas.
In contrast, local police previously said witness statements suggested there was nobody in the driver's seat when the car crashed into a tree and killed the two occupants.
Tesla shares rose on the disclosure and were recently up 3.1% to $892.70.
The NTSB said a review of vehicle data indicates ""both the driver and the passenger seats were occupied, and that the seat belts were buckled when the (event data recorder) recorded the crash.""
Based on a forensic examination of the steering wheel and information from the car’s event data recorder, the vehicle reached a speed of 67 mph during the 5 seconds leading up to the crash, NTSB added.
The NTSB also said data indicates ""the driver was applying the accelerator in the time leading up to the crash; application of the accelerator pedal was found to be as high as 98.8%.""
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The crash raised new alarms about Tesla's driver assistance system Autopilot in April after Harris County Constable Mark Herman said ""We have witness statements from people that said they left to test drive the vehicle without a driver and to show the friend how it can drive itself."" 
Herman's office did not immediately comment Thursday. 
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is also investigating the crash, declined to comment.
The NTSB said that ""no conclusions about how the crash happened should be drawn from the information in this investigative update"" and all aspects of the crash remain under investigation.
The NTSB said its Recorders Laboratory (NYSE:LH) repaired the car’s event data recorder and extracted critical precrash information from the unit.

The NTSB said in May that testing suggested the vehicle's automated steering system was ""not available"" on the road where the accident occurred.
Last month, an autopsy report showed one of the two victims had a blood-alcohol level that exceeded the legal driving limit. The car was destroyed by a post-crash fire and the victims badly burned.

Two such names are Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON), and they are worth buying on market weakness based on their popularity and product traction.It’s been a strong start to October thus far for the tech sector, with the Nasdaq-100 Index (QQQ) bouncing sharply from its September lows and extending its year-to-date gain to 19% after a brief pullback. This significant outperformance is despite inflation concerns and the possibility of rate hikes as early as 2023, which could make it more difficult to justify the valuations we’re seeing among high-flying growth names. However, while the market as a whole remains quite expensive, two names remain reasonably valued as long as they can continue to execute on their growth plans. These two names are Tesla (TSLA) and Peloton (PTON), and while they’re not on buy ratings, they are names worth keeping at the top of one’s shopping list if we do see some turbulence in the market. Let’s take a closer look at both names below:

Tesla and Peloton have little in common, with the latter company being a tech-leisure name and the other being an auto manufacturer with industry-leading self-driving technology. However, both companies have performed exceptionally well since the March 2020 lows, with Peloton gaining more than 400% even after its recent correction and Tesla up a whopping 1100%. At current levels, neither name offers a large enough margin of safety, but with the margin expansion profiles each have, and their strong revenue growth rates (50%+ revenue growth rates), I believe both names are buy-the-dip candidates if we do get a sharp sell-off in the coming months.

(Reuters) -Many people are passionate about climate change, but not everybody should drive a battery electric vehicle as a means to combat climate change,  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp Chief Scientist Gill Pratt said on Thursday at the Reuters Events Automotive Summit.
Pratt's comments, during a discussion on electric vehicles, appeared to amplify remarks made over the past year by Toyota President Akio Toyoda.
Toyoda and other company officials have said that electric vehicles will play a greater role in reducing emissions, but other solutions should be used, Toyota's gasoline-electric hybrid models or hydrogen-powered fuel cell electric vehicles. [nL4N2MX23C]
At Thursday's conference, Pratt said Toyota believes in ""diversity of drivetrains"" to give customers different tools to reduce CO2.
""It's not for us to predict which solution is the best or say only this will work,"" he said.
Government incentives should be aimed at reducing carbon emissions, not picking which car technology is the best way to achieve those goals, Pratt added, in a reference to proposed bans on internal combustion engine (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) vehicles, including hybrids, as a means of achieving carbon neutrality.
Toyota was among major automakers that supported the Trump administration in its attempt to bar California from setting its own zero-emission requirements, but the company dropped that support earlier this year.

Toyota has said it plans to invest $13.5 billion through 2030 on EV batteries, but so far its plans to roll out new battery electric vehicles (BEVs) seem relatively modest compared with those of U.S. automakers General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, which are spending around $30 billion each through 2025 to electrify more of their vehicle lines.
Toyota executives continue to tout the merits of the company's hybrid vehicles, which have been on the market for more than 20 years.

Wall Street analysts expect the largest publicly listed hospital operator, HCA Healthcare (NYSE:HCA) Inc, to report a near doubling in quarterly earnings, but the profits could come under pressure from higher costs. The company is due to report earnings on Friday. 
For HCA, ""elevated nursing costs and labor pressures will remain in third-quarter 2021,"" said Mizuho Securities analyst Ann Hynes in a research note. 
Hospitals nationwide are finding it difficult to fill nursing jobs and have to pay more to recruit and retain nurses, a cost that they cannot afford in an era of tight margins.

The stake has current a market value of around 1.65 billion euros ($1.92 billion), taking into account the Austrian lender's 429.8 million outstanding shares and Thursday's closing price of 38.76 euros per share, according to data from Refinitiv.
The lender said a potential full disposal of its stake in Erste based on the share price of September 30 would result in a non-material impact on its bottom line and would have positive effect of 15 basis points in its core tier-1 ratio.
Like other Spanish and European banks, Caixabank, which in March closed the acquisition of Bankia, is trying to comply with harsher solvency requirements and regulators are demanding banks to focus on their core banking business.
The sale of its stake could take place in different steps as Caixabank owns a 5.42% unhedged stake in EBS, which it could sell to certain pre-identified buyers.
Caixabank also said it was considering to settle equity swaps underlying a 4.5% of its stake by delivering the underlying shares to equity swaps counterparties.

Caixabank said that the divestment of Caixabank's entire stake in Erste Bank would ultimately depend on market conditions.

The move supported the Biden Administration's plan to ease snarls at the Southern California ports that process roughly 40% of the container cargo that enters the country.
But so far, it hasn't made a big dent.
""We've seen four dozen incremental domestic intermodal loads come through,"" Fritz said in a Zoom interview. ""It helps somewhere, and it will stay open 24/7 if that's what it needs.""

Union Pacific executives and other logistics experts say that a shortage of available warehouse space and port and long-haul truckers are stymieing efforts to keep up with the surge in cargo to the United States - where the world's most avid consumers have been buying more goods than ever due to pandemic-related curbs on travel and entertainment.
Union Pacific on Thursday reported a 6% decline in third-quarter volume for its intermodal business, which handles freight that moves by two or more modes of transportation - sea, rail or truck. Fritz told analysts that drop was due to shortage of port truckers to support the operations.

PARIS (Reuters) -L'Oreal on Thursday posted better-than-expected revenue growth for the third-quarter, fuelled by continued strong demand for its luxury lines and sustained growth in China.
The French group, which owns brands like Lancome and makes Armani cosmetics, saw luxury sales surge over 20%, as it benefited from e-commerce channels it expanded during the pandemic and stores that reopened.
Though mainland China continued to post double-digit growth during the quarter, helped by strong demand for hair and skincare products, growth was tempered by a resurgence of some regional coronavirus curbs.
Chief Executive Nicolas Hieronimus said the restrictions had mostly impacted in-store sales and that the country's e-commerce business continued to flourish.
""China's population and its middle classes are increasing and their appetite for beauty is not satisfied,"" Hieronimus told analysts in a call.
China last year became the world's second-largest market for beauty and personal care products after the United States, according to market research firm Statista, as a growing middle class and social media influence boosted demand for premium brands. 
Calls from the Chinese government for a ""common prosperity"" - a broad policy drive to narrow the gap between rich and poor - have however stoked investor concerns the state could seek to restrict high-end purchases. 
But Hieronimus said that efforts to redistribute wealth would likely increase the middle classes and benefit L'Oreal's business.
He said that premium lines were L'Oreal's fastest growing categories in China, citing cosmetics brands Lancome Absolue and Helena Rubinstein.
The company reported sales up 13.1% from July to September, excluding currency swings and acquisitions, materially beating analysts' forecasts.

Consensus estimates cited by  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) had predicted growth at around 8%, fearing that demand would taper off following a post-lockdown boom.
Sales had surged 33.5% in the previous three months, when L'Oreal and fashion labels benefited from booming Chinese and U.S. demand amid easing coronavirus curbs.

1362,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2021 02:31PM ET</span>",Explainer-What is Trump's new venture and what are its odds of success?,"By Helen Coster
(Reuters) - Former U.S. President Donald Trump has announced his return to the digital world with the planned launch of his own social media app as he promises to ""stand up to Big Tech"" after being banished from major platforms.
The app, TRUTH Social, will be created through a new company formed by a merger of the Trump Media and Technology Group and a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), according to a press release they issued on Wednesday. 
The venture may provide the first real test of the power of right-wing social media with the full force of Trump's support. Questions remain about how it plans to make money and avoid the same issues that led  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR),  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's YouTube to ban or suspend him.
Here is an explanation of Trump's venture.
What is the aim of Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG)?
In a presentation to investors, the new venture's backers said TMTG aspires to create a media powerhouse to ""rival the liberal media consortium"" and ""fight back against the Big Tech companies of Silicon Valley."" During his presidency, Trump railed against major news media organizations and called journalists ""the enemy of the people.""
The company said it wants to build a ""non-cancellable"" global community - including a social media platform, streaming service, news division and alternative cloud provider - to compete against entrenched players in those categories, from Twitter to Disney+ to CNN to Google Cloud. It said a streaming service, TMTG+, promises ""news, big-tent entertainment, exciting documentaries, sports programming and more.""
The backers have not laid out a plan for pricing or revenue generation. 
The TRUTH Social app is available for pre-order in the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) App store, a sign that its backers plan to distribute it through conventional routes.
How do SPACs work? 
A SPAC is a shell company that raises money in an IPO to merge with a privately held company that then becomes publicly traded as a result. SPACs have emerged as a popular IPO alternative for companies, providing a path to going public with less regulatory scrutiny and more certainty over the valuation that will be attained.
Shareholders of the SPAC, Digital World Acquisition Corp, will be asked whether they want to redeem their shares for their IPO value when the merger is poised to be completed. If they do, they will be reducing the $293 million in cash that the SPAC will have available to give to Trump's company. 
What are TMTG's odds of success? 
Trump attracted a large social media following before being permanently banned from Twitter and suspended by Facebook and YouTube. His @realdonaldtrump Twitter handle had 88.7 million followers. Trump has struggled to gain traction online since leaving office in January. He pulled the plug on his blog - entitled ""From the Desk of Donald J. Trump"" - after 29 days. 
Other conservative online ventures have failed to attract huge audiences. 
Gettr, a social media app launched in July by Trump's former spokesperson and senior adviser Jason Miller, has hit about 2.2 million installs globally across the App Store and Google Play, according to Sensor Tower. 
The social media and streaming platforms, news outlets and web-hosting services that TMTG seeks to challenge are well-established and well-funded. 
TMTG may struggle to find a web host if it becomes a source of violent rhetoric. Parler, the app backed by prominent Republican Party donor Rebekah Mercer, went dark for about a month after Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) suspended web-hosting services for it after the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot by Trump supporters. Google also removed Parler from its app store. Parler returned online in February with Los Angeles-based private cloud infrastructure SkySilk. 
Since Parler returned online - to the App store and not Google's marketplace - it has drawn a little over 100,000 installs, according to Sensor Tower. 

What type of speech will TMTG prohibit?
It will not allow for making fun of Trump or his people. According to its terms of services, as a user of the site one agrees not to ""disparage, tarnish, or otherwise harm, in our opinion, us and/or the Site.""

The seller of books, music and electrical equipment, which previously expected growth to be about 5%, said it expects 2021 current operating income to be in the upper end of the previous guidance of a range of 260 million-270 million euros ($302 million-314 million).
Retailers have seen their in-store sales rebound in recent months as shoppers returned after months of pandemic-related closures, while online sales continued to grow. 
Fnac Darty's total group sales for nine months were up 12.7% compared to the same period last year, with online sales accounting for 26% of revenue in the period. 
While global retail markets face supply chain disruptions ahead of peak shopping season, Fnac Darty's CFO Jean-Brieuc Le Tinier said on a call with reporters that the group was not experiencing any problems at the moment. 
He said that despite a certain pressure on telephony and IT products the company was less affected thanks to its market share of high-end products, which offer higher margins and are less prone to get hit from raw material prices and inflation.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A bipartisan group of 38 U.S. House lawmakers on Thursday urged leaders in Congress to immediately set a path to advance legislation providing $52 billion for U.S. semiconductor production including $2 billion in support for chips used by the automotive industry.
The U.S. Senate voted 68-32 in June to approve a sweeping package of legislation intended to boost the country's ability to compete with Chinese technology, including providing $52 billion for chips, but the measure has stalled in the House. 
The House lawmakers in a letter warned of the ""dire consequences the automotive industry as a whole - and the nation - faces if we fail to advance legislation soon.""
Automakers around the world have cut production dramatically because of the shortage in supply of semiconductor chips. The Senate bill includes $2 billion in funding dedicated to the type of chips automakers use.
The letter is spearheaded by U.S. Representatives Debbie Dingell and Fred Upton of Michigan. Dingell is a Democrat and Upton a Republican. The letter said the ""ongoing semiconductor shortage is hurting the automotive industry, American workers, and our nation’s competitiveness by the hour.""
It added that ""all of the major American automotive manufacturers are hurting and conditions are getting worse ... If this shortage is further prolonged, we fear more assembly plants will be faced with temporary shutdowns or long-term disruptions.""
Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo has been urging Congress to pass funding quickly.
""Realistically, there is no quick and easy fix,"" Raimondo told Reuters last month. ""Fundamentally, the solution is that we need to make more chips, and we need to make more chips in America.""

Raimondo's department issued a voluntary request for information to obtain better information on the chips problem from industry.
Automakers from General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) to Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co to  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp have cut output due to scarce chip supplies, made worse by a COVID-19 resurgence in key Asian semiconductor production hubs.

1366,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2021 02:21PM ET</span>",WeWork shares jump on debut after two-year struggle to go public,"By Noor Zainab Hussain
(Reuters) - Shares of SoftBank-owned WeWork jumped nearly 9% as they finally started trading in New York on Thursday, capping an arduous journey to the public markets for the storied office-sharing company that was once valued as high as $47 billion. 
While WeWork's top management led by current chairman and SoftBank executive Marcelo Claure insist the worst is over, the office-sharing firm continues to lose money, two years after an IPO fiasco.
""WeWork has a low occupancy rate, 55-58% recently, and thus can grow revenue without increasing costs by very much. It needs to grow revenue, because it is currently losing close to $1 for every dollar of revenue that it brings in,"" IPO expert Jay Ritter, a professor at the University of Florida, said. 
In 2019, when WeWork first embarked on its efforts to go public under founder and former chief executive Adam Neumann, the proposed share sale imploded spectacularly after IPO investors balked at the company's hefty losses, Neumann's management style, and WeWork's corporate governance lapses.
Once seen as a prized bet for SoftBank chief Masayoshi Son who personally backed Neumann, the Japanese conglomerate was forced to bail out WeWork after its valuation was slashed from a lofty $47 billion to $8 billion following the botched offering that threatened the company's survival.
Son was subsequently forced to concede that betting big on WeWork was a mistake. 
WeWork is yet to turn a profit. It reported a net loss attributable to the company of $888.85 million in the second quarter, compared with $863.83 million a year earlier.
Shares of the loss-making company, which in March struck a $9-billion go-public deal with blank-check acquisition firm BowX Acquisition Corp, were up 10.79% at $11.50 in afternoon trade.
Neumann continues to hold a sizable stake in the business, valued at nearly $1 billion, and under the terms of his exit package from WeWork, he will be eligible to observe board meetings from next year, even though he is not a board member anymore. 
Neumann's name can be seen dozens of times through the business combination filing, even though he holds no executive roles at WeWork anymore. 
Neumann also played an indirect role in helping put together the SPAC deal, Reuters reported in March, and according to a report from the New York Times on Thursday, Neumann and WeWork's co-founder Miguel McKelvey held a party on Thursday to celebrate the listing. 

The real test for WeWork will start now, experts say, as most companies around the world have adopted hybrid work models and in several instances, a complete shift to work from home even after widespread vaccinations. 
""Investors are betting that the company has switched from a model of focusing on growing its office space to a model of focusing on cutting losses and becoming profitable.""

(Reuters) -U.S. railroad operator  Union Pacific  Corp (NYSE:UNP) on Thursday cut its forecast for full-year volume growth, as worsening supply chain disruptions are expected to hit shipments across a sector considered critical in connecting most consumer and industrial businesses.
Supply problems have hit many company results in the third quarter and it was no different with North American Class I railroads, with three of them registering flat or a decline in volumes shipped.
Union Pacific's intermodal and automotive shipments, which made up for nearly a third of quarterly freight revenue, were particularly hit with combined volumes falling 9%.
The fall in shipments forced the Nebraska-based company, which operates in 23 states and connects East Coast ports to key terminals like Chicago, to cut its 2021 volume growth outlook to 5% versus a 7% growth it had forecast earlier.
""Its not necessarily a slam dunk that the new guidance range will be hit as well"" as fourth-quarter rail volumes have been ""somewhat disappointing"" so far, Evercore ISI analyst Jonathan Chappell said.
Union Pacific's Chief Executive Officer Lance Fritz, however, was optimistic about next year's overall volumes, projecting its growth ""ahead of industrial production"".
""What we don't know is when the automotive industry starts getting back to normal... and what's going to happen with the intermodal supply chain,"" Fritz told Reuters in an interview.
The company's third-quarter business volumes were flat at 2.04 million. Operating ratio, a key profitability metric, improved to 56.3% from 58.7%.
Union Pacific's net income rose nearly a quarter to beat expectations, as it took advantage of U.S. industrial demand to ship more chemicals, metals, minerals, paper and plastics at higher prices.

Operating revenue rose 13% to $5.57 billion for the quarter ended Sept. 30, beating average analysts' estimate of $5.41 billion, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S.
Shares of the company were up nearly 1% in afternoon trade.

The comments follow a Wall Street Journal report last month that said millions of Facebook accounts belonging to celebrities, politicians and other high-profile users were exempted from some internal checks.
The board said that Facebook has not been transparent with the company's 'cross-check' system, an internal program the social media network says is used to double-check enforcement actions against certain users.
""Facebook needs to commit to greater transparency and to treat users fairly,"" the board said in a tweet.
In relation to its May decision to uphold the indefinite suspension of former U.S. President Donald Trump's account after the Jan 6. riot, the board said when Facebook referred the case, it did not mention the cross-check system until it was asked.
""Given that the referral included a specific policy question about account-level enforcement for political leaders, many of whom the Board believes were covered by cross-check, this omission is not acceptable,"" it said. 
Facebook, in the form of a policy advisory opinion, has asked the board to review its cross-check system and make recommendations on how it can be changed.
A company spokesperson said the board's work had been ""impactful,"" which is why it asked for input into the cross-check system. 
Facebook created the board mainly to address criticism over how it handles problematic content and is responsible for independent verdicts on a number of thorny decisions related content moderation.

Going forward, the board will publish quarterly and annual transparency reports to provide assessment on whether its recommendations were implemented. 
In its first quarterly report, the board said over half a million Facebook and Instagram users submitted appeals between October 2020 and the end of June 2021, of which more than a third were related to content concerning Facebook's rules on hate speech.

Skillz shares are up over 10% at $10.13. 
Bhardwaj, who Skillz describes as an experienced gaming executive, most recently served as the General Manager and Director of Game Tech for Amazon Web Services (AWS). 
While with AWS, Bhardwaj started one of the most significant open-source initiatives, Amazon GameSparks, Open 3D engine, growing Amazon Gamelift, and launching several new initiatives in gaming.

Investing.com – Trading in  Digital World Acquisition  stock (NASDAQ:DWAC) was halted several times Thursday while the stock soared 194% after the news of the SPAC’s merger with former U.S. President Donald Trump’s planned social media platform sent traders into a buying frenzy.
More than 323 million shares of the company had exchanged hands on the Nasdaq as of 1:05 PM ET.
A SPAC, or special purpose acquisition company, is a blank-check company that uses proceeds from an IPO to take private firms public. It is usually set up by high profile people with relevant industry experience and that’s what gets it the initial valuation with the subsequent transaction bringing it the final value.
DWAC was the most actively traded stock as of midday Thursday among NYSE and Nasdaq listings.
In a sign that it has the backing of the retail traders active on social media, the stock featured among the top 10 most popular names on Reddit’s WallStreetBets, whose members were behind the meteoric rise of meme stocks like GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC).
Trump Media & Technology Group announced the combination Wednesday. Trump also said he would roll out the platform ‘TRUTH Social,’ that he claims will “stand up to the tyranny of big tech.”
The press release announcing the deal said the Trump company will have “at an initial enterprise value of $875 million.""
DWAC was incorporated late last year, soon after Trump lost his re-election bid.

Renault expects to produce at least 300,000 fewer vehicles this year due to a global shortage of semiconductors, sources told Reuters earlier this week. Information provider IHS Markit estimates chip shortages could cost the global automotive industry around 11 million vehicles in lost production in 2021.
In a separate panel, other executives said there needs to be greater transparency and information sharing between automakers and their suppliers, even down to smaller sub-suppliers.

""We give out suppliers too often very short horizons of demand at very granular level,"" Volvo Cars' supply chain vice president, Martin Corner, said. ""Anything beyond the short-term horizon, we offer quite vanilla spread vehicle line averages. That creates a problem.""

1375,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2021 12:53PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. slows down oil and gas mergers - sources,"(Fixes reference to Shell/ConocoPhillips deal in penultimate paragraph)
By David French and Diane Bartz
NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. antitrust regulators have extended the approval process for at least five oil and gas mergers and acquisitions in the last three months, as President Joe Biden's administration scrutinizes deals in a bid to tackle soaring energy prices, according to regulatory filings and corporate lawyers.
The slowdown comes amid growing pressure on policymakers to respond to consumer angst over skyrocketing retail gasoline prices, as U.S. crude futures hit multi-year highs. The White House has been calling U.S. oil and gas producers to ask how they can help lower prices, Reuters reported last week.
The move is also emblematic of a new push by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to protect consumers, workers, the environment and society at large. Under its new chair Lina Khan, the antitrust regulator has taken a tough stance on deals ranging from technology to healthcare.
Such scrutiny is rare in the oil and gas sector, where deals typically sail past regulators, more than a dozen industry sources, including lawyers and bankers advising on energy deals, said in interviews. 
This is because these companies sell their output to a global market, and regional consolidation has no impact on energy prices dictated by supply and demand worldwide. 
Maureen Ohlhausen, chair of antitrust & competition law at Baker Botts LLP, who served as acting FTC chair from January 2017 until April 2018 under the previous Trump administration, called the scrutiny unprecedented.
""Even though previous Democratic FTC commissioners wanted active enforcement, the industry was told what the standards were, deals got reviewed and things moved along. This is really different,"" Ohlhausen said.
""I believe the FTC Chair, effectively, would like to deter mergers.""
An FTC spokesperson declined to comment.
The FTC is subjecting more deals to so-called second requests, seeking additional information and documents, the deal advisers said and the filings show. Second requests can delay regulatory clearance of deals by several months.
""I am aware of two mergers in the last couple of months where FTC staff did not see a need to issue a second request but were overruled by their management,"" said Darren Tucker, chair of the antitrust practice at law firm Vinson & Elkins LLP. He declined to name the two deals. 
Among the proposed transactions that received second requests in September were HollyFrontier Corp's $2.6 billion purchase of Sinclair Oil and Vertex Energy (NASDAQ:VTNR) Inc's $140 million sale of motor oil collection and recycling assets to Safety-Kleen Systems Inc, the regulatory filings show.
Private equity firm EnCap Investments' proposed $1.5 billion acquisition of oil and gas producer EP Energy also received a second request in recent weeks, according to people familiar with the matter.
EnCap and EP Energy did not respond to comment requests.
Sources indicated there were other transactions which have received second requests in recent weeks but declined to identify them.
Second requests involving oil and gas producers are rare, and it is more common for the FTC to scrutinize deals involving pipelines and gas stations. Pipeline operator  Energy Transfer  (NYSE:ET) LP said in May it received a second request on its proposed $7.2 billion takeover of Enable Midstream (NYSE:ENBL) Partners LP.
DEALMAKING RISKS
The FTC's scrutiny threatens to put the brakes on dealmaking in the oil patch, which had already dropped to $18.5 billion of mergers and acquisitions between U.S. oil and gas producers in the third quarter, down from $33.4 billion in the second quarter, according to data analytics firm Enverus.

The White House has been public with its requests for the FTC to act as the reopening of economies around the world in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic drives up energy consumption. Brian Deese, director of the National Economic Council, wrote to FTC Chair Khan in August asking her to investigate soaring energy prices.
Khan responded that the FTC will scrutinize consolidation among gas station operators, but also look at dealmaking in the energy industry more broadly.
The Biden White House has already irked the oil and gas industry by making climate change a priority in its administrative agenda. It temporarily halted the issuance of new leases for drilling on federal land and has proposed to end some fossil fuel subsidies. Energy companies argue these moves will push up energy costs.
To be sure, it is not clear whether the FTC will seek to block any of the energy deals it has subjected to second requests. 
The regulator has not challenged a major merger of oil and gas producers since BP (NYSE:BP) Plc's $27 billion acquisition of Atlantic Richfield Co in 2000. It sued to block the merger and only agreed to drop its objections after BP offered to divest oil production acreage in Alaska.

A major test for the FTC will be ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP)' proposed $9.5 billion acquisition of Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc's Permian Basin assets. It was announced last month, and any FTC second request would be made in the coming weeks.
Shell and ConocoPhillips declined comment.

Group revenue advanced to 2.48 billion euros ($2.89 billion), the Paris-based company said in a statement, beating the 2.26 billion euro Visible Alpha analyst consensus provided by Jefferies (NYSE:JEF). 
Sales at Canal Plus, now Vivendi's biggest business unit, rose 6.5%, boosted by its international activities and a 35% jump in revenue from Studiocanal, which produces and distributes Canal Plus movies, as cinemas reopened. 
With a market value of about 12 billion euros, Vivendi is worth a little more than a third of its value before the spin-off of Universal, its most-prized asset. 
The world's biggest music label, which represents musicians and song catalogues from Billie Eilish to The Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan, saw its market value leap to 45 billion euros ($52 billion) in Europe's largest listing of the year.

Vivendi still owns 10% of Universal and is also home to publishing group Editis and advertising group Havas. 
The group , which is controlled by French tycoon Vincent Bollore, didn't provide full-year targets.

1377,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2021 12:47PM ET</span>",Analysis-Booming private jet market stretches rich buyers as climate clouds gather,"By Allison Lampert
LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Private jet demand has boomed during the pandemic as the wealthy took control of their travel, yet the flight to luxury could have limited runway as some buyers spend beyond their means and the sector presents a prime target for climate critics. 
Bidding wars for second-hand planes and premiums for early delivery of new ones dominated chatter at the National Business Aviation Association's (NBAA) show in Las Vegas last week.
It's a boon for publicly traded corporate planemakers who are increasingly selling aircraft without the discounts that had become pervasive after the industry fell from favor in the 2008-2009 financial crisis.
General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD)'s Gulfstream Aerospace, Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF), Textron (NYSE:TXT) and Dassault Aviation are leaders by value of deliveries, which supplier Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON) values at $238 billion over the next decade.
""I'm hearing from people every day who are interested in getting into private aircraft,"" said Stephen Hofer, president of Aerlex Law Group, which does aircraft transactions.
But the influx of new entrants, often wealthy individuals and families who upgraded their travel from first-class airline tickets during the pandemic, brings some new risks. 
One veteran broker described a new buyer who had purchased a plane at prices he could only afford by leasing the aircraft for part of the time to other travelers. If leasing demand wanes, the buyer could have difficulty paying for the jet, warned the broker who spoke candidly on condition of anonymity. 
""These are people who have never got a $1 million maintenance bill before,"" said the broker, adding such practices are reminiscent of market activity before the 2008 crash.
Still, U.S. business jet flight hours rose 16% during early October compared with October 2019, itself the strongest month for activity since 2008, according to consultancy WingX. 
And many executives, analysts, aviation lawyers and brokers are confident the rebound will continue into 2022. 
""The activity rebound in 2021 is increasingly being seen as a green light for faster industry growth the next few years, not just a one-off bounce from the pandemic,"" said WingX Managing Director Richard Koe.
BUDGETING FOR CARBON
Deliveries are set to rise from around 700 a year now to roughly 900 by 2025, but still have room to grow given the peak 1,300 planes delivered in 2008, analyst Brian Foley said.
Business jet production will however be limited by supply-chain capacity, added Don Dwyer, co-managing partner of aircraft brokerage Guardian Jet. 
One unknown quantity is the amount of business-related travel, which is expected to take longer to recover than the leisure trips that underpin domestic U.S. airline traffic. 
Vinayak Hegde, president of private aviation company Wheels Up, said he was now seeing more senior executives traveling for business.
But some companies are backing away from travel and setting ""carbon budgets"" to reduce pollution, in a move that would weigh on airlines' business class and corporate jets, which generate more emissions per passenger. 
The industry is also battling to fend off questions over its environmental record. It hit the headlines recently when Prince Harry and Meghan Markle drew media criticism for using private jets despite their stance on climate change.
Investors in the industry want it to tackle the issue.
Kenneth Ricci, principal of Directional Aviation Capital, a private investment firm that funds and owns business aviation companies, warned that corporate aviation must take action on the environment or risk having it used against the industry.
""My biggest concern, the one I'm watching all the time is what we're going to do on sustainability,"" Ricci told a lunch event at the NBAA show. ""We need to be vocally ahead of this."" 
Business jet firms followed airlines last week in committing to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, but environmental campaigners say the pledges don't go far enough.

""Business aviation is at a crossroads,"" said Jo Dardenne, aviation manager for Brussels-based Transport & Environment.
""If the sector wants to reach zero emissions, it should accept governments mandating the use of clean technologies and taxing wealthy private jet users to finance their deployment.""

LONDON (Reuters) -BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, said on Thursday it had voted against the re-election of more than 800 company directors during an Asia-dominated third quarter for annual general meetings.
The biggest number of votes - 320 - was in response to concerns around the independence of the directors, with 227 votes for issues related to boardroom diversity, 113 for concerns around pay and 80 related to the directors having too many other jobs.
The votes followed 571 engagements with 520 separate companies, in line with the same period a year earlier, with governance the most-discussed topic, it said in a report.
Climate change and natural capital, which covers issues such as deforestation and water usage, were discussed in more than half of the meetings, it added.
With the bulk of European and North American AGMs held in the second quarter, Asia-Pacific companies accounted for more than half of the 2,430 meetings held in the three months to end-September, it said.
One of those to feel the heat from BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), which has sought to adopt a tougher approach on climate-related issues over the last year, was a member of the Risk Committee at India-based Adani Enterprises.
The company is currently developing a large coal mine in Australia, the Carmichael Mine, and BlackRock said the Committee should ""ultimately be held accountable"" for the resultant increased environmental risks.
BlackRock also said it had voted against a proposal to give the company's board discretion to raise up to around $335 million in fresh equity, citing concerns it could be used to fund such controversial projects.
Despite BlackRock's opposition, both passed comfortably given Adani Group's 75% stake in Adani Enterprises, it said.

""(BlackRock) remains concerned regarding the environmental and social risks associated with the Carmichael Mine project, Adani Enterprises’ increasing coal exposures and the company’s overall potential impact on key stakeholders,"" it said.
Adani Enterprises did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co sees a robust market for electric trucks and vans by 2030, but it is facing some early pushback from commercial customers that are a key audience for the automaker's new F-150 Lightning and E-Transit, a top executive said on Thursday.
The Lightning pickup and E-Transit van ""are targeted at real people doing real work,"" said Ted Cannis, chief executive of Ford Pro, at the Reuters Events Automotive Summit.
But some of those potential fleet buyers are taking a ""wait and see"" attitude, partly from a lack of experience with electric vehicles and partly from a lack of clarity on government policy and regulations around EVs.
Those are not insurmountable obstacles over the longer term, according to Cannis, who told Reuters:
“In the U.S., we see 70% of the full-size bus and van industry going electric by 2030. That’s more than 300,000 vehicles annually. And we expect a third of the full-size pickup (market) to go all-electric by 2030, which is more than 800,000 vehicles annually.” 
With electric work trucks and vans, Cannis said, fleet customers can save money on fuel, maintenance and repairs, ""but there is still a fear of the unknown"" about EVs among both employees and managers.

He said Ford is upbeat, however, about the reaction from potential buyers who have driven the Lightning and ""think it's the most exciting F-150 ever."" With 150,000 reservations from both fleet and retail customers, ""we have so much demand, I'm not sure how we can supply"" enough vehicles.
In August, Ford doubled its production target for the Lightning because of strong early demand for the truck ahead of its 2022 launch. Ford is targeting annual production of more than 80,000 vehicles in 2024, up from its prior target of more than 40,000, sources told Reuters.

(Reuters) -Valero Energy Corp predicted on Thursday low inventories and a recovery in fuel demand to pre-pandemic levels could support higher refining margins, shrugging off a recent rally in crude prices.
Gasoline and distillate consumption in the United States is back in line with five-year averages after more than a year of weak demand due to the pandemic that had also knocked refining capacity offline.
""Looking ahead, we continue to have a favorable outlook on refining margins as a result of low global product inventories, continued demand recovery and global balances supported by the significant refinery capacity rationalization seen over the last 1.5 years,"" Chief Executive Officer Joe Gorder said.
The bullish prediction could bode well when other major refiners, including Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) and Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) report in coming weeks.
The first major U.S. refiner to report quarterly earnings, Valero's third-quarter refining margin was $2.597 billion, compared with $952 million in the previous year.
Total U.S. light product inventories are at five-year lows, while demand is over 95% of 2019 levels, the company said in a call with analysts, forecasting gasoline and diesel consumption to return to pre-pandemic levels in 2022. 
Valero said its refining throughput, or the amount of crude it processed, rose 13.4% to 2.86 million barrels per day (bpd) in the quarter.
The company's shares rose 2.3% in morning trading, before paring gains. They have risen about 47% so far this year.
The company reported net income attributable to its stockholders at $463 million, or $1.13 per share, for the three months ended Sept. 30. Valero posted a loss of $464 million, or $1.14 per share, a year earlier.

Excluding items, Valero posted a profit of $1.22 per share, beating analysts' average estimate of 92 cents per share, according to Refinitiv IBES. 
San Antonio, Texas-based Valero also said the Diamond Green Diesel expansion project at its St. Charles, Louisiana refinery (DGD 2), projected to increases renewable diesel production capacity by 400 million gallons per year, was completed in the third quarter and is starting up.

Investing.com – Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) stock fell 1.4% on Thursday after the company reported a loss in the third quarter and said it expects the fourth to be no different.
The company expects the current quarter’s capacity as well as January to March’s to stay below comparable quarters in years before the pandemic.
The carrier’s operations were disrupted for at least five days in the second week of this month. Bad weather conditions, staff shortages and air traffic-related disruptions made it the worst-hit airline. About 2,000 Southwest flights were cancelled in that period.
The hit to the airline’s October revenue could be the tune of $75 million because of operational costs and customer refunds, the airline said. Another $40 million hit to the month’s revenue is expected due to the lingering effects of the pandemic.
“We have reined in our capacity plans to adjust to the current staffing environment . . .,"" Chief Executive Gary Kelly said.
Except for higher fuel prices, fourth quarter 2021's overall results are trending better than third quarter 2021, he said.
The company is experiencing cost increases primarily due to inflation in labor rates and airport costs, the company said. Vaccination incentive pay is also adding to costs.
As a result, overall costs are estimated to rise between 8% and 12% in the quarter through December from 2019-quarter levels.
Excluding items, the Dallas-based airline's net loss narrowed to $135 million from $1.17 billion in the same quarter a year ago. Total operating revenue of $4.7 billion was 161% higher than the 2020-quarter but still 17% lower from the 2019 figure.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa's biggest metalworkers union said on Thursday that it had accepted a three-year wage offer in the steel and engineering sector, paving the way for a strike to end.
NUMSA, which has around 155,000 members in the sector, launched the strike early this month to press for higher salaries in a move that hit output at carmaker BMW and threatened more auto assembly lines.
The union had demanded an 8% across-the-board wage rise from employers in the first year, and inflation plus 2% for the second and third years. 
But the Steel and Engineering Industries Federation of Southern Africa (SEIFSA) only offered 4.4% for 2021, inflation plus 0.5% in 2022 and inflation plus 1% in the third year, before talks broke down.
Annual inflation was running at 5.0% in September.
In a statement on Thursday, NUMSA said its deal with SEIFSA was for workers on the lowest pay grades to get an annual 6% increase on scheduled rates of pay for all three years, while higher-paid employees would get annual increases of between 5% and 5.5%. 

""With this settlement agreement for this round of negotiations, we are calling on all employer associations to accept that our members should return to work from Friday 22 October and no later than Monday,"" it said.
Had the strike dragged on much longer, there were fears it could have a major impact on South Africa's export-focused auto sector, which is trying to bounce back from a steep sales drop caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The market rose last week as banks opened the third-quarter earnings season with a bang. On Thursday, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) posted strong results before the opening bell, and stocks surged on the day.
Banks are increasingly writing more consumer loans as the economy grows. The fact that top banks exceeded expectations bodes well for the economy as banks are considered economic bellwethers.

1391,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2021 11:36AM ET</span>",EU regulator verdict on Moderna COVID-19 booster shot next week,"LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union's drug regulator expects to announce the results of its review of  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s COVID-19 booster vaccine next week and also to start a rolling review of Merck's antiviral oral pill, a senior official said on Thursday.
The results of the Moderna review will be announced on Oct. 25, Marco Cavaleri, head of vaccines strategy for the European Medicines Agency (EMA), told a briefing.
Cavaleri also said it was not clear whether Russia would submit an application for its one-dose coronavirus vaccine, known as Sputnik Light, in addition to one already submitted for its two-dose Sputnik V shot.
""We don't have really any clear understanding of whether (the Russian team) intends to submit an application also for this vaccine in the European Union, but we will continue the dialogue to get more clarity on this,"" he said.
The start of a formal review of the two-dose Sputnik V was confirmed in March https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-europe-vaccines-idUSKCN2AW0W8, but no decision has yet been announced.
Reuters reported on Thursday that the regulator was unlikely to decide whether to approve the Russian vaccine until at least the first quarter of 2022 because it still lacked some data required for the review.
This is in line with what the World Health Organization has said regarding delays in its Emergency Use Listing process.
BOOSTERS AND PILLS
The EMA's conclusion on boosters of Moderna's vaccine, Spikevax, is expected for use in people over 12 years of age and the shot is to be given six months after a second dose. 
The EMA said it expected to receive data on boosters of the single-shot Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) vaccine in the coming weeks. 
On Oct. 4, the watchdog gave the go-ahead for the Pfizer-BioNTech boosters and recommended a third dose of a shot from Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna for vulnerable people, leaving it to member states to decide for the rest.
U.S. authorities have authorised on Wednesday booster doses of Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and J&J.

While vaccines are the main weapon against COVID-19, Merck's experimental pill, which it is developing with partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, could be a game-changer after studies showed it could halve the chances of dying or being hospitalised for those most at risk of contracting severe illness. 
Britain has already secured a deal https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/britain-secures-covid-19-antivirals-merck-pfizer-2021-10-20 for the drug, molnupiravir, well before any approvals.

1392,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2021 11:36AM ET</span>",U.S. FAA seeks new minimum rest periods for flight attendants between shifts,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is proposing to require flight attendants receive at least 10 hours of rest time between shifts after Congress had directed the action in 2018, according to a document released on Thursday.
Airlines for America, a trade group representing major carriers including American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), United Airlines and others, had previously estimated the rule would cost its members $786 million over 10 years for the 66% of U.S. flight attendants its members employ, resulting from things like unpaid idle time away from home and schedule disruptions. 
Aviation unions told the FAA the majority of U.S. flight attendants typically do receive 10 hours of rest from airlines but urged the rule's quick adoption for safety and security reasons.
Under existing rules, flight attendants get at least 9 hours of rest time but it can be as little as 8 hours in certain circumstances.
""Flight attendants serve hundreds of millions of passengers on close to 10 million flights annually in the United States,"" the FAA said, adding that they ""perform safety and security functions while on duty in addition to serving customers.""
It cited reports about the ""potential for fatigue to be associated with poor performance of safety and security related tasks,"" including in 2017, when a flight attendant reported almost causing the gate agent to deploy an emergency exit slide, which was attributed to fatigue and other issues.
The FAA estimated the regulation could prompt the industry to hire another 1,042 flight attendants and cost $118 million annually. If hiring assumptions were cut in half, it said, that would cut estimated costs by over 30%.
After the FAA published an advance notice of the planned rules in 2019, Delta announce it would mandate the 10-hour rest requirement by February 2020.
FAA Administrator Steve Dickson is testifying at a U.S. House Transportation subcommittee hearing on Thursday.
House Transportation Committee chairman Peter DeFazio said on Wednesday that it was ""unacceptable"" to delay the FAA adopting the flight attendant rest rule and mandating secondary flight deck barriers to better protect the cockpits on all newly manufactured airliners.
Attorneys at the FAA ""need a little poke"" to move faster on rules when ordered by Congress, DeFazio said on Thursday at the hearing. ""Do not screw around with it for three years... you just do it.""
Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants representing 50,000 workers at 17 airlines, said the rule was critical.
""Flight attendant fatigue is real. COVID has only exacerbated the safety gap with long duty days, short night, and combative conditions on planes,"" she said. ""Congress mandated 10 hours irreducible rest in October 2018, but the prior administration put the rule on a process to kill it.""

During the pandemic, flight attendants have dealt with records numbers of disruptive, occasionally violent passenger incidents, with the FAA citing 4,837 unruly passenger reports, including 3,511 for refusing to wear a mask since Jan. 1.
The FAA proposes to make the new flight attendant rest rules final 30 days after it publishes its final rules.

(Reuters) -AT&T Inc posted higher quarterly revenue and more cell phone subscribers on Thursday, bolstered by higher demand for its internet service and growing streaming platform HBO Max. 
The U.S. wireless carrier has been unraveling its years-long journey to become an entertainment powerhouse and moving faster to chop debt and invest in its 5G wireless network to provide quicker phone and internet services.
The actions are paying off as it added 928,000 net new phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill during the third quarter, well above consensus expectations of 560,000, according to data from research firm FactSet.
Rival carrier Verizon (NYSE:VZ) added 429,000 subscribers in its latest quarter.
Total revenue was $39.9 billion in the third quarter, exceeding analysts' average estimate of $39.14 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company has put more money into its growing fiber home internet business, and added 289,000 net new subscribers.
AT&T (NYSE:T) aims to grow its pace of fiber expansion to serve 5 million new homes per year, up from its current goal of 3 million per year, Chief Executive Officer John Stankey told analysts during a conference call.
Premium TV channel HBO and streaming service HBO Max had steady growth as viewers flocked to new television shows like ""White Lotus"", and movies ""Space Jam: A New Legacy"" and ""The Suicide Squad."" Total global subscribers for both services grew by 1.9 million from the previous quarter to 69.4 million.
U.S. subscribers for the services totaled 45.2 million during the third quarter, down from 47 million in the previous quarter, after HBO was removed from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime Video in September.
WarnerMedia Chief Executive Officer Jason Kilar told Reuters the company would ultimately benefit from cultivating direct customer relationships, rather than serving as a wholesaler to Amazon.
""It sets us up for a larger, more valuable, business,"" he said. ""Although it is the harder path, we think it's the better path for the business.""
Revenue for WarnerMedia was $8.4 billion during the quarter.
Net income attributable to the company's common stock rose to $5.9 billion, or 82 cents per share, from $2.8 billion, or 39 cents, a year earlier. 
Excluding items, AT&T earned 87 cents per share, beating analyst estimates of 78 cents.
AT&T's total debt was $179.2 billion as of Sept. 30.

The company said it expects full-year adjusted earnings per share to be at the high end of the low- to mid-single digit growth range. It also expects to reach the higher end of its HBO and HBO Max global subscriber target of between 70 million to 73 million by the end of this year.
The company still expects the WarnerMedia unit spin off to close in mid-2022.

Global carmakers are investing billions to accelerate a transition to low-emission mobility, pushing parts makers to adapt their production, with electric engines requiring less and often different components from traditional combustion ones.
Most of the Italian parts suppliers surveyed by Italian automotive industry lobby ANFIA did not give a final judgment about consequences of the creation of Stellantis, the world's fourth largest carmaker. 
But it showed a majority of those who responded think their size could put them under pressure from the bigger carmaker to adapt to its demands.
""There is a problem with size and this is an issue, especially in terms of investments, when businesses need to refocus their productions,"" said Marco Stella, head of the components sector at ANFIA, noting that Italy did not have large car part suppliers like Germany. 
""Small size affects their ability to respond to challenges posed by industry changes"".
However, many of the respondents in the survey still saw the merger as an opportunity, in particular for wider access to markets the group can guarantee, the report said. 
Francesco Zirpoli of Venice Ca' Foscari University, who contributed to the report, said the fortunes of Italy's car part suppliers would be tightly linked to how Stellantis manages the overlap between its former Fiat Chrysler and PSA European supply chains.

""Italian car parts makers are struggling to update their offer through R&D investments,"" he said.
The report showed Italian car parts industry comprised around 2,200 companies, with total revenue of almost 45 billion euros ($52 billion) last year. Around 42% of it came from sales to Stellantis.

And the growing therapeutic and recreational use of marijuana should keep driving the industry’s growth. Hence, we think fundamentally sound cannabis stocks Curaleaf (CURLF), Green Thumb (GTBIF), Trulieve Cannabis (OTC:TCNNF), and Cresco Labs (OTC:CRLBF) could now be worth adding to one’s watchlist. Also, Wall Street analysts have rated these stocks ‘Strong Buy.’ Read on.The cannabis industry has been the beneficiary of legalization moves in the U.S. lately. Increasing demand for the therapeutic benefits of cannabis, accelerating legislative headway, and an increase in consumers’ acceptance of innovative cannabis products have been fueling the cannabis market’s growth. The global market for legal marijuana is expected to reach $100 billion by 2027, registering a 19% CAGR. Also, the U.S. cannabis market is projected to reach $115 billion by 2030.
Although restricted access to capital and a stigma surrounding cannabis usage are still concerns, the SAFE Banking Act brings some relief. This bill, which was approved by a voice vote in the lower house as part of the broader National Defense Authorization Act, allows banks to do business with cannabis companies without fear of penalty.
Therefore, we think it could be wise to now add quality cannabis stocks Curaleaf Holdings, Inc. (OTC:CURLF),  Green Thumb Industries Inc . (OTC:GTBIF), Trulieve Cannabis Corp. (TCNNF) and Cresco Labs Inc. (CRLBF) to one’s watchlist. Also, Wall Street analysts rated these stocks ‘Strong Buy.’

The report prompted Volkswagen shares to rise 3% to the top of Frankfurt's blue-chip DAX index, reflecting hopes that such a move could unlock tens of billions of euros in value hidden under the carmaker's complex conglomerate structure.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), in a note last week, put Porsche's enterprise value at about 75 billion euros ($87 billion), accounting for more than half that of Volkswagen.
People familiar with the matter had told Reuters in May that the Porsche and Piech families, who control Volkswagen's largest shareholder Porsche SE, are prepared to take a direct stake in Porsche AG should the luxury carmaker be separately listed.
While sources say that Europe's largest carmaker continues to work on scenarios for a separation or listing, no decision has been made on whether such a move - which could fetch tens of billions of euros - will happen.
""The Volkswagen Group is constantly reviewing options that serve the development and implementation of the corporate strategy and raise the company's value,"" a Volkswagen spokesperson said, declining to comment further.
Goldman and Freshfields both declined to comment.

Asked about the idea of a Porsche listing, talk of which has surfaced regularly in recent years, Volkswagen Chief Executive Herbert Diess in July said that while the group continued to review its set-up, a planned battery ramp-up was the priority.

Investing.com — Several analysts cut their price targets on Biogen Inc's (NASDAQ:BIIB) shares after concerns about Aduhelm sales following the company's third quarter earnings report.
The biotechnology firm posted a revenue and EPS beat on Wednesday morning. Revenue came in at $2.78 billion, above the consensus of $2.67 billion, while its EPS was reported at $4.77, above the expected $4.11. 
However, it sold just $300,000 worth of its controversial Alzheimer's drug Aduhelm, falling way short of analyst predictions. 
Oppenheimer analyst Jay Olson reduced the firm's price target on Biogen to $390 from $450 but kept an outperform rating on the shares. Likewise, Cowen's Phil Nadeau dropped his firm's price target on Biogen to $375 from $450 with an outperform rating, as did RBC Capital analyst Brian Abrahams, who lowered the price target on Biogen to $295 from $325, and Piper Sandler analyst Christopher Raymond lowered Biogen's price target to $390 from $460, keeping an overweight rating.
All four analysts cited the sales of Aduhelm as the reason for the price target decrease, with Piper Sandler's Raymond stating that the Aduhelm launch was ""even worse than feared."" 
However, despite the downgrades, Biogen's share price has remained resilient, up over 1.2% on Thursday, following Wednesday's 0.58% decline. "

(Reuters) -Quest Diagnostics Inc on Thursday warned that demand for COVID-19 molecular testing will slow down through the end of 2021 as infections decline, but a recovery in its core testing business will likely cushion the blow. 
Shares of the U.S. laboratory reversed course and fell 3.5% to $141.75 in early trading after it said it expects to record about 50,000 molecular tests per day in the fourth quarter. The company averaged 83,000 tests a day in the third quarter.
COVID-19 testing volumes in the United States had slumped in the first half of this year, but demand rose once again in recent months due to the spread of the Delta variant, leading employers and schools to implement strict screening programs. 
As a result, Quest raised its annual revenue and profit forecasts on Thursday after it beat third-quarter estimates for quarterly results. 
The company, however, said the average test volumes have declined nearly 10% so far in October, compared with third quarter-end and will fall further. 
""While COVID testing has been strongly contributing to growth, we expect our base direct-to-consumer testing revenue to more than double this year,"" Quest Chief Executive Officer Stephen Rusckowsk said. 
The comments come a day after rival diagnostic company  Abbott Laboratories  (NYSE:ABT) also raised its earnings forecast for the year as demand for COVID-19 tests, especially rapid testing, rebounded.

Quest raised its full-year profit outlook to $13.50 to $13.90, from $11.65 to $12.35. Analysts on an average estimate $11.93.

The company, known for its rubber clogs, said on Thursday it would move production to China, Indonesia and Bosnia, from Vietnam which had become a manufacturing hub for many companies across the world, especially apparel.
Crocs had planned on 70% of its production coming from Vietnam in 2021, before deciding to move out some output, Chief executive Officer Andre Rees said on an analyst call. The company did not say how much production it was moving out of the country.
Many factories in Vietnam's manufacturing hubs have been shut or are operating with drastically fewer on-floor workers since mid-July due to a surge in Delta variant cases, hitting supplies of major clothing companies including  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE), Abercrombie & Fitch and Adidas AG (DE:ADSGN).
Nike has warned of delays during the crucial holiday shopping season due to supply issues and said it would take several months to resume full production in Vietnam, where about half its footwear is produced.
Crocs, meanwhile, said it would be able to ramp production back up quickly due to the simplicity of its shoes. The company added that it was also avoiding port delays on the U.S. West coast by switching to East coast docks. 

It expects revenue for fiscal 2021 to rise 62% to 65%, up from its prior forecast of a 60% to 65% increase.
Revenue for the third quarter ended Sept. 30 jumped 73% to $625.9 million, topping analysts' average estimate of $610 million, according to Refinitiv IBES, as the company benefited from higher prices and fewer discounts.

Investing.com –  Las Vegas Sands  stock (NYSE:LVS) slipped 2.5% Thursday as business at its properties in Singapore and Macao remained muted and that held the casino operator’s third-quarter numbers behind estimates.
The company said visits to its Macao and Singapore markets “remains well below historical levels due to travel restrictions related to Covid-19”.
According to Las Vegas Sands, traffic was higher when restrictions were eased, thus reflecting continued customer demand but the business is still far anywhere close to the pre-pandemic levels.
In Macao, the company said visits were at around 18% of 2019 levels. Mass gaming revenue reached nearly 31% of 2019 third-quarter-mark, it said.
Similarly, the company’s Marina Bay Sands property in Singapore was shut for two weeks in July to August and movement was restricted. All this hurt its business.
This March, the company entered into an around $6.25-billion deal to sell its Las Vegas real estate and operations to private equity Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO). The transaction is anticipated to close in the first quarter of 2022, LVS said.
LVS has marked Singapore, Macao and South Korea as principal areas of future development interest.
Third-quarter net revenue fell a little short of doubling to $857 million from $446 million in the prior-year quarter. The operating loss narrowed to $316 million from $523 million."

As a result, the stock fell 4% in price in early trading on Wednesday after its quarterly report delivered a negative earnings surprise.
The company’s $5.09 billion in third-quarter revenue fell short of the $5.34 billion consensus estimate, due to the current supply chain crisis and high raw material costs. These conditions could negatively impact the company’s share price in the near term.

So, let’s discuss these names.Despite worries surrounding rising inflation, the Fed’s signal that it will tighten monetary policy, and surging COVID-19 cases, investor optimism is evident in the recent performances of the major stock market indexes. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose to a new record on October 20, touching its 35,669.69 all-time high. And the S&P 500 delivered a six-day winning streak, approaching a record on Oct 20. The index gained 16.56 points to hit 4,536.19, which was less than 0.2% short of its record high. Chief investment strategist at CFRA, Sam Stovall, expects the S&P 500 to hit a new record high.
One of the prime factors driving the market’s rally is impressive third-quarter earnings reports from S&P 500 companies. According to a FactSet report, the net profit margin for the S&P 500 member companies for the third quarter of 2021 is 12.3% (combining the numbers reported so far and the estimates), which compares to a 10.9% five-year average net profit margin. Analysts expect third-quarter earnings to jump 35% year-over-year.
Given the market’s uptrend, we think that quality stocks Telefónica, S.A. (TEF), and Crescent Point Energy Corp. (NYSE:CPG), which are currently trading at less than $10, could be good additions to one’s portfolio now.

The health agency said earlier in October that data pointed to an increase of myocarditis and pericarditis among youths and young adults vaccinated with Moderna vaccine Spikevax, and paused the use for all born 1991 or later. 
The agency said on Thursday the pause would be extended beyond the original deadline of Dec. 1 and those who had taken a first dose of the Moderna vaccine would be offered the Comirnaty vaccine from Pfizer/Biontech instead. 
The European Medicines Agency approved the use of Comirnaty in May, while Spikevax was given the nod for children aged over 12 in July. 
The health agency also said it was time to cease wide-scale testing and will remove the recommendation for testing for those who are fully vaccinated, even if they are displaying symptoms. 
""We must test those who are most at risk of being infected with COVID-19. The vaccine protects well, above all against severe disease but also against infection and the spread of infection,"" health agency official Britta Bjorkholm told a news conference. 
Around 85% of all Swedes aged 16 and up have had one dose of vaccine and 80% have had two shots or more.
The new testing guidelines come into effect on Nov. 1. People who are patients or working in healthcare should still get tested, as should those who have been in contact with someone confirmed to be positive.

Of 139,651 tests last week, 3% came back positive.
Sweden, which opted against wide-ranging lockdowns and relied mostly on voluntary recommendations throughout the pandemic, has relatively low levels of cases, hospitalisations and deaths currently compared with other European countries.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The chief executive of Just Eat Takeaway.com said on Thursday he expects newly acquired Grubhub to eventually be part of a consolidation in the U.S. delivery market, but signalled he is not currently open to selling the business. 
""Over time there will inevitably be consolidation in the wider U.S. on-demand delivery market, as various players combine to optimise the last mile,"" Jitse Groen told investors in a livestreamed presentation.
Company management ""expects Grubhub to be involved in this consolidation when it comes and intends to do so from a position of strength"".
Asked whether he would consider selling or combining the whole of Grubhub's business, which Takeaway bought for $7.3 billion in June, Groen demurred. 
""Grubhub is fresh,"" he said, but added that ""anything that makes Grubhub a stronger player - we'll look at it"".
Takeaway's shares are down 25% so far this year, in part due to the company losing market share in U.S. suburbs and after New York City, its biggest and strongest market, imposed a cap on the commission food-delivery companies can charge restaurants.
Investors have called on the company to address its competitive position in the United States - where Grubhub is pitted against Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats and DoorDash among others - including by considering selling parts of its operations. They also want Takeaway to clarify its strategy on grocery delivery, where it competes strongly with Amazon-backed Deliveroo in Europe.
In a presentation, Takeaway it said it would target Gross Transaction Value growth - a common measure in e-commerce - in the ""mid teens"" for 2022.
The company repeated its full-year 2021 forecast for an earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) margin of -1%-1.5% on a gross transaction value of 28 billion-30 billion euros ($32 billion-$35 billion). That translates to an EBITDA loss of 280 million-380 million euros.
For 2022, the company told investors to expect the negative margin to improve to -0.6% to -0.8%, and that it expects a positive margin in ""long term"" as GTV doubles over the next five years.

Bernstein analysts, who rate Takeaway shares ""Outperform"", said in a note that the 2022 guidance was lower than expected but ""we remain positive about the position of Takeaway in its core markets.""
Shares recovered some of their early losses after Groen's remarks and were trading down 0.6% at 71.36 euros at 1253GMT.

1413,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2021 09:45AM ET</span>",China Evergrande secures bond extension as property sector turmoil deepens,"By Clare Jim and Andrew Galbraith
HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) -China Evergrande Group has secured more time to pay a defaulted bond, financial provider REDD reported on Thursday, offering rare respite to the developer even as a debt crisis in the broader property sector deepened with more defaults.
News of the three month-plus extension came a day after Evergrande scrapped a deal to sell a 50.1% stake, worth $2.6 billion, in a property services unit that could have eased some immediate pressure on the firm.
Evergrande was once China's top-selling developer but is now reeling under more than $300 billion of debt, prompting government officials to seek to reassure markets that the firm's problems won't spin out of control.
A deepening liquidity crisis, however, continued to reverberate across China's property sector, with more default announcements, and many companies saw their bonds slip again on Thursday after they had rallied this week.
Kaisa Group's most imminent offshore bond, which is due on Dec. 7, fell 10 cents to about 60 cents on the dollar, 40% below face value, after a Hong Kong developer dumped $30 million worth of its bonds.
Kaisa was the first Chinese developer to default back in 2015 and the Evergrande crisis has put it back in the spotlight.
Citing unidentified bondholders, REDD said Evergrande had been granted a more than three-month extension to a $260-million bond, issued by Jumbo Fortune Enterprises and guaranteed by Evergrande, after agreeing to provide extra collateral. 
The bond had been due to mature on Oct. 3.
A source familiar with the matter said Evergrande Chairman Hui Ka Yan had agreed to pump personal wealth into a Chinese residential project tied to the bond to ensure it gets completed, paving the way for bondholders to get their dues.
The bondholders agreed to the proposal to avoid a messy collapse of the developer or a drawn-out legal battle, the source told Reuters. Evergrande did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
The development comes just ahead of the expiry of a 30-day grace period for Evergrande to pay $83.5 million in coupon payments for an offshore bond, at which time, if it cannot pay, China's most indebted developer would be considered in default.
Evergrande, in an exchange filing on Wednesday, said the grace periods for the payment of the interest on its U.S. dollar-denominated bonds that were due in September and October had not expired. It did not elaborate.
It added it would continue to negotiate for the renewal or extension of its borrowings or other alternative arrangements with its creditors.
The scrapped $2.6 billion unit sale ""has made it even more unlikely for it (Evergrande) to pull a rabbit out of a hat at the last minute"", said a lawyer representing some creditors, requesting anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the media. 
""Given where things are with the missed payments and the grace period running out soon, people are bracing for a hard default.""
CONTAGION RISK
Statements from Evergrande peers on Thursday exacerbated investor concerns of contagion in the $5 trillion Chinese property sector that accounts for a quarter of the country's economy by some metrics.
Since the government started clamping down on corporate debt in 2017, many real estate developers turned to off-balance-sheet vehicles to borrow money and skirt regulatory scrutiny, analysts and lawyers said.
Oceanwide Holdings International Development, a unit of developer Oceanwide Holdings, said on Thursday its notes due Oct. 31, worth $134 million, had defaulted.
Modern Land China Co Ltd said it had ceased seeking consent from investors to extend the maturity date of a dollar bond due on Oct. 25, and that it planned to engage an adviser to solve its liquidity issues. 
The company's Hong Kong-listed shares were suspended from trading on Thursday, while its bonds slumped. Its 11.95% March 2024 bond traded down nearly 20% at below 21 cents, according to data provider Duration Finance.
Modern Land's decision weighed on investors' mood, said Clarence Tam, fixed income portfolio manager at Avenue Asset Management in Hong Kong. ""The market is worried all single-B companies will choose not to pay,"" he said, referring to a credit rating level.
Investor concerns were not confined to offshore markets. 
A September 2023 bond from developer Aoyuan Group Co was the biggest faller among corporate bonds on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, according to exchange data, dropping 10% to 88.65 yuan.
Ratings agency Fitch downgraded Central China Real Estate to ""B+"" from ""BB-"" with a negative outlook on Thursday, following a similar action by Moody's (NYSE:MCO).
Fitch said China's attempts to keep tighter risk controls for the property sector without magnifying a growth slowdown illustrated the difficult trade-offs policymakers are facing.
If policy easing is too cautious, stress could spread to other parts of the economy and the financial system, while a substantial credit loosening could set back efforts to control financial risks, it added.
DEAL FAILURE 
Trading in the Hong Kong-listed shares of Evergrande and Evergrande Property Services Group Ltd resumed on Thursday after a more than two-week suspension pending the announcement of the now-failed stake sale.
Evergrande closed down 12.5% and the services unit dropped 8%, while Evergrande's electric vehicle arm eased 2%. 
Shares in Hopson Development Holdings Ltd, which was in talks to buy the services unit stake, rose 7.6%. 
Both sides traded blame for the deal failure, with Hopson saying Evergrande had asked it to make ""substantial changes"" to agreed terms. Evergrande said on Wednesday it had reason to believe Hopson had not met the ""prerequisite to make a general offer,"" without elaborating.

The deal is Evergrande's second to collapse amid a scramble to raise cash. Sources told Reuters last week the $1.7 billion sale of the developer's Hong Kong headquarters had failed.
Evergrande also said on Wednesday that, barring its sale of a stake worth $1.5 billion in Chinese lender Shengjing Bank Co, it had made no material progress in selling other assets.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mostly lower on Thursday, unimpressed by another week of initial jobless claims under 300,000 and undecided over the quality of the earnings being reported by the country's blue-chip stocks.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), medical device group Danaher (NYSE:DHR) and railroad operator  Union Pacific  (NYSE:UNP) all fell despite reporting earnings that were, at first glance at least, better than street forecasts, while PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) continued to suffer from concerns about its mooted merger with Pinterest (NYSE:PINS), and  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) stock slumped after reporting another underwhelming quarter.
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 99 points, or 0.3%, while the S&P 500 was down 0.2% and the NASDAQ Composite was up 0.1%. 
Tesla stock quickly reversed, however, as the market quickly digested any caution implicit in the company's guidance, which contrasted with the strong figures reported. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and RBC all raised their price targets on the stock after an analyst call from which CEO Elon Musk was absent. 
The most eye-catching gainer in early trading was  Digital World Acquisition  (NASDAQ:DWAC), which rose 39% after former President Donald Trump announced he would merge his new social media platform, TRUTH Social, with the recently-listed SPAC.  
AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) stock was another gainer, the media and telecoms giant rising 0.6% after it reported adding over 900,000 net new mobile subscribers in the quarter, more than double the comparable figure from Verizon (NYSE:VZ) earlier in the week. Subscriptions at HBO Max also held up globally, despite falling in the U.S. as it was removed from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Prime service.
Earlier, the Labor Department had said that initial jobless claims inched down to a new post-pandemic low of 290,000, from an upwardly-revised 296,000 the previous week. Continuing claims also hit a post-pandemic low of 2.48 million. That lent some reassurance as regards the strength of the labor market, and it was corroborated by the employment index in the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's monthly survey of business conditions. The new orders component also rose sharply, pushing the business conditions index up to 30.8, while the prices paid index rose to above 70, a level it had only crossed twice in 40 years before this year's recovery.
Elsewhere, BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) stock rose 3.2% but  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) stock fell 0.7% after the two companies reported a high efficacy rate for booster shots of its Covid-19 vaccine in a large-scale clinical test. The fading of protection against Covid-19 over time was the reason behind the Food and Drug Administration's decision to approve 'booster shots' of vaccines made by  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) on Wednesday, expanding the addressable market for both drugs."

Tesla CEO Elon Musk said at a visit to the factory site in Gruenheide on Oct. 9 that he hoped to begin production in November, which looks increasingly unlikely as authorities first need to review the latest submissions before deciding whether to grant approval.
The repeated process, only open to those who expressed an objection in previous public consultation rounds but were not satisfied with the response from Tesla or the environmental ministry, will run from Nov. 2-22, the statement said.
A Tesla spokesperson said the company was maintaining its target to begin producing cars before the end of the year and then ramp up as quickly as possible.
Authorities decided to repeat the process after environmental groups disputed in a separate case also moved online that citizens were not warned far enough in advance that the consultation would be digital, prompting concern that the same applied to the Tesla consultation.
""Since, in the absence of sample cases, it is difficult to assess which legal opinion the administrative courts in Brandenburg would adopt in the event of a lawsuit, the licensing authority decided to repeat the online consultation in the emissions control procedure for the vehicle factory for reasons of legal certainty,"" it said.
Objections submitted in the previous round will still be valid, the statement said.

In his two-year battle to get production running at the site, Musk has expressed irritation at German laws and processes, arguing complex planning requirements were at odds with the urgency needed to fight climate change.
The factory and adjacent battery plant are set to produce at least 500,000 battery-electric vehicles a year and generate 50 Gwh of capacity, outstripping German competitors on both fronts.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Dutch government's forensic lab said on Thursday it had decrypted electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's closely guarded driving data-storage system, uncovering a wealth of information that could be used to investigate serious accidents. 
It was already known that Tesla cars store data from accidents, but the Netherlands Forensic Institute (NFI) said it had discovered far more data than investigators had previously been aware of. 
The NFI said the decrypted data showed Tesla vehicles store information about the operation of its driver assistance system, known as Autopilot. The vehicles also record speed, accelerator pedal position, steering wheel angle and brake usage, and depending on how the vehicle is used, that data can be stored for over a year. 
""These data contain a wealth of information for forensic investigators and traffic accident analysts and can help with a criminal investigation after a fatal traffic accident or an accident with injury,"" Francis Hoogendijk, a digital investigator at the NFI, said in a statement.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Dutch lab said rather than seek the data from Tesla, it had ""reverse engineered"" data logs - a process where software is deconstructed to extract information - present in Tesla vehicles ""in order to objectively investigate them.""
'WHO IS RESPONSIBLE?'
The NFI investigated a collision involving a Tesla driver using Autopilot and a car in front of it that suddenly braked hard. 
The investigation showed the Tesla driver reacted within the expected response time to a warning to resume control of the car, but the collision occurred because the Tesla was following the other vehicle too closely in busy traffic. 
""That makes it interesting, because who is responsible for the following distance: the car or the driver?"" said NFI investigator Aart Spek. 
The NFI said Tesla encrypts its coded driving data to keep its technology secure from other manufacturers and protect driver privacy. Car owners can request their data, including camera footage, in the event of an accident.
Earlier this year, Tesla said it had established a site in China to store car data locally, as automakers came under growing scrutiny over how they handle information collected by vehicle cameras and sensors. 
DECRYPTION REVEALED MORE DATA
The NFI found that Tesla had complied with data requests from the Dutch authorities, but left out a lot of data that could have proven useful.
""Tesla however only supplies a specific subset of signals, only the ones requested, for a specific timeframe, whereas the log files contain all the recorded signals,"" the NFI's report said.
By decrypting Tesla's code, the NFI now knows more about what kind of data the carmaker is storing and for how long, allowing for more detailed data requests, Hoogendijk said.
""You cannot claim what you do not know, so it's helpful that we now know what else is being stored,"" he said. 
Hoogendijk added this also applies to other carmakers, as investigators simply do not know how much and what kind of data manufacturers store and for how long.
Tesla has remote access to the data, the lab said, which is periodically uploaded from cars and used by the company for product improvements or to fix malfunctions.
The NFI said it had obtained data from Tesla models S, Y, X and the mass-market Model 3 and shared the results at a conference of the European Association for Accident Research so that other accident analysts can use it. 

In August, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened a formal safety probe into Tesla's Autopilot system in 765,000 U.S. vehicles after a series of crashes involving Tesla models and emergency vehicles.
To date, NHTSA has identified 12 crashes that involved Tesla vehicles using the advanced driver-assistance systems and emergency vehicles. NHTSA said most of the incidents took place after dark.

David Hall wrote to investors, in a letter seen by Reuters, that the board made ""strategic missteps"" and that he hopes to replace board chairman Michael Dee and director Christopher Thomas at the 2022 annual meeting.
""I will not allow Velodyne Lidar to continue to stagnate under current leadership,"" Hall wrote, adding ""I intend to nominate two highly-qualified director candidates.""
Hall who stepped off the board in February after the company stripped him of his executive chairmanship position, owns roughly 52% of the company along with his wife, Marta Hall, who serves on the company's seven-member board.
Next year's annual meeting date has not been set and investors will not be able to officially nominate director candidates until early February, 2022.
A representative for the company was not immediately available for comment.
Hall's letter and plans mark the latest twist in a boardroom drama that began soon after the company went public with a special purpose acquisition company in 2020. The company's chief executive officer Anand Gopalan left the company at the end of July and he has not been replaced. 

Hall's letter accuses the board of ""embracing performance mediocracy, large salaries and other egregious compensation practices instead of developing an actionable plan to stem value destruction""
The company's stock price has tumbled 59% in the last 52 weeks. The company is the leading supplier of lidar, an acronym for light detection and ranging, which uses laser beams to create a 3D representation of the surveyed environment and is critical for self-driving cars, for example.

(Reuters) -Unilever warned inflation was likely to accelerate next year and its prices would have to rise further as consumer goods companies battle to offset surging energy and other costs.
The maker of Dove soap and Knorr soup beat third-quarter sales growth forecasts on Thursday and kept its full-year profit margin guidance, defying some analysts' fears of a cut. 
However, finance chief Graeme Pitkethly saw little let up in inflationary pressures, in a potential blow to central bankers who are hoping the current spike in prices will be transitory.
""We expect inflation could be higher next year than this year,"" he said on a media call, adding it was likely to peak in the first half of 2022 and moderate thereafter. 
The maker of Ben & Jerry's ice cream said underlying sales rose 2.5% in the three months ended Sept. 30, above the 2.2% forecast by analysts in a company supplied consensus.
Growth was helped by demand in the United States, India, China and Turkey, while a 4.1% increase in prices more than offset a 1.5% decline in volumes.
The price hike was up sharply from the 1.6% increase in the second quarter and Pitkethly warned there would be another step up in the fourth quarter that would continue into the first half of next year.
Rivals Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Nestle said this week they too would raise prices further.
But analysts say Unilever (NYSE:UL) faces a particularly tough task due to its greater exposure to emerging markets, where inflation is the fiercest and there are signs of consumers shifting towards cheaper local brands.
In the three months to Sept. 30, Unilever said sales of deodorants, skin care products and take-away ice-creams increased as improved vaccination rates in developed markets encouraged more people to venture out.
More than two-thirds of the overall volume declines came from South East Asia, where a rise in cases of the Delta variant of the coronavirus forced governments to implement stringent lockdowns that curbed consumption. 
At 1203 GMT, Unilever shares were up 1.5% in a FTSE 100 index down 0.5%. 
""Relative to low expectations this feels like a 'good enough' quarter to us, with decisive progress on pricing a positive for us in the current climate. But the underlying challenge remains the one of accelerating volume growth,"" said Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Martin Deboo. 
PRICE RISES 
Consumer goods companies face soaring prices of raw materials such as energy, edible oils and packaging, as well as higher transport costs as economies recover from the pandemic. 
Inflation in the consumer goods industry has been running in the high-teens, though Unilever said it was seeing a lower impact because of its negotiating power and hedging.
Markets including Mexico, the Middle East and Russia faced some of the highest prices hikes in the quarter, but volumes were barely impacted there, CEO Alan Jope said on an investor call. 
Helped by the price rises, Unilever said it was sticking with its latest full-year operating margin forecast. In July, it had cut the forecast to ""about flat"" from ""slightly up.""
Palm and soybean oil and crude oil derivatives such as resin were some of key areas of cost pressures, while ocean freight costs were 10-15 times higher than late 2019, it added. 
Amid logistics challenges such as port logjams, Unilever is keeping buffer stocks in some categories to maintain on-shelf availability at retailers which has been over 96% for core brands in its top 10 markets, up 70 basis points from last year and ""above average"" compared to its peers, the group said.
Volumes fell by a high single-digit percentage in South East Asia, despite ""negligible"" price rises in the region, which contributes to about 14% of Unilever's turnover. 

The company also saw consumers there shift towards cheaper brands, which has stepped up competition in markets such as Indonesia.

Demand for the company's chemicals, used in everything from plastic and food packaging to textiles, electronics and paints, has bounced back as industrial and automotive activity recovers from pandemic lows. 
Meanwhile, Hurricane Ida, which lashed the U.S. Gulf Coast in August, forced Dow and other chemical makers to shut some operations, tightening already low supplies and boosting prices.
""We continue to see robust end-market demand that is expected to extend into 2022, coupled with near-term logistics constraints and low inventory levels"", Chief Executive Officer Jim Fitterling said in a statement. 
Dow forecast fourth-quarter net sales of between $14 billion and $14.5 billion, above estimates of $13.53 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Still, the company warned net sales in its packaging and specialty plastics, coatings, as well as industrials unit, to be flat to down 3%, from the third quarter, due to higher raw materials and energy costs, as well as logistics constraints.
Overall prices climbed 50% in the third quarter from a year earlier, while volume rose 2%, Dow said on Thursday 
The company's shares were up 1.5% at $60.82 in premarket trading, set to add to the about 8% gain so far this year.

Net operating income, which excludes certain items, rose to $2.07 billion, or $2.75 per share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, from $376 million, or 50 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts had estimated earnings of $2.55 per share.
Net sales of $14.84 billion was above estimates of $14.28 billion.

ZURICH (Reuters) -ABB expects the supply chain crunch to continue into next year, the Swiss engineering group said on Thursday, as a shortage of semiconductors made it cut its 2021 sales outlook, sending its shares down 6%.
The maker of industrial robots and drives is the latest company to warn about shortages reducing its ability to meet demand from customers ramping up output after the pandemic-induced slump in activity.
As a result ABB reported its third quarter sales increasing by 4%, less than half the 10% rate it expected in July. It now expects full-year sales growth of 6% to 8%, slower than the previous outlook for a 10% increase. 
""Semiconductors is the main problem, our products are very digital and they contain a lot of semiconductors not least in machine automation, robotics and electrification,"" Chief Executive Rosengren told reporters. 
Power cuts in China, and logistics difficulties such as harbour closures as COVID-19 restrictions returned also made it more difficult for ABB to get the parts it needed, he added.
""It has been a struggle which all industries are feeling today, this is not an ABB problem, this is a clear market problem,"" Rosengren said. ""It will take a couple more quarters before we see it better.""
Companies including Canadian auto parts maker Magna and Sweden's Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) have been hit by tight supply chains, while chip scarcity has brought some car assembly lines to a halt.
Swiss elevator and escalator maker Schindler has also flagged supply-chain problems.
Another problem was a shortage of skilled labour, particularly in the United States, which was affecting ABB and its customers.
Still, demand was buoyant, with the company's orders surging 26% while its backlog grew by $2.1 billion to $16 billion. 
""Demand has gone through the roof, but with the restrictions of movement under COVID that creates a tough labour market to attract good workers,"" said Rosengren.
The company was looking to mitigate the impact by redesigning products to use less scarce chips, sourcing new suppliers and building up its own stocks.
ABB shares were trading 6.2% lower in early afternoon activity in Switzerland following the more muted outlook, and the third quarter sales of $7.03 billion that missed forecasts.
Operational earnings before interest, tax and amortisation rose 32% to $1.06 billion, in line with forecasts, while net profit came in at $652 million, slightly below expectations.
ABB's third biggest investor, the activist group Cevian Capital was confident the supply chain problems would be overcome and was pleased with the improvement in operating profit margin to 15.1%.
""The supply chain disruptions are a short-term thing,"" said founding partner Christer Gardell, whose group controls 5.2% of ABB according to Refinitiv data. 
""When the supply chain blip normalises, ABB should deliver even better margins as they work through the growing order book,"" he told Reuters.

Still, the supply squeeze could affect others, analysts said.
""The larger than expected negative impact from the supply chain could also impact other companies, including its electrical peers Siemens, Schneider and Legrand,"" said JP Morgan analyst Andreas Willi.

(Reuters) - Elevator and escalator manufacturer Schindler expects 2022 to be challenging, particularly in the first half, citing a slowdown in China and rising costs.
The Swiss company said on Thursday it had not been materially impacted by Evergrande's debt issues, but it expected 2022, especially the first half of it, to be challenging for business in China, which makes up 14% of Schindler sales.
""China's real state investments slowdown will impact the market of our business in the first half of 2022, or a little bit longer,"" CEO Thomas Oetterli said on a conference call.
Oetterli said he expected the Chinese market, which accounts for at least two thirds of the world's new lift installations, to bounce back in the second half of 2022, helped by government actions.
Beijing has stepped up measures to rein in China's property market this year, including upper limits on developers' debt ratios and restrictions on purchases.
Baader Helvea said in a note it does not see a major impact for the company from the Evergrande crisis but said ""multiples might remain below former peaks and a persisting pressure on margins"".
Oetterli said Schindler expected 2022 to be challenging as electronic shortage and high material costs will continue to have a negative impact.
For the January to September period, the company pointed to Europe as the main burden on its revenues, which came in at 8.28 billion Swiss francs, in line with the 2019 pre-pandemic level.
""Revenue slowdown in the first three quarters was not related to China, we were weaker in Europe because material shortage was stronger than in the rest of the world"", Oetterli said.

Schindler's quarterly net profit came in at 234 million Swiss francs ($254.74 million), slightly below 235 million a year earlier, but beating the 220 million expected by analysts.

(Reuters) -AutoNation Inc on Thursday reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit and unveiled an additional $1-billion share buyback program, as the largest U.S. auto retailer benefited from surging car prices on tight inventories.
Consumer preference for personal transportation since the pandemic outbreak and a global chip shortage that has led to auto production cuts across the globe have been driving car prices higher. 
AutoNation (NYSE:AN), which reported another quarter of record income, said new vehicle inventory remained at historically low levels leading to a marginal rise in new vehicle revenue in the third quarter ended Sept. 30.
Used vehicle revenue, on the other hand, jumped 53% to $2.32 billion compared to $1.51 billion a year earlier. 
AutoNation Chief Executive Mike Jackson told Reuters that tight inventories and high prices are leading some customers to defer buying a new vehicle. However, Jackson said more customers are using AutoNation's websites to track vehicles the company's stores have coming to them in the next 30 to 60 days, and reserving a car or truck before it arrives.
""We're now at the limit of where can take inventories down to,"" Jackson said. ""This could be the trough on the disruption, and early next year shipments could improve.""
Consumer demand for vehicles is still strong, Jackson said, and shoppers who decide to defer a purchase are likely to come back when inventories improve.
""Pent-up demand is building,"" Jackson said.
Jackson will retire as AutoNation's CEO on Nov. 1 after 22 years leading the U.S. auto retail chain. He will be succeeded by former Fiat Chrysler Automobiles CEO Mike Manley. 
Net income from continuing operations was $361.7 million, or $5.12 per share, for the quarter, compared with $182.6 million, or $2.05 per share, a year earlier. Adjusted net income per share was $5.12. 
Revenue rose 18% to $6.4 billion.
Analysts on average had expected the company to report a profit of $4.2 per share, on revenue of $6.3 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

New vehicle gross profit per vehicle retailed jumped 116% to $5,484, while used vehicle gross profit per vehicle retailed was up 5% at $2,104. 
Shares of the company were up 1.7% at $117.9 in premarket trading.

Investing.com – American Airlines stock (NASDAQ:AAL) traded 1.2% higher as the company returned to profits in the third quarter and said it will add capacity to cater to rising demand.
Third-quarter profit was $169 million compared to a loss of $2.39 billion in July-September last year. Excluding items, the company posted a third-quarter net loss of $641 million.
American follows Tuesday's reporting of better numbers by United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL). Adjusted loss at the carrier, which has a larger international presence, narrowed to $329 million from $2.37 billion in the September quarter of last year.

1430,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2021 07:42AM ET</span>","Analysis-From doom to boom, energy stocks power out of COVID shock","By Danilo Masoni and Sujata Rao
MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - Big oil is back.
After enduring a near-death experience during the COVID crisis when demand plummeted and being distinctly off-trend as the sustainable investing wave engulfed Wall Street, cash-rich oil companies are again a sweet spot for fund managers. 
Oil's powerful rally and record-high gas prices have put the MSCI World Energy index on track for its best run since at least 1998, up more than 40% so far in 2021.
And there may be more to come -- the International Energy Agency projects oil demand to recover to pre-pandemic levels in 2022 and the index trades at a 56% valuation discount to the broader market, almost four times the long-run average. 
The equity gains so far have also lagged the 60% crude rally https://tmsnrt.rs/3jlFIAv, and analysts believe there could be catch-up potential from now on, even if crude stabilises. 
Earnings optimism is near a 16-year peak. Oil firms in Europe and the U.S. should see profits this year rise 720% to 43 billion euros and 1,300% to $68 billion respectively -- the highest of any sector, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S. 
Graphic: Energy stocks profit optimism: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/klvykzmabvg/Energy%20stocks%20profit%20optimism.PNG 
The big question, though, is what management teams do with those earnings.
Unlike previous price booms, many oil firms appear reluctant to increase investment in upstream production. The IEA, instead, called this month for a surge of investment in renewable energy to meet future demand.
Kiran Ganesh, head of multi-asset at UBS Global Wealth Management, said the reluctance to invest in traditional energy sources was ""a side effect of ESG (environmental, social and governance)"" investing, which emphasises sustainability. 
""Historically, when we saw oil price rises we have tended to see increases in investment. This time that response hasn't come through because companies are talking more of redistributing to shareholders via dividends and buybacks,"" he said.
""It's exciting for investors, but it's bad news if you are looking for commodity prices to moderate"". 
Oil and gas investment could be as little as $365 billion this year,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said quoting data provider Rystad Energy. That compares to $475 billion in 2019 and $740 billion in 2014.
European oil majors, including BP (NYSE:BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), are spending billions of dollars to reduce their dependency on fossil fuels and grow their focus on renewables. But Morgan Stanley's own analysis of 120 oil firms indicates total capex stagnating below 2019 levels even in 2023 and those figures include renewables investment, implying flat oil and gas capex and a peak in oil supply around 2024, they said.
BofA Securities' October fund managers survey showed commodities had the biggest consensus overweight. Almost half of those polled said they expect oil prices to breach $100 a barrel. 
Graphic: Energy stocks have lagged oil: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jnvwewlnevw/Energy%20stocks%20lag%20crude%20oil%20rally.PNG 
""DIVIDENDS FIT THE BILL""
Surging profits and shrinking capex have left oil companies with rich free cash flow piles and some are choosing to reward shareholders.
The energy sector in Europe has the second-highest free cash flow while a similar metric for a global energy index is hovering near a 35-year high, Refinitiv data shows.
The dividend yield alone for the MSCI Energy index -- whose market cap has climbed above $1.8 trillion -- has been the highest among the main MSCI sectors since January 2019. It is now at 4.7%.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) estimates European oil majors will return 20% of their market capitalisation by 2023, adding that upcoming earnings could provide catalysts for some stocks.
Bernstein strategists Sarah McCarthy and Mark Diver have an overweight for the energy sector ""in the long and short-run"", citing an average dividend and buyback yield of 8% at the oil majors.
""In a world of moderately higher inflation and negative real yields where investors need access to real income streams, dividends fit that bill,"" they said. 
Graphic: Energy offers the highest yield: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/klvykzbgqvg/Energy%20offers%20the%20highest%20dividend%20yield.PNG 
Money has been flowing back into the sector since March 2020.
The iShares Global Energy ETF (NYSE:XLE) -- holdings include  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM),  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX), TotalEnergies, BP and Royal Dutch Shell -- scored record trading volumes in the third quarter.
The turnaround for oil stocks would have seemed impossible last year when crude futures plunged sub-zero.
""The problem was that markets viewed oil as a raw material in secular decline, and people were starting to worry about risks associated with winding down facilities and sunk costs,"" said Angelo Meda, portfolio manager at Banor SIM in Milan.

""Now there is absolutely room (for oil stocks) to rise even further as it becomes clear that crude demand isn't yet at its peak, which I believe we'll reach somewhere towards the end of this decade,"" he added.

Investing.com –  IBM  stock (NYSE:IBM) fell nearly 5% in Thursday’s premarket trading as a weak showing by the company’s legacy business of infrastructure management kept third-quarter sales and profit numbers below estimates.
The computing giant is spinning off the global technology services unit that houses the business as clients have moved to the Cloud. That has caused the unit's margins to shrink over the years.
The company expects to wrap up the separation of Kyndryl, the name the business will have after the exercise, in the next two weeks. But for Kyndryl, IBM’s quarterly revenue would have been higher, driven by growth in high-margin consulting, software and Cloud offerings.
""As we issued the effective date for the spin-off of our managed infrastructure business, our clients paused all new project activities at the end of September and that impacted us here,"" Chief Financial Officer James Kavanaugh told Reuters.
Third-quarter revenue at Kyndryl fell around 5% to $6.15 billion. The separation will take between $2 and $3 billion off IBM's fourth-quarter consolidated revenue, Chairman and CEO Arvind Krishna said.
Demand in the systems business, housing IBM's mainframe computers, dropped too as the end of the product cycle neared. Revenue in the segment fell 12% to $1.1 billion.
The consulting business grew a strong 16% and Cloud revenue was 37% higher. Overall, the global business services, housing consulting and Cloud offerings expanded by 11% to $4.4 billion.
Cognitive software – comprising Red Hat, security and automation – grew 2% to $5.7 billion.
Revenue rose 0.3% to $17.6 billion. Adjusted operating profit fell 1% to $2.3 billion.
Talking about the ongoing quarter, Krishna said software revenue growth rate should improve over the third quarter while consulting should again see double-digit revenue growth.

SHANGHAI/LONDON (Reuters) - Numbers don't lie, you just need to be looking at the right ones.
That's the problem for investors searching for the next trouble spot in the Chinese real estate sector as industry giant China Evergrande Group lumbers towards what is expected to be the country's largest-ever corporate default. The figures on the books sometimes don't tell the full story.
Since Beijing started clamping down on corporate debt in 2017, many real estate developers have turned to off-balance-sheet vehicles to borrow money and skirt regulatory scrutiny, analysts and lawyers say.
Joint ventures are a popular choice because, unless a company holds a controlling interest in one, it can keep details of it and the debt it acquires off its balance sheet.
""Nearly every developer has borrowings in disguise. The sector's debt problem is worse than what you see,"" said He Siwei, attorney at Hui Ye Law Firm.
Chinese developers owed 33.5 trillion yuan ($5.24 trillion)through various channels at the end of June, Nomura estimates, based on official statistics, adding ""there are definitely other obscure financing channels yet to be covered.""
Private bonds issued by shell companies in offshore locations have emerged as a new concern.
In a note this month, Fitch ratings agency said that Fantasia Holdings Group, a property developer which has since defaulted, had recently told it ""for the first time"" that it had $150 million of private bonds that do not appear to have been reported in its financial statements.
Fantasia did not respond to a request for comment. The company had over $4 billion worth of cash at the end of June and two weeks before it defaulted said that it had ""ample capital"".
Unsurprisingly, investors have begun to look in less obvious places as the sectors' most troubled firms have been locked out of international capital markets.
Some of those developers hit hardest had better-looking financials than those whose bonds had been less impacted, according to an analysis by JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), underlining a lack of faith in balance sheets.
Out of 70 Chinese property developers rated by Moody's (NYSE:MCO), 27 have ""significant"" exposure to joint ventures, compared with five out of 49 in 2015.
Under a typical joint venture, a developer sets up a minority-owned real estate project with an asset manager or private equity fund and promises them fixed returns. The developer usually agrees to buy back its stake from the other investor after a certain number of years.

This year's escalation of Evergrande's woes meant that its failure to make a bond payment last month was largely expected. Once China's top-selling property developer, Evergrande has over $300 billion in liabilities, equivalent to about 2% of China's gross domestic product. 
It was the posterchild for the sector's credit-fuelled growth with a debt pile that has nearly quadrupled since 2016.
Evergrande's financing model, which depended on a constant stream of new sales to feed its operations, quickly ran into trouble when Beijing introduced its so-called ""Three Red Lines"" rules last year that capped the amount of debt developers could take on compared to the amount of cash, assets and equity capital they held.
Evergrande did not have many joint ventures, analysts say but it did use off-balance sheet debt for funding, such as sales of wealth management products.
It also appears to have had exposure to private bonds, according to a bond term sheet seen by Reuters. 
JPMorgan analysts estimated that Evergrande's true net gearing -- a measure of a company's financial leverage -- was at least 177% at the end of June, compared to the 100% reported in its accounts. 
It is not the only one. JPMorgan estimated R&F Properties' gearing jumped to 139% from 123% once disguised debt was added back on while Sunac China Holdings' figure leapt to 138% from 87% to name just a few.
""I don't think anyone knows for sure the real size of Evergrande's debt piles,"" said a bond regulator who declined to be identified.
Evergrande, R&F Properties and Sunac China did not respond to requests for comment. 
The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), which overseas disclosure by bond issuers, including developers, didn't respond to a request for comment on the issue of hidden debt.
Hong Kong's audit regulator has said it is investigating Evergrande's 2020 accounts and their audit by PwC because it had concerns about the adequacy of reporting. PwC did not comment on the announcement of the probe.

MINORITY INTERESTS
China's central bank governor Yi Gang said on Sunday that China's economy faces default risks for certain firms due to ""mismanagement"", and that authorities will try to prevent problems at Evergrande from spreading. 
In a press conference on Oct 15, another central bank official said that Evergrande is ""an idiosyncratic risk"" with limited spillover effects, urging developers to be responsible for repaying their debt. 
Due to increased investor scrutiny, some Chinese developers have started to bring some of their joint ventures onto their balance sheets. In most cases, that leads to a jump in minority interests, according to a report earlier this year by rating agency S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI).
Minority interests are considered equity rather than debt and, on paper, boost a company's financial strength.
JPMorgan estimates that Fantasia's net gearing rises to 92% when its joint ventures are included compared to a reported 76%. If both joint venture and minority interests are included, however, that rises to 170%, the bank said.
Fantasia's default prompted a sector-wide sell-off, with spreads on Chinese high-yield corporate dollar bonds nearly tripling since late May.
But with the mass sell-off leaving prices at rock bottom and the yields available on some of the bonds now well over 200%, some investors have been dipping their toes back in this week despite warnings of a treacherous trade.

""Absolutely there are hidden risks,"" said Jeff Grills, head of emerging market debt at Aegon (NYSE:AEG) Asset Management. ""And the thing is it is hard to know until you know,""

1437,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2021 06:57AM ET</span>","Britain faces 'massacre' of 20 more bust energy suppliers, Scottish Power says","LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's energy market faces an absolute massacre that could force at least 20 suppliers into bankruptcy in the next month alone unless the government reviews the energy price cap, Scottish Power Chief Executive Keith Anderson said on Thursday.
Natural gas prices have spiked this year as economies reopened from COVID-19 lockdowns and high demand for liquefied natural gas in Asia pushed down supplies to Europe, sending shockwaves through industries reliant on power.
Around 13 British suppliers have collapsed in recent months, forcing more than 2 million customers so far to switch providers. Before the crisis, there were more than 50 small- and mid-sized independent energy suppliers in Britain with around a 30% share of the market.
""There is a significant risk you could see the market shrink all the way back to five to six companies,"" Anderson told the Financial Times. 
Scottish Power, owned by Iberdrola (OTC:IBDRY), is Britain's fifth largest energy supplier with around 8% of the domestic gas supply market, according to data from regulator Ofgem. 
""We expect, probably in the next month, at least another 20 suppliers will end up going bankrupt,"" Anderson told Sky. ""We are now going to start seeing some relatively well-run, good, commercially sound businesses going bankrupt because they just can't pass the cost of the product through to customers.""
The soaring natural gas prices have strained Britain's retail energy markets to breaking point, putting into question 30 years of energy deregulation which began in 1989 under then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. 
Anderson cast Britain's energy market as facing months of tumult that could shrink the market all the way back to just five or six companies unless the price cap, set by Ofgem, was reviewed. 
The so-called big six British energy companies - Centrica (OTC:CPYYY)'s British Gas, E.ON, OVO Energy, EDF (PA:EDF) Energy, Scottish Power and Octopus - control more than three quarters of the domestic gas supply market, Ofgem data shows. 
The cap limits the cost of energy for millions of people on suppliers' default tariffs. It is reviewed twice a year.

Anderson said the regulator Ofgem and the government should look at changing the cap earlier than its next scheduled review in April so suppliers can pass on spikes in their costs sooner.
Without government and regulatory intervention, ""we are in danger of just sleepwalking into an absolute massacre,"" Anderson said.

(Reuters) - Zuckerverse. Timesuck. Faceplant.
They're just a few of the suggestions being bandied around online following reports that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) plans to rebrand itself with a new group name. The company refused to comment on rumor or speculation, of course, but the Twitterati had no problem.
The debate careered from sensible to screwball to strange.
""Meta"" was one of the more sober trending suggestions, referring to Facebook's reported desire to assume a name that focuses on the metaverse, a virtual environment where users can hang out.
Bookface, Facegram, Facetagram, FreeFace, FreeTalk, World Changer.
On the wilder side, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) user Dave Pell drew a comparison with musician Kanye West who recently changed his name to ""Ye"".
""It would be awesome if Facebook changes its name to Ye,"" he said. 
Several humorous suggestions reflected online speculation that the alleged rebrand was driven by founder Mark Zuckerberg's yearning to make Facebook ""cool"" once more. 
The platform has been deserted by many younger users who have moved to apps like Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok, and has become increasingly populated by older people. 
""Teenage Wasteland"", one wit suggested. 
""The Old People's App because that's what us younger people call it,"" college student Vittoria Esteves told Reuters in Rome. 
""Boomerville"", suggested Marco, referring to so-called baby boomers born in the years following World War II. 
'STREISAND EFFECT'
The online naming feast was sparked by a report on the Verge tech site that a newly named group would act as a parent for all the company's brands, including Facebook itself, Instagram and WhatsApp, and reflect a focus on virtual and augmented reality. 
An announcement is expected next week, according to the report. 
Many suggestions however reflected the public's concern about how the company handles user safety and hate speech. Internal documents leaked by a whistleblower formed the basis for a U.S. Senate hearing last week.
""Fakebook"", for example. Tracebook.
Other people were sceptical whether a name change would be enough to detract from the growing legal and regulatory scrutiny that has tarnished the company's reputation.

""It's going to be the Barbra Streisand effect thing going on,"" said 20-year old Glasgow student Thomas van der Hoven, referring to the phenomenon where seeking to suppress something inadvertently turbo-charges popular interest in it.
""So they're going to try and change it, and then that's just going to put the spotlight on the fact that they're changing it. Why are they changing this?"" he added. ""So it's probably going to spit back in their face at some point.""

1442,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2021 06:09AM ET</span>","U.S. company results in industrial, materials sectors could shed light on inflation woes","By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Corporate results in the industrial and materials sectors could offer a snapshot of how companies in a key swath of the U.S. economy are dealing with surging inflation, supply chain bottlenecks and higher commodity prices.
Companies in those sectors -- which include logistics and transportation firms, major chemical makers and manufacturers and suppliers for the aerospace, automotive and construction industries -- are expected to post strong third-quarter results.
Their position in the global economy, however, gives many companies in the industrial and materials sectors a window into the fallout from rising input costs, supply chain snags and other issues that have bedeviled the United States and other countries as economic reopenings spur a surge in demand.
Signs that companies are continuing to raise costs or expect inflation and logistics snafus to persist could bolster the view that the recent surge in consumer prices will prove more sustainable than expected, despite assurances from the Federal Reserve that the recent rise is likely transitory.
Supply chain and inflation issues have rippled through companies in a broad range of sectors, from tech companies to consumer product firms. 
Many industrial and materials companies have already relayed the challenges they face. Diversified manufacturer 3M at an investor conference last month pointed to inflation coming in higher than expected, with cost pressures in resins, wood pulp and labor.  Eaton  (NYSE:ETN) Corp last month warned its third-quarter revenue would come in ""slightly below"" the low end of its forecast largely due to the ""inability to serve the demand that we're getting.""
Also last month, paint and coatings company Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW) lowered its 2021 sales and earnings estimates citing ""escalating raw material availability challenges and inflation headwinds.""
""Everyone is going to feel the pain at different rates,"" said Joshua Aguilar, U.S. multi-industry analyst at Morningstar. ""Your short-cycle businesses are going to feel it first, but no one is immune. What you want is ideally somebody who has the pricing lever to offset that.""
Investors will learn more in the coming days as corporate reports arrive, including Dow Inc on Thursday, and 3M,  General Electric  (NYSE:GE), and  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) next week.
Industrial and materials were among the economically sensitive cyclical stocks that had broadly benefited after breakthrough vaccine data last November created optimism about the economy's ability to emerge from the coronavirus pandemic.
Yet while energy and financials have continued to shine among such economically sensitive groups, industrial and material shares have been weighed down by worries over how fallout from higher prices and supply chain issues will affect their bottom lines, investors said.
While the overall S&P 500 has gained 14% since the first quarter ended, the S&P 500 industrials sector has increased about 6%, and the materials sector has climbed roughly 8%.
""We know this quarter was hit by these margin issues, but are we going to see this continue for the next two quarters, or is it a one-quarter event?"" said Walter Todd, chief investment officer with Greenwood Capital in South Carolina. ""That’s the real unknown at this point, and that will drive ... how these stocks react.""
Industrials make up 8% of the overall S&P 500 index while materials account for 2.5%.
Some investors are betting companies in the sectors can see more upside, especially if they can weather rising costs including with strong pricing power for their products.

Ryan Cope, portfolio manager at American Century Investments, holds shares of bearings maker Timken Co in the small-cap value portfolio he manages.
""Companies that have pricing power in their business models will really start to show much better results than companies that do not,"" Cope said.

1443,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2021 06:09AM ET</span>",U.S. consumer watchdog to query tech giants over financial data -sources,"By Katanga Johnson and Michelle Price
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. consumer watchdog is expected this week to query tech giants including Facebook, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google on how they handle consumer financial data as part of a broader effort to boost consumer protections and financial sector competition, according to two people briefed on the matter.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) plans to send the companies a 55-page request for information about how they collect, use and market consumer financial data, the people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
""The regulator's questions will pay special attention to what it is firms are collecting, how they're collecting it and what they're using it for,"" said one of the sources.
The CFPB declined to comment.  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)., Amazon Inc. and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, which are not directly regulated by the CFPB, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The expected request for information follows the arrival of Rohit Chopra as director of the CFPB following his Senate confirmation last month. A former Democratic commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission, he built a reputation as a consumer advocate who was frequently tough on big tech. 
Democrats' top policy priorities include boosting competition in the consumer finance sector by requiring financial companies to give consumers more control over their financial data -- a concept known as ""open banking.""
Requiring banks and other financial firms to allow consumers to download data about account balances, payments, transactions and investments and share it with a third party, for example, could make it easier for consumers to switch providers. 
Chopra is expected to move ahead with an open-banking rule first proposed by the agency under the former Trump administration in coming months.

The companies' confidential responses many help inform the open banking and other future rule makings, the source said. 
""This move by the agency is a clear signal that this broader array of companies, which are not covered by the CFPB, are seen to undertake activities and collect consumer financial data that may be subject to future, open banking regulation,"" the source added.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Qantas Airways Ltd engineers are preparing for the airline's fleet to ramp up international flying starting Nov. 1, when Sydney opens to fully vaccinated citizens and permanent residents without quarantine.
With the exception of its Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) A380 super-jumbos, which remain stored in the Mojave Desert in California, most of Qantas' international fleet has already been doing some limited flying on cargo and repatriation flights.
""What we do is have them on a bit of a part-time schedule so they have been doing one day a week rather than seven days a week,"" said John Walker, the airline's head of line maintenance.
Australia applied strict border rules in March 2020 that stopped citizens from exiting without special permission and required two weeks of hotel quarantine for all arrivals, leading Qantas to stop regular international passenger flights.
Qantas engineering staff at Sydney Airport on Thursday were checking brakes and tyres and catching up on some minor maintenance work on its fleet of A330 planes that were flying on lighter schedules.
""For this aircraft, if it were in a deep sleep, it would be over 1,000 man hours with full crews of 12 or 15 to wake the plane up,"" Walker said. ""We started doing these wake-ups many, many months ago.""
In California, Qantas has a team of engineers in Los Angeles that regularly drives two hours to the Mojave Desert to carry out checks on the A380 fleet, he said. 
The desert environment there is drier than Alice Springs in central Australia, where other carriers including Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY) Ltd and Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways (OTC:CPCAY) Ltd have stored planes, he added.
Qantas expects five of its 12 A380s to return to service from July 2022 for London and Los Angeles flights, while two are being retired.
London and Los Angeles are also the first destinations for flights from Sydney on Nov. 1. Six weeks later it will start flights to Vancouver, Singapore Fiji and Japan.
It marks a major milestone for an airline that has done little international flying since March 2020 and has lost A$20 billion ($15.08 billion) of revenue due to the pandemic.

""We are now seeing light at the end of the tunnel,"" Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce said at an industry conference on Thursday. ""We see there is huge interest in people planning their trips for next year.""

1447,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2021 06:00AM ET</span>",S.Korea's launch of space rocket boosts its homegrown contractors,"By Josh Smith and Sangmi Cha
GOHEUNG/SEOUL, South Korea (Reuters) -South Korea's push for a domestically made space rocket promises wide-ranging benefits for its military and government, with a fillip to national prestige - but it is also good for business.
Despite Thursday's mission being incomplete, the project will press ahead towards its goal of launching satellites into orbit and joining in space exploration with five more launches scheduled by 2027, President Moon Jae-in said.
Moon, who watched the launched from the space centre, said the rocket completed all its flight sequences but failed to put its test payload into orbit.
The test of the Nuri rocket is a milestone for firms such as Hanwha Aerospace, which makes rocket boosters and other launch components, and Korea Aerospace Industries, which oversaw assembly of the launch vehicle.
""Hanwha built the engine, but KAI was responsible for assembling about 300,000 components of the rocket,"" said Choi Gwang-shik, an analyst with Korea Investment & Securities.
""And these components came from myriads of companies, including the shipbuilder Hyundai Heavy Industries. The launch would broadly benefit all firms involved.""
About 300 South Korean firms were involved in producing the 200-ton, three-stage Nuri, Yong Hong-taek, first vice minister of science and technology, told a briefing at the space centre.
The Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI) plans several more tests of Nuri before it carries a real payload, but looks to partner more closely with a single firm on assembly and launch processes, similar to the way in which NASA works with SpaceX in the United States, officials said.
""As we will attempt another five launches in the future we are planning to transfer all technology to the private sector eventually,"" Yong said.
Although the space programme lags many other nations, including neighbours China and Japan, South Korea is eager to catch up, and its companies look set to ride a wave of new government funding.
Since March 2010, South Korea has invested about 2 trillion won ($1.70 billion) in the Nuri development project, while annual investment in space projects has more than doubled, to 616 billion won ($524 million) in 2020 from 305 billion in 2013, the National Assembly Research Service said.
President Moon pointed to the rocket as an example of the efforts of the homegrown defence and aerospace industry, which he wants to supercharge. 
The government will foster the private space sector to make South Korea ""a space powerhouse,"" he told the Seoul International Aerospace & Defense Exhibition this week.
The space efforts also stand to benefit makers of surveillance, navigation, and communications satellites, as well as other industries.
The government plans to spend 3.7 trillion won ($3.1 billion) to develop a Korea Positioning System with eight satellites to ensure the accuracy needed to develop technology such as self-driving cars, ministry spokesman Koo Hyuk-chae said.
""We believe that will trickle down to the whole industry,"" he told Reuters.
South Korea plans a 4% increase in its space budget of 640 billion won ($544 million) for next year. 
In August the defence acquisition agency said it would invest about 1.6 trillion won ($1.4 billion) over the next 10 years in the domestic defence satellite sector.
Shares of Hanwha Aerospace, which makes everything from rocket engines and howitzers to surveillance technology, have soared 73% this year. 

The firm will focus on providing quality engines for future Nuri launch vehicle tests, a spokesperson said, adding that it had a rough investment target of about a trillion won ($849 million) or more in the space business by 2030.

Investing.com -- Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) both edged lower in premarket trade, hours after former President Donald Trump announced he will start a new social media company aimed at challenging their dominance. 
Facebook stock fell 0.3%, while Twitter stock fell 0.8%, after Trump said he would launch a plaftorm called TRUTH Social under the aegis of his Trump Media & Technology Group ""to stand up to the tyranny of Big Tech.""
The company is slated to go public through a merger with  Digital World Acquisition  (NASDAQ:DWAC), a special purpose acquisition company that listed in September. DWA shares rose 45% in post-market trading on the news. 
Trump's access to, and dominance of, social media in 2016 was the key to his successful bid for the U.S. presidency, and the news comes amid a flurry of reports suggesting that he intends to run again in 2024. A successful run will, however, be more difficult without access to mass platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. Both platforms banned Trump after January 6th, when his supporters stormed Congress in an attempt to stop the certification of Joe Biden's election victory. 
While his own platform will guarantee him access to a mouthpiece, it will be far from certain whether he can recreate the reach that he had with swing voters on an avowedly right-wing platform. Other platforms that have aimed at 'rebalancing' the social media sphere, such as Gab and Parler, have failed to draw mass readerships, and have had no visible impact on advertizing revenue at the larger platforms.
Facebook, which is reportedly set to drop an increasingly toxic brand from its corporate identity, continues to face threats from other directions meanwhile. The District of Columbia's Attorney General on Wednesday ffiled a motion to add Mr. Zuckerberg as a defendant in a consumer-protection lawsuit filed three years ago over its role in the Cambridge Analytica scandal, when Facebook allowed the data of millions of users to be harvested without their consent. Private shareholders have already sued for damages related to that case, alleging that Facebook settled charges by the Federal Trade Commission for a much larger sum than was necessary as part of a deal which kept Zuckerberg off the charge sheet."

PARIS (Reuters) -French spirits maker  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP) said solid sales growth could moderate in the 2022 fiscal year, after strong demand in China, the United States, India and Europe helped it post above-forecast sales in the first quarter.
Pernod - which owns Martell cognac, Mumm champagne and Absolut vodka - reported a 20% rise in like-for-like sales to 2.718 billion euros ($3.17 billion) in the three months to Sept. 30, above market expectations for a 15.7% rise.
The world's second-biggest spirits group said consumption by people staying at home remained resilient, while the reopening of bars and restaurants as coronavirus restrictions eased also helped, notably in Europe. 
Travel retail was still subdued although the company benefited in the quarter from a low comparison base.
Pernod Ricard's fiscal year started on July 1.
When asked if he was comfortable with average analyst expectations of 9.7% sales growth for the full year, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Alexandre Ricard told Reuters ""we give a qualitative guidance"".
""We are confident but we need to go through Christmas and the Chinese New Year (to have more visibility),"" he said.
Pernod expected ""good sales growth to continue through the year"", he said, adding that the first quarter had benefited from a low comparison base a year ago, when pandemic curbs had hit businesses in many countries.
That comparison base would progressively become less favourable as the year progressed, Ricard added.
""The comparison basis will get more complicated, the longer we go on.""
Despite strong sales, Pernod shares were off 1.1% at 196.60 euros by 0819 GMT.
""There is no change to the outlook, and although the beat is significant, it is only one quarter so we think consensus upgrades will probably be minor at this stage,"" wrote Investec analysts in a note.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts pointed out that ""significant investment in Advertising and Promotion(A&P) and structure costs should temper margin expectations,"" for the year.
GOOD MID-AUTUMN FESTIVAL IN CHINA 
The strong start to the year reflected a 9% sales jump in the United States, Pernod Ricard's top market, with good replenishment ahead of the festive season and a rebound in demand for Jameson Irish whiskey as bars and restaurants reopened after COVID restrictions were eased.
Supply chain concerns ranging from difficulties to find containers or truck drivers led some clients in the United States to stock up ahead of the holiday season, Ricard said.
In China, sales jumped 22%, driven by demand during the Mid-Autumn Festival and Martell cognac price hikes. 
""The Mid-Autumn Festival went well and our inventory level is healthy,"" Ricard said.
Europe also had a strong start, with sales rising 22% as consumers headed to bars and restaurants amid easing COVID restrictions. 
""People are keen to connect socially and resume (pre-COVID) lifestyles,"" Pernod's finance chief Helene de Tissot told analysts.
China contributes around 9% to Pernod's sales and is its second-largest market.

Global travel retail sales rose 55% year-on-year, returning to growth in all regions and benefiting from a very favourable comparison base.

1450,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2021 05:40AM ET</span>",Euronext sets sight on EU bond business in race with rival venues,"By Francesca Landini and Elvira Pollina
MILAN (Reuters) - Euronext is bidding to become a key service provider for European Union bonds, a top executive said, as the pan-European exchange seeks to leverage its newly-acquired Milan stock and debt exchange group to snatch business from rivals.
Euronext -- which runs stock markets in Amsterdam, Brussels, Dublin, Lisbon, Milan, Oslo and Paris -- bought Italian bond platform MTS this year as part of its 4.3 billion-euro ($5 billion) takeover of Italy's bourse group. 
It has now trained its sights on EU debt, given the bloc's 800 billion-euro borrowing plan for its pandemic recovery fund, which could lay foundations for a potential European ""safe asset"" that would be widely traded. 
The EU has already issued more than 50 billion euros in long-term debt, and is holding regular auctions, using nearly 50 primary dealer banks to arrange the sales and trade the bonds. 
The European Commission currently uses the Luxembourg Stock Exchange to list these bonds, while Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn)'s Clearstream provides custody and other services for the notes. 
The EU debt already trades on MTS. However, the EU has not outlined plans for a full-fledge secondary market yet as, unlike several European governments, it does not stipulate that banks managing its bond sales trade the notes for a certain volume each day and ensure liquidity to the market. 
MTS has offered the European Commission its market infrastructure, data and reports on the activity of primary dealers, its CEO Fabrizio Testa told Reuters.
It has also proposed its platform to help the EU Commision organise buy-backs and exchanges.
""The new EU bonds are already traded on MTS, but introducing incentives for primary dealers to continuously trade the notes on a regulated platform like ours would really make the difference,"" said Testa, who sits on Euronext's extended managing board. 
This would give investors unbroken access to prices and trading, even in times of market volatility, he said.
""At the moment there is an open dialogue with the European Commission ... We hope there will be a decision at the beginning of next year,"" Testa added.
CUSTODY SERVICES
Euronext has also suggested its Dublin Bourse for the listing and Monte Titoli for the custody services of the EU bonds, as an alternative to the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and Clearstream, Testa said, confirming what sources told Reuters.
A Commission spokesperson declined to comment specifically on the Euronext proposals, but said the EU was ""in active contact with all relevant stakeholders"".
""Our bonds are currently listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (LuxSE) and we would not speculate about any other solutions,"" the spokesperson added.
Asked for a comment on Euronext's offer, LuxSE said it currently had a 45% market share on the listing of international debt securities issued by sovereign, supranational and agencies.
""The exchange has longstanding relations with European institutions and agencies,"" a LuxSE spokeswoman said, adding the EU's inaugural 12 billion-euro green bond was listed on LuxSE.
Clearstream said that the recent growth of the Eurobond market proved the confidence that both issuers and investors have in the company's services. 
""We will continue to work with our partners to develop and further grow Europe's largest debt market,"" said Guido Wille, head of Clearstream's Eurobonds business in an emailed comment.
Introducing bond obligations for primary dealers and creating a liquid secondary market for EU debt would bring benefits, independent experts told Reuters.
Traders noted that EU bonds pay a premium over comparable German bonds despite enjoying the same triple-A credit rating. One trader, who requested anonymity said Brussels could save ""a handful of basis points"" at auctions if the MTS proposals boosted transparency and liquidity. 
Another trader at an EU primary dealer bank, Nils Kostense at ABN Amro, agreed that improved liquidity would lead to cost savings. 

""If (investors) can offload what they have onloaded easily... they would participate more easily in an auction. That could also benefit the EU because of more clients participating,"" Kostense said.

Investing.com – Tesla stock (NASDAQ:TSLA) traded 1% lower in Thursday’s premarket after the company spoke of a “variety of challenges” while disclosing third-quarter results that surpassed expectations.
The company referred to “semiconductor shortages, congestion at ports and rolling blackouts” even though its numbers suggested it had mastered those issues relatively well.
Tesla is among the most vertically integrated carmakers and that has allowed it to be on top of the supply chain issues plaguing most of the manufacturers. But such talk from the management was enough to sow doubt about whether that can be sustained. 
Price fluctuations of raw materials such as nickel and aluminum had created an “uncertain environment with respect to cost structure”, Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn was quoted by Reuters as saying on a call with analysts.
“Q4 production will depend heavily on availability of parts, but we are driving for continued growth,” he said. Celebrity CEO Elon Musk didn’t participate in the analyst briefing.
Supply chain issues have crippled just about every company as economies have boomed while supplies have lagged owing to the pandemic-induced restrictions keeping factories shut. Those shortages have been particularly acute for carmakers, who have had to compete with phone- and gadget-makers for the same capacities at chips-making factories.
Tesla’s gradual shift to lower-margin vehicles also weighed on sentiment, although cost discipline ensured that the carmaker’s operating margins reached an all-time high.
Average sale price of vehicle declined by 6% on the year as the weight of the Model 3 in the sales mix grew.
The EV-maker produced 64% more vehicles at 237,823 units and delivered 73% more at 241,391 units, with the lower-cost Shanghai factory beating the Fremont plant in quantity produced.
Automotive revenue jumped 58% to $12.05 billion while total revenue rose 57% to a record $13.75 billion. The company’s revenue from sales of environmental credits continued to fall as more companies shift to cleaner energy and reduce their dependence on buying carbon credits from Tesla. Revenue from sale of these credits fell 30% to $279 million.
The company posted a third consecutive record quarterly profit of $2.09 billion on an adjusted basis,up almost 140% from a year ago.
Tesla is now focusing on starting production at two new factories, one in Austin, Texas, and another outside Berlin, by the end of the year.

1452,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2021 05:20AM ET</span>",Umunna says JPMorgan to keep funding fossil fuel companies,"By Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) plans to keep lending to the fossil fuel industry to help it transition to a low-carbon economy, despite campaigner calls for banks to phase out financing to the sector, an executive said on Thursday.
Chuka Umunna, who heads the bank's environmental, social and governance-related activities in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said oil and gas companies were ""part of the solution"" to climate change and would need support to develop renewable energy technologies.
""Of course we want to see as many new and funky renewable energy companies coming to the market, but they... do not have access to the scale of capital investment that would be required for us to, overall, 'green' (the world's) economies,"" Umunna told the Reuters ESG Investment Europe 2021 conference.
The commitment to fossil fuels comes as an energy crisis grips markets across Europe and governments worry about the potential for blackouts over the northern hemisphere winter.
It also follows a landmark report from the International Energy Agency calling for no more fossil fuel projects to be developed after the end of this year, if the world wants to reach its climate goals by mid-century. 
In response, Dutch lender ING said it would look to align its business with the more ambitious net zero pathway, while French lender La Banque Postale said it planned to withdraw all financing from the oil and gas industry by 2030.
The report also galvanised climate campaigners keen to see banks take a more robust approach to cutting lending to the oil and gas industry.
Umunna said the bank would constantly ""evaluate and recalibrate"" its targets, but would not commit to changing them straight away, given it had only laid out a plan on financing the oil and gas industry earlier this year.
Under the plan, JPMorgan said it would cut the portfolio-weighted average carbon intensity of clients in the sector - a measure of emissions per unit of revenue - by 35% by 2030 for Scopes 1 and 2 - from companies' own operations; and by 15% for Scope 3 emissions, from the use of their products.
Pulling out of the sector too quickly would hit the world's poorest the hardest, he added.
""If we took out oil and gas right now, we don't have renewables at scale to replace that energy need and what will end up if we were to do that immediately this year, what would we see happen? We're probably likely to get blackouts and, frankly, the people who will suffer most are the world's less well off.""

As global leaders gear up for the next round of climate talks in Scotland from Oct. 31, Umunna - a former politician for Britain's opposition Labour Party - said politicians needed to secure greater support for policy changes that will be needed.
""You know, the majority of the UK does not agree with Greta Thunberg. As much as... I think she's a fantastic advocate (and) I agree with a lot of what she says, I think many business leaders do too, but we have to get a consensus for action here and we have to show that everybody stands to benefit from this.""

1453,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2021 04:45AM ET</span>",Barclays third quarter profit doubles amid global merger frenzy,"By Lawrence White and Iain Withers
LONDON (Reuters) -Barclays reported on Thursday a doubling of third-quarter profits, beating market expectations, as it followed Wall Street rivals in reaping bumper investment banking fees from a surge in advisory mandates and equities trading.
The British bank posted profit before tax of 2 billion pounds ($2.8 billion) for the July-September period, better than the 1.6 billion pounds average of analysts' forecasts and twice the 1.1 billion pounds it made in the same period a year ago.
The strong performance showed the value of  Barclays  (LON:BARC)' U.S. business, where it makes nearly half its income, and British banks' balance sheets holding up amid the pandemic with the rest of the sector due to report over the next two weeks.
Barclays' advisory and equities business had a record performance in the first nine months of the year, the bank said, driving a return on equity for the overall investment bank of 16.4% compared to 10.5% a year ago.
""While the CIB (investment bank) performance continues to be an area of strength for the group, we are also seeing evidence of a consumer recovery and the early signs of a more favourable rate environment,"" Barclays CEO Jes Staley said.
Staley told reporters the lender was relatively relaxed about the prospect of growing inflation in Britain, saying annual price rises of up to 4% could be positive for the bank so long as it was supported by economic growth.
His remarks contrasted with several other big companies reporting earnings on Thursday, including consumer products giant Unilever (NYSE:UL) which warned intensifying inflation was forcing it to hike prices.
Barclays' results were boosted by the bank releasing 622 million pounds in cash set aside for bad debt charges that have yet to materialise, after government support measures propped up businesses.
""A record profit for Barclays in the third quarter is illustrative of the turnaround in fortunes the UK's major banks have had compared to where they were this time last year,"" said Zoe Gillespie, investment manager at Brewin Dolphin (OTC:BDNHF)
The provision release comes despite a turbulent period for the British economy, with supply chain disruptions and fuel shortages that flared up in September denting consumer and business confidence. 
Barclays nonetheless upgraded its economic forecasts for the United Kingdom compared to the previous quarter and said it expected the country's GDP to hit pre-pandemic levels by early 2022.
But the bank warned that uncertainty remained relatively high, with a significant number of jobs at risk of redundancy in its key UK and U.S. markets as government support measures were withdrawn. 
Barclays hinted it could close more branches in Britain as a result of more customers banking online since the pandemic.
""We'll provide more detail once we've completed those plans ... the only thing I'll say is it's a march towards making your business more and more digital,"" Finance Director Tushar Morzaria said.
INVESTMENT BANK
Barclays is alone these days among British banks in competing with Wall Street rivals on their home turf across the main investment banking businesses of advisory, equities and fixed income.
That helped it cash in on the surge in M&A fees that saw U.S. peers such as Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) smash earnings estimates for the third quarter, as global merger volumes shattered all-time records.
Barclays reported investment banking income from advising on deals rose to 971 million pounds in the third quarter from 610 million in the same period a year ago, while equities income rose 10%.
The bank's fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) division, however, saw income fall to 803 million pounds from 1 billion pounds in the same quarter a year ago.
The lender said the weaker performance was due to lower global interest rates that narrowed spreads on fixed income products, driving lower client demand than in the same period last year.
Its shares opened flat and were last down 0.6% at 0811 GMT.

Barclays is the first major British lender to update the market on its third quarter earnings. HSBC reports on Monday, followed by Lloyds (LON:LLOY) on Thursday, Oct. 28, NatWest on Friday Oct. 29 and Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) on Nov. 2.

HELSINKI/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Finland's Nordea and Sweden's Swedbank reported higher earnings for the third quarter on Thursday as banks across the region recovered strongly from the impact of the pandemic and shifted excess capital to shareholders.
Helped by the rollout of vaccines, Nordic banks like their peers elsewhere in Europe have benefited from rising corporate and consumer activity while a glut of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and initial public offerings (IPOs) has yielded rich pickings for their investment banking arms.
After forecast-beating earnings from Sweden's SEB and Handelsbanken this week, the region's biggest lender Nordea saw its quarterly operating profit rise to 1.27 billion euros ($1.48 billion) from 1.09 billion a year ago, in line with market expectations.
""We have entered a new phase of recovery from the pandemic and, as a bank, we have done so from a position of strength,"" Nordea Chief Executive Frank Vang-Jensen said in a statement. 
Meanwhile, Swedbank, Sweden's oldest retail bank, said its net profit rose to 5.50 billion crowns from 5.26 billion a year earlier, beating analysts' expectations of 5.10 billion in a Refinitiv poll.
""The quarter has been characterised by a gradual return to the new normal,"" Swedbank CEO Jens Henriksson told reporters. ""We see a strong recovery, not least in Sweden.""
Capping off the slew of banking earnings, Norway's largest bank, DNB, reported its best ever third-quarter earnings and said it would now make a dividend payment for 2020.
Andreas Hakansson, banking analyst at Danske Bank, said Nordea's profit was in line with expectations but slightly lower on important income lines such as net interest income and commission income.
""So from that point of view it is perhaps a little weaker than expectations,"" he said. ""Swedbank beat the expectations on some of the important lines and I think the share will be traded up on that."" 
Worries about souring debts due to the pandemic have rapidly subsided for the banks while financial regulators have relaxed temporary curbs on shareholder payouts, helping drive strong gains for stocks across the sector.
On top of a 0.72 euro dividend paid out in October, Nordea said it would distribute excess capital to shareholders by starting to buy back its own shares from Oct. 22 at the earliest.
Nordea also said it expected to apply for approval from the European Central Bank for another buyback programme in early 2022.
Its Nordic rivals have also ramped up payouts with SEB unveiling a fresh dividend and the beginning of share repurchases earlier this week. 
A lingering uncertainty for some of the region's banks remains their efforts to keep a lid on costs.
In July, Nordea raised its 2021 cost guidance to about 4.6 billion euros, having previously said it would be below that figure, due to the acquisition of Nordea Finance Equipment and higher staff payouts due to a strong performance in the quarter.

The Helsinki-based lender stood by its cost outlook on Thursday as did Swedbank, which is also burdened by elevated legal spending stemming from money laundering investigations in its Baltic business in recent years.

OSLO (Reuters) - Norway's largest bank DNB reported its best ever third-quarter earnings on Thursday after the country ended pandemic restrictions, and announced it would now make a dividend payment for 2020, sending its shares higher.
DNB's net profit rose to 6.88 billion crowns ($826.88 million) for July-September from 5.55 billion crowns a year earlier, beating an average forecast of 5.76 billion crowns in a poll of analysts compiled by the firm.
The Nordic country dropped all domestic pandemic restrictions https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/norway-end-coronavirus-related-restrictions-saturday-2021-09-24 on Sept. 25. Some 86% of adults were fully vaccinated against COVID-19 as of Wednesday.
Shares in DNB were up 1.9% at 0708 GMT, outperforming a flat Oslo benchmark index.
""All important indicators are pointing in the right direction. Norway has reopened, and the level of activity in the economy is now higher than it was before the shutdowns,"" Chief Executive Kjerstin Braathen said in a statement.
""We are seeing a strong development in all areas of DNB.""
Fellow Nordic banks Nordea and Swedbank also posted rising third-quarter profit on Thursday partly due to economies reopening.
Following the record results, DNB will now pay a dividend of 9 crowns per share to its owners based on last year's earnings.
Norwegian regulators had proscribed bank dividends due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but those restrictions have since been lifted.

The dividend payment is the maximum the bank's owners permitted the board to pay out earlier this year.

The sale, for an enterprise value of about $46 million, marks FirstGroup's exit from its international operations. Earlier this year, it sold its U.S. school bus and transit business to private-equity firm EQT (NYSE:EQT) to focus on its UK bus and train operations.
FirstGroup will receive a total of $172 million in cash from the deal, the company said in a statement on Thursday, a portion of which will be used to pay down Greyhound's liabilities and leases. 
It will retain some properties and legacy liabilities of Greyhound, including pension and self-insurance.
Dallas-based Greyhound, a household name in North America since it was founded in 1914, was put up for sale in May 2019 as it battled with growing pressure from low cost airlines.
FlixMobility, owner of European intercity bus service FlixBus, said the purchase would help marry its technology and shared mobility expertise with Greyhound's nationwide presence.
Greyhound has a fleet of 1,300 vehicles and 2,400 employees, providing services connecting 1,750 destinations across North America.

The deal will help FirstGroup cut its adjusted net debt to about 10 million to 20 million pounds ($27.60 million), about 80 million to 90 million pounds lower than an earlier forecast.

DIY stock strategies culled from YouTube channels have become very much the norm for many of the country's retail traders - a phenomenon that bankers say is particularly South Korean in its extent.
Cho says it's working for him. He only began trading late last year but his 8% return so far this year beats a 5% rise in the benchmark Kospi and he feels no need to turn to traditional sources of financial advice or park his money in mutual funds.
While equity markets around the world have seen a surge in retail interest as the pandemic gives people more time and motivation to seek out financial security, the reaction in South Korea has been huge.
The country last year saw a stunning 49% jump in the number of people investing in domestic stocks to 9.14 million, about 18% of the population, industry data shows.
Underpinning that jump has been disillusionment with the housing market where many young people are now priced out after a series of tax increases and mortgage curbs.
Retail investors have now become the biggest force in the South Korean stock market. Their $40 billion in net purchases in 2020 helped the Kospi rocket 31% higher - the strongest performance by any G20 benchmark index.
They also accounted for two-thirds of South Korea's stock trades in 2020 and held 28% of the market by the end of the year. By comparison, in neighbouring Japan, retail investors accounted for 22.7% of trades and owned 16.8% of the market at end-December.
NEW CHALLENGES
South Korea's army of retail investors has posed new challenges for traditional market players. While it has led to red-hot demand for domestic IPOs, for example, it has also made them difficult to price.
""If you underprice a deal, then demand from retail investors on the first day means it soars and you have the company unhappy because they think money was left on the table. If it's overpriced based on the pent-up demand you see during the process, then the stock can tank on the first day,"" said one Hong Kong-based banker declining to be named.
And with many retail investors preferring DIY strategies, the domestic mutual fund industry has also largely been left behind in the current equity boom.
Net investment in local mutual funds that primarily invest in stocks fell 11% to 77.7 trillion won ($66 billion) last year - the sharpest drop in a decade, according to industry data.
Channels like SamproTV and Shuka World on YouTube have several advantages over traditional business TV shows - one being more engagement for viewers who can ask questions in the comment section and hear experts reply in real time on the programme.
SamproTV, which began in 2019 and now has 1.57 million subscribers, also notes that it can quickly offer up content in addition to its early morning and two evening programmes. 
""When there are drastic market movements or other content that should be addressed urgently, we schedule an impromptu show,"" says Kim Dong-hwan, the channel's main host.
The channels also benefit from the fact that analysts' reports in South Korea have traditionally been free. That has meant retail investors generally don't see the need to turn to financial institutions for advice, while also making it easier for analysts to offer their views on their shows.
South Korea's Financial Supervisory Service says it is closely monitoring the rise of YouTube channels for any market volatilities the trend may bring, but there are no plans to regulate them.

""From a regulatory standpoint, we've decided to view this as free speech rather than a form of business sales,"" said an FSS official, adding it was difficult to impose rules where no money is changing hands.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Sweden's AB Volvo beat third-quarter core earnings expectations on Thursday, boosted by strong demand for its trucks even as lingering chip shortages hampered production.
Shortages of components and freight capacity had resulted in production disruptions and increased costs, Volvo said in a statement.
It also cautioned it expected further disruptions and stoppages, both in truck production and in other parts of the group.
While recovering strongly, the group's sales and adjusted earnings remained below pre-pandemic levels.
JP Morgan said Volvo had produced a ""solid set of results,"" despite the disruptions.
""Despite limited visibility in the supply chain and semi-conductor shortages still impacting the industry in 2H21, we expect consensus expectations to move slightly higher,"" the investment bank said in a note.
Volvo, which competes with Germany's Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) and Traton, said order intake of its trucks, including brands such as Mack and  Renault  (PA:RENA), fell 4% from a year earlier.
It forecast European heavy truck market registrations would rise to 280,000 trucks in 2021, and to 300,000 trucks next year. 
It expects the U.S. market to reach 270,000 trucks this year, and 300,000 trucks in 2022. 
Volvo had previously forecast registrations in both Europe and the United States at 290,000 trucks this year. 
Adjusted operating profit at the company, which also makes construction equipment, buses and engines, rose to 9.40 billion Swedish crowns ($1.09 billion) from 7.22 billion a year earlier, beating the 8.87 billion expected by analysts.
A global shortage of semiconductors has hit large swaths of the manufacturing sector, not least the vehicles industry, and has prevented Volvo from fully capitalising on robust demand.

Daimler Trucks said this month it would continue to sell fewer vehicles than it could have in the coming year as chip shortages hamper production.

According to Refinitiv IBES estimates data, MSCI Asia-Pacific companies' earnings estimates for the next 12 months have been cut by 1.3% in the past month, the first downgrade since June 2020.
""We turn cautious on the earnings outlook of Asian companies,"" said Alvin So, equity strategist at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in a note this week.
""We forecast MXAPJ earnings to grow 32% this year and 9% in 2022-23, cumulatively 5% below bottom-up consensus on 2023 EPS, with risks stemming from virus impact, China growth and policy, supply disruption, and cost inflation."" 
(GRAPHIC: MSCI Asia-Pacific Index's forward 12-month EPS estimates - https://graphics.reuters.com/ASIA-EPS/zdvxorammpx/chart.png) 
Asian firms have enjoyed consecutive earnings upgrades as analysts forecast regional firms to outbeat the lower profits posted in the early part of 2020, when the economies were hit due to lockdowns.
However, the firms face higher base figures now as most countries emerged from lockdowns and delivered better earnings in the second half of last year.
Consumer discretionary sector saw a downgrade of about 2.5%, while health care, consumer staples, tech and materials sectors, saw their estimates revised down by over 1% each. 
The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday slashed this year's economic growth forecast for Asia and warned that a fresh wave of COVID-19 infections, supply chain disruptions and inflation pressures pose downside risks to the outlook.
""Based on the current pace of vaccine roll-out, herd immunity(in ASEAN region) is at least six months away"", ANZ bank said in a report. 
(GRAPHIC: Breakdown by sector for estimates changes in last 30 days - https://graphics.reuters.com/ASIA-EPS/klvykzmybvg/chart.png)

Analysts had expected comparable revenues at the French luxury group, which strip out currency fluctuations, to grow by 21% in the three months to September, according to a consensus cited by UBS.
Revenues at the end of the quarter stood at 2.37 billion euros ($2.76 billion), some 40% above their pre-pandemic, 2019 levels, the company said on Thursday.
Luxury goods companies have recovered sharply from the fallout of the health emergency, lifted by strong demand for high-end wares as lockdowns ease across the world and consumers return to socialising. 
However shopping by travelling tourists - a key source of revenue for the sector - remains muted, and a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in Asia during the summer has weighed on growth. 
Finance chief Eric du Halgouët shrugged off concerns about a slowdown in China, the industry's biggest market, saying store traffic, the percentage of people leaving its shops with a purchase and the average sum spent in its stores were all on the rise in the past quarter.
He said the group had seen no impact so far from comments by Chinese leaders indicating plans to reduce wealth gaps in the country, including through property taxes.
""We have observed in China in recent quarters an acceleration of store traffic, an improvement in conversion rates and an increase in average baskets,"" he told reporters.

Nordic economies have rebounded sharply this year with Sweden back above pre-pandemic levels, stoking consumer spending and demand for financial services and lifting shares in the region's banking stocks.
Meanwhile, soaring energy prices and component shortages amid the recovery have also played a part in rekindling long-dormant inflation, potentially shifting the zero interest rate environment for banks and their customers.

Property shares were the best performers in the two financial hubs, with gauges tracking the sector rising at least 2% as of 11:20 a.m. local time. China Resources Land Ltd. soared as much as 9.6% and Longfor Group Holdings added 7.9% to be among the top point contributors to the Hang Seng Index.
High-ranking Chinese officials including Vice Premier Liu He and central bank deputy governor Pan Gongsheng said on Wednesday that risks in the property market are controllable and the sector’s financing is becoming normal. 
The remarks provided a much-need boost for sentiment for an industry that’s been weighed by falling housing sales, sliding investment and President Xi Jinping’s mention of a property tax in a recent article, on top of months of the nail-biting saga of Evergrande’s liquidity woes.
The regulators’ comments “reaffirmed our view that the ‘darkest hour’ for the sector is over,” Sinolink Securities Co. analysts including Du Haomin wrote in a Wednesday note. Banks’ granting of mortgages and loans for developers are picking up and other policies may improve such as the deferral of developers’ payment of funds for land purchases, they added.

Investing.com – China  Evergrande  Group (HK:3333) shares slid after a deal to sell a $2.6 billion stake in its property services unit collapsed, in its latest setback.
The developer’s Hong Kong shares tumbled 12.88% to HK$2.57 ($0.33) by 11:26 PM ET (3:26 AM GMT), after sliding as much as 14% earlier in the session. Trading in the shares had been suspended since Oct. 4.
China Evergrande said on Wednesday that a deal to sell a 50.1% stake in  Evergrande Property Services Group  (HK:6666) to Hopson Development Holdings Ltd. (HK:0754) was scrapped, with Hopson failing to meet the ""prerequisite to make a general offer"".
However, Hopson retaliated by saying it does not accept ""there is any substance whatsoever"" to China Evergrande's termination of the sales agreement and added that it is exploring options to protect its legitimate interests.
Trading in Hopson and Evergrande Property Services shares also resumed on Thursday.
This is the second deal that has failed to come through for China Evergrande, with the $1.7 billion sale of its Hong Kong headquarters collapsing amid buyer concerns over the developer's financial situation, according to Reuters.
The collapse of the deal with Hopson comes as a 30-day grace period for China Evergrande to pay $83.5 million in coupon payments for an offshore bond is set to expire. Should the company fail to make the payments, it will be considered in default.
Although the collapsed deals mean that China Evergrande will have to find another way to pay off its more-than-$300 billion debt, authorities have attempted to calm fears by saying that the company’s debt woes will not spiral out of control and trigger a broader financial crisis.
In another development in the Chinese property sector on Thursday, Modern Land China Co. Ltd. (HK:1107) said it has ceased to seek consent from investors to extend the maturity date of a dollar bond due on Oct. 25. The company’s shares were suspended from trading on Thursday."

MELBOURNE (Reuters) -Woodside Petroleum slashed its gas reserves estimate for two fields at the Wheatstone project on Thursday, in an unexpected downgrade that knocked the top Australian oil and gas company's shares.
The company also said it was on track to sell down stakes in its $12 billion Scarborough gas project and Pluto LNG train 2 and $4.6 billion Sangomar oil project in Senegal, with soaring oil and gas prices improving its bargaining position.
""It certainly doesn't hurt to have oil prices in the $80s and record LNG prices and supply crunches at the time you're doing this,"" Chief Financial Officer Sherry Duhe told Reuters.
Woodside (OTC:WOPEY) expects to announce selldowns on the Scarborough and Pluto in time to make a final investment decision on those projects by Dec. 15, she said.
Shares in Woodside, which is poised to merge with the petroleum arm of BHP Group (NYSE:BHP), fell as much as 1.8% in a flat broader market after it cut its reserves estimate and reported weaker-than-expected third quarter sales revenue.
Woodside cut estimated total proved and probable reserves from the Julimar and Brunello fields, which contribute one-fifth of the gas at the Wheatstone LNG project run by  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX), by 27% to 168.4 million barrels of oil equivalent.
""Overall it does not change our fundamental view this is a multi-decade high quality asset and any changes in these reserves are back at that tail end of production anyway,"" Duhe said in an interview.
She said the downgrade would have no impact on production at the 8.9 million tonnes a year Wheatstone LNG plant and would not impact the merger ratio with BHP's petroleum arm.
The reserves estimate cut stemmed from reviewing well performance, drilling results and a reassessment of seismic data on the reservoir.
Woodside said its quarterly revenue more than doubled to $1.53 billion from $699 million a year ago, boosted by sales of third-party volumes into a hot spot market. However, it missed a broker consensus forecast of $1.69 billion.
It expects to benefit more from the strong prices in the fourth quarter, as most of its contracts are tied to oil prices with a three-month lag.

Woodside has more exposure to spot LNG prices, which have soared to record highs, than local rivals Santos, Oil Search (OTC:OISHY) and Origin Energy. 
It expects about 17% of its produced LNG to be sold into the spot market in the fourth quarter.

(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc said on Wednesday its upcoming factories and supply-chain headwinds would put pressure on its margins after it beat Wall Street expectations for third-quarter revenue on the back of record deliveries. 
The world's most valuable automaker has weathered the pandemic and the global supply-chain crisis better than rivals, posting record revenue for the fifth consecutive quarter in the July-to-September period, fueled by a production build-up at its Chinese factory. 
But the company led by billionaire Elon Musk faces challenges growing earnings in coming quarters due to supply chain disruptions and the time required to ramp up production at new factories in Berlin and Texas.
""There's quite an execution journey ahead of us,"" Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn said, referring to the new factories.
Price fluctuations of raw materials such as nickel and aluminum had created an ""uncertain environment with respect to cost structure"", he added.
Even so, he said Tesla was ""quite a bit ahead"" of its plan to increase deliveries by 50% this year. 
""Q4 production will depend heavily on availability of parts, but we are driving for continued growth,"" he said. 
Tesla shares, up about 23% this year, were down about 0.6% in extended trade late on Wednesday.
Musk himself was not present on the quarterly earnings call for the first time, a development that may have disappointed those investors keen to hear the celebrity CEO's latest thoughts.
Third-quarter revenue rose to $13.76 billion from $8.77 billion a year earlier, slightly beating analyst expectations according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Tesla's automotive gross margin, excluding environmental credits, rose to 28.8%, from 25.8% the previous quarter.
Tesla's overall average price fell as it sold more lower-priced Model 3 and Model Y cars, but it raised prices in the United States.
The company posted robust sales in China, where its low-cost Shanghai factory has surpassed the Tesla factory in Fremont, California, in terms of production. 
Tesla also said it intended to use lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery chemistry, which is cheaper than traditional batteries but offers lower range, in entry-level models sold outside China. Analysts said this would help keep costs down and address shortages.

It expected the first vehicles equipped with its own 4680, bigger battery cells to be delivered early next year, although it did not say which model would be fitted with them. Musk said in September last year that using its own cells would let Tesla offer a $25,000 car in three years.
In the third quarter, Tesla posted $279 million in revenue from sales of environmental credits, the lowest level in nearly two years. The company sells its excess environmental credits to other automakers that are trying to comply with regulations in California and elsewhere.

Developer Modern Land Faces Liquidity Issues (8:10 a.m. HK)
Modern Land says it continues to experience liquidity issues and won’t seek permission from debt holders to delay repaying a $250 million bond. The property developer said it’s in discussions with prospective independent financial advisers to assist with assessing the company’s capital structure, liquidity profile, operating and financial condition, “with a view to achieving a feasible solution to its current liquidity issues.”
Property Unit Stake Sale Called Off (2:40 p.m. NY)
Evergrande said it ended talks last week to sell 50.1% of its shares in Evergrande Property Services Group Ltd. for about HK$20 billion ($2.6 billion), according to a filing with the Hong Kong stock exchange Wednesday. It had been negotiating to sell a majority stake in the property-management arm to Hopson Development Holdings Ltd.
Hopson said in a separate statement that it “regrets to announce that the vendor has failed to complete the sale” of the stake, and asked for its shares to also resume trading.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Qantas Airways Ltd expects to get back to flying 100% of its pre-COVID-19 domestic capacity by January as Australian state borders open up due to surging vaccination rates, the airline's chief executive said on Thursday.
""It looks like by Christmas we will have every state open except for Western Australia, and Western Australia will open up domestically hopefully early in the new year, we assume around February,"" Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said at an industry conference held by Flight Centre Travel Group Ltd.
Travel restrictions between Sydney and Melbourne, Australia's largest cities, eased on Wednesday as Victoria opened its borders to fully vaccinated residents from New South Wales amid a rapid rise in immunisation levels.
With cases trending lower in New South Wales, including Sydney, residents will be allowed quarantine-free entry into Victoria for the first time in more than three months. Travellers from Melbourne who wish to enter Sydney, however, must undergo a two-week home quarantine.
Joyce said Qantas had just one daily flight from Sydney to Melbourne at present, down from 55 before the pandemic when it was one of the world's busiest domestic routes.

""We will progressively in the first week of November go back to nearly 15 flights a day and by Christmas get back to closer to 30 to 40 flights per day and in the new year, February, when business comes back, pretty close to the pre-COVID schedule,"" he said.
The airline will resume international passenger flights from Sydney to London and Los Angeles on Nov. 1 after New South Wales last week said it would permit the entry of fully vaccinated travellers without the need for quarantine, though only citizens and permanent residents will be allowed back in.

LOS ANGELES(Reuters) -About 100 people protested near Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s headquarters on Wednesday against the streaming pioneer’s decision to release comedian Dave Chappelle’s new special, which they say ridicules transgender people.
Netflix staff members, transgender rights advocates and public officials gathered on a sidewalk outside a Netflix office blocks away from the company's main 13-story Sunset Boulevard building in Los Angeles.
Demonstrators held signs proclaiming, “Trans Lives Matter” and “Team Trans” and chanted slogans like “What do we want? Accountability,” “When do we want it? Now.”
Netflix staff were outnumbered by members of the public, but the precise number was not clear. Netflix employees had called for a walkout. 
Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos acknowledged in interviews before the walkout, “I screwed up” in how he spoke to Netflix’s staff about Chappelle’s special, “The Closer.”
Sarandos previously defended the decision to air the show, saying Chappelle's language did not cross the line into inciting violence. Netflix posted record subscriber numbers on Tuesday,
“While we appreciate the acknowledgement of the screw-up, in his own words, we want to actually talk about what that repair looks like,” said Ashlee Marie Preston, a transgender activist who came out in support of the Netflix employees. 
Joey Soloway, creator of “Transparent,” a now-ended streaming series on rival Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) that had a transgender character, talked about the line that separates edgy jokes and harmful speech.
“People say to me, as a comedian, where’s the line?” said Soloway. “The line is anything that makes it worse.” 
Not everyone supported that message. “...The idea that a small, angry mob can shape entertainment and silence people’s speech is terrifying,"" said counterprotester Dick Masterson.
While employee protests against corporate policies have become common in Silicon Valley, this is believed to be the first such action at the pioneer streaming video company.

The controversy over “The Closer” is playing out against the backdrop of a company-wide diversity effort that began in 2018, after Netflix's former head of communications was fired for using a racial epithet in company meetings. 
“It doesn’t feel good to have been working at the company that put that out there,” Netflix software engineer Terra Field wrote in a Medium post, referring to ""The Closer."" “Especially when we’ve spent years building out the company’s policies and benefits so that it would be a great place for trans people to work.”

Earlier this month, Mexico City officials said they were opening criminal cases against people and companies involved in building the Metro's Line 12 and urged the firms to quickly come to settlement deals.
Grupo Carso denied responsibility for the accident. It said that despite disagreement on what caused the incident and in order to not further delay the rehabilitation and reinforcement work, it ""agreed to resolve in advance the legal procedures associated with this unfortunate event"" by inking Wednesday's agreement.
The firm said it has told the attorney general's office it is interested in participating in a compensation fund for the accident's victims.
The accident occurred in May when an overpass and train carriage on the line plummeted onto a stream of cars in the southeast of the city.

An independent auditor found that missing bolts and poor welding contributed to the crash, findings confirmed in a separate investigation by the Mexico City attorney general's office.
Slim has said his construction firm, Grupo Carso, which helped build the section that collapsed, will repair the line at no cost to the government. Mexico's Grupo ICA and France's  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) were a part of the consortium that built the full line.

In September, Japanese prosecutors asked a Tokyo court to send the executive, Greg Kelly, to prison for two years for his alleged part in helping Carlos Ghosn, Nissan's ousted CEO, hide earnings.
When asked about the case, Emanuel, who President Joe Biden has nominated to be his ambassador to key U.S. ally Japan, told senators he would deal with it as if he was a congressman and Kelly a constituent.
""I've already started to inquire about this and I want a report on my desk and ... if you start asking that, that goes from here to up here as a top priority,"" he said.
""This is not just another piece of business to be checked out,"" he said. ""I'm going to be approaching this subject as a former U.S. congressman, who knows what it means when you have a constituent at heart.""
Emanuel, the former mayor of Chicago, was responding to a question from Republican Senator William Hagerty of Tennessee, a former ambassador to Japan, who asked if he would make it a top priority to clear Kelly's name.
Hagerty referred to Kelly as a ""Tennessee citizen"" and said he had been ""deceived"" into leaving the state to go to Japan where he was arrested in 2018, even though his lawyers believed he had committed no crime.
Hagerty said Japan was the number one investor in his home state and called the case ""a real impediment"" to the U.S.-Japan economic relationship.
Japanese prosecutors called for the jail sentence for Kelly, who has been on bail in Japan since 2018, during closing arguments in a trial that began a last year. 
A ruling in the case is expected next year, and if found guilty, Kelly could join two other Americans serving time in Japan after a court sentenced them in July for helping smuggle Ghosn out of Japan on a private jet hidden in luggage to Lebanon at the end of 2019, where he remains free as a fugitive.

Kelly has denied charges he helped Ghosn hide 9.3 billion yen ($81.4 million) of Ghosn's earnings over eight years through deferred payments, saying that his only goal had been to retain a chief executive who could have been lured away by a rival automaker.
Both former Nissan executives allege they are victims of a boardroom coup by former colleagues worried that Ghosn would push through a merger between Nissan and Renault SA (OTC:RNLSY), its largest shareholder.

The Chinese billionaire has largely been out of public view since he publicly criticised China's regulatory system in a speech last year. His empire promptly came under heavy scrutiny by regulators, that even led to the suspension of Ant Group's $37 billion blockbuster IPO.
The Diario de Mallorca newspaper said Ma was seen on Tuesday in the port of Andratx buying home decor at a local store.
The superyacht Zen has been moving along Mallorca's northwestern coast for the past few days and was in Andratx on Tuesday. 
It dropped anchor on Wednesday near the beach town of Santa Ponsa, but a Reuters cameraman could only see smaller support boats returning to the superyacht from the shore empty, with Ma nowhere to be seen.
Without citing any sources, El Pais newspaper said Ma had been visiting Spain's Balearic Islands since Saturday, accompanied by various Chinese business people and his security detail.
The sleek five-deck, vertical-bowed motor yacht, measuring 88 metres (289 ft), can accommodate up to 16 guests and a crew of 25, according to the Superyacht Times edition. It was built in the Netherlands and delivered in April.
Ma, a globe-trotter not known to shy away from the limelight before falling out with regulators, retired as Alibaba's chairman in 2019.
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post, which is owned by Alibaba, reported on Tuesday that Ma was in Spain for a study tour on agriculture and technology related to environmental issues after spending ""private time"" with his family in Hong Kong.

Alibaba Group's Hong Kong shares rose nearly 10% earlier on Wednesday, extending gains for the fourth consecutive session, with brokers saying that investors saw Ma's trip as a sign of the central government relaxing its scrutiny over the group.
A Spanish banking industry source told Reuters Ma had visited Mallorca in his company in 2019 and that the billionaire liked to ""often spend time"" in the Balearic Islands.

1481,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2021 07:35PM ET</span>",Tesla lobbies Modi's office in India to slash taxes before it enters market-sources,"By Aditi Shah and Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Tesla Inc has urged Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's office to slash import taxes on electric vehicles before it enters the market, four sources told Reuters, ratcheting up demands that faced objections from some Indian automakers.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) wants to begin selling imported cars in India this year but says taxes in the country are among the highest in the world. Its request for tax cuts - first reported by Reuters in July https://reut.rs/3hWd2Ok - prompted objections from several local players, who say such a move would deter investment in domestic manufacturing.
Tesla executives, including its head of policy in India, Manuj Khurana, took the company's demands to Modi's officials last month in a closed-door meeting, arguing that the taxes were too high, four sources familiar with the discussions said. 
During the meeting at Modi's office, Tesla said that India's duty structure would not make its business in the country a ""viable proposition"", according to one of the sources.
India levies an import duty of 60% on electric vehicles that cost $40,000 or less, and 100% duty on those priced over $40,000. Analysts have said that at these rates Tesla cars would become far too costly for buyers and could limit their sales.
Tesla has separately also put in a request for a meeting between its Chief Executive Elon Musk and Modi, three of the sources said.
Modi's office and Tesla, as well as its executive Khurana, did not respond to a request for comment.
It is not clear what Modi's office specifically told Tesla in response, but the four sources told Reuters government officials are divided over the U.S. automaker's demands. Some officials want the company to commit to local manufacturing before considering any import tax breaks.
Concern about the impact on the local auto industry is also weighing on the government, the sources added.
Indian companies such as  Tata Motors  (NYSE:TTM), which recently raised $1 billion from investors https://reut.rs/3vwpMQT including TPG to boost EV production locally, has said giving Tesla concessions would be contrary to India's plans to boost domestic EV manufacturing.
One of the sources, who has direct knowledge of the government's thinking, said: ""If Tesla was the only EV maker, decreasing duties would have worked. But there are others.""
The transport minister said this month Tesla should not sell made-in-China cars in India and should manufacture locally instead, but Tesla has indicated it first wants to experiment with imports.
Musk said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) in July that ""if Tesla is able to succeed with imported vehicles, then a factory in India is quite likely.""

The Indian market for premium EVs is still in its infancy and charging infrastructure is scarce. Just 5,000 of the 2.4 million cars sold in India last year were electric.
One government official said lowering duties for a limited period to pave the way for Tesla's entry could ""boost India's investor friendly image and green credentials"" while also attracting more investments.

By Devik Jain, Shreyashi Sanyal and Sinéad Carew
(Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Dow climbed on Wednesday with the Dow hitting an intraday record high as investors eyed better than expected third-quarter earnings from U.S. companies.
While the Nasdaq lagged as technology stocks took a breather, the Dow Jones Industrials Average surpassed its previous record reached in mid-August before paring gains during the session. The benchmark S&P 500 index came within five points of its early September record at its peak for the day.
The S&P's healthcare index rallied for a second day in a row with help from Anthem and Abbott, which both gained ground on impressive financial forecasts.
The S&P had fallen almost 6% below its record by Oct. 4 as investors worried about supply chain problems, profit margin pressures, higher wages and increasing input costs ahead of the earnings season, which kicked off last week.
And while U.S. companies have been citing supply chain problems and higher costs during their earnings calls, investors have been relieved so far that they seem to be able to maintain profit margins by passing on costs to customers, according to Jack Janasiewicz, strategist and portfolio manager at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions.
""Earnings are what matter and thus far what we've seen have actually been better than expected. Margins are actually holding up, said Janasiewicz.
""The bar was set pretty low coming into (earnings season) so that makes things a little easier ... Things are coming out, so far, better than expected. That's putting upward pressure on stocks.""
With just about 14% of S&P 500 third-quarter reports in, analysts were expecting earnings for the benchmark index to rise 33% from the year-ago quarter. More than 85% of earnings beat expectations, according to the latest Refinitiv data.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 152.03 points, or 0.43%, to 35,609.34, the S&P 500 gained 16.56 points, or 0.37%, to 4,536.19 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 7.41 points, or 0.05%, to 15,121.68.
The CBOE volatility index, also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, closed at 15.49 after earlier hitting 15.29, its lowest level since Aug. 13.
Eight of the S&P's eleven major industry sectors indexes were advanced, led by utilities and real estate, both finishing up about 1.6% higher, and healthcare stocks, which closed up 1.5%.
The technology sector was the S&P's biggest laggard, down 0.3%, as it snapped a five-day rally.
The S&P 500 Value index, which houses economically-sensitive stocks like energy and industrials, closed up 0.9% after hitting a fresh record high.
However, shares in  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) were down around 5% in after the bell trading on Wednesday after it missed market estimates for third-quarter revenue due to a decline in orders at its managed infrastructure unit ahead of a spinoff. 
Shares in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc dipped slightly in late trade even after it beat Wall Street expectations for third-quarter revenue on the back of record deliveries, as the electric carmaker navigates through a prolonged global shortage of chips and raw materials. 
 Abbott Laboratories  (NYSE:ABT) had finished the regular trading session up 3.3% after raising its full-year profit forecast on a rebound in COVID-19 test sales. 
Anthem Inc soared 7.7% after raising its full-year earnings forecasts. However, Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB) shares closed down 0.6% as it reported a much smaller-than-expected quarterly sales of its Alzheimer's drug while it raised its full year earnings forecast. 
 Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) gained 2.4% after it added more postpaid phone subscribers than expected in the third quarter. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.29-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.37-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 63 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 106 new highs and 41 new lows.
On U.S. exchanges 9.29 billion shares changed hands compared with the 10.26 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

ANKENY, Iowa (Reuters) - U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack visited striking union members outside a Deere (NYSE:DE) & Co farm equipment plant in Iowa on Wednesday, telling workers he supports them and the country needs them.
Deere employees represented by the United Auto Workers (UAW) are joining thousands of other U.S. workers who have gone on strike in recent months, demanding higher pay and better working conditions.
Emboldened by a tight jobs market and an administration they consider sypathetic to unions, workers say the strikes are fueled in part by frustration over cuts to healthcare and retirement benefits at a time when their employers are reporting record-breaking returns. 
""You work hard and you deserve a fair price and a fair deal,"" Vilsack told picketers. He said he would be happy to tell Deere Chief Executive Officer John May how important it is to resolve the dispute quickly and fairly.
The company in August raised its full-year earnings forecast amid strong demand.
Deere officials have repeatedly said they want to resolve the strike and maintain their employees' status as the best paid in the industry.
The strike at Deere, the largest U.S. farm equipment maker, began on Oct. 14 after 90% of hourly workers rejected the company's contract offer. Now, about 10,000 employees across 14 U.S. locations are on strike.
The strike is taking place in the middle of the U.S. corn and soybean harvest as farmers are struggling to find parts for tractors and combines.
""We care for the farmers,"" said Keith Chada, a committeeman for the UAW, who was at the Ankeny plant. 
""At the end of the day, we'd like to be able to put our children through college, be able to afford the things that these people can afford on the other side.""
As Vilsack pulled up in a SUV, protesters outside the plant waved blue and white signs declaring ""UAW on strike."" Drivers honked their horns in support as they drove past.
Vilsack shook hands and wished protesters luck. At one point, he pulled out an American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees lifetime honorary membership card from his pocket.
""It means a lot that he came out to show support for us,"" said Justin Limke, a UAW Local 450 vice president who works as a painter in the plant. 

The visit echoed Vilsack's political past in 1998, when the then-Iowa state senator was lagging in Iowa's gubernatorial race.
""The UAW was with me from the get go,"" Vilsack said. ""You don't forget the people that were with you.""

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc CEO Elon Musk did not participate in the company's earnings conference call for the first time on Wednesday, making him one of the rare top executives in the United States to miss the quarterly ritual of talking to Wall Street. 
Musk's popularity among investors and customers is a major asset for the electric car maker, and his absence - if it continues - is likely to turn Tesla's quarterly calls into more staid reviews of business than unpredictable platforms for the celebrity CEO's latest thoughts.
Earlier on Wednesday, Tesla beat Wall Street expectations for third-quarter revenue on the back of record deliveries as it navigated a prolonged global shortage of chips and raw materials.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s late CEO, Steve Jobs, did not usually speak on quarterly conference calls, but his successor, Tim Cook, makes an appearance at the events. So do other major executives like Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co's CEO, Jim Farley, and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)'s CEO Mark Zuckerberg.
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s billionaire founder, Jeff Bezos, did not attend the e-commerce giant's earnings calls prior to his stepping down as CEO earlier this year. Musk and Bezos have been vying for the title of world's richest person.
Musk said during Tesla's July earnings call that he would not necessarily be present at such future events, ""unless there's something really important that I need to say."" 
In the past, the outspoken tycoon has used the quarterly calls to make promises about delivering technology and products and to fire back at analysts, the government and critics.
These days, Musk often focuses on another major venture, SpaceX, which is developing a massive rocket to transport people to Mars with the ultimate goal of colonizing the planet.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) has said its clients believe SpaceX could make Musk the first ""trillionaire"" and that the company could ultimately command a higher valuation than even Tesla, the world's most valuable industrial/manufacturing company.

On an earnings call last year, Musk called the U.S. government's stay-at-home restrictions to curtail the coronavirus outbreak “fascist.” 
In another call in 2018, he refused to answer questions from analysts on the electric vehicle maker’s capital requirements, saying “boring, bonehead questions are not cool.” Tesla shares fell as a result.

1486,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2021 06:20PM ET</span>","Changing Facebook's name will not deter lawmaker or regulatory scrutiny, experts say","By Sheila Dang and Supantha Mukherjee
(Reuters) - Renaming  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) is unlikely to enable the tech giant to distance itself from regulatory and public scrutiny around the potential harms caused by its social media apps, marketing and branding experts told Reuters.
Tech publication The Verge reported on Tuesday that the California-based firm is planning to change its corporate branding to reflect that as well as owning the social media platform that made it a global household name, it also now includes other thriving businesses like Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus.
The company declined to comment regarding the report on the possible rebranding. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story.
Facebook is battling intense scrutiny after a whistleblower leaked thousands of internal documents that showed it contributed to increased polarization online when it made changes to its content algorithm, failed to take steps to reduce vaccine hesitancy, and was aware that popular social media app Instagram harmed the mental health of teenage girls.
The U.S. Senate held a hearing earlier this month into the effect of Instagram on young users.
""Legislators and politicians are sufficiently smart to not be fooled by a rebranding,"" said James Cordwell, an internet analyst at Atlantic Equities. 
Renaming can be an effective strategy to allow subsidiary brands to maintain their own reputations, said Marisa Mulvihill, head of brand and activation at Prophet, a branding and marketing consultancy. But the media and regulators ""are not going to stop investigating or creating reforms just because you rebranded,"" she added.
The new parent company name could reflect Facebook's focus on building the 'metaverse,' The Verge reported, referring to a proposed digital world where people can use different devices to move and communicate in a virtual environment.
It could also prevent a possible negative perception around the Facebook name from affecting WhatsApp, the messaging app used by nearly 2 billion people globally, and Oculus, its virtual reality brand, experts said.
According to Prophet's annual ranking, Facebook's brand relevance to U.S. consumers has dropped ""precipitously"" over the past several years, Mulvihill said.
""What you don't want is for that to proliferate and have a negative halo effect on other parts of your business,"" said Deborah Stafford-Watson, head of strategy at brand consultancy firm Elmwood.
Other major companies have taken similar steps. Google reorganized under a holding company called Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in 2015, as the company best known for internet searches increasingly pursued ambitions like autonomous driving technology.
In 2003, cigarette seller Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) rebranded itself as Altria (NYSE:MO), at a time when the company owned Kraft Foods (NASDAQ:KHC). It later spun off the food division.
While the move to rebrand as Altria didn't remove the negative connotations of tobacco from the cigarette brands itself, it did help to limit the effects on Kraft, Mulvihill said.

Facebook will continue to confront the same pressures even after a rebrand, the experts said.
""I don't think it's going to help Facebook mitigate regulators' scrutiny or the general public's skepticism, if not distrust,"" said Natasha Jen, a partner at Pentagram, a design studio that does advertising and communication work. ""Trust is something you need to earn.""

Net cash outflows at AMP (OTC:AMLTF)'s main wealth management business was A$1.4 billion ($1.05 billion) in the three months to September, lower than A$1.8 billion in the same period last year.
However, assets under management at the unit was little changed at A$131.2 billion as the broader market situation improved, the company said. 
In last year's third quarter, the Australian wealth unit saw outflows of A$692 million due to the Early Release of Super (ERS) program that the government scrapped at the end of 2020 as the country fared better than initially thought against the pandemic. 
AMP has suffered from persistent outflows since a government-backed inquiry revealed a series of scandals that the 172-year old firm has been looking to make amends for and regain trust.
It is undergoing a restructuring, with plans to spin off its asset management arm's private markets business in the first half of next year. 

The asset management arm, AMP Capital, reported outflows of A$12 billion for the quarter, a sizable jump from A$2.4 billion a year earlier, as it lost its New Zealand wealth management mandate, which accounted for A$9.2 billion.

(Reuters) -IBM on Wednesday missed market estimates for quarterly revenue as its managed infrastructure business suffered from a decline in orders ahead of a spinoff next month, sending its shares down 4% in extended trading.
The lower-margin, legacy unit provides technical support to  IBM  (NYSE:IBM)'s clients and has shrunk in recent years as companies moved to the cloud, becoming a drag on Big Blue's earnings. 
""As we issued the effective date for the spin-off of our managed infrastructure business, our clients paused all new project activities at the end of September and that impacted us here,"" Chief Financial Officer James Kavanaugh said in an interview.
Revenue at the global technology services unit, which houses the business set to be called Kyndryl after the spinoff, fell 4.8% to $6.15 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30.
Kavanaugh also said demand dropped at the systems business, home to IBM's mainframe computers, as the end of the product cycle neared, driving a 12% fall in the unit's revenue.
The slowdown in the legacy business has prompted 110-year-old IBM to shift focus to hybrid-cloud, an area where it sees a $1 trillion market opportunity, to boost growth and better compete with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT).
Revenue at the cloud and cognitive software unit was up 2.5% at $5.69 billion but missed analysts' estimates of $5.77 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
The weakness at IBM's ""supposedly high-growth areas is more problematic"" than the revenue miss, said Wedbush analyst Moshe Katri.
Total revenue rose slightly to $17.62 billion, missing expectations of $17.77 billion.

But IBM's revenue adjusted for the Kyndryl spinoff was 2.5% higher, helped in part by firmer demand for its consulting services from enterprises digitizing their operations during the COVID-19 pandemic.

1491,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2021 05:57PM ET</span>",PayPal in $45 billion bid for Pinterest -sources,"By Greg Roumeliotis and Arriana McLymore
(Reuters) -  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL) has offered to buy digital pinboard site Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) Inc for $45 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, a combination that could herald more financial technology and social media tie-ups in e-ecommerce.
It would be the biggest acquisition of a social media company, surpassing  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s $26.2 billion purchase of LinkedIn in 2016.
The deal talks come as internet shoppers increasingly buy items they see on social media, often following ""influencers"" on platforms such as Instagram and TikTok. Acquiring Pinterest would allow PayPal to capture more of that e-commerce growth and diversify its income though advertising revenue. 
PayPal has offered $70 per share, mostly in stock, for Pinterest, one of the sources said. The online payments provider hopes to successfully negotiate and announce a deal by the time it reports quarterly earnings on Nov. 8, the source added.
The sources cautioned that no deal was certain and terms could change. They asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. 
PayPal and Pinterest did not respond to requests for comment. Bloomberg News first reported on the companies' talks on Wednesday.
PayPal shares fell 4.9% to close at $258.36, while Pinterest shares jumped 12.8% to $62.68. 
""(The) combination would be a significant positive for PayPal's ongoing monetization initiatives on both sides of its merchant and consumer platforms, especially if Pinterest's social commerce platform gets integrated with Honey's AI into PayPal's destination app,"" Wedbush analysts wrote in a note.
The payments behemoth was among the big winners of the COVID-19 pandemic, as more people used its services to shop online and pay bills to avoid stepping out. Its shares have risen about 36% in the last 12 months, giving it a market capitalization of nearly $320 billion.
Pinterest was valued at about $13 billion when it went public in 2019. It also saw a huge spike in users looking for crafts and DIY project ideas, as lockdown curbs kept people at home.
As lockdowns eased, Pinterest has warned about slowing user growth, especially in the United States, its largest market. It has said it expects revenue growth mainly through deeper engagement with existing users rather than signing up new ones.
The market has valued Pinterest shares more cheaply than those of some younger social media platforms such as  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) but higher than more mature companies such as  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR), according to Refinitiv Eikon valuation metrics.
PayPal's offer represents a 26% premium to Pinterest's closing price of $55.58 on Tuesday and it is equivalent to 62 times the social media company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization over the last 12 months, according to Eikon. 
By that metric, Microsoft paid 79 times LinkedIn's earnings when it acquired it in all-cash deal. Pinterest, however, would be giving its shareholders some of PayPal's stock, in a bet that this currency would appreciate over time over time as the combined company reaps revenue and cost synergies.
Pinterest is at a crossroads after co-founder Evan Sharp (OTC:SHCAY) announced last week he would step down as chief creative officer to join LoveFrom, a firm led by Jony Ive, the designer of many Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) products.
Sharp founded the online scrapbook and photo-sharing platform in 2010 with Ben Silbermann, who is the San Francisco, California-based company's chief executive officer, and Paul Sciarra, who left in 2012.
PayPal had been looking to boost its e-commerce offerings in recent years through acquisitions. It bought online coupon finder Honey Science in 2019 for $4 billion and Japanese buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) firm Paidy for $2.7 billion earlier this year. It acquired return-service provider Happy Returns in May.
SOCIAL MEDIA-DRIVEN COMMERCE
Social media platforms that have not pursued mergers with fintech firms have been working on ways to allow consumers to buy directly from their platforms.
TikTok, for example, is testing a way for users to buy products directly on its short video app. It has partnered with ecommerce giant Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and in August began allowing retail brands to link their product catalogs to the app.

Analysts said the PayPal-Pinterest deal talks highlight the potential for other social media and fintech companies to join forces to capture swaths of the e-commerce market.
""Social/interactive commerce is growing in the United States and no one has won it yet. So rather than going against Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), PayPal is making a bet on a different kind of shopping model,"" said Marketplace Pulse e-commerce analyst Joe Kaziukėnas.

With people taking to the roads again and air travel picking up as international borders reopen, Kinder Morgan reported a jump of 9% in gasoline volumes and a 56% surge in jet fuel volumes. 
The company also posted a 3% rise in gas pipeline volumes as a scramble to fill gas inventories before the winter heating season in Europe and Asia steadily boosted exports of liquefied natural gas from the United States.
""We continue to benefit from growing global natural gas demand. Our assets are well-positioned to serve growing domestic markets and export locations for LNG and Mexico,"" Chief Executive Officer Steve Kean said.
The Delta variant of COVID-19 had hit refined products volumes during the period, but the company expects the impact to ease in the fourth quarter. 
Kinder Morgan, which pushed into the renewable natural gas business with the $310 million purchase of privately held Kinetrex Energy this year, said it was looking to take advantage of the global transition to green energy by seeking opportunities in the space.
Kinetrex and natural gas pipeline firm Stagecoach Gas Services, which Kinder Morgan bought in July, are expected to slightly outperform the company's expectations for the year.
Adjusted profit rose to $505 million, or 22 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, from $485 million, or 21 cents per share, a year earlier.

Analysts on average had estimated 24 cents per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Revenue of $3.82 billion beat estimates of $3.26 billion.

1493,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2021 05:30PM ET</span>",Evergrande's $2.6 billion unit stake sale fails as Chinese officials seek to calm nerves,"By Clare Jim and Andrew Galbraith
HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Teetering Chinese property giant China Evergrande formally abandoned plans to sell a $2.6 billion stake in one of its key units on Wednesday, as Beijing officials went out in force to say the problems would not spin out of control.
Once China's top-selling developer and now reeling under more than $300 billion of debt, Evergrande was in talks to sell a 50.1% stake in its Evergrande Property Services arm to smaller rival Hopson Development Holdings.
In a stock exchange filing late on Wednesday, Evergrande said that the company had reason to believe that Hopson had not met the ""prerequisite to make a general offer"" for its unit without elaborating further. 
In a separate exchange filing, Evergrande said barring its sale of a stake worth $1.5 billion https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-evergrande-transfer-15-bln-stake-shengjing-bank-state-firm-2021-09-29 in Chinese lender Shengjing Bank Co, it had made no material progress in selling other assets it has put on the block.
Evergrande's disclosures came after a number of top Chinese officials had sought to reassure homebuyers and markets that the current woes in the property sector would not be allowed to turn into a full-scale crisis.
Worries that a cash crunch at Evergrande, whose liabilities are equal to 2% of China's gross domestic product, could cause economic contagion have seen swathes of other heavily-indebted developers hit with credit rating downgrades, while some smaller ones have already defaulted. 
In comments reported by state media Xinhua and echoing words from the country's central bank late last week, Vice Premier Liu He told a Beijing forum on Wednesday that the risks were controllable, and that reasonable capital demand from property firms was being met.
The chairman of China's securities regulator, Yi Huiman, added at the same forum that authorities would properly handle the default risks and look to curb excessive debt more broadly. 
""(We need) to improve the effectiveness of the constraint mechanism on debt financing, to avoid excessive financing through 'high leverage',"" Yi said.
Chinese property developers have total outstanding debt of 33.5 trillion yuan ($5.24 trillion), according to Nomura, equivalent to roughly a third of the country's gross domestic product.
Evergrande, which has epitomised China's freewheeling era of borrowing and building, has been scrambling to raise funds to pay its many lenders and suppliers, amid expectations it is about to formally default on one of its international bonds.
In its Wednesday filing, Evergrande said it would continue to implement measures ""to ease the liquidity issues"" and would use best efforts to negotiate for the renewal or extension of its borrowings with its creditors.
""In view of the difficulties, challenges and uncertainties in improving its liquidity, there is no guarantee that the group will be able to meet its financial obligations under the relevant financing documents and other contracts,"" it said.
Creditors have so far said there has been no contact from Evergrande despite weeks of effort on their behalf. Evergrande will officially be in default if it doesn't make an already- overdue March 2022 bond coupon payment by Monday.
BLAME GAME 
Sources told Reuters on Tuesday Evergrande had been forced to shelve its property services unit stake sale to Hopson after failing to win the blessing of the Guangdong provincial government, which is overseeing Evergrande's restructuring.
Some of Evergrande's international creditors had also opposed the deal, one of them said. If companies sell assets just before they collapse, creditors have less to claw their money back with. 
There was a blame game starting too though.
Hopson said in an exchange filing that it had been prepared to complete the deal but had received a transaction termination notice from Evergrande on Oct. 13.
Evergrande, Evergrande Property Services, and Hopson, which have had trading in their shares suspended since Oct. 4 pending the deal announcement, all said they had requested for their shares to resume trading in Hong Kong from Thursday.
The sale setback for Evergrande comes after Chinese state-owned Yuexiu Property pulled out of a proposed $1.7 billion deal to buy its Hong Kong headquarters last week.
REBUILDING PROCESS 
Pan Gongsheng, head of China's foreign exchange regulator, added to a chorus of officials trying to soothe concerns, saying excessive tightening by financial institutions and markets on the property sector was being gradually corrected, financial magazine Yicai reported.
Those comments followed a speech by People's Bank of China (PBOC) Governor Yi Gang, who said on Sunday https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-faces-challenges-mismanagement-certain-firms-says-pboc-head-2021-10-17 that the world's second-largest economy is ""doing well"" but faces challenges such as default risks for certain firms due to ""mismanagement.""
A transcript of the comments released by the PBOC on Wednesday showed Yi also saying that China will fully respect and protect the legal rights of Evergrande's creditors and asset owners, in line with ""repayment priorities"" laid out by China's laws. 
Strong demand at a sale of Chinese government bonds on Wednesday showed there was no sign of the troubles impacting the wider markets.
The official reassurances in recent days and some coupon payments from other major developers, helped China high-yield debt spreads continue to improve after hitting record high levels last week.

There was an increasingly stark divide though. While many firms saw their bond prices continue to regain ground, Kaisa group, which was the first Chinese real estate firm to default in 2015, saw its bonds hit new record lows.
Central China Real Estate became the latest to see its credit rating chopped, and like many of its peers in recent days, was immediately warned that it could happen again too.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The head of the Federal Aviation Administration will tell U.S. lawmakers on Thursday that the agency is taking a new stance in overseeing the safety efforts of airplane manufacturers like Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. 
""Our approach to aircraft certification and safety oversight has changed. The FAA’s relationship with manufacturers is evolving,"" agency Administrator Steve Dickson says in prepared testimony for a hearing before a U.S. House of Representatives panel, which was seen by Reuters.
""We are prioritizing oversight of manufacturers and working to focus that oversight on safety-critical areas. We are delegating fewer responsibilities and demanding more transparency from them, and evaluating key assumptions prior to delegating functions in certain areas.""
Congress in December approved legislation boosting FAA oversight of aircraft manufacturers, requiring disclosure of critical safety information and providing new whistleblower protections in the wake of two fatal Boeing 737 MAX crashes that killed 346 people and led to the plane's 19-month U.S. grounding.
Dickson is slated to testify before a Transportation Committee subcommittee at a hearing that comes nearly three years since Lion Air 610 crashed in Indonesia.
Dickson noted that the new law includes over 100 unique requirements for the FAA to implement. The work ""is 
still in the early stages, and we are carrying it out with the urgency that it requires,"" his testimony says.
An FAA survey released in August 2020 found some safety employees reported facing ""strong"" external pressure from industry and raised alarms the agency does not always prioritize air safety.
House Transportation Chairman Peter DeFazio said in prepare remarks released Wednesday the MAX crashes ""were the culmination of a series of failures"" at Boeing ""as well as dangerous inadequacies in the FAA’s process for certifying new airplanes. It is clear that Boeing needed thorough regulation and strict oversight, but its regulator could not provide enough of either.""
DeFazio added ""the FAA is making progress in implementing"" reforms mandated by Congress but urged Dickson ""to place

particular emphasis on this work, because Boeing’s next aircraft—the 777X—is already in flight tests.""
Boeing did not immediately comment.

Investing.com — Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares hit a new all-time high of $309.70 during the Wednesday session after its price target was raised at both Jefferies and Wedbush.
Microsoft's stock price rose after opening up the session at $308.35 before sliding around 0.3% to around the $307.26 mark.
Earlier in the day, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill increased the firm's price target on Microsoft shares to $375 from $345, keeping a buy rating. In a research note to investors, Thill said Microsoft has been a ""significant outperformer"" for the year-to-date. In addition, he believes the 18% year-over-year sales growth prediction for fiscal Q2 is ""attainable"" but cautions that comparisons become ""progressively tougher"" into fiscal 2022. 
Meanwhile, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives boosted Microsoft's price target to $375 from $350 and maintained an outperform rating on the stock ahead of the company's quarterly earnings report next week.
 Ives' look at Microsoft in the September quarter has indicated incremental strength once again, showing that the Azure cloud growth story is moving into the next phase in Redmond, Washington. The analyst declared that the company will release another ""Picasso-like masterpiece quarter with numbers"" that will comfortably beat Wall Street expectations.

Taylor Dart breaks down whether or not this is a good time to buy.It’s been a volatile 3-week stretch far for the precious metals sector, but after a tense battle at the $22.00/oz level, the bulls seem to finally have the upper hand in the silver (SLV) trade. This is since silver has recovered nearly all of its 7% loss in September, up nearly 8% month-to-date. The recovery is partially attributed to the fact that bullish sentiment readings continue to sit at their lowest levels in years. When we see extremes in sentiment, markets are very prone to violent moves in the other direction. The other potential boost to the silver price is the most recent inflation reading, with the annual inflation rate coming in at a 13-year high at 5.4%. In inflationary environments with negative real rates, precious metals typically perform well, and this is certainly the environment we’ve found ourselves in currently.
This strong fundamental backdrop combined with extreme pessimism can breed strong forward returns; hence a buy-the-dip strategy makes sense as we head into a stronger seasonal period for the metal. Let’s take a closer look below:

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stock indexes mostly rose worldwide on Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average touching a record intraday high, as more companies reported earnings that beat analysts' expectations, while oil prices jumped.
Boosting oil was data showing crude inventories at the largest U.S. storage site hit their lowest level in three years.
In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin touched a record high, a day after the first U.S. bitcoin futures-based exchange-traded fund began trading.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -United Airlines said on Wednesday its Boeing (NYSE:BA) 777-200 planes equipped with Pratt & Whitney (PW) engines are expected to return to service as early as in the first quarter of 2022.
The Chicago-based carrier had to ground the wide-body jets after a United flight to Honolulu suffered an engine failure and made an emergency landing in February in Denver.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ordered immediate inspections of Boeing 777 planes fitted with Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engines after the incident.
On Wednesday, the regulator said it is still evaluating the manufacturers' proposed fixes and will not approve them until it is satisfied that they address its safety concerns. 
""Any work performed on the airplanes prior to that time is subject to being affected by any new Airworthiness Directives,"" the FAA said in a statement.
Greg Hart, United's executive vice president, strategy and planning, said the company has not heard from the FAA, but it expects the aircraft to return to service in the first quarter of next year.
""We have been working tirelessly with Boeing, Pratt & Whitney and the FAA over the past six months,"" he said.
United is the only U.S. operator of 777s with the PW4000 engine and has 52 such planes.
The anticipated return of the planes is a key element of the company's strategy to ramp up international capacity by 10% next year.

FAA Administrator Steve Dickson said in May the agency was going to mandate strengthening a key engine part on Boeing 777-200 planes with the PW4000 engines.
Dickson told a U.S. House committee that the agency is ""requiring the manufacturers to address strengthen(ing) the cowling"" and will issue an airworthiness directive.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Questions about the murder of a Black teenager by a white police officer loomed over the confirmation hearing on Wednesday for former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, President Joe Biden's nominee to be the U.S. ambassador to Japan.
The hearing took place exactly seven years after police officer Jason Van Dyke fired his weapon multiple times at 17-year-old Laquan McDonald.
Then-Mayor Emanuel was questioned about his handling of the case, especially the fact that a video showing the shooting was not released for more than a year.
Emanuel made a statement about the killing at his hearing. ""I said then, 'I'm the mayor and I'm responsible and accountable for fixing this, so this never happens again.' To be honest, there's not a day or a week that has gone by in the last seven years I haven't thought about this,"" he told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley praised the ""depth and breadth"" of Emanuel's experience, but questioned him about what he knew about McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) death and when.
""It seems hard to believe all those things happened and yet you were never briefed on the details of the situation when you were leading the city,"" Merkley said.
Emanuel is a former member of the House of Representatives and was the first White House chief of staff when President Barack Obama was president and Biden was vice president.

Emanuel is expected to be confirmed. He is backed by most of Biden's fellow Democrats and some Republicans. Republican Senator Bill Hagerty, who was ambassador to Japan under ex-President Donald Trump, introduced Emanuel at his hearing and urged his confirmation.
Van Dyke was convicted of second-degree murder and jailed for nearly seven years and four Chicago police officers were fired over McDonald's death, which highlighted racial tensions in the United States' third-largest city.

PARIS (Reuters) -Carrefour, which earlier this month ended talks over a possible tie-up with unlisted rival Auchan, said it remained on the offensive as it kept a guidance for 2021 net free cash flow ""comfortably"" above 1 billion euros.
Europe's largest retailer also said revenue growth slowed in the third quarter, reflecting weaker sales in the core French market where a mandatory COVID-19 health pass hit business at its large out-of-town hypermarkets.
 Carrefour  (PA:CARR), which also faced high year-ago comparables in the quarter, is confident, however, about closing 2021 ""roughly in line with the current consensus"" for recurring operating income, finance chief Matthieu Malige told analysts, when asked if he was comfortable with a 2.26 billion euro figure.
""With its robust balance sheet, and thanks to the commitment of its teams, Carrefour is attractive and on the offensive, for the benefit of its customers and its shareholders,"" Chairman and CEO Alexandre Bompard said in a statement.
Earlier this month Carrefour and Auchan ended talks over a possible partnership, the second time this year Bompard's plans to create a Gallic supermarket powerhouse have been frustrated.
Carrefour is in the midst of a five-year plan it launched in January 2018 to cut costs and boost e-commerce investment to improve profits and sales, as it seeks to tackle competition from online rivals such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and discounters like Lidl and unlisted retailer Leclerc.
Carrefour reappointed Bompard in May to lead for another three years. Bompard has said he is working on a new strategic plan and is conducting an asset review as part of the process.
NO NEED FOR TRANSFORMATIONAL M&A
Malige told analysts no decision had yet been taken on potential disposals.
On the acquisition front, Carrefour strategy's had been constant: ""We are taking initiatives exclusively on potential bolt-on M&A and with a focus on our three core markets, France, Spain and Brazil. And we don't need any transformational M&A.""
""We are active in our various geographies to see if we have any further opportunities for bolt-on M&A,"" he added.
Carrefour said sales reached 20.468 billion euros ($23.83 billion) in the third quarter, a like-for-like rise of 0.8% but a slowdown from 3.6% growth in the second quarter.
In France, where Bompard has made reviving flagging sales at hypermarket stores a priority, sales eased 0.3% following a 4.% rise in the second-quarter. French hypermarket sales alone fell 2.8% in the quarter after rising 4.3% in the second quarter.

The introduction in France from mid-August to end-September of a health pass that customers had to show in shopping malls with a surface area of more than 20,000 square metres (215,278 sq ft) hit business in the third quarter at the hypermarket stores. At end-September, Carrefour had no more stores affected by the pass, Malige said.

DETROIT (Reuters) -A union-affiliated pension fund advisor said it is pressing Rivian on human rights and environment concerns in the electric vehicle startup's battery supply chain ahead of its expected blockbuster initial public offering.
SOC Investment Group, in a letter sent Wednesday to Rivian board member Rose Marcario, called on the Irvine, California-based company to ""commit to a rigorous human rights assessment of Rivian and its value chain"" before it finalizes the S-1 document with U.S. regulators for its IPO. SOC provided a copy of the letter to Reuters.
""Failure to address potential human rights abuses and environmental harms associated with the battery life cycle exposes Rivian to significant regulatory, litigation and reputational risks,"" SOC Executive Director Dieter Waizenegger said in the letter, calling on Rivian to respond by Nov. 3.
""It just was baffling to us when we were looking through the S-1 that they're completely silent on that,"" he added in an interview with Reuters, citing the company's marketing to consumers who enjoy an outdoor lifestyle. ""The (battery) supply chain and production is rife with human rights risks."" 
As issues of environmental, social and corporate governance take on growing important with investors, automakers have come under pressure to prove that such minerals as lithium and cobalt for their electric vehicles batteries are sourced without human rights abuses.
In the past, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk has expressed his desire to eliminate the use of cobalt from the EV leader's batteries because of the financial and reputation risk of a metal associated with child labor and poor safety conditions at artisanal mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the world's dominant producer. 
SOC called on Rivian to adopt policies to identify and prevent human rights risks and environmental impacts through its supply chain based on United Nations guiding principles for businesses. 
It also wants Rivian to publicly support a moratorium on deep-seabed mining, adopt a policy not to buy minerals from the deep seabed, designate a board committee with responsibility for oversight of these issues and report annually to investors on the company's efforts.
Rivian said the health and wellbeing of people and the planet informed how it operates.
""Working with materials suppliers and supply chain partners on ethical sourcing practices is a critical piece of that,"" the company said in a statement. ""As we've laid out in our IPO filing documents, we're committed to responsible environmental, social, and governance practices and that includes thorough reporting and disclosure.”
Rivian is nearing an IPO in the coming weeks that could attract a valuation of about $80 billion and raise between $5 billion and $8 billion for the company. Its pre-IPO investors include Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), T. Rowe Price and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK). 
SOC, formerly known as CtW Investment Group, is an advisor for union pension funds that have more than $250 billion in assets. It has taken a more activist approach with such companies as Doordash, Uber (NYSE:UBER) and  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT), around such issues as board diversity, executive pay and company stock structure. 
This is the first time SOC has approached an automaker about the battery supply chain, and Waizenegger said it will raise the issue with other automakers, as well as investors. 
Waizenegger cited BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, as having required companies it invests in to prevent human rights abuses. He said SOC had not yet reached out to BlackRock about its letter to Rivian. 
He also said such automakers as Ford and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) have made commitments to protect human rights and the environment. In addition, AB Volvo and BMW have backed a call for a moratorium on deep-sea mining.
Amnesty International, which has reported in the past on human rights abuses in cobalt mines in Africa, have seen SOC's letter to Rivian, and welcomed the push. It was one of the authors of a report demanding companies in the battery supply chain protect humans rights and the environment.

Richard Kent, the organization's researcher on human rights and energy transition, said all automakers are falling short of implementing the United Nations guiding principles on business and human rights. 
""Investors are playing an increasingly active role in due diligence around the world, particularly in companies driving the energy transition,"" he said.

1519,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2021 02:36PM ET</span>","Rodolphe Belmer named Atos CEO, ending Girard's troubled reign","By Mathieu Rosemain and Gwénaëlle Barzic
(Reuters) -Rodolphe Belmer will replace Elie Girard as chief executive of Atos by early next year, the French IT consulting firm said on Wednesday, in a sudden announcement that wrapped Girard's short stint as CEO. 
Belmer, 52, is the current boss of French satellite firm Eutelsat, which he joined in 2015. A graduate of France's elite HEC business school, he previously led pay-TV station Canal+, owned by media group Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY).
Speculation about the future of Girard, 43, has mounted in recent months, following a string of setbacks that sent Atos' share price down by more than 40% this year. 
The most painful stemmed from accounting errors spotted by auditors for two of Atos' units in North America. The disclosure in April spooked investors and triggered a 20% fall in the firm's shares in a single day. 
The audit firm eventually cleared the accounts, but several analysts said the news had further dented investors' trust in Girard's management and strategy after a failed attempt to buy DXC Technology, a deal that valued the New-York listed group at more than $10 billion in what would have been the biggest-ever acquisition for deal-hungry Atos.
The group also cut its 2021 targets in July, blaming the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
The company's fall from investors' grace saw Atos exit France's blue-chip CAC 40 index last month and speculation about a takeover or the arrival of activist investors. 
However, the group - whose top investor is German engineering and technology company Siemens and counts President Emmanuel Macron's first prime minister Edouard Philippe as a board member - is deemed strategic by the French government as it supplies secure information systems to the country's army, which could complicate any takeover.
It also owns supercomputers used to develop next-generation technologies based on artificial intelligence and deep learning.
Girard, who will leave the company on Friday, succeeded Thierry Breton, today's European industry chief, in 2019, after acting as a close aide to the former French finance minister as CFO. 
A former top executive at telecoms group Orange, Girard inherited a company that had rapidly expanded through a buyout spree, which included cloud and cybersecurity firm Bull. 

Atos, which plans to gradually dispose of non-core assets and seek partners for classic infrastructure activities, said Belmer's term of office would begin on Jan. 20, 2022, at the latest. 
Effective Monday, Oct. 25, Pierre Barnabe and Adrian Gregory would be appointed acting co-chief executive officers until Belmer starts, the company said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said on Wednesday that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk should directly raise with him any issues about the hiring of a senior safety adviser who has been critical of the automaker.
""He's welcome to call me if he's concerned,"" Buttigieg told reporters at an event on Wednesday. ""We are responsible for making sure that every vehicle on the road is safe.""
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on Tuesday confirmed a Reuters report that Duke University engineering and computer science professor Missy Cummings is being named a new senior adviser for safety at NHTSA, saying in a statement it looks forward ""to leveraging her experience and leadership in safety and autonomous technologies.""
On Tuesday, Musk wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR): ""Objectively, her track record is extremely biased against Tesla.""
She responded to Musk on Twitter saying: ""Happy to sit down and talk with you anytime.""
NHTSA in August opened a formal safety probe into Tesla's Autopilot system in 765,000 U.S. vehicles after a series of crashes involving Tesla models and emergency vehicles.
Cummings has repeatedly expressed concerns about Tesla's Autopilot feature. In 2019, she wrote on Twitter: ""I have driven several Teslas - autopilot easily causes mode confusion, is unreliable and unsafe @NHTSArecalls should require 
@tesla to turn it off.""
NHTSA said Cummings was being named for a ""temporary assignment"" under the Intergovernmental Personnel Act Mobility Program.

Last week, NHTSA asked Tesla why it has not issued a recall to address software updates made to Autopilot system to improve the vehicles' ability to detect emergency vehicles.
To date, NHTSA has identified 12 crashes that involved Tesla vehicles using the advanced driver-assistance systems and emergency vehicles. NHTSA said most of the incidents took place after dark.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -China has raised $4 billion through a U.S. dollar sovereign bond issue, a term sheet showed, with the offer attracting robust demand from offshore investors despite an ongoing regulatory crackdown across industries and problems in the property market.
Investor bids for the four tranche deal reached $23.2 billion, nearly six times the amount raised, official statistics published by advisers showed on Wednesday.
The sale comes at a tricky time for China: its economy is slowing, while investors are worried about a regulatory crackdown and potential contagion from China Evergrande Group's debt problems.
The strong appetite came after finance ministry officials told investors on a call on Monday they were confident cash-strapped developer Evergrande posed no systemic risk, three people with knowledge of the matter said. The sources could not be named as the information had not been made public.
The Finance Ministry did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for a comment.
A People's Bank of China official also said on Friday that the spillover effect of Evergrande's debt problems is controllable and individual financial institutions' risk exposures are not big https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-cbank-official-says-spillover-effect-evergrandes-debt-woes-is-controllable-2021-10-15.
Evergrande shares remain in a trading halt on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange after it missed a number of offshore bond interest repayments in the past few weeks. It is grappling with more than $305 billion worth of liabilities. 
The pricing for China's dollar-denominated sovereign bond was set at 6 basis points (bps) above U.S. Treasuries for the three-year tranche, 12 bps over for the five-year, 23 bps higher for the 10-year and 53 bps above for the 30-year tranche.
Final pricing for the deal was significantly lower than first flagged.
Initial pricing guidance was given to investors at 35 bps over Treasuries for the three-year tranche, 45 bps on the five-year tranche, 55 bps on the 10-year tranche and 85 bps on the 30-year tranche.
The spreads on each of the tranches were the lowest ever for a sovereign bond issue from China, the three sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
The three- and 10-year tranches each raised $1 billion, the 5-year raised $1.5 billion and the 30-year $500 million, the term sheet showed.
Asian banks were strong buyers of the shorter dated bonds because of their capital requirements, while U.S. investors were more active in purchasing the longer dated tranches, statistics on the deal showed. 
The bond offering comes as the world's second-largest economy posted its slowest pace of growth https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-q3-gdp-growth-hits-1-year-low-raising-heat-policymakers-2021-10-17 in a year in the third quarter, hurt by power shortages, sporadic COVD-19 outbreaks and a weakening property sector.
Investors questioned the economic implications of the power cuts but were assured China's fundamentals remained strong, the sources with direct knowledge said.

The finance ministry also flagged that China would likely carry out a euro denominated bond before the end of the year, copying the pattern of issuance it initiated in 2020, the sources said.
The ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Investing.com – Bank of America stock (NYSE:BAC) traded 1.5% higher Wednesday as the lender renewed its $25 billion share repurchase program it had first announced in April.
During April to September, the bank spent a little over $14 billion on buying back its own shares. The fresh approval by the bank’s board replaces the previous program.
The repurchases may be made through open market transactions or privately negotiated deals, the bank said.
The timing and amount of repurchases are subject to the company's capital position, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price, regulatory requirements and general market conditions. Also, it may be suspended at any time.
Bank of America's ability to make capital distributions depends, in part, on its ability to maintain regulatory capital levels above the 9.5% CET1 or core capital requirement. As of September 30, the bank’s CET1 ratio was 11.1%.
A buyback helps to increase earnings per share as the company's stock count goes down. It thus boosts shareholder returns. A share buyback usually happens when the company has no better use for the cash on its books or when investors press the company to return their money."

(Reuters) - U.S. online holiday spending is expected to grow at its slowest pace in at least eight years, as product shortages, higher prices and lingering pandemic-related uncertainties threaten to put a strain on the shopping season.
Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Analytics forecast an average 10% growth or $207 billion in online sales in November and December, compared with a record 33% jump in 2020 when people chose to shop from home, instead of traveling to stores during the pandemic.
After grappling with virus restrictions on stores for the better part of last year, retailers are now dealing with a slew of pandemic consequences including a clogging of global supply chains that could lead to a shortage of everything from  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) shoes to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhones during the holiday quarter.
The lack of clarity around what items could run out of stock, and when, is making it hard to determine whether product shortages could push consumers to shop more online or in-store, Adobe Digital Insights lead analyst Vivek Pandya said on Wednesday.
The expected shortages and the risk of a resurgence in COVID-19 cases are also part of the reason for Adobe's broader spending forecast range, between a 5% and 15% gain, Pandya added.
The 2021 growth, expected to be partly driven by product price hikes, would be the smallest rise since Adobe started tracking holiday spending data in 2014.
With companies raising product prices due to skyrocketing commodity and transportation expenses, consumers are expected to pay 9% more between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday this year, Adobe said. 

It said out-of-stock messages on retailers' websites were up 172% at the end of July from pre-pandemic levels, with apparel stocks depleting the fastest, followed by sporting goods, baby products and electronics.
To cope with the potential inventory shortfalls, retailers are offering fewer discounts and looking to spread out the selling season by encouraging shoppers to start their holiday shopping early this year.

PARIS (Reuters) - French carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) expects to produce at least 300,000 fewer vehicles this year due to the global shortage of semiconductor chips, three sources close to the firm told Reuters on Wednesday, a much bigger hit than previously estimated.
The shortage of chips, used in everything from brake sensors to power steering to entertainment systems, has led automakers around the world to curtail or even suspend production, pushing up the prices of vehicles.
The supply problems would cost Renault, which is set to publish its third-quarter sales on Friday, over a third more than the 220,000 lost vehicles it forecast in early September.
A Renault spokesperson declined to comment.
The company's Paris-listed shares were down around 4% by 1347 GMT, while shares in European rivals Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), BMW and Stellantis, all of which have also been forced to cut production, were down between 1% and 4%.
""The forecasts change all the time, but the shortfall will be between 300,000 and 400,00 vehicles,"" said one of the sources. That would represent at least 8% of the 3.75 million vehicles Renault sold in pre-pandemic 2019. 
The other two sources said the figure could be between 350,000 and 380,000 vehicles.
Stifel analyst Pierre-Yves Quemener said it would be an ""achievement"" if the shortfall could be limited to 350,000 vehicles.
""This would imply that they would improve the situation significantly in the fourth quarter, which seems to me very, very ambitious,"" he said. 
London-based information provider IHS Markit told Reuters chip shortages could cost the automotive industry around 11 million vehicles in lost production this year.
BAD TIMING
The chip crunch has come at the worst possible time, automotive lobby group PFA said on Tuesday, as carmakers recover from coronavirus disruptions and shift towards producing all-electric vehicles.
It said that chip supply constraints could stretch well into 2022. 
Electronics firms in Malaysia, central to global chip supplies, said customers that sell chips to auto and electronics manufacturers want to lock in longer-term deals and are happy to pay more if need be https://www.reuters.com/technology/theyll-have-pay-malaysia-chip-crunch-triggers-new-era-supply-deals-2021-10-20.

Renault has said that electric vehicles would account for up to 90% of its Renault brand sales by 2030.
All cars manufactured in the European Union this year must comply with EU regulations that cap average CO2 emissions from new cars at 95g CO2/km, or face heavy fines.

Radius shares rose 21% on Wednesday. 
The study was designed to assess the treatment, elacestrant, as a monotherapy versus the standard of care for the disease. 
There were two primary endpoints for the study, which were both met— progression-free survival in the overall population and progression-free survival in patients with tumors harboring estrogen receptor 1 mutations.

1538,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2021 12:14PM ET</span>",Britain secures COVID-19 antivirals from Merck and Pfizer,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain said on Wednesday it had secured deals for two COVID-19 antivirals, one developed by Merck and the other by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), which it said could be used to treat patients by the end of the year if regulatory approval is granted.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has removed almost all COVID-19 restrictions and is relying on COVID-19 vaccines and treatments to try and withstand winter pressures on hospitals given high case numbers of more than 40,000 new infections a day.
""We may soon have a new defence in our arsenal with two new antiviral drugs that we have secured,"" health minister Sajid Javid said in a statement.
Britain said it had secured 480,000 courses of Merck's molnupiravir, an antiviral pill which can be used in non-hospitalised patients. 
The drug cut the rate of hospitalization and death by 50% in mild-to-moderately ill patients who had at least one risk factor for the disease, according to trial data released earlier this month.
If approved, molnupiravir, which Merck is developing with partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, could become the first oral antiviral medication for COVID-19.
Pfizer is also racing to develop an easy-to-administer antiviral pill for COVID-19, and last month began a large study of its investigational oral antiviral drug for the prevention of COVID-19 in people exposed to the virus.
In the trial, PF-07321332, designed to block the activity of a key enzyme needed for the coronavirus to multiply, will be administered along with a low dose of ritonavir, an older medication widely used in combination treatments for HIV infection.
Britain said it had secured 250,000 courses of the PF-07321332/ritonavir antiviral.

No price was disclosed for either order. Both Merck's and Pfizer's antivirals would need approval by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) before being used, the government said.
A national study will also be set up to gather more data on the effectiveness of the antivirals, it added.

(Reuters) -Nasdaq Inc on Wednesday reported third-quarter profits above Wall Street estimates, helped by strong demand for its technology and investment-related products, along with a jump in initial public offerings on its exchanges.
Nasdaq reported adjusted profit of $1.78 per share for the quarter, 6 cents above analysts' consensus estimate, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
While the trans-Atlantic exchange operator is best known for its bourses, Nasdaq has made a big push into the anti-financial crimes software sector, having completed its $2.75 billion acquisition of Verafin in February. 
Nasdaq counts around 2,000 U.S. and Canadian banks as clients and sees demand in the anti-financial crimes space growing along with new technologies like cryptocurrencies, Chief Executive Officer Adena Friedman said on a call with analysts.
""As crypto becomes more integrated into the financial system, we want to make sure that we can provide solutions that meet the needs across all of our customers,"" she said. 
Revenue from the company's solutions segment jumped 19% to $541 million, helped by the Verafin deal and strong demand for products tied to Nasdaq's financial indexes.
Nasdaq also offers a cloud-based market services platform where it provides the technology and infrastructure for marketplaces. Eight crypto exchanges are now using Nasdaq trading technology and nine are using its surveillance technology, Friedman said. 
New York-based Nasdaq won 147 IPOs in the quarter, including 80 operating companies, like  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) and Freshworks Inc, while the rest were special purpose acquisition firms, representing $29 billion of capital raised. 
Market services revenue rose 15% to $295 million.
Net revenues were up 17% to $838 million.

Nasdaq shares opened at a record high, but then pulled back, and were last down 4.29% at $199.88. 
Friedman said she expected compensation expenses to rise into 2022 due to heightened competition for talent.

(Reuters) -European shares closed at six-week highs on Wednesday as strong results from Nestle boosted food company stocks, helping outweigh losses after a clutch of disappointing earnings including luxury group  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and chipmaker ASML.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index ended 0.3% higher, with oil stocks also aiding gains as crude prices recovered slightly. [MKTS/GLOB]
Swiss food giant Nestle gained 2.7% on an upbeat sales outlook after strong coffee sales and price hikes pushed organic sales 6.5% higher in the third quarter.
Europe's food and beverage index rose 1.7%, with Anglo-Dutch rival Unilever (NYSE:UL), which is due to give a trading update on Thursday, up 0.8%. The sector had dipped last session after downbeat results from Danone.
As the third-quarter earnings season unfolds, investors are fretting about the impact of higher costs, stemming from supply-chain problems and labour shortfalls, especially when central banks across the globe are planning to withdraw their stimulus measures.
""The bar (for earnings) that was set early this year is too high. It's going to be hard to beat that,"" said Anna Stupnytska, global macro economist at Fidelity International. 
Kering tumbled 0.6% as sales growth at its star fashion brand Gucci missed analysts' expectations due to a sharp slowdown in its pace of recovery, particularly in Asia.
TS Lombard said it downgraded German and French equities as the heavy presence of automotive and luxury companies leaves them vulnerable to a slowdown in China, but still holds out hope for the broader region. 
""Growth headwinds are mounting, but we believe that the recovery in the euro area has further to run,"" it said.
ASML Holdings, a key supplier to computer chip makers, fell almost 4% after its fourth-quarter sales forecast fell short of some analysts' estimates.
Drugmaker Roche beat revenue expectations and raised its 2021 sales forecast amid pandemic-driven demand. But its shares were down 1.6%. 
Dutch paints and coatings maker Akzo Nobel (OTC:AKZOY) slipped 1.3% as its quarterly earnings were hit by continued raw material inflation and supply chain disruptions, which it expects to continue through mid-2022.

Europe Inc earnings are expected to have risen 47.6% to 96.1 billion euros ($112 billion) in the third quarter, latest data from Refinitiv I/B/E/S showed, only a slight improvement from last week's 46.7% growth forecast. 
Miner Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) slipped 3.3% as investors worried about spending after it announced a $7.5 billion plan to reduce carbon emissions.

1541,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 20, 2021 12:08PM ET</span>","Baker Hughes Slumps as Ida, Costlier Inputs Hurt Operations","By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com –  Baker Hughes  stock (NYSE:BKR) plunged more than 6% Wednesday as Hurricane Ida, supply chain issues and pricier raw materials in the chemicals business held the company’s third-quarter sales and profits below estimates.
Record-high prices of crude were supposed to help oil services firms like Baker, but Hurricane Ida played havoc with their operations. The hurricane shut operations of several oil and has majors in the U.S. Gulf Coast and Gulf of Mexico in August and September. Some of the operations remain affected.
Along with supply chain problems, it cost Baker Hughes $30 million to $40 million during the quarter.
Rival Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) Tuesday reported a 30% jump in third-quarter revenue to $3.86 billion. This was below estimates too. Adjusted profit per share of 28 cents was higher than the 27 cents estimated by analysts.
Both manufacturing and services firms suffered during the quarter as the pandemic kept factories in China, Vietnam and other hubs shut while strong demand kept ships busy and ports clogged.
The company booked orders worth $5.4 billion during the quarter, up 5% from last year at a time when activity rose.
This was a result of higher order intake in oilfield equipment, oilfield services, and digital solutions, partially offset by a decline in turbomachinery and process solutions. Year-over-year equipment orders were down 7% and service orders were up 18%.
The U.S. industry-wide rig count jumped by 51 units over three months to 521 at the end of the third quarter, according to data the company revealed earlier.
""As we look ahead to the rest of 2021 and into 2022, we see continued signs of global economic recovery that should drive further demand growth for oil and natural gas,"" Chief Executive Officer Lorenzo Simonelli said.
Revenue in the third quarter rose 1% to $5.09 billion. Oilfield services, turbomachinery and process solutions, and digital solutions segments grew in volumes, partially offset by oilfield equipment. Adjusted profit per share came in at 16 cents."

(Reuters) - U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said on Wednesday he expects disruptions in the trucking industry to last as long as the COVID-19 pandemic persists.
""There are going to be disruptions and shocks to the system as long as the pandemic continues,"" he said in an interview with CNN when asked about the driver shortages in the trucking industry.
He had said on Sunday that supply chain issues could last into 2022 as many companies struggle with disruptions.
Rating agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO) said on Wednesday that the pressure on U.S. supply chains will take time to subside. Increased transportation costs and shortages of commodities and consumer goods will put upward pressure on consumer prices, Moody's said.
The rebound in economic activity across some parts of the world as coronavirus restrictions are eased has exposed shortages across supply chains, with companies scrambling to find workers, ships, and even fuel to power factories, threatening the recovery from the pandemic.
Last week, U.S. President Joe Biden urged the private sector to help ease supply chain blockages that are threatening to disrupt the U.S. holiday season. 

""The private sector was not expecting the speed of the economic recovery that we have been experiencing,"" Buttigieg told CNN.
""You add on to that the fact that we have some issues with our infrastructure as we (the Biden administration) have been saying everyday since we got here,"" he added.

1543,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2021 12:01PM ET</span>",Analysis-Eat or be eaten? Food delivery apps have knives out as pandemic boom fades,"By Toby Sterling
AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The meal delivery market is expected to turn to a phase of consolidation in the coming months as players look to adjust operations after the explosive boom in demand served up to them during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The industry, which includes the likes of Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats, Just Eat Takeaway and Deliveroo, generally saw share prices spike during 2020 as lockdowns and other restrictions kept people eating at home.
Investor sentiment has turned in 2021 in anticipation of a return to normal, but experts say consumers' ordering habits have likely changed permanently.
""Food delivery app usage has not slowed down, even as consumers return to in-person dining more frequently,"" said Alisha Kapur of Similarweb (NYSE:SMWB), which analyses web traffic and app downloads.
Yet most of the companies are losing money and the increasing need for scale means the market is ripe for consolidation, according to industry experts.
Kapur said it was ""very rare"" for significant numbers of consumers to change the meal delivery apps they're accustomed to using, with ""a few exceptions that demonstrate the largest players are only grabbing more share"".
Stock prices across the sector have stabilised after the pandemic-driven spike and many players have actually seen them fall this year, also hit by developments such as a 15% cap on commission fees they can charge restaurants in New York City, imposed in August. 
While Amazon-backed Deliveroo raised its full-year guidance on Wednesday, its shares are still trading well below its 390 pence March IPO price. 
DIGESTING GRUBHUB
Just Eat Takeaway has fared the worst, though. 
Its $7.3 billion acquisition of American rival GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) in June looked smart against the new industry landscape, but it has left the Dutch-based company heavily exposed to the New York cap, which it says will cost it around 100 million euros ($116 million) in the second half of this year.
Takeaway shares have sunk more than 20% this year prompting a major long-term shareholder, Cat Rock, to call on management to sell assets and explore strategic combinations. 
As a result, the company is at the centre of industry deal talk.
Potential targets for acquisition, according to analysts, include Takeaway's 33% stake in iFood of Brazil, valued at more than $3 billion, parts of its U.S. business, which requires significant investment, and its French business, which trails Uber and Deliveroo in that market. 
Takeaway reported weaker than expected third-quarter orders last week, but CEO Jitse Groen said it was seeing business improve in several countries as workers returned to offices and the weather worsened heading into winter.
Groen and other senior executives are due to meet worried investors on Thursday to outline strategy.
""Investors are looking for a clear plan to improve in the U.S., a clear plan to defend market shares in Europe, and especially in Germany, said Clément Genelot, an analyst at Bryan Garnier & Co, who launched coverage of Takeaway with a well-timed ""Sell"" recommendation in May. 
""And also a clear vision and a clear plan to quickly roll out grocery delivery."" 
Takeaway said it was confident it would address key investor concerns, including an update on ""portfolio management"" and investment priorities, at the capital markets day.
'LEANING INTO GROCERY'
Grocery delivery is proving another hot area for deals and partnerships in the industry.
Deliveroo has been most aggressive in working with grocery chains, with the support of 12% shareholder Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Uber told Reuters its meal delivery business was also ""very much leaning into grocery"", pointing to a deal with Britain's Sainsbury's and France's  Carrefour  (PA:CARR). 
Others are looking to take advantage on a blizzard of launches of ""on demand"" grocery delivery startups, especially in Europe.
DoorDash has invested in Germany's Flink. Delivery Hero, one of Takeaway's oldest competitors, said on Tuesday it has taken an 8% stake in another German startup, Gorillas. 
Delivery Hero, a prolific investor, owns 7.4% of Takeaway and a 5.03% stake in Deliveroo. It also owns 37% of Glovo, and the pair sold each other operations in the Balkans and in Latin America during the pandemic.

Technology investor Prosus (OTC:PROSF) in turn owns 27.42% of Delivery Hero and a majority stake in Brazil's iFood, setting the Prosus-Delivery Hero pair up as possible deal brokers.

President Biden and his fellow Democrats are pushing to close a deal by October 31. If the bill is passed, it should be a significant boost to the infrastructure sector. Given this backdrop, we think quality infrastructure stocks Dover (DOV), Regal Rexnord (NYSE:ZWS) (RRX), and Crane Co. (CR) could be rewarding bets now. Read on.The U.S. infrastructure sector is looking at a potential trillion-dollar federal spending initiative, which will be targeted at upgrading the country’s existing infrastructure base. The “once-in-a-generation” investment proposal should be a significant boost to the overall economy. The planned vote to pass the infrastructure package has been delayed due to intraparty disagreements and a lack of support from some Democrats.
However, President Biden and his Democratic caucus intend to wrap up negotiations and pass the bipartisan infrastructure bill and a larger “Build Back Better” package (an ambitious plan to fund meaningful climate action and achieve a carbon-zero electric grid by 2035, create jobs, cut taxes, and lower costs for working families) by the end of the month. When passed, the bill should stimulate growth in the U.S. infrastructure sector.
The potential infrastructure spending opens an attractive opportunity to invest in quality infrastructure stocks, which could generate substantial returns over an extended term, bolstered by the massive government spending. Given this backdrop, we think Dover Corporation (NYSE:DOV), Regal Rexnord Corporation (RRX), and Crane Co. (CR) could be attractive additions to one’s portfolio, based on their immense growth potential.

(Reuters) -Anthem Inc on Wednesday raised its full-year profit outlook for the third time this year and forecast less of a drag on earnings from COVID-19 next year as infections drop, sending the U.S. health insurer's shares to a record high. 
The comments from Anthem echoed larger rival UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE:UNH) and allayed some concerns the recent surge in U.S. COVID-19 cases linked to the Delta variant would boost health insurance companies' medical costs.
Such costs have been in flux since the coronavirus outbreak, with less spending due to delays in elective procedures being offset by a jump in direct COVID-19 treatment and testing costs.
Anthem, like UnitedHealth, raised its 2021 profit forecast after beating third-quarter profit estimates on the back of lower-than-expected medical costs. 
UnitedHealth also said last week it expected the pandemic to have a smaller impact on its profit next year as infections decline and more people get vaccinated. 
Anthem, however, said higher testing and vaccinations will probably keep medical costs above usual levels throughout the fourth quarter. 
""The Delta variant is still out there, and we want to be very respectful for it as well as any other new variants that may or may not exist,"" Chief Financial Officer John Gallina said.
The comments come as the United States is on the verge of authorizing booster vaccine shots from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).
The number two U.S. health insurer said it now expected this year's adjusted profit to exceed $25.85 per share, up from an earlier forecast of more than $25.50.

Stephens analyst Scott Fidel said Anthem and UnitedHealth's expectations were ""reasonable given where we are right now with vaccinations entering into 2022.""
Anthem shares were up nearly 7% at $422.72 in late morning trade.

Investing.com — PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL)is exploring a potential acquisition of  Pinterest Inc  (NYSE:PINS), according to a report by Bloomberg, citing people with knowledge of the matter.
Pinterest shares jumped 12% after the report. PayPal shares fell 3%.
California-based payments giant PayPal recently approached social media firm Pinterest about a possible deal, with the companies discussing a possible price of around $70 per share. That would value Pinterest at $39 billion.
A deal at that price would be a premium on Pinterest's closing price of $55.58 on Tuesday. 
Bloomberg said its sources did state that transaction terms could alter, and there is no guarantee of a deal. 
Following reports of a potential deal, Andrew Jeffrey, an analyst at Truist, believes a potential deal would make ""zero sense"" and underlines his concerns about PayPal's organic revenue growth durability. The analyst currently has a $275 price target and Hold rating on PayPal shares.
On the flip side, Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said that a possible combination between the companies could make strategic sense and accelerate their 'super app' ambitions. Sebastian has a $325 price target and Outperform rating on PayPal stock.

Major bottlenecks have formed across the globe in recent months due to a surge in demand for retail goods from people stuck at home under pandemic-related lockdowns and logjams impacting the supply of container ships and boxes to transport cargo.
The situation has been particularly severe in major retail markets such as the United States, where dozens of vessels remain stuck off the West Coast ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, unable to discharge. 
""I see this as a very prolonged crisis at least on the port and land side, particularly in places like the U.S. It's going to be tough,"" said Christian Gonzalez, head of corporate with Philippines-headquartered International Container Terminal Services (ICTSI).
""From a transpacific point of view, it’s going to be quite messy for some time, and it is not something that can be solved by adding more ships into the system. That is going to create a bigger backlog."" 
Gonzalez said ports everywhere were feeling the strain of such huge demand to process cargo. He added that traditional peak season flows ahead of Christmas had also been impacted.
The buoyant cargo activity was also impacting other regions including Iraq, Gonzalez said, where ICTSI operates the Basra Gateway Terminal in the south of the country.
International shipping lines were deploying containers on bigger volume routes which have seen record high freight rates in recent months, he said.
""There is quite a bit of disruption in Iraq, mostly because of container shortages and people just not wanting to send containers on those routes,"" he said. 
Gonzalez said he was ""bullish"" about prospects for 2022 for the company's portfolio, with cargo volumes expected to remain firm.

ICTSI, which has container ports in a number of regions including Asia, the Middle East and South America and is among the world's top 10 container terminal operators, handled consolidated volume of 5.45 million TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units) in the first half of 2021. 
That was 14% higher than the 4.79 million TEUs handled in the same period of 2020.

(Reuters) -  Abbott Laboratories  (NYSE:ABT) said demand for its COVID-19 tests, especially rapid testing, rebounded as the U.S. wrestled with surging coronavirus cases during the quarter, prompting the company to raise its earnings forecast for the year.
The medical device maker's shares rose 3.5% to $123.53 on Wednesday after it also reported third-quarter earnings above analysts' estimates.
The company said it shipped more than 225 million COVID-19 tests globally in the quarter and expects testing to remain an important part of the fight against the virus going into the fourth quarter and 2022.
""Over the last several months, we've learned that COVID-19 vaccines, while a powerful tool, are not the lone solution needed in our global fight against this virus,"" Chief Executive Officer Robert Ford said.
""Testing, particularly rapid testing, which is fast, affordable and easy to use is an important companion to vaccines and therapeutics.""
Abbott and other diagnostics companies have seen higher demand for COVID-19 tests in recent months due to the Delta variant of the virus.
The U.S. government has also announced policies aimed at pushing large employers to have their workers inoculated or tested weekly and invested around $3 billion to procure rapid COVID-19 tests from Abbott and other manufacturers.
The company expects coronavirus test-related sales to be between $1.0 billion and $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter.
In the short term, through the traditional flu season testing volumes will likely remain robust, but this revenue boost could be transitory, Atlantic Equities analyst James Mainwaring said.

Abbott raised its outlook for 2021 adjusted earnings from continuing operations to between $5.00 and $5.10 per share, compared with its previous forecast of $4.30 to $4.50 per share.
On an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.40 per share, beating estimates of 95 cents per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

Lynk & Co, which sells and rents cars to customers on monthly subscriptions, will also begin its Asian market expansion ""in due course"", it said in a statement. 
It will mainly sell its cars through dealers in the Middle East and Asia, like China, rather than use the subscription model it has established in Europe, said Lin Jie, a Geely Auto senior vice president who also oversees Lynk & Co's sales. 
He did not specify which countries it planned to enter but said the company would focus on places with a left-hand drive system, like China. 
The five-year-old brand, which currently offers just one China-made SUV compact car in hybrid and plug-in hybrid form, saw 29% sales growth in the first half of 2021 to 17,077 units, Geely reported in July.

Last week, its CEO Alain Visser told a car conference in Germany that the company could be profitable within one or two years in Europe.
Lin said the brand had also started to trial a subscription-like service in the eastern Chinese cities of Hangzhou and Ningbo.

Activist investor Engine No. 1 in May shocked the oil-and-gas industry when three of its four nominees were elected to the board by Exxon shareholders, who were frustrated by weak returns and the company's flagging attention to climate concerns. 
The appointment of activist Jeff Ubben in March put a third of the 12-member board in new hands. 
The board members expressed concerns about some projects, including a $30 billion liquefied natural gas development in Mozambique and another multibillion-dollar gas project in Vietnam, the WSJ report said, citing people familiar with the matter.
Exxon did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
The Mozambique and Vietnam projects have been stalled for long periods over local fights as well as sour gas and high costs. No final investment decisions have been taken on these projects.
The talks on projects are taking place as part of a review of Exxon's five-year spending plan, on which the board is set to vote at the end of this month, WSJ reported.
Exxon is also analyzing the expected carbon emissions from each project and how they would affect its ability to meet pledges to reduce emissions, the report said. 
The annual projected emissions from the Mozambique and Vietnam projects were among the highest in Exxon's planned pipeline of oil and gas projects, according to a pre-pandemic internal analysis by Exxon, which was reviewed by WSJ. 

Exxon is also planning to declare in coming weeks that it will raise its investment in a low-carbon unit it announced in February by billions of dollars, the Journal added. 
Exxon had in February said it would invest $3 billion through 2025 in a new division that would commercialize its carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, biofuels and other technologies.

Investing.com —   Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) shares tumbled 9.9% Wednesday following a report from Politico that the drug maker has run into delays regarding the production of its Covid-19 vaccine. 
The report said that Novavax has faced problems concerning the testing of the purity of its vaccine candidate and that it has so far failed to prove the shot is ""consistently up to snuff.""
According to the Politico report, which cites people familiar with the  matter, the practices used to test the vaccine's efficacy have dropped below U.S. regulators’ standards.
However, Novavax has since come out and expressed confidence in its vaccine candidate and manufacturing. ""In response to a recent news article citing anonymous sources, Novavax confirms our confidence in our ability to deliver our high-quality vaccine. Further, we underscore our ongoing commitment to the stringent standards of production and manufacturing for our recombinant nanoparticle protein-based COVID-19 vaccine candidate with Matrix-M adjuvant,"" the company said.
The company continued by saying that it has ""made significant progress in mobilizing a global manufacturing network over the past 18 months with sites that are now routinely producing high-quality product at commercial scale at multiple sites across the world. Our global supply chain is expected to achieve a capacity of 150 million doses per month by the end of the fourth quarter.""
In addition, Novavax said it sees regulatory submissions within the next couple of weeks in some of its key markets, including the United Kingdom, Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. 
It has already, along with its partner SII, filed for authorization in India, Indonesia, The Philippines, and Emergency Use Listing with the World Health Organization. They also expect to file for Emergency Use Authorization in the U.S. before the end of this year."

(Reuters) -Biogen Inc is pinning its hopes on a decision on U.S. government coverage of its Alzheimer's disease drug next year to help drive up its usage, after a big miss on quarterly sales of the much-awaited treatment.
The company recorded $300,000 in sales of Aduhelm in the third quarter, compared with the $10.79 million mean estimate from 16 analysts, according to Refinitiv data. 
Only 120 sites across the United States are offering the drug, Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) said, versus its expectations of 900 immediately after the launch. The company expects minimal sales from the treatment this year, while raising its forecasts on demand for its multiple sclerosis drugs.
Biogen is betting on Aduhelm, the first new treatment for the memory-robbing disease in nearly 20 years, to buffer a hit from its main revenue drivers facing rising competition.
However, the uptake has been slower than expected as several commercial insurers wait for further direction from Medicare before covering the drug, which is priced at $56,000 a year.
""We can't actually speculate on the outcome of the (review). But as you know, we do believe it will be a major milestone, and this will alleviate a lot of the confusion that we're seeing with physicians,"" Biogen U.S. President Alisha Alaimo told analysts on a post-earnings call.
Still, Wall Street's consensus expectations for 2022 sales of the drug are too high and should move lower, said Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Michael Yee. Aduhelm is expected to generate sales of $953 million next year, according to Refinitiv estimates.
Alaimo also said the price tag was not the main reason for hospitals refusing to use the drug so far, adding the company was offering financial assistance programs.

Meanwhile, Biogen raised its full-year adjusted earnings per share expectations to $18.85 to $19.35, from $17.50 to $19.00.
The company's shares were up 1.8% at $272.92 in early trading.

Investing.com —  Brinker International Inc  (NYSE:EAT) shares tumbled Wednesday after it announced preliminary earnings for the first quarter of 2022.
The parent company of Chili's shares have fallen 8.64% after its results showed higher labor and food costs affected its profit margins. First-quarter sales increased to $859.6 million compared to $728.2 million during the same quarter of fiscal 2021. Net income increased to 34 cents a share compared to 28 cents. 
Revenue was as forecasted; however, net income widely missed estimates of 69 cents a share. This was attributed to the higher costs of labor and food with Brinker saying it plans to raise prices for the fiscal year with a target of 3%.
""Brinker's first quarter delivered positive sales and continued to significantly outpace the industry in traffic,"" said Wyman Roberts, chief executive officer. 
""But the COVID surge starting in August exacerbated the industry-wide labor and commodity challenges and impacted our margins and bottom line more than we anticipated,"" added Roberts.
Brinker's price target was recently lowered to $58 from $63 at KeyBanc. Meanwhile, Stephens analyst James Rutherford kept his overweight rating and $68 price target despite the Q1 earnings miss but noted that it was an even wider miss than he anticipated."

MADRID (Reuters) -Axel Weber, the chairman of UBS, made it clear in September 2018 to his Santander (MC:SAN) counterpart, Ana Botin, that the bank would not stump up Andrea Orcel's deferred pay if he quit to join the Spanish rival, Weber told a court on Wednesday, showing the pivotal role he played in a high-stakes dispute.
Orcel, who was UBS's top investment banker at the time, is suing Santander for compensation in a Spanish court after the withdrawal of an offer to make him CEO because of disagreements over the deferred pay from UBS he would lose.
Botin previously told the court she was aware of Weber's position but UBS's Chief Executive Officer at that time, Sergio Ermotti, had a different view of what UBS might be willing to pay Orcel. Any payout of his deferred bonuses from UBS would have reduced the compensation Santander had to pay Orcel in the package they offered him. 
UBS's official stance was not known until mid-November, Botin had said. Ermotti has never publicly made his position clear and has not been called to give evidence.
Weber said on Wednesday that UBS strips any employee leaving voluntarily to join another financial institution of any deferred payments and he made the bank's position clear to Santander.
""On September 24 (of 2018) we took a final decision, it included that UBS would not pay compensation, that six months leave period would apply, and also included no doubt Santander qualified as financial services institution.""
Asked on Wednesday if Ermotti was involved in the talks about payments that might be due to Orcel, Weber told Madrid court judge Javier Sanchez Beltran remotely from Switzerland that compensation was a matter for the board, not executives.
BINDING OFFER OR NOT?
The case revolves around whether a four-page offer letter to Orcel in September 2018 was a binding contract or a non-binding initial offer, as Botin claimed in the first session of the court hearing in May. 
In January 2019, Santander said the bank could not meet Orcel's pay demands which included covering up to 35 million euros ($41 million) of a 55 million euros compensation package he was expecting to receive in future years from UBS.
Botin said in May that the offer letter to Orcel had stated that any payments he was set to receive from his former employer would help reduce the total compensation paid by Santander. He refused to attribute 13.7 million euros that UBS agreed to pay him, she said. 
On Wednesday, Roberto di Bernadini, Santander's human resources chief at the time, told the court that ""the buyout was a very significant part of Orcel's payment in the offer letter, which set a maximum, and also included an obligation for Orcel to negotiate with UBS to pay the deferrals or at least a part.""
The hearing ended pending lawyers' final submissions by November 5. The ruling could take days or weeks to be released, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Orcel, who has not been called to testify though he was present in court on Wednesday, originally sought as much as 112 million euros from Santander for breach of contract and damage to his career for the last minute U-turn. 
But in May, he dropped the part of his legal claim that would require the Spanish bank to hire him after he was appointed CEO of Italy's UniCredit.
He also reduced his demand to 66-76 million euros, according to sources close to the matter, a court document and Santander's lawyer.
Orcel declined to comment to journalists after the hearing on Wednesday.

UBS head of rewards Mark Shelton said the bank had continued to pay Orcel deferrals in 2020 and 2021 after Santander's offer was retracted. He declined to give details of the amounts.

In more disappointment, the company made net bookings off 6.2 billion euro, lower than second quarter’s 8.3 billion euro. This comes at a time when demand for chips has touched unprecedented levels, which has meant big business for their manufacturers and in turn suppliers of their raw materials and machines.
The Dutch company makes machines used by world’s top companies to produce chips that go into mobile phones, laptops, TVs and cars. It also provides software and services that help those companies mass produce patterns on silicon. For some of the most advanced semiconductors that go into laptops, mobiles and other digital devices, ASML is the world’s only maker of equipment used to produce them.
According to Reuters, ASML dominates the market for lithography systems, machines that cost up to 150 million euros each and that use focused beams of light to help create the circuitry of semiconductors.
Gross margin in the third quarter was 51.7%. The company had guided it to come in between 51% and 52%.
The company told investors in September it was benefiting from ""megatrends"" in the electronics industry. It said annual revenue could come in between 24 billion euro and 30 billion euro in 2025, with gross margins of up to 56%.

The production delays are likely to affect deliveries to the COVAX facility, which aims to provide equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for low- and middle-income countries, the report added.
Novavax and India's Serum Institute, the world's largest vaccine producer, had together committed to providing more than 1.1 billion doses to COVAX.
Novavax in a statement said https://ir.novavax.com/Novavax-Reconfirms-Confidence-in-Regulatory-Filing-Timelines-and-Manufacturing-Quality it was confident in its ability to deliver its high-quality vaccine. 
""We underscore our ongoing commitment to the stringent standards of production and manufacturing for our recombinant nanoparticle protein-based COVID-19 vaccine candidate with Matrix-M adjuvant,"" the company said.

It has fallen behind in the race for authorization in the United States and Europe, which have already vaccinated most of their residents.
Last month, the company and its partner Serum Institute of India applied to the World Health Organization for an emergency use listing of Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine, potentially clearing the way for the shot to be shipped to many poor countries.

ZURICH/FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) misled authorities over spying on its staff and lied to investors about a corrupt loan to Mozambique, regulators said, painting a bleak picture of the cultural decay at the global bank.
The hefty fines announced late on Tuesday by British and U.S. regulators in the Mozambique case as well as a rare rebuke by Swiss regulators over the spying affair mark a low ebb for a Swiss bank that was once a pillar of the economy.
Credit Suisse, which brought in seasoned banker Antonio Horta-Osario as chairman in April to stop the rot, said in response that it condemned the spying and had taken ""decisive"" steps to improve its governance and strengthen compliance. 
Nonetheless, the scandals, coupled with heavy losses from the collapse of U.S. family office Archegos and the hit to the bank's clients from the demise of British financier Greensill, have prompted debate about strengthening Swiss banking controls.
""The scandals expose a cultural problem,"" said Gerhard Andrey, a Green Party lawmaker in Switzerland's parliament who is pushing for tighter regulation. ""We need more power to tackle the top ranks of management at these banks, who always walk away unscathed from such scandals.""
Vincent Kaufmann, chief executive of Swiss investment adviser Ethos, called on Wednesday on Credit Suisse to claw back bonuses paid to managers involved in the various scandals and consider taking legal action against them.
On Tuesday, Credit Suisse was penalised $547 million by British and U.S. regulators for secret loans to Mozambique, whose discovery prompted donors to withdraw support for the southern African country and triggered its economic collapse.
The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) said Credit Suisse had hidden the true nature of the loans, which were meant to pay for a tuna fishing fleet, including the payment of $200 million in kickbacks to its bankers and government officials in Mozambique. 
""Credit Suisse, through its subsidiary in the United Kingdom, engaged in a global criminal conspiracy to defraud investors,"" U.S. Attorney Breon Peace said in the DOJ statement.
The DOJ said Credit Suisse would have to pay British and U.S. regulators $475 million, after taking into account crediting and other resolutions.
Speaking for Mozambique's attorney general, Keith Oliver at law firm Peters & Peters said it was an ""important step towards obtaining full redress for the people of Mozambique"" and the country would bring those responsible to justice.
'UNJUSTIFIED OBSERVATION'
The string of scandals at Credit Suisse have rattled faith in the Swiss bank founded to finance the building of the nation's rail network that tunnels through the Alps.
Shareholders have deserted the bank following the slew of bad headlines and a tepid performance. Its shares are down 14% this year while the Swiss blue chip index has climbed 11%.
Separately, Swiss regulators accused Credit Suisse on Tuesday of misleading them about the scale of spying the bank was undertaking in a scandal that forced the departure last year of Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam.
The crisis erupted when Credit Suisse's former star wealth manager Iqbal Khan, who had defected to arch Swiss rival UBS, confronted a private detective trailing him through downtown Zurich. 
As more details came to light, one private investigator involved in the scandal committed suicide, intensifying the outcry. Credit Suisse, however, repeatedly played down this and another episode of spying as isolated incidents.
But the Swiss Financial market Supervisory Authority FINMA said on Tuesday that the bank planned spying operations on seven occasions between 2016 and 2019, and carried out most of them.
It said the bank had sought to cover its tracks by using external text messaging services and ""rudimentary invoices"". It said several members of the executive board were informed of planned spying on an employee in Asia in 2019.
Criticising the banks for serious shortcomings in its governance, FINMA said it had launched enforcement proceedings against three individuals. 
The bank said it regretted that it did not ""ensure all relevant information was readily available"" to FINMA and that it condemned any ""unjustified observation"".
The scandals have angered FINMA officials, who struggle to hold bankers to account because Swiss rules only allow them to sanction directors if they are directly involved in wrongdoing, rather than for general managerial lapses.
Despite more than $15 billion in writedowns and penalties in recent years at Credit Suisse, dissenting shareholders also failed to oust chairman Urs Rohner before he retired this year.

Cedric Wermuth, a Swiss lawmaker from the Social Democratic Party, backed calls for tighter banking controls.
""We will have more cases in the future like this unless we have stronger regulation,"" he said.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Nestle raised its full-year sales target on Wednesday after the world’s largest food group reaped the benefits of price hikes on its products ranging from pet food to bottled water with a forecast-beating third quarter.
The Switzerland-based firm, whose shares rose more than 3%, has moved ahead of other consumer companies in passing on higher input costs to consumers, leveraging the strength of its brands such as Purina pet food and Perrier water.
The maker of KitKat bars and Nescafe will increase prices further in the final quarter and in 2022 when input costs are expected to increase even more than the 4% rise seen in 2021, Chief Financial Officer Francois-Xavier Roger told investors.
Its rivals are set to follow. Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), has said it will raise prices in the United States and Danone has warned of price pressures next year, adding to a global inflationary threat testing the resolve of central banks.
Unilever (NYSE:UL) gives a trading update on Thursday.
""Our industry, in general, is not an industry that is in normal times pinched by inflation,"" Chief Executive Mark Schneider said, adding the industry should be able to maintain its financial performance even if the inflationary cycle extended beyond 2022.
Like its peers, Nestle is grappling with supply chain constraints as the world economy roars out of a COVID-19 slump. The company said in a statement price increases should help keep its margin steady at about 17.5% this year, followed by a moderate margin improvement in the mid term.
But Schneider played down prospects for an improvement as early as next year, citing rising input costs since the summer. ""There is no guidance or commitment for 2022 to increase margins,"" he said.
Nestle raised its full-year organic growth guidance to 6%-7% from 5%-6% previously, after organic sales rose 6.5% in the third quarter, composed of 2.1% price hikes and 4.4% volume growth, and beating forecasts https://www.nestle.com/investors/analysts-consensus.
Roger said volume growth was expected to slow somewhat as the pandemic-related boost to at-home consumption waned. 
Nestle shares, up 8% this year, climbed 3.2% by 1318 GMT, exceeding the 1.6% rise across the European food sector. 
""The company knocked it out of the park for the third quarter,"" Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Jon Cox said, saying price rises for Nestle products were the highest since 2015.
""Most companies with strong brands will be able to pass on prices and I think the market still does not get that,"" he said.
Nestle said growth at its Purina petcare business was fuelled by its higher priced premium ranges and veterinary products. Vontobel analyst Jean-Philippe Bertschy said Purina was Nestle's ""star performer"".

Bernstein's Bruno Monteyne said the benefits of higher volumes and pricing would only fully show in 2022. 
Strong coffee sales were also a driver for Nestle, with its Starbucks-branded products posting 15.5% growth in the first nine months. Out-of-home consumption of food and drinks, which took a hit during the pandemic, recovered further, Nestle said.

Oil service firms are expected to be supported by a rebound in oil prices to pre-pandemic levels as demand recovers and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and their allies stick to their output-increase schedule instead of accelerating production.
But some companies are seeing earnings clipped by higher prices for materials and disruptions to global supply chains. Baker Hughes and rival Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) have also been negatively impacted by Hurricane Ida, which disrupted operations on the U.S. Gulf Coast and Gulf of Mexico in August and September. 
Baker Hughes reported adjusted net income of $141 million, or 16 cents per share, in the third quarter, missing forecasts for 21 cents per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data. Revenues of $5.093 billion also fell short of expectations of $5.321 billion. 
Shares slipped 4% to $25.79 in early trading. They are up about 29% year-to-date, lagging gains in global oil prices, which have risen about 62%. 
""As we look ahead to the rest of 2021 and into 2022, we see continued signs of global economic recovery that should drive further demand growth for oil and natural gas,"" Baker Hughes Chief Executive Officer Lorenzo Simonelli said. 
On a call with investors, Simonelli acknowledged Baker Hughes experienced ""some mixed results across our product companies.""
Its oilfield services unit was negatively impacted by Hurricane Ida and supply chain problems, which costs the company roughly $30 million to $40 million during the quarter. 
Higher costs for chemicals, which have not yet been fully passed onto customers, also weighed on earnings.
Wall Street analysts were underwhelmed by the report, calling it neutral to negative. 
""At the segment level, there were a number of different moving pieces which may drive some uneasiness today,"" Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co said in a note, pointing to disappointing results in oilfield services and digital solutions. Those units offset a margin beat in its Turbomachinery and Process Solutions unit. 
Its digital solutions unit was also negatively impacted by supply chain problems related to semiconductors, boards and displays, executives said on the call. 

Net income attributable to the company was $8 million, marking Baker Hughes' first quarterly profit since the fourth quarter of 2020. 
Crude prices climbed 4.5% in the quarter ended Sept. 30. and are currently trading just above $84 a barrel.

Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), a group of banks committed to reducing their carbon financing and investment portfolio by 2050.
The alliance, launched in April, has almost 80 members from 35 countries, including Bank of America (NYSE:BAC),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C)  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM). It has $54 trillion in assets under management, more than a third of global banking assets. 
The Italian lenders made their announcements made before the U.N. Climate Change Conference, known as COP26, in Glasgow, Scotland, which starts on Oct. 31.
Alliance members are required to submit science-based climate plans that cover all types of emissions, set interim targets for 2030, and annually publish details on emissions. The banks have 18 months from signing to set their first objectives. 
UniCredit said it would give details on its environmental, social and governance (ESG) strategy, part of its new business plan, at an investor day expected in the fourth quarter.
""This is an important moment in our journey to a more sustainable future and is a necessary action to focus attention and ultimately make significant progress in this area,"" UniCredit Chief Executive Andrea Orcel said in a statement.
""To do otherwise would be irresponsible and would work against the customers and clients we serve,"" he said.
Intesa Sanpaolo said it would provide about 80 billion euros ($93 billion) to finance green and circular economy initiatives and for the ecological transition during the course of Italy's national recovery plan.

Chief Executive Carlo Messina said joining the alliance was ""a significant step along a path that commits Intesa Sanpaolo to new objectives in the fight against climate change.""
Ifis CEO Frederik Geertman said joining the alliance was an ""important commitment"" for the bank and the decision was fully aligned with past actions regarding environmental issues.

Let’s discuss.A solid start to the third-quarter earnings season has made investors bullish, as evidenced by the impressive performances of the major stock market indexes. According to FactSet, through October 15, 8% of the companies in the S&P 500 had reported results for Q3 2021, and 80% of them have surpassed consensus EPS estimates, which surpasses the 76% five-year average. This, along with a low-interest-rate environment and decline in initial jobless claims, should keep the stock market upbeat in the near term.
While high inflation and supply chain constraints remain concerns, initial jobless claims fell below 300,000 for the week ended October 9, for the first time since the initial days of the COVID-19 pandemic.

1570,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2021 09:46AM ET</span>","India's Future Retail must take part in Amazon dispute arbitration, Singapore panel says","By Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Future Retail must take part in arbitration over a commercial dispute with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), a Singapore arbitration panel ruled on Wednesday, rejecting the Indian retailer's bid to avoid the process. 
Amazon is trying to block https://www.reuters.com/article/amazon-india-future-reliance-idUSKBN2871AM Future's $3.4 billion sale of its retail assets to Indian market leader Reliance Industries, accusing it of breaking contracts. Future denies any wrongdoing.
After the Singapore arbitrator put the deal on hold last year in an interim decision, Future argued it should be excluded from arbitration because Amazon had initiated it incorrectly under a contract it signed with another Future group company. 
In an order on Wednesday, which is not public but has been reviewed by Reuters, the panel disagreed with Future. It said the three agreements at the heart of the Future-Amazon dispute must be read together, and not separately, as Future argued.
The three agreements were of ""composite nature"", ""wide and comprehensive enough"" and the tribunal ""has jurisdiction over FRL (Future Retail) in this Arbitration,"" said the 69-page order.
Future and Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
The main arbitration proceedings will now begin in due course, people familiar with the matter said. 
The dispute started after Future, India's second-largest retailer with over 1,700 stores, entered into a deal last year to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and certain other businesses to Reliance, after COVID-19 hit its operations hard.
Amazon had its sights on ultimately owning some of Future's retail assets itself. It has argued a 2019 deal it had with a Future unit contained clauses prohibiting the Indian group from selling its retail assets to anyone on a ""restricted persons"" list that included Reliance.

Amazon brought proceedings against Future before a Singapore arbitration panel, and the dispute is also being fought at various Indian legal forums.
The outcome of the tussle involving two of the world’s richest men, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and Reliance’s Mukesh Ambani, could reshape India’s pandemic-hit shopping sector and help determine whether Amazon can blunt Reliance's dominance of India's almost one trillion-dollar retail market.

1571,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 20, 2021 09:42AM ET</span>","Wall Street Opens a Shade Higher; Verizon, Alibaba Gain; Dow up 30 Pts","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened a fraction higher on Tuesday, supported by a number of positive earnings report but held back by disappointment at heavyweight Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s earnings. 
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), all three main indices were struggling to extend the gains that they made on Tuesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 29 points, or 0.1%, at 35,486 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.1%. 
To a large degree, this was due to disappointment at guidance from Netflix after the close on Tuesday. The streaming giant said it would have negative free cash flow in the current quarter due to high amortization costs after a heavy investment in original content. That investment had brought in nearly 1 million more new subscribers than expected in the third quarter, but revenue failed to keep pace with subscriber growth, and user numbers in the higher-paying but largely saturated North American market only inched up. There was also little sign of the company making significant money out of its diversification into videogaming in the near term.
Netflix stock fell 2.5%, downgraded by, among others,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn). 
Among the stocks supported by better-than-expected results were Verizon (NYSE:VZ), which added 2.1% after the carrier posted a solid gain in high-paying 5G mobile subscribers, raising its guidance and its dividend in the process.  Abbott Laboratories  (NYSE:ABT) stock gained 4.0%, and Anthem (NYSE:ANTM) stock rose 6.7%, the latter pulling UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) stock up by another 2.3%. Both Anthem's and Abbott's results benefited from a return to normality in the health care system as the pandemic receded. 
By contrast,  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) stock plunged 16% after Politico reported that it is struggling to meet quality standards dictated by the Food and Drug Administration for its Covid-19 vaccine.
Elsewhere, Winnebago (NYSE:WGO) stock and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) stock both lost premarket momentum, losing 1.4% and 0.1% respectively after trading higher before the opening. The bottom lines of both were better than expected in the last quarter, Winnebago earning more and United losing less than forecast. However, both warned of higher costs in the pipeline.  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) ADRs were another to lose premarket gains as soon as the market opened. They were down 0.1%, having already gained nearly 7% on Tuesday on the back of a report that sighted founder Jack Ma allegedly on vacation in Spain. The report was taken as a sign that relations between Ma and Beijing have eased to the point where vacations are possible again.
Regulatory battles have been at the heart of a decline in Alibaba's stock that goes back to last fall, when regulators intervened to stop Alibaba's financial services affiliate Ant Group listing in Hong Kong. New rules introduced in the wake of that have substantially reduced Ant Group's profitability, while Alibaba has been a lightning rod for broader concerns about the impact of the Chinese government's campaign to reduce inequality."

Foxconn, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, aims to become a major player in the global EV market and has clinched deals with U.S. startup Fisker Inc and Thailand's energy group PTT PCL.
Speaking to reporters at a business forum in Taipei after unveiling three EV prototypes on Monday, Liu said that due to disclosure restrictions he couldn't provide any details of its plans for Europe, India and Latin America.
""Europe will be a bit faster, I agree with that. But as to where, I can't tell you,"" he said.
Asked if they would be cooperating with German car firms he said ""indirectly"", saying the timeline would be Europe first, then India and Latin America, adding that Mexico was ""very possible"".
Liu has previously mentioned Mexico as a possible EV production site.
He said they would be using what Foxconn refers to as its BOL model, meaning Build, Operate, and Localise - investing with partners to build and operate local factories and then sell to local consumers.
In May, Foxconn and carmaker Stellantis announced a plan https://www.reuters.com/technology/stellantis-foxconn-form-connectivity-focused-car-technology-jv-2021-05-18 to create a joint venture to supply in-car and connected-car technologies across the auto industry.
Foxconn this month bought a factory from U.S. startup Lordstown Motors Corp to make electric cars. In August it bought a chip plant in Taiwan in a move to supply future demand for auto chips.
Foxconn, best known for making iPhones for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), has set a target to provide components or services for 10% of the world's EVs by between 2025 and 2027, as it looks to diversify revenue streams away from being a contract electronics maker. 
Liu, speaking earlier at the same forum, said Taiwan had a natural edge when it came to making EVs because of its existing strength in software and semiconductors.
""These are the advantages that Taiwan has cultivated for many years and is best at.""

Foxconn's shares closed up 0.5% on Wednesday, outperforming a 0.1% fall on the broader market. 
They are up almost 17% since the start of the year.

""Ultimately higher jet fuel prices lead to higher ticket prices,"" Kirby told CNBC.
Despite robust travel demand, a recent surge in fuel prices has proved painful for the aviation industry with Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) warning of a fourth quarter pre-tax loss and suggesting it might have to pass on higher costs to consumers.
Higher fuel costs leads to less flown capacity and higher fares. JP Morgan analyst Jamie Baker views higher fuel costs as a short-term negative, but a positive in the medium- to long-term.
A global energy crunch is expected to boost oil demand and could stoke inflation and slow the world's recovery from the pandemic, according to the International Energy Agency.
The brent crude benchmark has risen 62.7% so far this year.

Kirby's comments come a day after United Airlines reported a smaller third-quarter loss, but was hurt by a resurgence in coronavirus cases, which slowed bookings and drove up cancellations.
United Airlines expects to spend about $2.39 per gallon in the fourth quarter on jet fuel. The carrier spent on average $2.14 per gallon in the third quarter, about 6% higher than in the same period in 2019.

LONDON (Reuters) - British fashion house Burberry has named Jonathan Akeroyd as its new chief executive officer from next April, poaching the boss of Milan-based Versace and former Alexander McQueen head to succeed Marco Gobbetti. 
The appointment ends months of uncertainty at the 165-year-old group, which had been searching for a replacement for Gobbetti since June, when he announced his shock departure mid-way into a multi-year turnaround plan to take the brand further upmarket.
However, the relatively long transition period means it will take time for Akeroyd to stamp his mark on Burberry.
""The timing of his start date suggests Burberry is unlikely to present an updated strategy until Q3/Q4 2022 at the earliest, thus delaying its turnaround even further,"" UBS analysts said in a note. 
Shares in Burberry, which have extended losses since the announcement of Gobbetti's departure and were trading down 19% on June levels, were up slightly on Wednesday. 
Burberry, known for its trench coats, trademark plaid and TB monogram, said Akeroyd, a 54-year-old Briton, was the right choice to build on its creative heritage. 
""Jonathan is an experienced leader with a strong track record in building global luxury fashion brands and driving profitable growth,"" Burberry Chair Gerry Murphy said. 
Akeroyd accelerated growth during his five years at Italy's Versace and oversaw the sale of the house, known for its opulent, ostentatious style, to U.S. group Michael Kors, now known as Capri Holdings (NYSE:CPRI), in 2018.
Versace's revenues rebounded in the latest quarter reported, with revenue of $240 million up 158% year on year and a return to profit after the COVID-19 impact a year earlier. 
However, its pre-pandemic annual sales of $843 million are still well below a $2 billion target set by Capri for the brand. 
Before joining Versace, Akeroyd led the successful relaunch of British luxury brand Alexander McQueen, part of French luxury giant  Kering  (PA:PRTP), from 2004-2016.
Berenberg analysts said Akeroyd had ""lots of luxury CEO experience of leading houses - as well as brand turnarounds"".
He would earn an annual salary of 1.1 million pounds ($1.5 million) plus bonuses, and would be granted cash and share payments worth about 6 million pounds for incentives he forfeits at Versace, Burberry said. 
Like other luxury brands, Burberry was hit by COVID-19, but it has recovered, driven by demand in Asia.
It said in July its like-for-like sales had risen above pre-pandemic levels, driven by new, younger fans of Riccardo Tisci, the designer who Gobbetti brought in to revitalise the brand and who investors are relieved is staying put.

Gobbetti's departure was described as a personal decision to return to Italy, where he will lead the Italian luxury goods group Ferragamo.
He will leave Burberry on Dec. 31. The group said Murphy would chair the executive committee for the four months until Akeroyd joins.

The company's shares rose 5.7% to $358.00 premarket.
A global semiconductor shortage has forced dealers and automakers to operate with far leaner inventories than usual and has made buyers pay record prices for the vehicles of their choice.
The average retail price for new vehicles hit new highs every month during the quarter, according to auto consultant J.D. power, boosting profits at auto retailers as demand for personal transportation remains high.
Lithia, the first large U.S. auto retailer to report third-quarter results, said its quarterly profit nearly doubled as gross profit per new vehicle jumped 78.7% to $5,221. 
""Profit margins per vehicle may get even stronger in the near term, as consumer demand for vehicles is very strong right now amid tight supply,"" Guggenheim Securities analyst Ali Faghri said.
The Oregon-based company's average gross profit for used vehicles, on the other hand, rose 3.9% to $3,046. 
Lithia's quarterly revenue rose about 70% to $6.17 billion, beating analyst estimates of $5.8 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES.
Net income rose 94% to $307.9 million, or $10.11 per share, for the quarter ended Sept. 30.

1578,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2021 09:12AM ET</span>",Amazon and others commit to using zero-carbon shipping fuels by 2040,"By Jonathan Saul
LONDON (Reuters) -Amazon.com Inc and IKEA are among commercial users of container shipping that will opt for zero-carbon marine fuels by 2040 in a new initiative aimed at speeding up decarbonisation in the maritime sector, executives said on Tuesday. 
With about 90% of world trade transported by sea, global shipping accounts for nearly 3% of the world's CO2 emissions and the sector is under growing scrutiny to become cleaner.
The initiative, which was organised by the non-profit Aspen Institute and has nine signatories so far also including Unilever (NYSE:UL) and  Michelin  (PA:MICP), sets a goal for companies to only purchase ocean freight services powered by scalable zero-carbon fuels by 2040.
""The time to act is now,"" said Edgar Blanco, director for net-zero carbon at Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). 
Elisabeth Munck af Rosenschöld, sustainability manager for supply chain operations at Inter IKEA Group, said working with others was crucial for developing cleaner ocean shipping fuel. 
""The voice of the cargo owners is important since we are one of the stakeholders to enable the transformation in the industry,"" she told Reuters. 
""We are not willing to automatically pay a premium for sustainability, but we are willing to collaborate and to co-create the solutions and share the necessary investments.""
Boston Consulting Group estimates that the global shipping industry will need $2.4 trillion in investments to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. The move will require the swift development of zero or low-emission fuels and new designs for ships. 
A surge in demand for retail goods while people have been stuck at home due to lockdowns has led to record high container shipping rates in recent months, compounded by port disruptions, which has also led to higher costs for cargo users. 
Michelle Grose, head of logistics at Unilever, said logistics accounted for 15% of the group's total greenhouse gas emissions footprint, and Unilever was ""encouraging our existing carriers to switch to cleaner fuels"".
""By signalling our combined commitment to zero-emission shipping, we are confident that we will accelerate the transition at the pace and the scale that is needed.""
Environmental groups in the Ship It Zero green coalition said the announced commitments were ""historic, but too weak"", and urged the signatories to switch entirely to zero-emissions ships by 2030. 
""If major retail brands truly want to do their fair share on climate change, they need to be on a course correction now, not 19 years from now,"" said Kendra Ulrich at environmental group Stand.earth, a member of Ship It Zero.
Michael Field, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, said the pledge by the companies was welcomed.

""Although 2040 is clearly a long time away, it certainly gets the ball rolling on investment in clean technologies and will most likely encourage other large corporations to follow suit, perhaps with even more near-term commitments,"" Field said.
The United Nations aims to reduce the shipping industry's greenhouse gas emissions by 50% from 2008 levels by 2050, with growing calls for a more ambitious target of full decarbonisation by 2050.

Covid-19 tests had begun to taper off but with vaccinations rates getting sluggish, governments, corporates, schools, colleges and other bodies made Covid testing mandatory. That boosted the demand for testing platforms provided by the company.
Third-quarter sales at Abbott's diagnostics business grew 47% to $3.91 billion, with Covid test-related sales at $1.9 billion, up from $1.3 billion in the second quarter.
Excluding Covid-19 testing-related sales, worldwide diagnostics sales grew a robust 14% as people became more health-conscious and also attended to medical issues the pandemic had forced them to ignore.
Sales in established pharmaceuticals and medical devices business rose by around 15% and 13%, respectively, while the nutrition segment grew 9%.
The pharmaceuticals business, where the company focuses on branded generics, did well in China, Russia and India. Abbott’s medical devices found use in electrophysiology, heart failure, structural heart and diabetes care.
Abbott’s nutrition brands, both for adult and pediatric use, performed well in the U.S.
Total sales rose 22% on organic basis to $10.9 billion and profit per share jumped 43% to $1.4. Both topped estimates and the company said the adjusted profit per share is now seen at $5.05 at midpoint, higher than the $4.4-figure it gave in July.

Philippe Donnet, at the helm of the insurer since 2016, has come under fire from two shareholders -- the Italian businessmen Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone and Leonardo Del Vecchio -- who have criticised his M&A strategy as too timid and want Generali to grow further. 
However, Donnet can count on the support of the majority of the board and of Generali's largest shareholder Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY), ahead of the renewal of the board of directors that will be voted on by shareholders on April 29.
Responding indirectly to criticism from the two tycoons, Donnet said Generali has delivered a total shareholder return of above 100%, more than any of its competitors, since his first investor day as CEO in late 2016.
""Despite our imperfections we have been the best,"" he said at an industry event. 
""Europe is our home"" and growing in Europe ""continues to be our strategy. We also want to strengthen our presence in Asia,"" he added. 
In June Generali agreed to buy Axa's insurance assets in Malaysia and take full ownership of a joint venture it runs in the country to strengthen its local presence. 

After a number of acquisitions in Portugal and eastern Europe, Generali has launched a bid for smaller Italian rival Cattolica to become the country's leading non-life operator.
The new three-year plan ""will be a plan to ramp up digital transformation and in asset management,"" Donnet said, adding that sustainability will be ""an increasingly central theme of the strategy.""

Chip scarcity has hampered automobile production around the world, bringing some assembly lines to a halt, with automakers warning the chip shortage could extend, even as vehicle demand booms in markets including the United States.
The company said it expects 2021 sales of $35.4 billion to $36.4 billion, compared with $38.0 billion to $39.5 billion forecast earlier. Magna added it expects light vehicle production to fall 7% in North America and 9% in Europe this year.

Magna, which is scheduled to report third-quarter results on Nov. 5, also cut its adjusted operating margin forecast to between 5.1% and 5.4% from 7.0% to 7.4%, citing automakers' unpredictable production schedules and higher commodity costs.
Magna's U.S. peer, Aptiv (NYSE:APTV) plc, lowered its annual sales forecast earlier this month, citing the chip shortage.

Washington imposed sanctions on Deripaska, 53, and other influential Russians in 2018 because of their ties to President Vladimir Putin after alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election, which Moscow denies.
""Watching everything that is happening in America, I cannot help but marvel at the utter stupidity of part of the American establishment who persist in spinning this story about the allegedly colossal role of the Russians in the 2016 U.S. presidential election,"" Deripaska said.
""It is convenient to feed one's electorate (brought up on Hollywood movies about horrible Russians) with all sorts of crap for another 10 years,"" he added.
The two homes that, according to Deripaska, belong to his relatives were raided by the FBI on Tuesday. Two sources familiar with the investigation told Reuters the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan was leading the probe.
Deripaska said in his social media post that no one was living in the properties. 
""I have to ask: how much of Putin's money was found in those abandoned houses yesterday?"" he said, sarcastically inquiring whether investigators had discovered any mouldy jam or vodka in the cupboards.
Deripaska is the founder of Russian aluminium giant Rusal, in which he still owns a stake via his shares in its parent company En+ Group. Deripaska relinquished control in both in 2018 as part of his deal with Washington that removed those companies from the blacklist but kept him on it.

Rusal's Hong Kong-listed shares were down 3% on Wednesday.
The Kremlin declined to comment when asked about the FBI raids on Wednesday, adding that it did not know what prompted the searches but was ready to defend the rights and interests of Russian citizens if they were affected.

Investing.com – Verizon stock (NYSE:VZ) traded nearly 1% higher in Wednesday’s premarket as the telecom company brought in more users seeking its 5G services in the third quarter.
A higher dividend for the 15th consecutive year and a higher annual guidance also boosted the stock.
The company reaped the benefit of a wider 5G network, ever-broadening content and more phones offering high-speed services. The company added 429,000 postpaid phone subscribers in the quarter and the company closed the quarter with more than 25% of wireless phone customers having 5G-capable devices. At the end of September, the company had 122 million total retail connections.
Total broadband net additions, including wireline and fixed wireless, numbered 129,000.
Total third-quarter wireless service revenue rose 4% on-year to $17.1 billion, driven by higher access revenue, volume growth and products.
Total revenue declined 0.8% to $7.7 billion. The company said wireless revenue growth continues to offset ongoing legacy wireline declines.
Consolidated operating revenue jumped 4.3% to $32.9 billion. The sale of the Verizon Media business boosted profits and adjusted earnings per share of $1.41 topped estimates. The company factored in two months of revenue from the sold operations.
The company is now guiding for total wireless service revenue growth at the top end of its previous guidance of 3%-4%. Adjusted EPS is also seen higher than previously."

BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) has produced just 300,000 cars at its main Wolfsburg plant so far this year, a company source with knowledge of the matter said, the lowest figure since 1958 and far behind its average output before the pandemic.
The plant, which makes cars from the Golf, Tiguan, and Seat brands among others, produced an average of 780,000 vehicles per year in the past decade and the company said in 2018 it aimed to boost this figure to a million.
But supply chain problems meant just under 500,000 vehicles made it off the assembly line in 2020. This year's output, first reported by Die Zeit weekly, is set to be even lower as the chip crisis sets in.
Volkswagen has previously said it would have a production shortfall in the high hundreds of thousands due to a lack of semiconductors, a problem plaguing automakers worldwide which the company expects to last well into 2022.

A spokesperson said last week that discussions were underway to address the competitiveness of the Wolfsburg plant, which does not yet produce fully electric vehicles, particularly in the face of growing competition from new entrants such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).
The comments followed reports that Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess had said at a supervisory board meeting in September that a delay in the transition to electric vehicles could cost the company 30,000 jobs - one in four of its current employees.

Banks have stepped up branch closures after many paused restructuring for much of last year to focus on responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Kering's shares were down by 3.4 percent in early session trading, making it the worst-performing stock on France's benchmark CAC-40 index. 
The fall in Kering also dragged down shares in its French rival LVMH, with LVMH shares falling 0.9 percent, while Hermes also fell 0.6 percent.
""Gucci growth was disappointing, with retail sales +2% on a 2-year basis, decelerating from Q2 (+11%), negatively impacted by increased pandemic restrictions in APAC and a lack of product newness,"" wrote JP Morgan in a research note.

Luxury goods groups have bounced back strongly from the fallout of the health emergency, lifted by pent-up demand for high-end wares as lockdowns ease across the world and consumers return to socialising.
However, shopping by travelling tourists - a key source of revenue for the sector - remains well below pre-pandemic levels.

Investing.com –  Alibaba  ADRs (NYSE:BABA) looked like extending their recent gains Wednesday on reports that founder Jack Ma had made his first trip abroad after a year of being out of public view.
The reports were taken as a sign that Ma's problems with regulators - which had been behind a sharp drop in Alibaba's shares in recent months - had improved. 
The ADRs had closed 6.1% higher Tuesday and traded with 2.2% gains in today’s premarket session.
Hong Kong-based publication East Week reported Tuesday that Ma had traveled to Spain over the weekend with his billionaire friends and business partners for a vacation.
According to Alibaba-owned The South China Morning Post, Ma is there for an agriculture and technology study tour.
The billionaire seemed to have disappeared last October soon after making statements that appeared to criticize the Chinese regulators. His whereabouts have been the subject of much discussion ever since.
Ma’s fintech giant Ant Group had to call off its initial public offering just a day before it was to open, an outcome that many attributed to pressure from the authorities in the wake of his comments.
There was some news at the operational end too, propping up the shares.

1593,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2021 07:31AM ET</span>",Explainer-Why is Toyota being sued by supplier Nippon Steel?,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Nippon Steel Corp is suing customer  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp to stop it manufacturing and selling vehicles that contain specialised steel made by rival supplier Baoshan Iron & Steel Co Ltd (Baosteel) of China, which it is also suing. 
It highlights the high stakes for materials producers as technology transforms the auto industry and comes as Japan is increasingly concerned about safeguarding supply chains and intellectual property. 
Here is what's behind the lawsuit and why it is important:
WHAT IS THE SUIT ABOUT? 
Nippon Steel is suing Toyota and Baosteel in a Tokyo court for patent infringement, seeking 20 billion yen ($176 million) in damages from each. It is also trying to stop Toyota from selling and manufacturing vehicles in Japan that use Baosteel's non-oriented magnetic steel sheets.
Nippon Steel believes the sale and use of the Baosteel sheets in Japan violates its Japanese patent claims on composition, thickness, crystal grain diameter and magnetic properties, according to a company spokesperson.
Toyota said it confirmed there was no infringement before concluding its contract with Baosteel.
Baosteel said it did not agree with Nippon Steel's claims and it would ""firmly"" defend its rights and interests.
WHY IS THE STEEL IMPORTANT?
Non-oriented magnetic steel is specialised metal that improves the performance of motors in hybrid electric and electric vehicles, according to Nippon Steel.
The company has supplied electromagnetic steel to Toyota for the Prius hybrid for more than two decades.
Japan's steelmakers are focused on advanced niche markets, such as specialised automobile components, where they have so far had an edge against bigger Chinese rivals.
But Toyota's supply deal with Baosteel suggests Chinese producers may be catching up. Demand for specialised steel is expected to grow as electric vehicles transform the auto industry.
WHAT ABOUT NIPPON STEEL'S PAST LAWSUIT?
Nippon Steel sued South Korea's  POSCO  (NYSE:PKX) for more than $1 billion in 2012, alleging POSCO stole its technology for making another type of magnetic steel sheets, which are used in transformers.
POSCO later paid around $250 million to settle.
That suit came about after a former POSCO employee was sentenced for selling POSCO technology to a Chinese steelmaker and told a court the technology came from Nippon Steel.
The Chinese steelmaker in that incident was also Baosteel, according to a person familiar with the matter.
When contacted by Reuters, Baosteel declined to comment on the POSCO suit.
IMPACT ON TOYOTA?
The monetary damages sought are unlikely to have a significant impact on Toyota. The bigger concern would be if a court stopped it from using the Baosteel steel when it is ramping up production of electric vehicles. 
""The volume of electrified vehicles is increasing and there is a need to secure the volume of the parts,"" a Toyota spokesperson said. He declined to say how many models could be affected by an injunction on Baosteel supplies. 
IMPACT ON BAOSTEEL?
Baosteel said it is currently unable to assess the impact on its profits from the lawsuit.
IMPACT ON NIPPON STEEL?
Nippon Steel may have more to lose by taking on key customer Toyota, which could try to buy more from rivals outside Japan to avoid future supply-chain disruption. 
Nippon Steel is more dependent on Toyota than the automaker is on the steelmaker, according to ratings agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO).
However, UBS analyst Harunobu Goroh doesn't see any impact on the fundamental relationship between the two Japanese companies, adding they will remain strategic partners. 
WHAT DOES TOKYO SAY?
The spat coincides with deepening concern in Japan about the vulnerability of industrial supply chains both to U.S.-China trade frictions and the semiconductors shortage.
Japan is also worried about alleged technology theft by China. New Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has created a new post in his cabinet, minister for economic security, to tackle these issues. 
China has repeatedly said it respects intellectual property rights.
For now, however, trade ministry officials and government spokesman Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno have declined to comment on the tussle between two of Japan's industrial giants.

""This is a private sector litigation and I shouldn't comment,"" Matsuno told reporters on Friday.

1594,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2021 07:27AM ET</span>","Facebook plans new group name to revamp image, says The Verge","(Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), under fire from regulators and lawmakers over its business practices, is planning to rebrand itself with a new group name that focuses on the metaverse, the Verge reported on Tuesday. 
The name change will be announced next week, The Verge reported, citing a source with direct knowledge of the matter.
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been talking up the metaverse, a digital world where people can move between different devices and communicate in a virtual environment, since July, and the group has invested heavily in virtual reality and augmented reality, developing hardware such as its Oculus VR headsets and working on AR glasses and wristband technologies.
The move would likely position the flagship app as one of many products under a parent company overseeing brands such as Instagram and WhatsApp, according to the report. Google adopted such a structure when it reorganized into a holding company called Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in 2015.
Facebook said it does not comment on ""rumor or speculation.""
If true, the rebranding would make sense as the core Facebook business becomes less important to the group and it seeks to revamp an image tarnished by regulatory and legal scrutiny of how it handles user safety and hate speech, analysts said. 
""It reflects the broadening out of the Facebook business. And then, secondly, I do think that Facebook's brand is probably not the greatest given all of the events of the last three years or so,"" internet analyst James Cordwell at Atlantic Equities said.
Facebook is under wide-ranging scrutiny from global lawmakers and regulators over its content moderation practices and harms linked to its platforms, with internal documents leaked by a whistleblower forming the basis for a U.S. Senate hearing last week.
""Having a different parent brand will guard against having this negative association transferred into a new brand, or other brands that are in the portfolio,"" said Shankha Basu, associate professor of marketing at University of Leeds. 
Last month, Facebook appointed Andrew Bosworth, who heads up the social media company's augmented reality and virtual reality efforts, including products like its Oculus Quest VR headset, as chief technology officer.

Metaverse, first coined in a dystopian novel three decades earlier, is popular in Silicon Valley and has been referenced by other tech firms such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). The popular children's game Roblox describes itself as a metaverse company. Epic Games' Fortnite is also considered to be part of the metaverse.
Zuckerberg plans to talk about the name change at the company's annual Connect conference on Oct. 28, but it could be unveiled sooner, the Verge said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of five U.S. senators urged the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on Wednesday to address surveillance threats posed by foreign firms providing services to U.S. telecommunications providers.
The previously unreported letter, led by Senator Ron Wyden and also signed by Senators Dick Durbin, Richard Blumenthal, Chris Van Hollen and Ed Markey, said it is widespread among small rural carriers ""to outsource the installation and ongoing administration of networking technology to managed service providers, some of which are based in foreign countries.""
The FCC has taken in action in recent years to address concerns raised U.S. telecommunications firms using hardware made by companies like China's Huawei and ZTE Corp (HK:0763).
The Democratic lawmakers said the FCC should work with U.S. intelligence agencies ""to identify high-risk foreign managed service providers that pose a threat to Americans’ privacy and U.S. national security, and prohibit U.S. wireless carriers from outsourcing the administration of their networks to these high-risk foreign firms.""
U.S. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines in January told the Senate Intelligence Committee that ""remote administration and management of U.S. telecommunications networks by foreign companies could potentially threaten national security."" 
The letter to acting FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel noted President Joe Biden in June signed an executive order aimed at protecting Americans' ""sensitive data from foreign adversaries.""
The FCC did not immediately comment but Rosenworcel said in June ""we need to think about security in everything we do in our connected world."" 
The letter added ""there are currently no registration requirements for foreign managed service providers.""
In 2020, the FCC designated Huawei and ZTE as national security threats to communications networks - a declaration that barred U.S. firms from tapping an $8.3 billion government fund to purchase equipment from the companies.

Last month, the FCC said it would open starting Oct. 29 a $1.9 billion program to reimburse mostly rural U.S. telecom carriers for removing network equipment made by Chinese companies like Huawei and ZTE.
In March, the FCC designated five Chinese companies as posing a threat to national security under a 2019 law aimed at protecting U.S. communications networks -- Huawei, ZTE, Hytera Communications Corp, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co and Zhejiang Dahua Technology Co.

The unit, Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX), said it expects cost savings of $20 million in 2022 by preferring the Semglee injection.
Drugmakers such as Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), Sanofi and Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) have been under pressure to make their insulin products more affordable amid heavy criticism from lawmakers and patients in a country with a diabetes problem.
One in 10 Americans, or 34 million people, have diabetes, and researchers have found significant increases in the disease among both sexes and across racial and ethnic groups. 
Semglee won U.S. approval in July as a biosimilar that can be used instead of Lantus without a physician's intervention.
Sales of Lantus, once Sanofi's top insulin product, have declined since its U.S. patent expired in 2015. 

Biosimilars, cheaper copies of high-priced drugs, can help reduce costs, both through direct savings and competition that encourages lower prices, Express Scripts said. 
Pharmacy benefit managers such as Express Scripts and CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) help health insurers negotiate better prices from drugmakers and also draw up ""formularies"", or lists of drugs reimbursed by the insurers they work for.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said Facebook had deliberately failed to comply with its order, and the penalty served as a warning that no company was above the law.
Facebook has increasingly come under fire from regulators and lawmakers about its business practices. 
It said it strongly disagreed with the CMA. 
The regulator said Facebook had failed to provide full updates about its compliance with requirements to continue to compete with Giphy and not integrate its operations with Giphy's while its investigation was ongoing.
Facebook had not provided the required information, despite multiple warnings, the CMA said, and it considered its failure to comply deliberate. 
""We warned Facebook that its refusal to provide us with important information was a breach of the order but, even after losing its appeal in two separate courts, Facebook continued to disregard its legal obligations,"" said Joel Bamford, senior director of mergers at the CMA.
""This should serve as a warning to any company that thinks it is above the law.""
Bamford's words echo those of U.S. Solicitor of Labor Seema Nanda on Tuesday after Facebook agreed to pay up to $14.25 million to settle civil claims over its adherence to recruitment rules.
A media report on Wednesday said Facebook was planning to rebrand, a change that would likely see a parent company overseeing its brands.
Responding to the CMA fine, Facebook said: ""We strongly disagree with the CMA's unfair decision to punish Facebook for a best effort compliance approach, which the CMA itself ultimately approved. 

""We will review the CMA's decision and consider our options.""

Investing.com – United Airlines stock (NASDAQ:UAL) traded 2.2% higher in Wednesday’s premarket as the carrier reported a narrower loss with the CEO Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) saying “the headwinds we’ve faced are turning to tailwinds”.
According to Reuters, United expects revenue in the current quarter to recover to up to 75% of 2019. The airline’s total operating revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019 was $10.88 billion.
The airline said premium leisure travel is making a comeback and with the most profitable transatlantic route opening up, more planes will fly internationally. Reaching pre-pandemic levels on those routes will take time, though: fourth-quarter capacity is seen down around 23% compared to the same period in 2019.
For comparison, United aims to make 3,500 domestic flights daily in December, representing 91% of its domestic capacity compared to 2019.
Airlines have been the worst hit in the pandemic for some obvious and other not-so-obvious reasons as travel restrictions, testing requirements and their patchy and ad-hoc implementation in various countries have kept passengers away and hurt travel and business plans.
The emergence of the Delta variant in the third quarter made matters worse, slowing an incipient recovery in domestic travel. 
Total operating revenue during July-September was $7.75 billion, more than three times a year ago but still 32% off the same quarter in 2019. Nonetheless, it topped estimates. Adjusted loss narrowed to $329 million from $2.37 billion in the September quarter of last year.

The Boise, Idaho-based company is the only American firm that makes both key types of memory chips, competing against South Korea's Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd and SK Hynix and Japan's Kioxia, Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY)'s former memory chip unit.
Micron has pilot manufacturing lines for developing new technologies at its Idaho headquarters and a factory in Virginia that turns out special high-reliability chips for automobiles. But its most advanced memory chips, which go into devices including PCs, phones and data centers, are made in Taiwan, Japan and Singapore. 
Sumit Sadana, Micron's chief business officer, told Reuters memory chips are about 30% of the global semiconductor market but only 2% are made in the United States.
""We certainly want to very seriously assess manufacturing in the U.S., because the U.S. ought to have more than 2% of memory manufacturing for the sake of national security and for the sake of supply chain resiliency,"" Sadana said in an interview.
Sadana said the company has not settled on a country for its next factory for advanced chips. The factories will require tools such as ASML Holdings' extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines, which can cost more than $100 million each. 
Micron plans to spend up to $12 billion in capital expenditure and $3 billion on research and development next year, Sadana said, and up to $150 billion over the next decade.
Micron estimates costs for memory manufacturing are 45% higher in the United States than in Asia, Sadana said. 

He said Micron's decision will depend on whether U.S. subsidies for buildings factories and investment tax credits for expensive tools - both of which are being debated in the U.S. Congress - are put in place.
""We need these policies to be stable and bipartisan in nature,"" he said.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A labour dispute at Germany's public-sector banks deepened on Wednesday after a third round of talks failed to reach agreement, with inflation fears prompting unions to stand firm over demands for higher wages. 
The impasse, which affects about 60,000 workers at Germany's Landesbanken and development banks such as KfW, mirrors stalled wage talks for employees of private banks such as  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
Germany has more banks per capita than most of its neighbours and other industrialised economies. That makes for stiff competition and low profits, and has resulted in efforts to cut costs and reduce headcount.
Workers at public-sector banks have staged warning strikes to underscore union demands for a 4.5% wage increase and rights for working outside the office. 
Jan Duscheck, an official overseeing negotiations for the Verdi labour union, said he was disappointed with the outcome of the latest round of talks. 
""There was no concrete offer for salaries, nor did we seriously enter negotiations on the issue of mobile working,"" he told Reuters.
Annual inflation in Germany was 4.1% in September, highlighting growing price pressures as Europe's largest economy recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic and its companies face with supply shortages.
Oliver Popp, spokesperson for the DBV union, said inflation concerns were playing a big role in the union demands. 
""The normal bank employee isn't super rich,"" Popp said. 
""Salaries are just enough to get by"" and energy prices are ""crazy"", he said.
Negotiators for bank management said they hoped to secure an agreement at the next round of talks scheduled for November.
Last week, union officials called off planned wage talks with private banks after they said management counter-offers were unsatisfactory. Unions want 4.5% increases for the 140,000 private-bank employees represented in the talks.

Earlier this year, employees at Deutsche Bank call centres, some of whom were paid 12 euros ($13.95) an hour, went on strike for higher wages and eventually reached a pay deal after a months-long dispute.

1606,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 20, 2021 05:57AM ET</span>",Netflix Slips as Higher Costs Await Amid Ramp Up in Originals,"By Dhirendra Tripathi
Investing.com – Netflix stock (NASDAQ:NFLX) traded 2% lower in Wednesday’s premarket as the streaming giant only just met sales expectations in the third quarter and warned of a heavy investment schedule ahead.
Margins in the current quarter will be less than half of the same period last year, the company said, as a big content release schedule results in higher amortization costs.
The company estimates free cash flow to be negative in the current quarter as it ramps up production and launches more originals. The company went slow on originals last year as shoots came to a halt during the pandemic, although the company’s cash registers still rang as people stayed home and binged on streaming.
The forecast for negative cash flow comes despite the company growing its subscriber base faster than expected. Netflix added 4.38 million net new subscriptions to close the quarter with 214 million paying users. Analysts had projected 3.86 million additions, according to Refinitiv data.
Netflix said a ""mind-boggling"" 142 million households had watched 'Squid Game', the Korean drama series that has become its most successful show ever in barely a month since its release. 
However, the market expected more. Those looking for early monetization of the company’s foray into games were disappointed. The company said games will be included in members’ subscriptions and will not have advertisements or in-app purchases, so “game play is purely focused on enjoyment versus monetization.”
The company said its paid memberships in U.S., Canada – its biggest markets – and Latin America – grew more slowly. For the second consecutive quarter, Asia Pacific was Netflix’s largest contributor to membership growth with half of total paid net adds. Typically, average revenue per user outside the US, Canada and Europe tends to be lower for companies though Netflix doesn’t provide region-wise ARPU details.
Revenue in the third quarter grew around 16% to $7.48 billion. Adjusted profit per share of $3.19 was higher than estimates.

It beat third-quarter profit forecasts after market close on Tuesday and announced it would make a strategic exit from Denmark and Finland. [L1N2RF1S1]
However, investors were unimpressed and analysts pointed to the lack of progress in cost cutting. 
Underlying expenses, which worried investors in recent years, were up 3% in the first nine months of this year. 
Handelsbanken shares were down 3.2% at 0949 GMT.
It said its target of reaching an annual cost base of 20 billion Swedish crowns had lost its relevance due to higher development costs and its exit from Denmark and Finland.
""We are putting more and more in cloud-based solutions, that changes the playing field a bit,"" CEO Carina Akerstrom told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday.

The bank did not provide a new cost target.

Citibank said in a note that underlying costs ""continued to disappoint"" and said that it saw no visible improvement in personnel costs. 
Handelsbanken reported a third-quarter net profit of 5.19 billion Swedish crowns ($602 million), up from 3.32 billion a year earlier and beating the 4.65 billion expected by analysts, Refinitiv data showed.

The bank on Oct. 7 admitted three criminal charges of not adequately monitoring customer accounts between 2012 and 2016, the first time a bank in Britain acknowledged it committed a criminal offence of this kind.
""There are questions which remain to be answered, most notably why it has taken five years after the police raid in 2016 to bring this case to a successful conclusion,"" Mel Stride, chair of the cross-party Treasury Select Committee, said in a letter to the FCA published on Wednesday.
""We’ve received the letter and will be responding shortly,"" a spokesperson for the FCA said.
Stride said the committee is also looking into why no individual NatWest staff were prosecuted.
The FCA in the case alleged NatWest had failed to monitor suspect activity by a client that deposited about 365 million pounds in its accounts over five years, of which 264 million was in cash.
NatWest could face a potential penalty https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/natwest-pleads-guilty-money-laundering-offences-2021-10-07 of around 340 million pounds under sentencing guidelines, although a judge will set the level of any fine later this year.

LONDON (Reuters) -Swedish private equity firm EQT (NYSE:EQT) is looking to raise 4 billion euros ($4.6 billion) for a fund aiming to create a positive environmental and social impact at its portfolio companies through longer-term investments.
The fund, EQT Future, will invest in ""mature companies with market-shaping impact potential"" through safeguarding the planet's resources and climate, increasing mental and physical health, and creating equality of opportunity, it said.
Up to 20% of the carried interest - a measure of the fund's profits - will be tied to the portfolio hitting impact-related targets including reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing gender diversity within the companies' top 20% of earners, EQT said.
Chief Executive Christian Sinding told Reuters the launch was ""an important strategic step"". 
While a typical private equity fund would hold an investment for three to five years over a 10-year life of the fund, EQT Future would hold positions for seven to eight years over the maximum 15-year life of the fund.
""It means you can think a bit differently about the types of transformation you can actually drive. We'd actually like to find industries and companies where, if we spend that time ... we can impact that whole industry, not just the company,"" Sinding said.
The fund would target companies in Europe and North America worth at least 400 million euros in sectors including the green, health and education technology sectors, health diagnostics, financial inclusion and decarbonisation, Sinding said.
Also on Wednesday, EQT updated the market on its third-quarter performance, with total assets under management of 70.3 billion euros and investments during the period of 7.7 billion euros.
Commenting on the results, Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analysts said in a note that fundraising in the quarter had been ""quieter"", but the launch of EQT Future and plans for a buyout fund, EQT X, would likely see that ""ramp back up"". 
EQT Future's investment team of 10 will be led by EQT Partner Anders Misund, with fellow partner Andreas Aschenbrenner as deputy head. 
It will be supported by a board of advisers led by the former boss of Unilever (NYSE:UL) and U.N. Sustainability Ambassador Paul Polman, and Jacob Wallenberg, chair of EQT's biggest shareholder Investor AB and vice-chair of ABB.
Investor demand for funds with a focus on fighting climate change and boosting efforts at diversity and other social goals is gathering pace.
In July, U.S. General Atlantic said it was launching a new venture entitled BeyondNetZero https://www.generalatlantic.com/media-article/general-atlantic-forms-beyondnetzero-to-invest-in-growth-companies-delivering-innovative-climate-solutions that would target growth equity investments related to climate change.

(Reuters) -Roche raised its 2021 sales forecast on Wednesday after demand for COVID-19 tests and medicines was boosted by the highly contagious Delta variant and the wider business performed well, helping the Swiss drugmaker beat revenue expectations. 
The company now predicts overall 2021 sales will grow in the mid-single digit range at constant exchange rates, having previously expected them to rise in the low to mid-single digit percentage range.
""The demand for coronavirus tests remained high in the third quarter due to the Delta variant,"" Chief Executive Severin Schwan said.
Roche in July had flagged an expected slowdown in demand for the tests in the second half of the year, but management was more confident this time. 
""(COVID-19) testing is likely to continue into the fourth quarter, and likely into next year. The question is the level of testing,"" said Thomas Schinecker, head of Roche's diagnostics business. 
That would depend on several factors, including the pace of vaccination, Schinecker added on a media call. 
Group sales in the three months to September rose 8% to 15.97 billion Swiss francs ($17.29 billion), the company said, as diagnostics division revenues jumped 18%.
Analysts on average were expecting sales of 15.48 billion francs, according to Jefferies (NYSE:JEF). 
""The quality of the beat is somewhat worse than we wished for - key growth drivers underperformed,"" Vontobel analysts said in a note, adding that the beat comes from Actemra, which profits from the pandemic, and a slower erosion of key oncology drugs. 
Shares in the company were down 0.3% by 0848 GMT, compared to a near 1% rise in the wider European pharmaceuticals index.
Roche, whose medicines RoActemra/Actemra and Ronapreve have been critical to COVID-19 treatment in several countries, said supply of biological ingredients for those drugs was improving after the situation had been tight. 
There have also been signs of recovery in the pharmaceuticals unit since the summer, the company said, after the pandemic hurt sales. 
A plethora of new launches, including an Alzheimer's treatment if approved by U.S. authorities, are expected to bolster future sales at Roche as it faces increasing competition for older drugs. 
Final data from a study of its experimental COVID-19 antiviral pill, which Roche is working on with Atea, will be submitted to a peer-reviewed publication and the partners will continue to analyse data, the company said.

The pill had failed to help patients with mild and moderate COVID-19 in a small study of mostly low-risk patients, delivering a major setback to the firms.

1615,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2021 04:45AM ET</span>",Unilever margins in spotlight as inflation surges,"By Siddharth Cavale
(Reuters) - Unilever (NYSE:UL)'s battle with rising costs will take centre stage at its third-quarter results on Thursday, with investors focused on whether the consumer goods giant will cut its profit margin forecast for the second time this year. 
Crude oil prices hit three-year highs on Monday, vegetable oil prices are at multi-year highs, and packaging, transport and labour costs are also rising as economies recover from the pandemic - a headache for central bankers and companies alike. 
Tide detergent maker Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) (P&G) on Tuesday hiked its full-year forecast for commodity and freight costs by about $400 million, or more than 20%.
Analysts warn Unilever could be particularly exposed because, unlike household goods specialist P&G, it also has a big food business selling products including Knorr soups, Magnum ice-cream and Hellmann's mayonnaise. 
That means exposure to edible oils, milk and crude derivatives, such as caustic soda (used in making ice-cream), whose prices have also surged over the past three months. 
Unilever also makes about 60% of its turnover in emerging markets, where inflation is fiercest.
""Since the second quarter, inflation has continued to creep up and another (margin) revision is possible,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Warren Ackerman wrote in a note. 
In July, Unilever cut its operating margin forecast to ""about flat"" from ""slightly up."" 
In contrast, packaged food rival Nestle kept its full-year operating margin guidance on Wednesday, helped by strong coffee sales and price hikes.
Analysts expect Unilever to report a 0.2 percentage point drop in full-year underlying operating margins, according to a company-supplied consensus. That margin was 18.5% in 2020. 
Unilever has tried to offset costs by raising average prices by 2.2%, but Ackerman said that was hard in places like South East Asia where pandemic-hit consumers are switching to cheaper brands and local competition is tough.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Cazenove analysts estimate Unilever may need to raise prices by as much as 13% over the next two years to offset raw material and packaging pressures, which they say could reach 16% this year, at constant currencies and including hedging. 
Packaging (NYSE:PKG) and raw materials represent about 70% of Unilever's total annual cost of goods of about 23 billion euros ($26.7 billion). A 15% increase translates to about 3.5 billion euros in additional costs. 
Despite the pressures, Unilever said in July it was confident of delivering full-year underlying sales growth within its mid-term target range of 3-5%.
Some analysts are less bullish, though, saying recent lockdowns in Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand will have curbed spending. Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) cut its third-quarter underlying sales growth forecast to 2.1% from 3.7%. Analysts on average expect a 2.2% rise.
There are other potential catalysts for Unilever's shares, as it works to sell a big part of its 2 billion euro tea business and is also reportedly https://www.ft.com/content/77ee6bd4-95e4-4d63-88f3-994049058291 in the sights of a top activist investor. 
But for now, the attention is on whether it can transfer rising costs onto customers. 

""The shares have been weak, suggesting the market does not think Unilever can pass them all on and that therefore the margin is at risk,"" said Tineke Frikkee, head of UK Equity research at Unilever shareholder Waverton Investment Management.

1618,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2021 03:26AM ET</span>","Exclusive - Germany may miss COVID-19 vaccine donation goal, blames manufacturers","BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany may miss its target to donate 100 million COVID-19 vaccine doses this year due to conditions imposed by manufacturers and delivery shortfalls, a health ministry official said in a letter to Brussels seen by Reuters. 
The 100 million doses account for half the total promised by European Union member states to poorer countries this year, according to the European Commission.
The German foreign office said on Oct. 19 that Germany had only donated just over 17% of that amount.
In a letter on Monday to the European Commission's Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA), health ministry state secretary Thomas Steffen said there were ""ongoing bureaucratic, logistical and legal problems"" imposed by vaccine makers on EU countries wanting to donate surplus shots.
Steffen said these factors made ""a quick response to international requests for help almost impossible.""
The letter is the strongest sign yet of the tensions between governments and drugmakers over donations.
The EU and rich countries, most of whose most vulnerable citizens have been vaccinated, are under pressure from the World Health Organization to deliver more doses to poorer nations, many of which have inoculated only a fraction of their people.
""With vaccine surpluses in many member states increasing at present, we will soon be facing a situation of global allocation emergency,"" Steffen wrote. ""Some countries could be forced to waste large volumes of valuable vaccines urgently needed in other parts of the world.""
He said obstacles included minimum sales prices, onerous compensation payments required of recipient countries and restrictions on distributing to international organisations.
Changes in expected delivery volumes and expiration dates of vaccine doses also made planning more difficult, he added.
Steffen said AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) could together only deliver up to 50 million doses of their COVID-19 vaccines this year, meaning Germany would also have to donate Pfizer/BioNTech and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) shots that are the mainstays of its vaccination drive.
In response, Johnson & Johnson said it would help countries with surplus doses to donate them to other countries, especially using the international COVAX facility, as long as the countries met safety, legal, regulatory and logistical requirements.
AstraZeneca said it was supporting donations in addition to regular supply agreements with individual countries and COVAX, and said it had helped with about 85% of all donations in Germany so far.
""The donation of vaccines is a complex administrative process with long lead times that are outside vaccine manufacturers' control,"" it added.
Other manufacturers could not immediately be reached for comment.

EU countries have mostly promised to donate AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. Many have restricted the use of these vaccines due to very rare cases of blood clotting.
Any shortfall in donations is likely to heighten criticism of richer nations, which are rolling out boosters and inoculating teenagers considered a low-risk from COVID-19, while the pandemic rages elsewhere.

OSLO (Reuters) -Norwegian robotics firm AutoStore said on Wednesday it had priced its initial public offering (IPO) at 31 Norwegian crowns per share, the top of its target range, valuing the company at 103.5 billion crowns ($12.4 billion).
SoftBank-backed AutoStore will be Norway's most valuable new listing for two decades when it goes public on Euronext's Oslo Stock Exchange later on Wednesday.
The company raised 2.7 billion crowns in cash from the issue of new shares, while existing owners such as Thomas H. Lee Partners, EQT (NYSE:EQT) and others sold stock worth 15.3 billion crowns.
Its share traded up 8.1% to 33.5 crowns at 0712 GMT, a few minutes after trading started on the Oslo bourse.
""The money we get from the IPO will be used primarily to deleverage the debt to a level that is more normal for a public company,"" CEO Karl Johan Lier told Reuters.
He plans to bring down the leverage ratio to around 2.5 from the current ratio of between 5 and 6.
Following the IPO, the free float of AutoStore shares will amount to about 17.4% of the overall equity.
Founded in 1996, AutoStore has 20,000 robots deployed across more than 35 countries to automate warehouses. The company, whose customers include ASDA, Gucci and Lufthansa, uses robots to store and retrieve products, allowing customers to store four times the inventory in the same space.
In April, Japan's SoftBank bought https://www.reuters.com/article/us-softbank-group-autostore-idUSKBN2BS1YC a 40% stake in the Norwegian company for $2.8 billion, valuing AutoStore at about $7 billion at the time. SoftBank did not sell stock in the IPO.
""SoftBank is a very good partner, ready to help us drive more attention in the APAC region ... they have a large network of companies that can potentially be AutoStore customers so we see a lot of potential with the relationship,"" Lier said.
AutoStore is Norway's most valuable new listing since the 2001 debut of  Statoil  (OL:EQNR), now known as Equinor, which was valued at 151 billion crowns at the time of its IPO.
Four cornerstone investors, Alecta Pensionsforsakring, FIL Investments, Mawer Investment Management and WCM Investment Management, had each committed to invest $200 million ahead of the IPO.
AutoStore reported net revenue of $182.1 million last year and expects revenue of about $300 million in 2021, rising to more than $500 million in 2022 with a project pipeline worth $3.4 billion across 2,000 projects.

Bankers from Carnegie, J.P Morgan,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), ABG Sundal Collier,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Jefferies (NYSE:JEF), Mizuho, SpareBank 1 Markets and Moelis (NYSE:MC) were involved in the deal.

1620,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2021 03:11AM ET</span>",Marketmind: Margin pressures,"LONDON (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead from Sujata Rao.
Margin pressures for companies and higher prices for shoppers: That’s the message so far from the earnings season.
Just a few examples -- Proctor & Gamble expects a $2.3 billion hit to expenses this fiscal year, compared with the previously expected $1.9 billion. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), according to a Bloomberg report, may produce 10 million fewer iPhone 13 units, Danone predicts costs to be at least 8% higher, driven by shipping expenses and shortages of plastic and cardboard packaging. Still there is no sign that optimism over earnings has been dented -- the S&P 500 index finished Tuesday just 0.4% below its early September record close.
The conclusion perhaps is that companies will be able to pass on higher costs to consumers to protect their bottom lines and indeed, Nestle on Wednesday said price hikes of 2.1% in the third quarter had helped mitigate cost price inflation.
What follows is that consumers will face those higher costs, especially with oil prices close to multi-year highs. The question then is how much central bankers feel the need to react to mounting inflationary pressures.
However, there was some good news for the Bank of England on the inflation front, with price growth slowing unexpectedly in September – it came in at 3.1% compared to 3.2% in August. That may not, however, deter the BoE from raising interest rates in the coming months, with money markets pricing a cumulative 35 basis points of tightening by year-end.
Meanwhile some of the rate hike bets priced for the U.S. Federal Reserve for next year have been pared back following weaker than-expected housing data. That’s taken some of the heat out of short-end Treasuries and instead allowed 10-year yields to rise to four-month highs of around 1.65%. And the gap between 2-year and 10-year yields – the so-called yield curve – has subsequently widened back to around 125 basis points – 10 bps steeper than a week ago.
Still, all the uncertainty on inflation and economic growth means the mood is sombre on stock markets this morning.
While Asian markets rallied, futures for Wall Street are pointing south and European bourses opening lower.
Investors might cheer up after Wednesday’s set of U.S. earnings, with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) especially in focus to see if it can retain its resilience to chip shortages and the Chinese growth slowdown.

And Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) could be in for gains, having said on Tuesday The Squid Game show had helped it add 4.38 million subscribers from July through September to reach a worldwide total of 213.6 million. In Europe, a a global semiconductor shortage helped ASML to beat Q3 forecasts.
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Wednesday: -China's new home prices stall for first time since COVID-19-UK inflation dip unlikely to deter Bank of England from rate hike-German PPI-Final Euro zone HICP-U.S. 20 year bond auction-Fed speakers: St. Louis President James Bullard; Atlanta President Raphael Bostic; Chicago President Charles Evans, regulation head Randall Quarles-Norway Central Bank Governor Oystein Olsen-European earnings: Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY), Reckitt Benckiser, ASML, Akso Nebel, Handelsbank, Bankinter, SEB, -U.S. earnings: Abbott, Verizon (NYSE:VZ), Nasdaq,  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS), Tesla,  IBM  (NYSE:IBM)

LONDON (Reuters) -Nearly half of the 100 biggest companies listed on Britain's FTSE Index have no net-zero target at all and just 23 have a scientifically approved plan, according to ESG investment research and asset manager Arabesque.
Britain wants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the economy to net-zero by 2050 while Prime Minister Boris Johnson has expressed enthusiasm for leading a green revolution to force Western economies to kick their addiction to fossil fuels.
Arabesque research found that 45 companies on the FTSE-100 Index had no net zero target. Just 23 companies had set net zero targets meeting the standards of the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), which defines best practice in such targets.
The research found that 28 FTSE companies are on course to contribute to a global temperature rise of 2.7 degrees Celsius or above by 2050. Scientists believe such a rise would lead to a worst-case climate scenario.
The results of the research are a potential embarrassment for the British government just days before it hosts a major climate summit, known as COP26, in Glasgow, Scotland. 
""These findings show a wide gulf between where the FTSE 100 stands today, and where it needs to be to deliver on the UK’s net zero target,"" Daniel Klier, president of Arabesque, said.
""Most of the UK’s biggest firms are not on a path to reach net zero by 2050 and we will need to see a significant change in business models and capital allocation.""
Among the best performing 20 British FTSE-100 companies on climate were AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN), British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI), Burberry, Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY) and Unilever (NYSE:UL), Arabesque said. The worst performing companies, according to Arabesque, were miners and energy companies. 
Klier said Britain’s top firms were performing worse on climate than comparative companies in the United States, Japan, Germany and France. 

""The performance of our biggest businesses will be one of our greatest challenges to achieving net zero, but also, where one of our biggest opportunities to reduce emissions will lie,"" Klier said.
""The time for commitments is now passing, however, and 2022 must be a year of action.""

1623,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2021 01:57AM ET</span>",'They'll have to pay': Malaysia chip crunch triggers new era in supply deals,"By Liz Lee
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysian electronics firms central to the supply of basic chips that drive the world's cars, smartphones and home devices say big-name customers are beating on their doors to lock in take-or-pay, longer-term deals - and happy to pay more if need be.
Manufacturers are rushing to replenish chip stocks depleted during coronavirus pandemic factory curbs - not least automakers who earlier cancelled orders expecting poor demand. That chip shortage has slammed their output, and still dislocates supply chains, just as consumer demand ramps up along with a global easing of COVID restrictions in everyday life.
At factories in Malaysia, operators like chip packaging firm Unisem say that drive is leading buyers that sell chips on to auto and electronics manufacturers to become willing to sign up for big price hikes, some even asking for as many assembled chips as plants can produce - whatever the cost.
But Malaysia's chip assembly industry, accounting for more than a tenth of a global trade worth over $20 billion, warns that shortages - exacerbated by years of under-investment in basic chip production, while high-end semiconductors were favoured - will last at least two years.
Firms must marry the need to ramp up production with the imperative to avoid COVID-19 infections in factories that could trigger complete shutdowns.
""The shortage is very real,"" said John Chia, chairman of Unisem. ""For CEOs (of our clients) to escalate their issues to me directly shows that this is a serious matter ... now they want to talk to me directly,"" he told Reuters.
Chia declined to provide names of clients requesting as much supply as they can get their hands on. Unisem's customers include suppliers to global carmakers and electronics firms like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).
He said demand is so robust that its Chengdu plant in China is booked out for the whole of next year - and it will take months for it to clear backlogs for some automotive components.
Pre-pandemic, the world's outsourced chip assembly and test industry was estimated worth around $23 billion and it is seen growing to $30 billion in 2022, according to market research firm Yole Development.
Taiwan is the biggest service provider with more than 50% of market share, followed by China, the United States and then Malaysia. The latter is home to suppliers and factories serving chipmakers such as STMicroelectronics and Infineon (OTC:IFNNY), and carmakers including  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and General Motors (NYSE:GM). 
Wong Siew Hai, President at the Malaysia Semiconductor Industry Association, warns the shortage is likely to last for years. Some customers are ordering more than they need to lock in supplies, Wong said, while long-term contracts that range from one to three years have now become a new industry norm.
""For the capacity to match demand, (it will take) at least two to three years from now,"" Wong told Reuters.
OUTBREAK MEANS SHUTDOWN
Companies like Unisem have been ramping up. But Unisem, with a market value of about $1.6 billion, is still operating just 80% of its capacity, to reduce a risk of mass infections on its factory floor that could lead to an entire plant shutdown. 
While 98% of its staff are now fully vaccinated, it has been forced to temporarily shut down its Ipoh plant, in northwestern Malaysia, twice since June due to an outbreak in the factory and a national lockdown order. Several automakers and semiconductor companies have said pandemic-related disruption in Malaysia has hit supply chains.
GM's CEO Mary Barra explained earlier this month https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/general-motors-mary-barra-wall-street to Fox Business that, ""We were hit maybe harder than most because some of the specific facilities in Malaysia were heavily impacted by COVID."" 
For a graphic on Malaysia semiconductor output & exports:
https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/znpnezkydvl/MalaysiaSemiconductors.png 
The gradual ramp-up at Unisem matches that of many of its peers. 
Despite surging orders, Globetronics Technology, which makes optical sensors, light-emitting diodes and integrated circuits for the likes of Apple, Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) and German carmakers, says it's running 90% of its factory capacity - and is also worried about rising costs.
""We've had to stay adaptable and mindful of workers' wellbeing during the lockdowns, including offering various types of incentives like cash to keep employees motivated and productivity high,"" Heng Charng Yee, vice president of business and operations, told Reuters.
The Malaysian government's stringent workplace rules, requiring frequent swab tests and limits on staff numbers, for example, have also added cost pressure, she said.
'THEY'LL HAVE TO PAY'
Investors and analysts say the shortage is also the fruit of under-investment in technology to make older-generation chips that can cost less than $1, widely used in auto industry, as heavyweights such as Samsung (KS:005930) and TSMC ploughed billions into developing more powerful, high-end chips.
""We always think of these back-end semiconductors as low-margin business. But they suddenly have additional 5-10% pricing power,"" said Patrick Chang, ASEAN regional Chief Investment Officer Equities at Principal Asset Management Bhd.
Amid such demand, Unisem is pushing ahead with expansion at its plants in Malaysia and China - which will only come on stream 12-15 months down the line.

""We are cautious,"" said chairman Chia. ""We have been hit blue and black before, remember the dotcom days?""
""We tell them (customers) now to at least sign up for 70% of their forecast (volume). If they don't give me that full amount, they will still have to pay.""

The new facility will make DRAM chips, which are widely used in data centres, with production set to begin in 2024, the report said, without citing sources.
Micron officials in Japan were not immediately available to comment.
COVID-19 pandemic stay-at-home demand for electronic devices is causing shortages of non-memory chips that has forced some manufacturers, such as automakers and smartphone makers, to curtail production. That has also reduced sales of DRAM memory chips, but some industry watchers expect demand to rebound helped by an expansion of data centres. 
The report comes after chip giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.(TSMC) announced plans last week to build a plant in Japan, that media reports said may be partly paid for by the Japanese government.
Japan wants to lure chipmakers to the country to ensure its companies have ready access to supplies of semiconductors necessary to keep its economy competitive.

Micron, which also produces slower, but cheaper, NAND memory chips for the data storage market, makes 300 millimetre DRAM semiconductors at its plant in Hiroshima and has a research and development facility there.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden plans to nominate the No. 2 auto safety official to head the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the White House confirmed on Tuesday.
Steven Cliff, who has been deputy administrator since February, has been a key figure in the Biden administration's proposed rewrite of fuel economy standards through 2026.
He is also overseeing the department's safety probe of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and investigation of whether 30 million vehicles produced by nearly https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-autos-safety-idCAKBN2GF0JOtwo dozen automakers have unsafe air bags.
Reuters first reported Cliff's planned nomination earlier on Tuesday.
NHTSA later confirmed a Reuters report that Duke University engineering and computer science professor Missy Cummings is being named a new senior adviser for safety at NHTSA, saying in a statement it looks forward ""to leveraging her experience and leadership in safety and autonomous technologies.""
The agency added Cummings was being named for a ""temporary assignment"" under the Intergovernmental Personnel Act Mobility Program. Cummings has previously expressed concerns about Tesla's Autopilot feature.
Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk responded to her hiring on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) by writing: ""Objectively, her track record is extremely biased against Tesla.""
She responded to Musk on Twitter saying: ""happy to sit down and talk with you anytime.""
NHTSA, which is part of the U.S. Transportation Department, faces a backlog of pending auto safety regulations and has not had a Senate-confirmed administrator since January 2017. There has not even been a nominee for https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-emissions-usa-idUSKCN1V21VG NHTSA's top job since 2019.
NHTSA in August proposed dramatically revising the Trump administration's rollback of Corporate Average Fuel Economy rules, proposing increasing fuel efficiency by 8% annually for the 2024-2026 model years.
Cliff, a former deputy executive officer at the California Air Resources Board, said the proposal reduces ""climate pollution by approximately the same amount as if we took more than 5 million of today’s vehicles off the road.""
Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States has seen a sustained increase in traffic deaths that NHTSA has ascribed to impaired driving, speeding, a failure to wear seatbelts and other unsafe behavior.
NHTSA last month estimated 8,730 people https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-traffic-deaths-jump-105-early-2021-2021-09-02 died in vehicle crashes in the first three months of 2021, compared with 7,900 deaths during the same period last year - up 10.5% despite a 2.1% drop in miles driven.
Last month, NHTSA asked Tesla https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-nhtsa-asks-tesla-why-it-did-not-recall-autopilot-system-ap-2021-10-13 why it has not issued a recall to address software updates made to its Autopilot driver-assistance system.
NHTSA in August opened a formal safety probe into Tesla's Autopilot system in 765,000 U.S. vehicles after a series of crashes involving Tesla models and emergency vehicles.

In June, it issued an order requiring automakers and operators of vehicles equipped with advanced driver assistance or automated driving systems to immediately report crashes.
Cummings in a 2018 interview https://blog.ucsusa.org/jeremy-martin/when-will-autonomous-vehicles-be-safe-enough-an-interview-with-professor-missy-cummings said the United States needs ""an entirely new regulatory framework where an agency like NHTSA would oversee"" autonomous vehicles, adding the agency ""does have the authority to mandate testing and other interventions, but they’re not doing it.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia plans to allow companies to ditch physical shareholder meetings and move to gatherings that are completely online, making rules introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic permanent. 
A bill, which has been criticised by shareholder groups, was introduced in parliament on Wednesday.
Under the new rules, companies will be able to hold online meetings if the company's constitution expressly permits it ""provided that members, as a whole, are given reasonable opportunity to participate"", Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said in a statement. 
In recent months, some companies have sought to amend their constitutions to allow such a move. A resolution by pallet maker Brambles, however, was withdrawn by the company after receiving little support from shareholders.
Rachel Waterhouse, chief executive of the Australian Shareholders Association said the group was disappointed with the government's decision because online-only meetings can limit investors' ability to hold executives to account.
""This allows executives and directors to avoid transparency and answering questions, potentially leaving retail shareholders uninformed about the true performance of the company and frustrated about directors impacting their oversight,"" she said.
The shareholder group believes hybrid meetings should be the norm instead because they achieve greater transparency, shareholder engagement and participation.

The proposed laws will also permit annual reports or website links to them and other information to be emailed rather than printed and physically mailed to shareholders.
The temporary measures were introduced in May 2020 as part of the government's response to the coronavirus crisis and were later extended until March 31, 2022. If passed, the laws will be reviewed in two years to ensure that they are operating as intended, Frydenberg added.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's biggest hot pot chain Haidilao is slowing its rollout of new restaurants and increasing diversification of its fare, tempering its rapid expansion during the coronavirus pandemic to cope with a subsequent slump in consumer spending. 
Haidilao, which became so popular in recent years that it appeased customers in hours-long queues for its soups by providing free manicures, snacks and shoe shines, is at the forefront of a reckoning in China's restaurant industry post-pandemic.
The chain has seen falling table turnover rates and profits as consumers dine out less and new stores cannibalise business at older locations.
""We will open stores based on market demand, and compared to before, will appropriately slow down our opening pace,"" the company said in a written response to Reuters' questions about its strategy.
China's catering industry shrank 4.5% in August, before recovering for growth of 3.1% last month. Analysts said it will likely remain volatile for some time amid the country's broader patchy economic recovery. 
""This year, fresh waves of the epidemic happened repeatedly, and passenger flow in commercial areas is volatile, affecting the recovery of core business indicators,"" Tianfeng Securities wrote in a research note last month. 
Haidilao was initially undeterred by the pandemic, embarking on an expansion drive in early 2020 that has doubled its outlets since then to almost 1,600 currently. It did so by snapping up sites left behind by vacating weaker players, often helped by deep discounts offered by landlords.
But that expansion pushed Haidilao's table turnover rate down to 3.0 - or three sets of customers per day on average - in the first half of this year, from 4.8 in 2019.
Xiabu Xiabu, another Hong Kong-listed Chinese hot pot chain, has said it plans to shut 200 of its 1,010 stores after losing 50 million yuan ($7.76 million) in the first half of 2021. 
Haidilao's share price has fallen to around HK$30 from a record high of HK$86 in February. 
""The company will need to create demand going forward, which is more challenging than fulfilling demand,"" China Renaissance analysts wrote in an August note.
DELIVERY AND DRINKS
To turn its fortunes around, Haidilao has opened more than 10 outlets specialising in fast food such as noodles and dumplings, moving beyond the hot pot, the signature dish of southwestern Sichuan province where the company was founded 27 years ago.
However, with a maximum of just five stores each and an average spending per guest of 10 to 20 yuan - versus 107.3 yuan for the Haidilao restaurants - the sub-brands contributed just 0.5% to first-half revenue.
Haidilao last month closed a potato noodle restaurant less than a year after opening it in the central city of Zhengzhou, without publicly citing a reason.
In other diversification attempts, the company has opened bars in three of its Beijing restaurants and is promoting its delivery service, a unit where revenue initially rose during the pandemic. 
However, delivery revenue dropped from 409.6 million yuan, or 4.2% of total revenue, in the first half of 2020 to 345.7 yuan, or 1.7% of total revenue, in the first half of 2021.
""(Eating) hot pot has a strong social feature so people are less likely to order hot pot at home,"" said Zhu Danpeng, an independent food industry analyst.
Haidilao opened a store on  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA)'s marketplace Tmall several months ago to sell items including lipsticks inspired by its soup bases with names such as ""capsicum rouge"" and ""summer tomato"". 

Zhu said Haidilao's multi-brands strategy was the right move but the company did not have a lot of room for growth: ""Haidilao has reached a certain phase with its development, as a man has reached his middle age.""

1630,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2021 09:01PM ET</span>","Diapers to yogurt, global firms face higher costs amid supply-chain woes","(Reuters) - Results from companies Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) Co and Danone SA (OTC:DANOY) as well as phone maker Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) on Tuesday show higher costs and supply chain disruptions, signaling more margin pressure for global firms and higher prices for shoppers.
Panic-buying at the start of the pandemic led to mass shortages of everything from toilet paper to packaged foods. Global lockdowns and labor shortages crimped supply chain movement and caused lasting log-jams at ports from China to California. 
Many companies have leaned on price increases to offset higher prices for materials needed to make and ship essential necessities like diapers and bottled water. Executives and analysts have said price increases will linger into next year.
Procter & Gamble, which noted its first-quarter operating margins were squeezed, now expects a hit of about $2.3 billion in expenses this fiscal year, compared with a prior forecast of about $1.9 billion.
The company is blaming higher raw material costs as well as diesel and energy prices, and said it does not expect those issues to ease up anytime soon.
Danone, which sells Activa yogurt and Evian bottled water, warned of growing inflationary pressures next year after sticking by its 2021 outlook on Tuesday, pledging its operating margins will be protected by productivity gains and price increases.
""Like just about everyone across the sector and beyond, we see inflationary pressures across the board. What started as increased inflation on material costs evolved into widespread constraints impacting our supply chain in many parts of the world,"" said Danone's finance chief Juergen Esser.
Sweden's Ericsson told investors on Tuesday global supply chain issues will still be a major hurdle.
""Late in Q3 we experienced some impact on sales from disturbances in the supply chain, and such issues will continue to pose a risk,"" Chief Executive Officer Börje Ekholm said in a statement.
The company was not able to deliver certain hardware to its customers due to a chip shortage at suppliers, coupled with logistics problems, it said.
Electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc is due to report results on Wednesday. Investors are closely watching the car maker's margins. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has previously said the company is spending heavily to fly car parts around the world to meet demand, while at the same time working to cut costs at its factory in China by sourcing more local parts.

Some investors want to see how those costs add up.
""I think that there is probably a headwind to margins. They're paying more for components,"" said Gene Munster, managing partner at venture capital firm Loup Ventures, an investor in Tesla. ""I think that would be a huge positive if they can raise auto gross margin in this environment.""

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mexican telecommunications giant  America Movil  (NYSE:AMX) on Tuesday reported a 16% dip in third-quarter net profit compared to the year earlier period as the peso currency weakened versus the U.S. dollar, falling short of some analyst expectations. 
The company, which is controlled by the family of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, posted net profit of 15.8 billion pesos ($766 million), compared with 18.9 billion pesos a year earlier, in part due to the depreciation of the peso.
Net profit was below the estimates of Itau BBA for 21.3 billion pesos and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) for 23.48 billion pesos. 
Local bank Banorte, however, predicted a steeper drop to 12.03 billion pesos due to the foreign exchange losses. 
America Movil's revenue dipped to 253.4 billion pesos from 260.2 billion pesos during the year-ago quarter. That still beat the Refinitiv forecast of 244.32 billion pesos. 
EBITDA was 87.6 billion pesos, an increase of about 1% in nominal terms from a year ago.
""The EBITDA margin increased 1.3 percentage points to 34.6% and was our highest EBITDA margin in nine years,"" the company said in its filing with the Mexican stock exchange.
America Movil said it added 4.2 million wireless subscribers in the quarter, including 2.2 million postpaid customers. The company also reported 252,000 new broadband additions. 
Shareholders last month overwhelmingly approved the company's plan to spin off its towers business in Latin America. 
America Movil and Liberty Latin America announced in September they would combine Chilean operations to form a joint venture. The two companies also reached a deal in which America Movil would sell its Claro Panama unit to Cable & Wireless Panama, a unit of Liberty Latin America. 

Both deals excluded America Movil's telecoms towers in Chile and Panama.

1633,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2021 07:56PM ET</span>",Global 'Squid Game' mania lifts Netflix quarter,"By Lisa Richwine and Eva Mathews
(Reuters) -Netflix Inc's global sensation ""Squid Game"" helped lure more new customers than expected, the world's largest streaming service said on Tuesday as it predicted a packed lineup would further boost signups through the end of the year.
After a sharp slowdown in the first half of 2021, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) added 4.38 million subscribers from July through September to reach 213.6 million worldwide. Wall Street analysts had projected 3.86 million additions, according to Refinitiv data.
Netflix enjoyed a subscriber boom last year as COVID-19 kept audiences at home, but growth stalled early this year. At the same time, Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's Disney+, AT&T Inc (NYSE:T)'s HBO Max and other competitors bolstered their offerings. Netflix blamed the earlier weakness in part on a thin slate of new programming caused by production shutdowns from the pandemic. 
Then, South Korean drama ""Squid Game"" debuted on Sept. 17 and surprised executives by becoming the streaming service's most-watched original series in its first month. On Tuesday, Netflix said a ""mind-boggling"" 142 million households had watched the dark drama about people who compete in a deadly competition to erase financial debt. 
The series, made with a relatively small budget, shot to the top of Netflix viewing charts in 94 countries, kick-started sales of track suits and Vans sneakers, and kindled interest in learning Korean https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/netflix-hit-show-squid-game-spurs-interest-learning-korean-2021-10-11. ""Squid Game"" merchandise is now on its way to retailers, Netflix said. 
The fervor around ""Squid Game"" also is expected to lift the current quarter. Netflix projected it will pick up 8.5 million new customers by year's end, ahead of industry forecasts of 8.33 million, as it releases a heavy lineup of new programming. Upcoming debuts include big-budget action flick ""Red Notice"" and a second season of fantasy drama ""The Witcher."" 
It also expects a ""more normalized"" programming slate in 2022 spread throughout the year, ""assuming no new COVID waves or unforeseen events,"" the company said in a quarterly letter to shareholders.
Shares of Netflix were close to even in after-hours trading at $641 following the earnings report.
OVERSEAS GROWTH 
Most new customer pickups in the quarter came from the Asia Pacific market, where Netflix now has 30 million subscribers. Industry experts believe the region may rival the United States and Canada - Netflix's largest market - in three to five years, said Third Bridge senior analyst Joe McCormack.
Netflix is trying new ways to attract customers overseas, including offering a free plan in Kenya https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/exclusive-netflix-offers-free-plan-kenya-entice-new-subscribers-2021-09-20. It will take one to two years to tell if that tactic leads to more paying subscribers, the company said.
For the quarter that ended in September, diluted earnings-per-share came in at $3.19, beating analyst expectations of $2.57. Revenue rose 16% to $7.5 billion.
Before the earnings report, Netflix shares had risen roughly 22% this year and were trading near record highs, but their gains lag behind the 54% increase in the Nasdaq. 

Netflix, which keeps much of its viewership data secret, also said it will release information more frequently and shift its main publicly reported metric to hours viewed, rather than the number of accounts that watched a title for at least 2 minutes. The company noted that it competes with a large set of activities beyond TV including TikTok and Fortnite. When  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) suffered a global outage in early October, ""our engagement saw a 14% increase during this time period,"" Netflix said.
Executives did not address worker complaints about a Dave Chappelle comedy special, which the company has previously defended. Some employees say Chappelle made comments that harmful to transgender people, and they plan a walkout on Wednesday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate will hold an Oct. 26 hearing with tech firms Snap (NYSE:SNAP)'s Snapchat, TikTok, and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s YouTube about their platforms' impact on young users, a panel said on Tuesday.
""Recent revelations about harm to kids online show that Big Tech is facing its Big Tobacco moment — a moment of reckoning,"" said Senator Richard Blumenthal, who chairs the Senate Commerce consumer protection subcommittee holding the hearing.
""We need to understand the impact of popular platforms like Snapchat, TikTok, and YouTube on children and what companies can do better to keep them safe.""
Senator Marcia Blackburn, the top Republican on the subcommittee, said, ""TikTok, Snapchat, and YouTube all play a leading role in exposing children to harmful content.""
A Snap spokeswoman said the company looks forward to discussing their ""approach to protecting the safety, privacy and wellbeing of our Snapchat community."" TikTok and YouTube both confirmed they would take part.
Earlier this month, the panel held a hearing with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) whistleblower Frances Haugen, who turned over thousands of documents she said showed the company had failed to protect young users.
""The company's leadership knows how to make Facebook and Instagram safer, but won't make the necessary changes because they have put their astronomical profits before people. Congressional action is needed,"" Haugen said.

At the hearing, Blackburn accused Facebook of turning a blind eye to children below age 13 on its services. ""It is clear that Facebook prioritizes profit over the well-being of children and all users,"" she said.
Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg rejected the criticism. ""The argument that we deliberately push content that makes people angry for profit is deeply illogical,"" he wrote. Last month, Facebook said it was putting on hold a new version of its Instagram photo sharing app for kids.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Industrial conglomerate 3M Co on Tuesday said it had agreed to pay about $98.4 million to settle claims that it contaminated the Tennessee River with toxic chemicals.
3M agreed to resolve a lawsuit by environmental group Tennessee Riverkeeper and a separate class action by residents of Alabama's Morgan County. It also negotiated a private settlement with Morgan County, the city of Decatur, where 3M's local facility is based, and Decatur's utility provider.
The three agreements all involve 3M's manufacturing and disposal of polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, at its Decatur industrial site in Morgan County. 
The settlements come a day after the Environmental Protection Agency said it would set limits on PFAS, which scientists have associated with illnesses such as kidney cancer.
PFAS have been dubbed ""forever chemicals"" because they do not break down easily. They have been used for decades in household products such as non-stick cookware.
The agreements are subject to final approval, 3M said in a statement. The company did not admit wrongdoing. 
3M's Decatur site director, Michelle Howell, said in a statement that she hoped the deals would ""strengthen Decatur for the future.""

Tennessee Riverkeeper in a statement called the settlement ""just a start."" 
Decatur Mayor Tab Bowling said in a statement the settlement ""will fund improvements that will make the environment in Decatur and Morgan County healthier.""

1636,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2021 07:37PM ET</span>",U.S. workers face job losses as COVID-19 vaccine mandates kick in,"By Nathan Layne
(Reuters) -Thousands of unvaccinated workers across the United States are facing potential job losses as a growing number of states, cities and private companies start to enforce mandates for inoculation against COVID-19.
In the latest high-profile example, Washington State University (WSU) fired its head football coach and four of his assistants on Monday for failing to comply with the state's vaccine requirement. The coach, Nick Rolovich, had applied for a religious exemption from the mandate earlier this month.
Thousands of police officers and firefighters in cities like Chicago and Baltimore are also at risk of losing their jobs in the coming days under mandates that require them to report their vaccination status or submit to regular coronavirus testing.
While controversial, the mandates have been effective at convincing many hesitant workers to get vaccinated against the virus, which has killed more than 700,000 people in the United States. Some 77% of eligible Americans have received at least one shot of a vaccine, White House COVID-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients told reporters last week.
In Chicago, Mayor Lori Lightfoot has been battling with the police union, which came out against the vaccine mandate for city workers. About a third of the city's 12,770 police employees missed a Friday deadline to report their vaccination status, and some officers have been put on no-pay status.
""Fundamentally, what this all is about is about saving lives. It's about maximizing the opportunity to create a safe workplace,"" Lightfoot said on Monday, accusing the union of tying to ""induce an insurrection"" by opposing the mandate.
Chicago Fraternal Order of Police union president John Catanzara did not respond to a request for comment.
The White House, which announced sweeping vaccine requirements in a bid to reduce a surge in COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths caused by the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus, has been a major catalyst behind the inoculation push.
On Friday, some 200 Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co employees and others staged a protest over the planemaker's requirement that 125,000 workers be vaccinated by Dec. 8, under an executive order issued by President Joe Biden for federal contractors.
The rules for another order applying to private businesses with 100 or more employees are expected to be finalized soon.
Along with the mandate for federal workers and contractors, Biden's vaccine requirements will cover roughly 100 million people, about two-thirds of the U.S. workforce.
The White House has been meeting with executives of several major companies to discuss Biden's private-sector vaccination plan.
On Sunday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he was worried about a possible shortage of Transportation Security Administration agents gumming up air travel during the year-end holiday season. With 40% of the agency's staff not yet vaccinated and Thanksgiving just over a month away, Schumer suggested security dogs could be added to help cover any shortfall.
'VACCINE MANDATES HELP MOTIVATE PEOPLE'
A wave of layoffs has already swept through the healthcare industry, which moved more quickly than others to impose vaccine mandates given the heightened COVID-19 exposure risk for patients and staff. 
Nurses and other healthcare workers who chose to leave their jobs rather than be immunized recently told Reuters they could not get past their concern over a lack of long-term data on the three vaccines available in the United States.
While the vaccines received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration in less than a year, medical experts have widely vouched for their safety, citing years of research, large clinical trials and real world data after hundreds of millions have been vaccinated worldwide. 
Like WSU's Rolovich, many unvaccinated workers looking to avoid the shots have done so by seeking religious exemptions, which are being tested in several courts.
School leaders said the mandate was aimed at ensuring the safety of its faculty and staff.
""Experience is showing that vaccine mandates help motivate people to complete the vaccination process,"" Marty Dickinson, WSU Board of Regents Chair, said in a statement.

The mandates are causing staffing concerns across various industries, and some companies are taking steps to reassure workers that their requests for medical or religious exemptions will be given serious consideration.
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) told its employees on Friday that it would allow the unvaccinated to continue working, rather than being placed on unpaid leave, if their exemption requests have not been evaluated by the Dec. 8 deadline.

WASHINGTON/ZURICH (Reuters) -Credit Suisse Group AG will pay about $475 million to American and British authorities to resolve bribery and fraud charges relating to a $2 billion Mozambican corruption scandal, while its subsidiary pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge in New York, U.S. and UK agencies said on Tuesday. 
The settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Justice Department and Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is the latest blow for the scandal-plagued https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mozambique-credit-suisse-banking-idUSKBN2762KS Swiss bank and was announced just minutes before Switzerland's financial regulator reprimanded it for a long-running corporate espionage saga. 
The U.S. and British charges stem from nearly $1 billion in bond offerings and a syndicated loan  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) helped to arrange between 2013 to 2016 to finance a tuna fishing industry project in Mozambique. Much of the proceeds were diverted via kickbacks to Credit Suisse bankers and Mozambique officials.
The three former Credit Suisse bankers, along with two middlemen and three Mozambican government officials, were charged in 2018 for money laundering and defrauding U.S. investors who had invested in the loans. U.S. prosecutors said at least $200 million of the loans had been diverted to the eight defendants. The former bankers pleaded guilty in 2019.
Through the actions of its bankers, Credit Suisse fraudulently misled investors and violated U.S. bribery laws, the authorities alleged on Tuesday.
The bank will pay a $175 million criminal fine to the Justice Department, $99 million to the SEC, and $200 million to the British authorities, and will also forgive $200 million of debt owed by Mozambique. As a result, the bank said it expects to take $230 million in charges in the third quarter 2021. 
Credit Suisse's European subsidiary also pleaded guilty in a U.S. federal court to one criminal count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, while the group has entered a three-year deferred prosecution agreement with the Justice Department.
That will require the bank to continue cooperating with any ongoing investigation and to improve its compliance systems. 
Credit Suisse's European subsidiary has also agreed with the Swiss regulator to appoint an independent third-party to monitor its transactions and risk controls.
""Credit Suisse is satisfied with the completion of the proceedings by U.S., UK and Swiss regulatory authorities into the bank's arrangement of loan financing for Mozambique state enterprises,"" the bank said in a statement.
SNOOPING SCANDAL
The Swiss bank is already reeling from a string of scandals https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/credit-suisse-scandals-prompt-switzerland-think-unthinkable-punish-bankers-2021-05-28including heavy losses from the collapse of U.S. family office Archegos, client-losses stemming from the collapse of supply chain finance company Greensill, and allegations that it snooped on its former top wealth management executive Iqbal Khan.
Chairman Antonio Horta-Osorio, who joined the bank in April from Britain's Lloyds (LON:LLOY), has said the scandals are the gravest he has seen. 
The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, FINMA, said on Tuesday that the bank was found to have had ""serious organizational shortcomings"" surrounding the corporate espionage that ultimately triggered the departure of Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam. 
FINMA said it had reprimanded two individuals and opened enforcement proceedings against three additional individuals, without naming them.
Referring to the spying matter, Credit Suisse said it had ""taken decisive steps to strengthen its relevant governance and processes.""
Tuesday's resolution is the latest development in the multi-year Mozambique saga https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mozambique-credit-suisse-banking-idUSKBN2762KS for Credit Suisse, with private litigation ongoing. The African nation is suing Credit Suisse and shipbuilder Privinvest in London's High Court over the missing money.
The corruption scandal prompted donors including the International Monetary Fund cut off support to Mozambique, triggering a currency collapse and debt default.
It has also embroiled other major lenders. 

A London-based subsidiary of Russian bank VTB, which worked with Credit Suisse to arrange one of the bonds in 2016, also agreed on Tuesday to pay $6 million to settle SEC charges it misled investors. 
""VTB takes today's settlement seriously and fully cooperated with the SEC investigation,"" the bank said.

The actions are based on an increase in number of reports ranging from years ago to the present, Activision said in a letter to employees.
The owner of ""Call of Duty"" and ""Candy Crush"" franchises added it would expand its ethics and compliance team in order to create a ""more accountable workplace and culture"". The company will add 19 full-time roles to the team.
""Two of those roles will be specifically dedicated to overseeing investigations related to the EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) and APAC (Asia Pacific) regions,"" it added.
Activision said a report could be submitted anonymously, and that there was zero tolerance for retaliation of any kind. It added that the company would ""terminate or discipline"" individuals violating its policies.
The sacking of 20 employees was first reported by the Financial Times.
Earlier in September, Activision Blizzard and the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) said they had reached an agreement to settle claims over sexual harassment and discrimination in the company's workplace.

The EEOC, which has been investigating allegations of sexual harassment, discrimination and retaliation at Activision for three years, found that the company failed to take corrective and preventive measures on sexual harassment complaints, according to a filing in the U.S. District Court of the Central District of California.
The company also said last month it was continuing to work with regulators on addressing and resolving the workplace complaints it has received.

(Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes closed higher on Tuesday with the biggest boosts from the technology and healthcare sectors as investors appeared to bet on solid quarterly reports even as some worried that it was too early to celebrate. 
In its fifth straight session of gains, the benchmark S&P 500 index finished just 0.4% below its early September record close while the Dow Jones Industrials average ended the day about 0.5% below its record reached in mid-August. 
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s shares added 2.3% providing a big boost to the S&P 500 after it raised its 2021 adjusted profit forecast. Insurer Travelers (NYSE:TRV) Cos Inc climbed 1.6% after beating its profit estimates.
High-profile technology and communications companies were also big S&P boosts with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) all rising. 
But in the second week of earnings with a ""very small sample"" of releases, Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR), worried about a possible pullback.
""We're seeing volatility measures like the VIX flipping from nervous to complacent in a really short period of time,"" said Sosnick. ""We may be a bit ahead of ourselves. The mostly likely scenario is that we make one more run at new S&P highs and then we pull back, subject to earnings.""
The CBOE market volatility index fell 0.6 points after earlier hitting 15.57, its lowest level since mid-August. 
Analysts now expect S&P 500 earnings to rise 32.4% from a year earlier, according to Refinitiv data.
""The key for the market to going up from here will not be higher multiples, it will have to be higher earnings. That's why it's so important to pay attention to what those profit margins do going forward and what the trajectory of GDP looks like,"" said Eric Marshall, portfolio manager at Hodges Funds.
""Investors will be paying very close attention to pricing power, how companies are dealing with labor shortages and inflationary cost pressures within their business.""

Ten of the eleven major S&P 500 sectors closed higher, with healthcare stocks, up 1.3% after dropping 0.7% in Monday's session. The next biggest gainer was utilities, which rose 1.26% after falling almost 1% Monday. 
Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), after closing up 0.2%, added slightly to gains after the bell when quarterly results showed that global interest in Korean thriller ""Squid Game"" lured more new customers than expected. 
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, which closed down 0.7%, is due to release results on Wednesday, with investors watching for indications of its performance in China.
Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) Co, fell 1% during the session, after it warned that it would have to raise prices of some products to counter higher commodity and freight costs.
However, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc shares added 2% after being added to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) ""Americas Conviction List."" 
Helping the healthcare sector on Tuesday was drugmaker Merck & Co Inc, which rose 3% while  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) climbed 1.9% following the release of a competitor's COVID-19 drug study results. 
Its competitor, Atea Pharmaceuticals Inc, fell 66% after the company's antiviral pill, being developed with Roche, failed to help patients with mild and moderate COVID-19.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.51-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.69-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

In the third quarter, Vale said it had produced 89.42 million tonnes of iron ore, about 0.8% more than in the same period a year earlier. 

It also said it had produced 30,200 tonnes of nickel, 22% less than a year earlier, mostly due to labor disruptions at its Sudbury mine.
Iron ore prices have fallen sharply from record prices reached in May following an end to supply constraints and a weaker demand outlook in China.

1642,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2021 06:48PM ET</span>",Facebook to pay up to $14.25 million to settle U.S. employment discrimination claims,"By Sarah N. Lynch
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) has agreed to pay up to $14.25 million to settle civil claims by the U.S. government that the social media company discriminated against American workers and violated federal recruitment rules, U.S. officials said on Tuesday.
The two related settlements were announced by the Justice Department and Labor Department and confirmed by Facebook. The Justice Department last December filed a lawsuit accusing Facebook of giving hiring preferences to temporary workers including those who hold H-1B visas that let companies temporarily employ foreign workers in certain specialty occupations. Such visas are widely used by tech companies.
Kristen Clarke, assistant U.S. attorney general for the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, called the agreement with Facebook historic.
""It represents by far the largest civil penalty the Civil Rights Division has ever recovered in the 35-year history of the Immigration and Nationality Act's anti-discrimination provision,"" Clarke said in a call with reporters, referring to a key U.S. immigration law that bars discrimination against workers because of their citizenship or immigration status.
The case centered on Facebook's use of the so-called permanent labor certification, called the PERM program. 
The U.S. government said that Facebook refused to recruit or hire American workers for jobs that had been reserved for temporary visa holders under the PERM program. It also accused Facebook of ""potential regulatory recruitment violations.""
Facebook will pay a civil penalty under the settlement of $4.75 million, plus up to $9.5 million to eligible victims of what the government called discriminatory hiring practices.
""While we strongly believe we met the federal government's standards in our permanent labor certification (PERM) practices, we've reached agreements to end the ongoing litigation and move forward with our PERM program,"" a Facebook spokesperson said, adding that the company intends to ""continue our focus on hiring the best builders from both the U.S. and around the world.""
The settlements come at a time when Facebook is facing increasing U.S. government scrutiny over other business practices.
Facebook this month faced anger from U.S. lawmakers after former company employee and whistleblower Frances Haugen accused it of pushing for higher profits while being cavalier about user safety. Haugen has turned over thousands of documents to congressional investigators amid concerns that Facebook has harmed children's mental health and has stoked societal divisions.
The company has denied any wrongdoing.
In Tuesday's settlements, the Justice Department said that Facebook used recruitment practices designed to deter U.S. workers such as requiring applications to be submitted only by mail, refusing to consider American workers who applied for positions and hiring only temporary visa holders.

The Labor Department this year conducted audits of Facebook's pending PERM applications and uncovered other concerns about the company's recruitment efforts.
""Facebook is not above the law,"" U.S. Solicitor of Labor Seema Nanda told reporters, adding that the Labor Department is ""committed to ensuring that the PERM process is not misused by employers - regardless of their size and reach.""

CHICAGO (Reuters) -United Airlines Holdings on Tuesday reported a smaller quarterly loss than a year ago, but a resurgence in coronavirus cases slowed bookings and drove up cancellations, upending the carrier's plan to return to profit.
Chief Executive Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX), however, said recent headwinds the airline has faced are ""turning to tailwinds.""
United said it expects revenue in the current quarter to recover to up to 75% of 2019 levels, improving from about 68% in the quarter through September.
The company's shares rose about 2% to $47.22 in extended trading.
Buoyed by a strong summer travel season, United was expecting to be profitable in the third and fourth quarters. It lowered its estimates https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/united-airlines-warns-delta-variant-hit-revenue-capacity-2021-09-09 last month, citing the impact of the fast spreading Delta variant of the coronavirus on travel. 
With COVID-19 cases still high but in decline in the United States as more people get vaccinated, airlines said bookings have bottomed out.
Rival Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) last week said domestic consumer travel has returned to pre-pandemic levels.
U.S. carriers are eyeing a strong holiday season, with United planning to fly its biggest domestic schedule since the start of the pandemic, offering more than 3,500 daily domestic flights in December - representing 91% of its domestic capacity compared to 2019.
They are also optimistic about the re-opening next month of the transatlantic route - the most lucrative long-haul market - which they expect will spur a recovery in international traffic.
Betting on pent-up travel demand, the Chicago-based carrier last week announced https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/united-airlines-ramp-up-transatlantic-service-add-new-routes-2021-10-14 an expansion of its transatlantic service next year, and Kirby has said he expects the route to have the busiest summer ever in 2022.
The company reported an adjusted loss for the third quarter of $1.02 per share, compared with a loss of $8.16 per share last year at the height of the coronavirus pandemic. Analysts were forecasting a loss of $1.67 per share, according to Refinitiv data.

With government pandemic aid, the airline reported a net profit of $1.44 per share for the quarter.
United will discuss the results on a call with analysts and investors on Wednesday morning.

A chamber of the court known as the STJ ruled on Tuesday that the charges filed by state prosecutors in Minas Gerais should be filed through a federal court and not a state one.
The collapse of the dam unleashed a massive wave of tailings on the mining community of Brumadinho and its surroundings. The dead included 250 Vale employees.

The unanimous decision on an appeal filed last year by former Vale chief executive Fabio Schvartsman, one of the 16 people prosecutors sought to indict, means that the case has to begin again from scratch in a federal court.
The Minas Gerais state prosecutors office said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that it will appeal against the decision.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Executives with  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS), Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co and other companies met with White House officials on Tuesday to discuss President Joe Biden's COVID-19 vaccine requirement plan for private-sector workers, amid concerns it could worsen labor shortages and supply chain woes.
The mandate would apply to businesses with 100 or more employees, and would affect about 80 million workers nationwide.
Several industry sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the rulemaking process was moving with urgency and they expect the mandate to be formally announced as early as this week. It was not clear how much time employers will have to implement it.
The White House's Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has been meeting with several influential business lobbying groups, such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Retail Industry Leaders Association (RILA) and the Business Roundtable as part of its rulemaking process. The meetings were requested by the trade groups and companies and is part of the regular rulemaking process.
Tuesday's meetings were disclosed in filings with the White House. Disney did not respond to requests for comment. A UPS spokesperson confirmed the meeting and said it is reviewing what a vaccine mandate means for the company and its employees.
Many of the industry groups have raised concerns such as labor shortages and how regulation by the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) could worsen existing supply-chain problems facing U.S. companies ahead of the holiday shopping season. Other topics, such as testing requirements and who will bear the cost, also were raised.
Evan Armstrong, RILA vice president for workforce, said it will be tough for the retail industry to implement the rule in the middle of the U.S. holiday season and that pushing it to January would help. He said the group raised the topic with the White House during their meeting.
""The implementation period needs to push this out past the holiday season because obviously for retail that is the biggest time for us,"" he said. RILA's members include large U.S. employers such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and the industry supports over 50 million U.S. jobs.
Biden's plan has drawn a mixed reaction from industry trade groups and companies.
Several big employers including Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) Co and 3M Co, along with airlines such as American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) Corp, have imposed vaccination mandates since Biden's announcement last month. Others such as  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) have said they will require all U.S. employees to be fully vaccinated by Dec. 8, no matter how often they come into the office.
Some other large U.S. employers, such as Walmart, have yet to issue broad requirements.

The vaccine order has spurred pushback from many Republican governors, including Florida's Ron DeSantis and Greg Abbott of Texas, who issued an executive order banning businesses in his state from requiring vaccinations for employees. Although some, such as American Airlines, have said they plan to proceed with vaccination rules. 
The mandate will be implemented under a federal rule-making mechanism known as an emergency temporary standard.

(Reuters) - A group of U.S. lawmakers said  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) cannot be trusted to manage cryptocurrency and urged the social media platform to discontinue immediately a small pilot of its cryptocurrency wallet named Novi, which was launched on Tuesday.
U.S. Democratic senators Brian Schatz, Sherrod Brown, Richard Blumenthal, Elizabeth Warren and Tina Smith voiced their opposition to Facebook's two-year-old effort to launch a cryptocurrency and digital wallet.
""Facebook is once again pursuing digital currency plans on an aggressive timeline and has already launched a pilot for a payments infrastructure network, even though these plans are incompatible with the actual financial regulatory landscape,"" the senators wrote in a letter to Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg.
""Facebook cannot be trusted to manage a payment system or digital currency when its existing ability to manage risks and keep consumers safe has proven wholly insufficient,"" the senators wrote.
The letter by the senators indicates that even Facebook's small pilot of its cryptocurrency wallet will face scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators, who have previously raised antitrust and other concerns.
A Novi spokesperson said: ""We look forward to responding to the committee’s letter."" 
Facebook unveiled a cryptocurrency project in June 2019, as part of an effort to expand into e-commerce and global payments.

But the project immediately ran into fierce opposition from policymakers globally, who worried it could erode their control over the money system, enable crime and harm users' privacy.
In December, the project was rebranded in a renewed effort to gain regulatory approval, with its scope scaled back further to a single dollar-backed digital coin.

And given the commodity’s high volatility, fundamentally weak stocks in this space are at the risk of a downturn. Indeed, oil & gas stocks Northern Oil and Gas (NOG) and Genesis Energy (NYSE:GEL) have recently been downgraded by analysts. So, we think these stocks are best avoided now.Rising energy prices have lately delivered significant returns for oil & gas producers. However, despite optimistic price expectations, uncertainty reigns in the forward market. And it will likely take a while for U.S. independent producers to reverse the supply cuts implied last year and to operate at their pre-pandemic capacity. A senior equity analyst at Siebert Williams Shank & Co., Gabriele Sorbara expects U.S. shale oil companies to remain in ""maintenance mode"" regarding drilling and completing new wells.
Furthermore, producers signed contracts at much lower oil prices to hedge against the negative oil prices last year. Drilling budgets need to increase 54% to more than half a trillion dollars to avoid a future supply crisis. Recently, President Biden’s administration had called on OPEC to increase supply and asked for cooperation from oil companies to curb price increases.
Given the uncertainties surrounding the oil market, we believe fundamentally weak stocks with bleak long-term prospects, Northern Oil and Gas, Inc. (NOG) and Genesis Energy, L.P. (GEL), are best avoided now. Analysts have recently downgraded these stocks.

Therefore, we think prominent players in this space, Abbott (ABT) and Abiomed (NASDAQ:ABMD), should benefit. But which of these stocks is a better buy now? Read more to find out. Abbott Laboratories  (NYSE:ABT) in Abbott Park, Ill., and Danvers, Mass.-based Abiomed, Inc. (ABMD) are two prominent players in the medical devices industry. ABT discovers, develops, and sells health care products focused on cardiovascular, diabetes care, diagnostics, neuromodulation, nutrition, and medicine. The company operates through four segments--Established Pharmaceutical Products; Diagnostic Products; Nutritional Products; and Medical Devices. ABMD, in comparison, manufactures and markets medical devices and technologies that provide circulatory support and oxygenation. It also provides a continuum of care to heart failure patients. Both companies sell their products through direct sales and clinical support personnel worldwide.
As the categorization of medical procedures into essential and non-essential led to a decline in non-COVID-19 related medical procedures last year, the medical devices industry suffered a significant setback. However, solid progress on the vaccination front caused a rebound in demand for medical devices this year, primarily for rescheduled surgeries. Moreover, continued product innovations, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI), and entry into new market divisions position the industry well for solid long-term growth. The global medical devices market is expected to grow at a 5.2% CAGR to $671.49 billion by 2027. So, both ABT and ABMD are expected to benefit.
But while ABT gained 7.3% in price year-to-date, ABMD has surged 8.3%. ABMD is also a clear winner with 22.5% gains versus ABT’s 9.5% returns in terms of the past year's performance. But which of these stocks is a better pick now? Let’s find out.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Three unions representing workers at  Union Pacific  Corp (NYSE:UNP) filed lawsuits against the U.S. railroad operator's move to make vaccines mandatory for its 31,000 employees under a deadline imposed by the Biden administration for federal contractors.
Union Pacific said on Monday it filed suit against the unions on Friday, saying the action was necessary to prevent any disruption of its rail network ""and to avoid any impact on America’s supply chain, as it continues to recover from the pandemic.""
Union Pacific asked a judge to ""have any dispute over the mandate resolved through the various dispute resolution procedures outlined in the Railway Labor Act.""
The lawsuits were filed in U.S. District Court in Northern Illinois.
The union lawsuits said workers who were vaccinated would be paid a $300 incentive and that Union Pacific did not engage union officers or attempt to engage in any bargaining over the matter before imposing the mandate.

President Joe Biden signed an executive order on Sept. 9 requiring federal contractors to mandate vaccinations and the White House said on Sept. 27 that millions of employees from covered federal contractors must be vaccinated by Dec. 8.

(Reuters) - The United States and ally nations should mine and process more rare earths to ensure adequate global supply of the strategic minerals for military and commercial uses, a U.S. Department of Defense official said on Tuesday.
The remarks underscore the Pentagon's rising interest in public-private mining partnerships to counter China's status as the top global producer of rare earths, the 17 minerals used to make specialized magnets for weaponry and electric vehicles (EVs). 
""We know we cannot resolve our shared exposure to supply chain risk without a close partnership with industry,"" Danielle Miller of the Pentagon's Office of Industrial Policy told the Adamas Intelligence North American Critical Minerals Days conference.
""New primary production of strategic and critical minerals - in a word, mining - is a necessity to increase resilience in global supply chains."" 
Miller cited recent investments in U.S. rare earth projects under development by MP Materials Corp, Urban Mining Co, and a joint venture of Australia's Lynas Rare Earths Ltd and Blue Line Corp as evidence of the Pentagon's desire to be a ""patient, strategic investor"" in private industry.
""Domestic production of strategic and critical materials is the ultimate hedge against the risk of deliberate non-market interference in extended overseas supply chains,"" Miller said, a likely reference to China's hints it could curtail rare earth exports to the United States.
""We are under no illusions about the competing pressures facing"" the U.S. mining industry.

Miller also said the Pentagon wants to help mining companies in ally nations ""create a common understanding of sustainability."" U.S. environmental standards for mining are among the tightest in the world.
""We want to work with (miners) to accelerate the transition from the lowest cost, technically acceptable sourcing, to one that reflects our values,"" Miller said.

1660,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2021 04:10PM ET</span>",Democrats pitch scaled-down U.S. bank tax reporting requirement,"By Pete Schroeder and David Lawder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Democrats on Tuesday unveiled a scaled-down version of a proposal to crack down on wealthy tax cheats after intense bank lobbying, although the industry still called the plan onerous and problematic.
The provision, part of a broader government spending package, would require banks to report to the Internal Revenue Service any accounts that see activity in excess of $10,000 a year, excluding wages. That is an increase from the original proposal, which would have flagged accounts with over $600 in money going in or out.
Banks are not currently required to report such accounts to the IRS.
Democrats said the provision could give tax collectors valuable information for identifying individuals or companies that underreport their taxes.
""For years, giant corporations and the wealthy have worked to rig the tax code,"" said Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat and prominent bank critic. ""This means the IRS can spot when a wealthy tax cheat has millions of dollars flowing into an account but isn’t reporting that money on their tax return.""
The Biden administration threw its support behind the revamped proposal. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement it ""reflects the Administration’s strong belief that we should zero in on those at the top of the income scale who don’t pay the taxes they owe.""
Proponents of the measure had pointed words for critics, including the banking industry, which they accused of inaccurately suggesting the policy would require banks to tell the IRS about specific bank transactions. Senator Ron Wyden, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said opponents had engaged in ""egregious lies and misrepresentations.""
""The IRS would not know what any taxpayer is purchasing, and that is something I insisted on,"" he said.
Nonetheless, banks, which intensely lobbied alongside conservative groups against the original provision, continued to criticize the revamped plan. Rob Nichols, president and chief executive of the American Bankers Association, called on lawmakers to oppose the proposal.
""If enacted, this new proposal would still raise the same privacy concerns, increase tax preparation costs for individuals and small businesses, and create significant operational challenges, particularly for community banks,"" he said in a statement.

Among industry concerns about the proposal is that the $10,000 threshold could still sweep in too many average Americans for potential audits.
“Raising the threshold to $10,000 sounds like it’s a big increase, but it’s not. It’s fundamentally flawed at any threshold,"" said Ryan Donovan, a lobbyist for Credit Union National Association.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden's Handelsbanken said on Tuesday it would exit Denmark and Finland, as it saw little chance to grow without making major investments in those markets.
Handelsbanken, one of Sweden's oldest banks and a major mortgage lender, said new regulatory frameworks meant the bank needed central staff functions and infrastructure in each market and that the synergies had decreased for small markets.
""Despite a lasting presence in these markets, the bank's market position remains small and the bank sees little opportunity to scale up its offering without significant investment,"" Handelsbanken said in a statement, adding that the process to divest the operations had been initiated.
Together, Denmark and Finland account for 10% of the income, 13% of the costs, and 8% of Handelsbanken's operating profit.
Handelsbanken's main markets are Sweden, Norway and the United Kingdom, and these markets account for 91% of its profits. Handelsbanken also has small operations in the Netherlands and in Luxemburg.
Handelsbanken reported better-than-expected third-quarter net profit which rose to 5.19 billion Swedish crowns ($602 million) from 3.32 billion in the previous year, beating the mean forecast of 4.65 billion by analysts, according to Refinitiv data.
Handelsbanken, with a low-risk, decentralised business model, has proven resilient in the face of COVID-19 and its shares, up 30% this year, are very close to pre-pandemic levels.

(Reuters) - California’s biofuel projects are important for the state to achieve its decarbonization goals despite “tremendous pushback” in some instances, a top state environmental regulator said on Tuesday.
California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard program incentivizes energy companies to seek out new feedstocks that would lower the carbon intensity of fuels like diesel, jet fuel and gasoline. Refiners are trying to take advantage of the standard by selling more lower-emission products, currently a small part of overall fuel sales.
Oil refiners Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) and Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) are converting their Bay Area refineries to run on feedstocks such as vegetable oils and animal fats. 
“The worst outcome is those investments don’t occur in the state,” said Richard Corey, executive officer at the California Air Resources Board, at Argus’ LCFS and Carbon Markets Summit in Napa, California. 
Last year California Governor Gavin Newsom called on the state to expedite regulatory processes to repurpose and downstream oil production facilities such as refineries and to phase out the sale of internal combustion engines by 2030.
Some projects, which are currently undergoing environmental reviews by state and local agencies, have come under opposition from some people that “don’t want any fuel,” Corey said, without elaborating.
Environmental advocates have demanded that regulators consider the effects of the proposed biofuels projects on water, air quality and food prices, and have warned that the increased use of hydrogen in refining fats and oils might cause more flaring.
California is the largest consumer of both jet fuel and motor gasoline, according to data from the Energy Information Administration.
Last week, California's Contra Costa County released environmental impact reports for the projects from oil refiners Marathon Petroleum and Phillips 66.

The state welcomes the creative energy of some refiners exploring options to produce fuels such as renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuels, Corey said.
“Aviation ... is going to be using liquid fuels for a very long time,” he said.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -General Electric Co has asked its U.S.-based workers to get COVID-19 shots or seek a medical or religious accommodation by Dec. 8 in order to comply with U.S. President Joe Biden's executive order.
As part of efforts to control the pandemic, which has killed more than 700,000 Americans, Biden, a Democrat, last month signed the order requiring federal contractors to mandate COVID-19 shots for employees and get them vaccinated by Dec. 8.
As a federal contractor, GE said it is complying with the executive order. The company updated its vaccine policy for more than 50,000 U.S. workers last week.
The Boston-based conglomerate is the latest U.S. employer to impose such a requirement, which has sparked a political fight.
While supporters of vaccine mandates see them as necessary to pull the country out of the nearly two-year-old pandemic, critics are calling them unconstitutional and authoritarian.
The White House has said vaccine requirements have driven up COVID-19 vaccination rates by 20 percentage points. 

The measure has drawn a sharp reaction from some Republicans, with Texas Governor Greg Abbott last week barring COVID-19 vaccine mandates by any entity, including private employers.
 Union Pacific  Corp (NYSE:UNP) and its three unions have sued each other over the vaccine mandate.

LONDON (Reuters) -Shareholders in supermarket group Morrisons on Tuesday approved a 7 billion pound ($9.7 billion) offer from U.S. private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R), bringing the curtain down on Britain's most fiercely contested takeover this year. 
Morrisons said the requisite majorities of shareholders backed the deal, which had been recommended by the board, at meetings held both physically at its Bradford, northern England headquarters and virtually.
CD&R, which has former Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) boss Terry Leahy as a senior adviser, won an auction for Morrisons on Oct. 2, bidding a penny a share more than a consortium led by Softbank-owned Fortress Investment Group.
CD&R's winning bid of 287 pence a share represented a hefty 61% premium on Morrisons' share price before takeover interest publicly emerged in mid-June.
Formal completion of the deal, expected on Oct. 27, will conclude a six-month battle to buy Morrisons, Britain's fourth-biggest grocer and one of the country's biggest food producers.
It will end Morrisons' 54-year run as a publicly-listed company and see the ultimate decisions on the group's future shift from Bradford to the New York home of CD&R.
Morrisons, which started out as an egg and butter merchant in 1899, trails market leader Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda in annual revenue.
The battle for Morrisons has been the most high-profile amid a raft of bids for British companies this year, reflecting private equity's appetite for cash-generating UK assets.
CD&R has committed to retaining Morrisons' Bradford base and its existing management team, led by CEO David Potts.
It has also said it will execute the supermarket chain's existing strategy, not sell its freehold store estate and maintain staff pay rates.
Those commitments are not legally binding, however.
""We are very pleased to have received the approval of shareholders and are excited at the opportunity that lies ahead,"" said Leahy, who is expected to succeed Andrew Higginson as Morrisons' chairman.
""The particular heritage, culture and operating model of Morrisons are key features of the company and we will be very mindful of these during our tenure as owners.""
Morrisons is the second UK supermarket chain in a year to be acquired by private equity after a buyout of No. 3 player Asda, by the Issa brothers and TDR Capital, completed in February.

Potts, who started his retail career at Tesco as a 16-year-old shelf stacker, will make more than 10 million pounds from selling his Morrisons shares to CD&R. Chief Operating Officer Trevor Strain will pocket about 4 million pounds.

1676,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2021 02:26PM ET</span>","Analysis-As oil prices skyrocket, fund managers hop on board for the ride","By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A surge in oil prices is drawing fund managers back into shares of oil and gas companies, even as some remain unsure that the price gains will stick.
Energy stocks in the S&P 500 are up 53.8% for the year to date compared with a 20.2% gain for the broader index, as rising demand from the global economic reopening collides with supply chain disruptions and inflation fears to boost energy prices to multi-year highs. 
The rally has caught many fund managers by surprise and some are scrambling to catch up, betting that commodity prices will remain high in the face of burgeoning demand. Allocations to energy stocks among fund managers increased by 23 percentage points from last month to the largest overweight since March 2012, a BofA Global Research survey showed on Tuesday.
""I have a sneaking suspicion that energy prices may be elevated for a while because it will take some time for the supply side to catch up,” said Jack Janasiewicz, a portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers who has been increasing his overweight in energy stocks. 
Janasiewicz also said he believes surging prices for oil and gas companies will likely bring in money managers who have been underweight the sector and are nervous their comparative performance will suffer.
Many fund managers had spent years pruning their energy holdings, as clients demanded more exposure to environmentally friendly companies in their portfolios and an abundance of shale oil in the United States undercut the case for big rallies in prices. U.S. equity funds had an average of 2.6% of their portfolios in energy stocks in August, compared with 5% three years earlier, according to Morningstar data.
Supply bottlenecks and worker shortages that have helped push energy prices in Europe to record levels have helped change that calculus. Meanwhile, worries that a recent surge in inflation may be more persistent than previously expected have boosted the appeal of commodities as a hedge against rising consumer prices.
Brent crude futures topped $86 a barrel on Monday, their highest level since October 2018. U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures stand at $83.73, their highest since October 2014.
Exploration and production companies remain attractive if oil prices stay between $50 and $80 a barrel and do not rise high enough to start weighing on demand, said Eric Marshall, a fund manager at Hodges Capital Management who has positions in companies including  Pioneer Natural Resources  (NYSE:PXD) Co and Diamondback (NASDAQ:FANG) Energy Inc. 
Energy companies have focused more on returning cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks than gaining market share and have been slow to increase their rig counts as spot prices increase, he said. 
Lower rig counts help buoy prices because they keep a lid on supply. While rigs operating in the United States have increased six weeks in a row, the total rig count is just now back to levels last seen in April 2020, according to Baker Hughes Co.
Yet some on Wall Street remain wary that the rally in oil prices can reverse if inflation proves to be transitory, demand slackens or energy companies invest too heavily in production. Past boom and bust cycles in commodity prices have been marked by rapid surges in oil prices followed by bruising declines: Oil plummeted from above $100 a barrel to around $30 between 2014 and 2016 as growth in shale drilling turned the United States into the world's largest producer of crude oil.
Simon Wong, an energy analyst at Gabelli Funds, said that some market participants may be wary of companies ramping up production and flooding the market with supply.
""The generalist investors need to see two or three years of commitment from companies that they are not going to grow at all costs before they return en masse,"" he said.

Michael Underhill, chief investment officer at Capital Innovations, said high costs will push some consumers to shift consumption to alternative energy sources or cut back on usage, causing oil prices to fall as much as 20% in the next 12 months.
“The old adage of ‘the best remedy for high oil prices is high oil prices’ will prove to be correct again,” Underhill said.

Net profit attributable to shareholders was 300.3 million euros ($349.31 million), up from 227.1 million euros a year ago, the company said. Analysts had expected a profit increase of nearly 27%.

PARIS (Reuters) -French luxury group  Kering  (PA:PRTP)'s star fashion brand Gucci grew sales by just 3.8% in the third quarter, missing analyst expectations as the pace of recovery from COVID-19 slowed down sharply, particularly in Asia, following a bumper second quarter.
Luxury goods groups have bounced back strongly from the fallout of the health emergency, lifted by pent-up demand for high-end wares as lockdowns ease across the world and consumers return to socialising. 
However, shopping by travelling tourists - a key source of revenue for the sector - remains well below pre-pandemic levels.
Overall sales at Kering rose by 12.2% on a comparable basis, which strips out the effect of acquisitions and currency fluctuations, a touch above an analyst consensus forecast for an 11% increase. 
The group flagged a strong performance in the United States and improving sales in western Europe but a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in late July and August weighed on revenue in the key Asia-Pacific region, where Gucci sales were down 3%.
The label, which accounts for more than half of annual sales, has been losing steam compared to some rivals after years of stellar growth, becoming the main focus for investors. 
Analysts had expected revenue at Gucci to rise by 9% in the three months to end-September after an 86% surge in the previous quarter. By comparison, LVMH's fashion and leather goods division, home to Louis Vuitton and Dior, posted a 24% increase in third-quarter sales.
Kering's finance chief, Jean-Marc Duplaix, told reporters the group expected Gucci's growth to accelerate in the fourth quarter after its new Aria collection, which includes a broader array of products than previous collections, hit stores in late September.
""We expect a very intense end of the year,"" he said, noting the collection had been well received in markets around the world. 
He added the group was looking to support the brand with investments in events, communication, stores and recruitment, efforts that would hit the brand's margin growth in the second half.

Sales of smaller fashion labels Yves Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta grew briskly over the quarter, led by double-digit growth in North America and Europe, while their performances were also more muted in the Asia-Pacific region.
Asia has been a key growth driver for the luxury sector, in particular China which is being closely watched by luxury investors concerned that government measures aimed at reducing the wealth gap and slower economic growth could dampen appetite for high-end goods.

(Reuters) - Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB)'s Alzheimer's drug will be of little help to its third-quarter sales, Wall Street analysts said, as the drugmaker faces an uphill task of convincing hospitals and clinics to use the $56,000-a-year treatment and insurers to reimburse it.
Aduhelm in June became the first new treatment for the memory-robbing disease in nearly 20 years, boosting hopes the treatment would cushion the blow of diving sales of Biogen's mainstay multiple sclerosis drug, Tecfidera, due to rising competition.
But the acceptance of Aduhelm has been limited due to doubts about its net benefit to patients as well as uncertainty about reimbursement from Medicare, the U.S. government health plan for people over age 65.
""We expect focus will remain Aduhelm's launch, where signals around initial sales, reimbursement and prescriber sentiment have been negative, and shares have reflected this, taking a round trip nearly all the way back from pre-approval levels,"" said Baird analyst Brian Skorney. 
Insurers and hospitals now await coverage terms from the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services before covering the drug, which is administered through an infusion. 
Wall Street estimates for Aduhelm sales https://graphics.reuters.com/BIOGEN-RESULTS/PREVIEW/xmvjolbjkpr/chart.png 
THE CONTEXT
** The CMS will give its initial decision on whether it will cover the Adulhelm's cost in January 2022, with a final decision expected in April.
** In June, U.S. regulators approved Biogen's aducanumab as the first treatment to attack a likely cause of Alzheimer's disease despite controversy over whether the clinical evidence proves the drug works.
** Last month, U.S. lawmakers sought information from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration related to its accelerated approval of Aduhelm, ratcheting up the pressure on the agency that has come under fire for clearing the drug.

PARIS (Reuters) - French infrastructure group Vinci posted third-quarter sales on Tuesday that surpassed pre-pandemic levels, helped by a ramp-up in public works and more traffic on its motorways.
Europe's biggest construction and concessions firm posted quarterly sales up 7.8% year-on-year to 13.24 billion euros ($15.39 billion), in line with analysts' forecasts and exceeding the 13.13 billion euros it generated in 2019.
Vinci has benefited from several large construction works and a rise in motorway traffic as COVID-19 travel curbs eased across Europe, but labour shortages and high raw material costs have forced it to consider delaying some projects.
However, Vinci's finance chief Christian Labeyrie said that though some projects, in agreement with customers, could be pushed from this year into 2022, this would not impact the firm's net profits.
""We are big enough,"" he told analysts in a call, speaking about the group's core construction business. ""We aren't looking for more volume, but for better quality orders to improve our profit margin.""
Despite the introduction of a European Union-wide COVID vaccine certificate, business at Vinci's smaller airports arm remained sluggish, with passengers nearly 60% below 2019 levels.
This kept revenues from Vinci's airports division, which includes London's Gatwick Airport, down almost 55% from 2019.
The group confirmed its previous guidance that 2021 earnings would not recover to pre-pandemic levels, but they should rise sharply compared to 2020.

It said its energy infrastructure and construction businesses should see full-year growth compared to 2019, while revenues in its motorway division should approach pre-pandemic levels.
The company has not given specific financial forecasts.

Investing.com —  Target  Corporation (NYSE:TGT) said Tuesday that it will be adding even more dedicated Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) at Target shop-in-shop locations.
Shares of Target fell 1% on Tuesday.
The general merchandise retailer said it is more than doubling the number of Apple shops to 36 stores from 17 just in time for holiday shopping to ""offer guests more Apple products and accessories.""
The company said the incredible response to the first locations, which were opened in February, played a significant factor in the move to add more Apple shop-in-shop experiences.
“With the expanded Apple at Target shop-in-shop experiences, we’re elevating this even further. And coupled with the added convenience of our same-day fulfillment services and new price match guarantee all season long, guests know they can turn to Target with confidence during the holidays, whether that’s in store or online,” said Nikhil Nayar, senior vice president of hardlines at Target.
The news comes hot on the heels of Apple's Monday afternoon announcement of its new, revamped Macbook Pro, which saw Apple's stock price close over 1% higher.

1682,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2021 01:42PM ET</span>","China Evergrande shelves stake sale, Kaisa clattered by downgrade","By Clare Jim and Marc Jones
SHANGHAI/LONDON (Reuters) - China's property sector saw more drama on Tuesday as Evergrande shelved plans to sell a majority stake in its property services unit, Sinic formally declared default and Kaisa was crunched by another credit rating cut.
Sources told Reuters that Evergrande, teetering on the brink of collapse with more than $300 billion in debt, had been forced to stall its proposed $2.6 billion, 51% stake sale to smaller rival Hopson Development after failing to win the blessing of the Guangdong provincial government which is overseeing Evergrande's restructuring. 
When contacted, a Hopson representative asked Reuters to await an announcement. Evergrande and the Guangdong provincial government did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. 
Evergrande is scrambling to raise funds to pay its many lenders and suppliers, amid expectations it is about to formally default on one of international bonds.
Hengda Real Estate Group Co, Evergrande's flagship unit, has though transferred funds to pay an 'onshore' bond coupon of 121.8 million yuan ($19 million), sources with knowledge of the matter said.
One said Evergrande, China's No. 2 developer, needs to prioritise its limited funds towards the domestic market where the stakes are much higher for the country's financial system.
While, it was not immediately clear why the Guangdong provincial government has not approved the Evergrande Property Services transaction, some of Evergrande's international creditors had also opposed the deal, the person added.
Another source said the announcement of the deal will be delayed, pending China's regulatory approval. The deal has already won Hong Kong Stock Exchange's special approval, he added.
Reuters reported last week Chinese state-owned Yuexiu Property had pulled out of a proposed $1.7 billion deal to buy Evergrande's Hong Kong headquarters building over worries about the developer's dire financial situation. 
A source said the company had also received guidance from the municipal government of the southern city of Guangzhou to put the purchase on hold at the end of August.
MARKETS ROILED
The liquidity crisis at Evergrande has roiled global markets. High-yield bonds issued by Chinese property developers have been hit especially hard although there have been some signs that markets are beginning to differentiate.
An Evergrande bond due March 23, 2022 will officially be in default if the company does not make good after a 30-day grace period for a missed coupon payment that had been due on Sept. 23.
But the wider offshore bond market has responded positively after assuring comments from China central bank's and coupon payments by two other major developers.
An index of China high-yield debt, which is dominated by property developer issuers, has seen spreads tighten from last week's record levels to around 1,484 points on Tuesday.
Sunac China, which has a $27.14 million payment due Tuesday, has paid its bondholders, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said. 
The source was not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified. A Sunac representative also declined to comment.
Kaisa Group, which was the first Chinese firm to default back in 2015 said on Monday it had paid a coupon due Oct. 16 and it plans to transfer funds for a coupon worth $35.85 million due Oct. 22 on Thursday.
Its bonds slumped as much as 13 cents on the dollar, or nearly 25%, on Tuesday, after Moody's (NYSE:MCO) slashed the firm's credit rating and immediately warned it could be cut again due to default worries.
In the past few days, the People's Bank of China has said spillover effects on the banking system from Evergrande's debt problems were controllable and that China's economy was ""doing well"".

Bonds from other Chinese developers gained on Tuesday including Modern Land's 2022 bonds which bounced over 8% to 40.250 cents on the dollar, Greenland which jumped 6-7 cents and Central China Real Estate's 2024 bonds which climbed 5% to 44.843 cents.
Smaller developer Sinic Holdings became the latest to have its rating put in ""selective default"" by S&P after it defaulted on $246 million in bonds, having warned it was likely to do so last week.

CHICAGO/BERLIN (Reuters) -U.S. farmers are pre-buying seeds and chemicals they need earlier than normal, in a bid to secure supplies for next spring amid sector-wide supply-chain problems, a top executive at German agricultural and pharmaceuticals firm  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) said on Tuesday.
Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) also estimates its average seed prices will go up about 5% for 2022, Liam Condon, president of Bayer's agricultural unit, told Reuters on Tuesday.
""What we're seeing is a pretty robust order book,"" Condon said. ""How extensive that is, it's still too early to call from our point of view. But it's clearly noticeable.""
U.S. farmers have been gearing up for a spike in how much it will cost them to produce their corn and soybean crops next year, amid rising prices of fertilizer, chemicals and seeds due to labor issues, snarled exports and surging demand. 
Bayer sees no impact on its full-year guidance from customers' changing planting habits or a five-week shutdown at its main glyphosate herbicide production site in Louisiana after Hurricane Ida, the German life science group said earlier on Tuesday.
Bayer had to close the Louisiana factory after the hurricane slammed the Gulf Coast in late August, further complicating logistical and supply-chain problems that had already tightened global supplies of fertilizers and chemicals.
Prices in the fertilizer market, which also has been hammered by rising energy costs in Europe and China, are now soaring to levels seen during the global financial crisis.
""We lost five weeks of production. This will, of course, involve some cost that will have an impact on sales, but nothing to any degree that would impact our full-year guidance for this year,"" Condon told investors on Tuesday during an online event.
Asked if rising production costs may push farmers to plant fewer acres of corn - which is a cornerstone of Bayer's performance and tends to be a more expensive crop to produce - and more soybeans, Condon said it was too early to know whether producers might make any such shifts.

However, he said, Bayer would see any changes as seasonal fluctuations rather than anything that could affect the outlook of the company's crop science division. He added that any product price increases would be passed on to Bayer's customers.
""Our strategy has always been to pass on inflation, clearly, into the market,"" Condon said. ""This is the only way we will maintain a sustainable business, and we're confident in our ability to do that.""

(Reuters) -Procter & Gamble Co said on Tuesday it will raise prices of some of its grooming, oral and skin care products in the U.S. to counter higher commodity and freight costs that are expected to take a bigger bite out of its earnings this year.
Shares of the company, which reported lower quarterly earnings, while maintaining its full-year forecasts, were down 2.2% at $139.24.
The latest price increases are in addition to the mid to high single-digit percentage price hikes earlier this year on P&G's products including Pampers diapers and Always sanitary pads.
The new price hikes are not being implemented broadly, but marked for specific items such as razors and in some sub-categories, CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call. U.S. retailers are aware of the new sticker prices, he added.
Global supply chains are under strain due to factors such as a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in Asia and labor shortages in the United States, leading to a surge in raw material prices that is also squeezing profits at Unilever (NYSE:UL) and Reckitt Benckiser.
On Tuesday, P&G raised its commodity and freight costs impact for this fiscal year to $2.3 billion from $1.9 billion.
Schulten blamed the price hikes on warehousing and raw material costs, adding that diesel and energy prices were also trending higher.
""We do not anticipate any easing in these commodity cost pressures, he added.
The Gillette maker said the additional expenses will shave off 90 cents from its full-year earnings per share, compared with a previous forecast of a hit of 70 cents.

P&G kept its full-year forecast for earnings per share growth in the 3% to 6% range and net sales between 2% and 4%, banking on price hikes and higher demand for premium products to help offset the increase in costs.
""We expect pricing to be a larger contributor to sales growth in coming quarters as more of our price increases become effective,"" Schulten said.

(Reuters) -U.S. oilfield firm Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) Co on Tuesday posted its third consecutive quarterly profit and said customer spending in the United States could jump 20% next year, as stronger oil prices and drilling activity boost demand for services and equipment. 
Oil prices have rallied to multi-year highs with global crude futures climbing 4.5% in the quarter ended Sept. 30, helped by OPEC+'s decision to maintain its planned output increase rather than raising it on global supply concerns.
Brent oil futures are trading around $84.4 a barrel, up about 63% so far this year, while benchmark U.S. crude is at roughly $82.5 a barrel, up 70% over the same period. 
""I see a multiyear upcycle unfolding. Structural global commodity tightness drives increased demand for our services, both internationally and in North America,"" Halliburton Chief Executive Officer Jeff Miller said.
Miller said the company is reallocating some equipment to drive better returns, and that it has seen some net pricing gains for its services. Next year's jump in customer spending will be the result of both better pricing and inflation, he said. 
""We expect customers to drill more new wells to offset steep decline rates,"" Miller told investors during a conference call on Tuesday. Companies have begun the tender process for equipment early amid a tight market, he added. 
Houston-based Halliburton posted adjusted net income attributable to the company of $248 million, or 28 cents per share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, up from the $100 million or 11 cents per share reported a year earlier.
Its third-quarter profit was in line with analysts' estimates, while revenue of $3.86 billion was slightly under consensus expectations of $3.912 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES. 
The company had previously guided down its third-quarter expectations due to Hurricane Ida, which caused unexpected downtime in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. 
Halliburton's shares were up 1.2% midday at $26.32, after falling more than 2% in morning activity. They are up 39% year-to-date, trailing gains seen in oil prices. 
Halliburton, a leading provider of hydraulic fracturing services to the U.S. market, is the first major oilfield services firm to report its third-quarter earnings. Rivals Baker Hughes and Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) will report later this week. 

Oilfield firms should be supported by the jump in activity, as the number of active U.S. hydraulic fracturing fleets climbed to 263 in early October, up from around 100 a year ago, according to data from Primary Vision. 
Wall Street analysts said Halliburton's results were neutral to slightly negative, as some financial metrics came in under estimates. They lauded Halliburton's report of $469 million in free cash flow, which topped expectations.

The study was conducted between June and September, when the extremely contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus was predominant.
Yet, the data from 19 pediatric hospitals showed that among the 179 patients who were hospitalized for COVID-19, 97% were unvaccinated, providing reassurance of the vaccine's efficacy.
Of the roughly 16% of patients hospitalized with severe enough COVID-19 to require life support, none were vaccinated.
The CDC report builds on trials done by the companies in this age group that showed high immune response against the virus, but which were not designed to demonstrate efficacy against hospitalization. 
The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is authorized for children as young as 12, and the companies are seeking authorization for use in those as young as five years of age.

LyondellBasell (LYB),  Texas Roadhouse  (NASDAQ:TXRH), and Herc Holdings (NYSE:HRI) are names that possess solid growth attributes. Their earnings are expected to grow significantly this quarter and beyond. So, we think it could be wise to scoop up these stocks now. Let’s give these companies a closer examination.Even though the market remains volatile as supply chain disruptions and rising oil prices further exacerbate the inflationary environment, growth stocks have been witnessing continued investor attention. This is evidenced by the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Growth ETF’s (SPYG) 11.3% returns over the past three months compared to the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Value ETF (SPYV) and the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 3.7% and 7.6% gains, respectively.
While the Federal Reserve recently indicated its willingness to reduce asset purchases before year’s end, benchmark interest rates have been kept near zero for now. And a low-interest-rate environment should keep supporting the business growth of several companies. 
Moreover, analysts expect third-quarter corporate earnings to be strong. According to FactSet, 41 S&P 500 companies have reported third-quarter results so far, with 80% of them topping EPS expectations. And shares of companies reporting earnings growth should soar in the near term.

So, shares of established auto manufacturers Honda Motor (HMC) and Ford Motor (F) should benefit. But which of these two stocks is a better buy now? Read more to find out.Headquartered in Tokyo, Japan, Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (HMC) develops, manufactures, and distributes motorcycles, automobiles, power products, and other products internationally. It operates through four segments: Motorcycle Business; Automobile Business; Financial Services Business; and Life creation and Other Businesses. In comparison, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) in Dearborn, Mich., designs, manufactures, markets, and services a range of Ford trucks, cars, sport utility vehicles, electrified vehicles, and Lincoln luxury vehicles worldwide. It operates through three segments: Automotive; Mobility; and Ford Credit.
Even though a global semiconductor supply crunch has negatively impacted the auto manufacturing industry, massive government and private investments to boost semiconductor production should gradually redress the situation. Moreover, traditional automakers might be the biggest beneficiaries based on their broad portfolio of vehicles and market dominance. According to a report by Market Research Future, the automotive industry is expected to grow at a 4.5% CAGR between 2021 - 2028. Therefore, both HMC and F should benefit.
F’s shares have gained 59.7% in price over the past nine months, while HMC has returned 12.4%. Also, F’s 78.6% gains year-to-date are significantly higher than HMC’s 9%. Moreover, F is the clear winner with 28.3% gains versus HMC’s 0.6% returns in terms of the past six months’ performance.

Investing.com – Dover Corporation stock (NYSE:DOV) rose 3% Tuesday as the company lifted its annual EPS forecast for the third time after its July-September sales and earnings beat analysts’ estimates.
The company now expects its adjusted profit per share for the year to come in between $7.45 and $7.50 compared to the $7.35 estimate at midpoint it had put out in July. It attributed the revision to its record order book that stood at $2.82 billion at close of the quarter, more than 10% higher from the end of June.
The first forecast for the ongoing financial year, given in January, had pegged the adjusted EPS at $6.35.
The revised guidance came as the company grew its revenue and order book across all its five operating segments, namely engineered products, fueling solutions, imaging and identification, pumps and process solutions and refrigeration and food equipment.
It improved its margins year-over-year despite supply chain, logistics, and labor availability challenges that adversely impacted shipment timing in several businesses, most notably in most notably in refrigeration and food equipment and engineered products segments.
Dover warned that it does not expect the third-quarter challenges to abate but said it is counting on its strong order book that provides near-term visibility for the remainder of the year and into 2022.
Revenue in the third quarter rose 15% on-year to $2.01 billion. Adjusted diluted EPS was 24% higher at $1.98.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A Republican member of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on Tuesday said he wants the U.S. telecommunications regulator to begin the process of imposing new restrictions on Chinese drone maker SZ DJI Technology Co.
FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr said the agency should takes steps toward adding DJI, the world's largest dronemaker, to the so-called ""Covered List"" that would prohibit U.S. Universal Service Fund money from being used to purchase its equipment. 
DJI, which accounts for more than 50% of U.S. drone sales, said its ""drones are safe and secure for critical and sensitive operations... Our customers know that DJI drones remain the most capable and most affordable products for a wide variety of uses, including sensitive industrial and government work.""
In March, the FCC designated five Chinese companies as posing a threat to national security under a 2019 law aimed at protecting U.S. communications networks.
The FCC named Huawei Technologies Co, ZTE Corp (HK:0763), Hytera Communications Corp <002583.SZ), Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co and Zhejiang Dahua Technology Co.
Carr noted that the FCC has a separate ongoing effort to decide whether to continue approving equipment from entities on the Covered List for use in the United States.
""DJI drones and the surveillance technology on board these systems are collecting vast amounts of sensitive data-everything from high-resolution images of critical infrastructure to facial recognition technology and remote sensors that can measure an individual’s body temperature and heart rate,"" Carr said in a statement. ""We do not need an airborne version of Huawei.""
He said the FCC in consultation with national security agencies ""should also consider whether there are additional entities that warrant closer scrutiny.""
In December, DJI was added by the U.S. Commerce Department to the U.S. government’s economic blacklist.

In January 2020, the U.S. Interior Department said it was grounding its fleet of about 800 Chinese-made drones, and earlier halted additional Interior Department purchases of such drones.
In May 2019, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security warned U.S. firms of the risks to company data from Chinese-made drones.

DETROIT (Reuters) -Volkswagen AG's top Americas executive said on Tuesday the global semiconductor chip shortage will run well into next year.
""Without a doubt, this shortage is going to go well into 2022, at least the second half of '22,"" Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) Group of America Chief Executive Scott Keogh said at the Reuters Events Automotive Summit.
The shortage of chips has led automakers around the world to curtail vehicle production, but also driven up profit as vehicle prices have risen. Carmakers use chips in everything from brake sensors to power steering to entertainment systems.
Keogh added that while the issue may ease in the fourth quarter of this year, the industry still cannot meet market demand for vehicles.
He said one likely shift in the near future is that automakers will try to reduce the number of chips needed in each part of the cars and trucks. 
""Historically, we've made decision as if chips were nearly infinite, so each and every module required a chip, every window lift, every modulator,"" he said. ""There's ways that we start to look at it when we develop the cars, can we do more modules with less chips? It can be done. These are all things we are looking at.""
As for talk that the U.S. government should simply fund the building of additional chip plants, Keogh said it will take billions of dollars and at least four years to do that. ""I don't know if picking up a phone to the government is the solution on the chip shortage.""

While chips are the current challenge, the next will be the growing demand for electric vehicles and the batteries needed to power them, Keogh said. 
While VW's plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, will obtain its batteries from SK Innovation's Georgia plant, the German automaker will have additional announcements regarding batteries when it starts rolling out the next wave of EVs, he said.

The company, founded in 2009, lets users rent and shop second-hand clothes and accessories such as handbags and jewelry in over 18,000 styles from more than 750 designer brands. It also allows customers to rent and shop home goods.
Rent the Runway plans to sell 15 million shares priced between $18.00 and $21.00 apiece in its IPO, raising $315 million, according to a regulator filing https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1468327/000119312521301156/d194411ds1a.htm.
On a fully diluted basis, which includes securities such as stock options and restricted stock units, Rent the Runway is seeking a valuation of nearly $1.46 billion. On a non-diluted basis, the IPO values the company at $1.3 billion.
Earlier this month, the Brooklyn, New York-based company disclosed a near 39% drop in revenue for the fiscal year 2020. Its top line also took a hit in the first half of this fiscal year, with revenue down 9% in the period ended July 31.
Rent the Runway said its active subscribers more than doubled to 111,732 in the first nine months of 2021.

Demand for second-hand clothes has jumped in recent months as customers become increasingly conscious about their carbon footprint, boosting revenues at styling service  Stitch Fix  (NASDAQ:SFIX) and online resale shop ThredUp.
Goldman Sachs & Co (NYSE:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) are the lead underwriters for the offering. Rent the Runway will list its stock on the Nasdaq under the symbol ""RENT"".

BEAUMONT, Texas (Reuters) - The U.S. National Labor Relations Board is expected to schedule a mid-November vote on removing the United Steelworkers union from  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM)'s Beaumont, Texas, refinery, a person familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. 
Exxon locked out union members on May 1 after it and the USW were unable to agree on a new, six-year labor contract for the refinery and oil-blending and packaging plant. A vote on Exxon's proposed contract is ongoing and results are due this evening. 
At least 30% of the plant's 650 members separately signed a petition calling for an NLRB vote to decertify the local union. Decertification is the formal name for the removal process. 
An Exxon spokesperson was not immediately available to comment on the vote timing. The NLRB did not reply to a request for comment. 

The NLRB will first consider the union's charge that Exxon improperly aided the removal petition before releasing any results from the vote, the person familiar with the matter said.
The USW in April filed a complaint with the NLRB alleging Exxon had violated federal law by providing an employee with decertification materials, employee email addresses and use of a company computer and email system to campaign for decertification.

(Reuters) -Some positive earnings and defensive buying kept Europe's main stock index in the black on Tuesday, helping offset losses in Sweden's Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) and French consumer goods giant Danone after downbeat results.
The pan-European STOXX 600 rose 0.3%, staying close to one-month highs. Utilities and industrials led gains, while German reinsurer Munich Re rose 2.6% after doubling its profit in the third quarter.
Some upbeat earnings from Wall Street, including Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Travelers (NYSE:TRV), also boosted sentiment. (N) 
Capping gains were food and beverage names after Danone warned of growing inflationary pressures next year, pulling France's CAC40 index 0.1% lower. Danone, peers Nestle and Unilever (NYSE:UL) slipped between 1.3% and 3%. 
Telecom stocks followed, down 0.8% as Sweden's Ericsson and Tele2 fell 3.7% and 4.3%, respectively, after earnings. Ericsson announced plans to reduce its operations in China after suffering a big sales drop in one of its biggest markets. 
As Europe's third-quarter reporting season kicks into high gear, investors are scrutinising company results for any signs that supply-chain strains, labour shortages and surging energy prices are starting to undermine profits.
Third-quarter profits at European companies are expected to grow 47.6% from the same period in 2020, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S data, with earnings revisions by analysts cooling recently but still remaining positive.
""It's hard to see how further optimism about earnings would boost the market too much at this point just because of how much good news is already discounted in share prices,"" said Thomas Mathews, markets economist at Capital Economics.
The STOXX 600 has gained almost 3% so far in October after a 3.4% drop in the previous month, as investors turned to riskier assets in expectation of a steady earnings season.
""With rates starting to rise and inflation picking up, the days of big, sustained rallies in the market are over, but we can expect to see European equities grinding higher for a while,"" said Mathews. 
Investors have been aggressively pricing in interest rate hikes, particularly in the UK, to offset a surge in energy prices and other bottlenecks driving general prices higher.
