NEW YORK (Reuters) - A selloff in cryptocurrencies, high-growth stocks and other high-flying assets may be signalling a more cautious outlook among market participants after a stretch of rampant exuberance, investors and analysts said.
Few believe the bull run that broader U.S. stock markets have experienced over the past year is set for a reversal. Still, concerns are growing that a looming rise in inflation combined with a potential peak in U.S. economic growth could force investors to cut down on risk in their portfolios, hurting many of the assets that shot higher earlier this year.
""Higher-risk assets, whether in the form ... of cryptocurrencies or the more speculative growth stocks, are seeing their multiples taken down markedly as investors begin to reassess what impact the potential for inflation will have,"" said David Mazza, managing director at Direxion. 
Wednesday's selloff zeroed in on many of the assets that rallied the most over the last year. Bitcoin dropped to its lowest levels since January, while Cathie Wood's ARK Innovation ETF - the top-performing U.S. equity fund in 2020 - slid another 2.5% to leave it down 15.3% since the start of the month. Bitcoin is up 34% for the year to date while ARK is down 17.2%. 
Energy stocks in the S&P 500 fell 2.5%, dampening their rally of more than 30% since January, while the FANG Index - a measure of large technology names that led the market higher last year - rose 0.7%. It remains up just 3.5% since the start of the year. The S&P 500 is up 84% from its March 2020 lows and has risen 9.9% this year.
Minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest meeting, released on Wednesday afternoon, showed that a ""number"" of Fed officials appeared ready to consider changes to monetary policy based on a continued strong economic recovery - a potential negative for risk assets that have thrived from unprecedented stimulus. That meeting, however, took place before the release of April's anemic job data.
""They were thinking about thinking about tapering (quantitative easing) asset purchases if the economy continues on this rapid recovery and they get closer to meeting the dual mandates,"" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist at Oxford Economics. ""Our view is they probably pre-announce tapering at Jackson Hole in August and they actually start to taper back the asset purchases at the beginning of next year.""
Fed officials have pledged to keep their ultra-loose, crisis-fighting policies in place, betting that the unexpected surge in consumer prices last month stems from temporary forces that will ease on their own.
""We think there's still more room to run but that doesn't mean that there wasn't froth in certain parts of the market,"" said Brian Jacobsen, a senior investment strategist for the Multi-Asset Solutions team at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Asset Management. ""This bull market came out of the gate really quickly and you are bound to get some muscle cramps along the way.""
Concerns over inflation - or at least how investors will react to signs of rising consumer prices - have proliferated in recent weeks. 
Fund managers in a survey from BoFA Global Research released on Tuesday named inflation as the top risk to markets, while BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), the world’s largest asset manager, said a market overreaction to an inflation overshoot is a risk accompanying its recommendation of an overweight equity position. 
“The recent sell-off in tech shares, despite strong first-quarter earnings, illustrates the potential for hitting air pockets as the economic restart unfolds,” the firm said earlier this week. “This may create opportunities in a sector benefiting from structural trends.”
Mazza, of Direxion, expects that inflation worries will be short-lived, leaving some of the growth names that have sold off in May more attractive over the next 12 months. 

The Russell 1000 Value index, for instance, is up 15% for the year to date, while the Russell 1000 Growth index is up 2.6%. 
""It's very difficult to see a situation where value continues to outperform growth by the same extent through 2022,"" he said.

1,By Reuters,"<span>May 19, 2021 11:10PM ET</span>",An audit gave the all-clear. Others alleged slavery,"By A. Ananthalakshmi, Liz Lee and Mei Mei Chu
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - In December 2020, with coronavirus infections spreading rapidly across factories and workers' dormitories in Malaysia, officials raided latex glove maker Brightway Holdings near Kuala Lumpur. They said they found workers living in shipping containers, under conditions so squalid that human resources minister M. Saravanan later likened them to ""modern slavery.""
Nineteen months earlier, inspectors from a social-auditing firm - private contractors that help companies monitor environmental, social and other ethical standards in industries from toys to palm oil - had visited the same three facilities. In three reports over 350 pages, they had detailed 61 violations of global ethical standards and checked boxes for 50 violations of Malaysian labour laws.
Even so, the executive summary of each report concluded: ""There is no forced, bonded or involuntary prison labour hired in this facility.""
Brightway's customers include some of the world's biggest suppliers of personal care and protective equipment. The company's managing director, G. Baskaran, shared the audit reports from 2019 and 2020 with Reuters in April, saying they show that ""we did not practice any form of forced labour or modern slavery.""
These contrasting conclusions highlight little-known flaws in global efforts to monitor labour conditions. Social audits - independent reports used by global brands to test that their suppliers meet ethical norms – are not always effective in identifying labour risks, and can even obscure them, more than two dozen auditors, oversight bodies, factory workers and labour rights groups told Reuters. 
Laws around the world prohibit the use of forced labour, but no rules govern the quality of audits, which are voluntary, audit firms told Reuters. Auditors are usually paid by the firms they are auditing, raising potential conflicts of interest if inspectors feel compelled to give positive reports to retain business. Beyond this, inspectors and Brightway workers told Reuters, companies can manipulate what auditors see on site. 
There is no evidence of any impropriety by the auditor Brightway hired, British firm Intertek Group (LON:ITRK), which declined to comment on Brightway. Intertek said its audits meet stringent operational procedures with rigorous standards, and are themselves subject to regular and thorough independent audits. It did not say by whom. 
Neither Saravanan, the Malaysian cabinet minister who criticized Brightway on national TV, nor his ministry responded to requests for further comment.
INVESTIGATION
About a month after the Malaysia raids, U.S. Customs and Border Protection opened investigations into Brightway. U.S. Customs is examining forced labour allegations including debt bondage, excessive overtime and poor accommodation, according to a letter the agency sent to Nepal-based independent labour rights activist Andy Hall after he drew the agency's attention to details in the audit report. Reuters reviewed a copy of the letter. 
In response, Brightway said U.S. Customs has not asked the company for any details.
U.S. Customs said it does not comment on whether it is investigating specific entities. Companies it looks into submit audit reports during that process, and some reports it has seen have been ""insufficient,"" a Customs official told Reuters.
""Many companies are not willing to get a candid assessment of their forced labour vulnerabilities because of the implications that can have on their reputation, their profitability, and their stockholders,"" said Ana Hinojosa, an executive director at CBP's trade office, which investigates forced labour allegations.
Two other social auditors who reviewed the Brightway reports for Reuters said some of the findings may indicate forced labour as defined by the International Labour Organization, which has set out 11 indicators that point to ""the possible existence of a forced labour case."" The relevant findings in the Brightway reports were: excessive working hours, high recruitment fees paid by workers to agents, and unsafe living and working conditions.
Labour activist Hall said the Brightway reports' conclusions were ""completely misleading"" because they overlooked evidence contained in the reports themselves. Customers who only read executive summaries would miss such evidence, he said.
WHAT THE AUDITOR SAW
Malaysia is a manufacturing hub for everything from palm oil to iPhone components. Firms there employ migrants from countries including Bangladesh and Nepal and have faced the highest number of U.S. sanctions over forced labour allegations after China. In the last two years, U.S. Customs has excluded purchases from four Malaysian companies after finding what it called reasonable evidence of forced labour.
The Brightway raid came as the United States had barred another glove maker, Top Glove, over forced labour allegations. Top Glove said in April it had resolved the issues that led to the ban, but the sanctions remain in place and U.S. authorities seized two shipments of the company's gloves this month. 
At the time of the Brightway raid, Malaysian authorities were inspecting companies across the country to try to ensure worker accommodation did not become a vector for COVID-19 infection, and to avert further claims they abused workers.
As part of efforts to get the bans revoked, Malaysian companies have given millions of dollars to workers to repay recruitment fees that the workers have paid to middlemen. These fees can be onerous, forcing workers into debt.
In the Brightway case, recruitment fees were among problems inspectors had highlighted in the body of the reports. All 78 workers interviewed at the three facilities told inspectors they had paid recruitment fees of up to $4,200 each to agents.
Other points the inspectors noted include a dormitory in the same compound as the factory and a dorm without any beds or mattresses; different signatures on some workers' passports than on their employment contracts; and people working as many as 15 hours a day. 
Malaysia's constitution prohibits forced labour, and the country has several laws that address safety, accommodation, working hours and other workers' rights. Brightway now faces a total of 30 charges for violating a law on minimum standards of housing and amenities, the Malaysian labour department said in December.
Brightway did not comment on these charges. Asked about the authorities' claim that workers were living in shipping containers, Brightway's Baskaran told Reuters the government inspectors were mistaken: The workers' quarters were covered with metal decking, which could have been misconstrued as containers, he said.
Brightway says it is not responsible for alleged violations such as recruiters charging hiring fees or imposing long hours, because it does not charge fees and overtime hours were in accordance with Malaysian laws. It said its dormitories were congested, ""purely due to the COVID situation,"" because it had converted a warehouse into temporary accommodation. 
After the December raid, Brightway paid its 2,719 workers 38 million ringgit ($9.21 million), to repay their recruitment fees, Baskaran said. 
Asked about the audit findings on forced labour indicators, he said, ""it depends on how you interpret forced labour."" 
RED FLAGS
Brightway's customers include  Kimberly Clark  of the United States, whose brands include Kleenex and Andrex; Australian personal protective equipment supplier Ansell; and the UK's National Health Service. All declined to comment in detail on Intertek's reports. Ansell told Reuters the audits, when it inspected them, ""revealed several non-compliances with labour standards."" 
Ansell and Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) both said Brightway had corrected some of these problems since the government raid in December.
Kimberly-Clark spokesman Terry Balluck said the company was ""keenly aware of the real-life challenges with an effective audit,"" but added that every audit identifies ""some issue or opportunity,"" and audits continue to be an effective tool to safeguard workers at all levels. 
Ansell said audits are a key tool that should be supplemented with dialogue and communication with suppliers.The NHS directed queries to the U.K. Department of Health and Social Care. A spokesman said, ""all our suppliers must follow the highest legal and ethical standards or they can be blocked from applying for future contracts."" 
The International Labour Organization did not comment on the Brightway audit, but said it was aware of doubts over how effectively such private initiatives protect workers' rights. 
""There is also the question about what happens before and after the audits, and how the violations detected are addressed,"" the UN agency said in an email.
Five Brightway workers told Reuters they had been informed in advance by their supervisors of planned audits. They said they were asked to clean their hostels ahead of time and provide only positive feedback about the company on their food, hostel facilities and access to passports.
All five, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Brightway usually withholds workers' passports but places them in their personal lockers on days auditors visit. Retention of passports by an employer is considered a forced labour indicator by the ILO.
Brightway's Baskaran said workers can access their passports any time in the lockers, for which they have keys. Brightway does not prepare workers for the audit, but there are efforts to clean hostels, he said.

""During audits, just like everything else, it is a norm to put in extra effort to clean up the place, amongst other activities,"" he said.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down Thursday morning after the U.S. Federal Reserve hinted that debate on tapering asset purchases has already begun. Investors also digested trade and employment data from Japan and Australia respectively.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 inched down 0.06% by 10:28 PM ET (1:45 AM GMT) as April trade data released earlier in the day outperformed expectations. Exports grew 38% year-on-year, imports grew 12.8% year-on-year and the trade balance stood at JPY255.3 billion.
In Australia, the ASX 200 rose 0.88%. The country’s employment data for April was mixed, with the employment change declined by 36,000 jobs while the unemployment rate fell to a year-low of 5.5%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.51% while the Shenzhen Component edged up 0.16% after the People’s Bank of China released its loan prime rate earlier in the day.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.93% and South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.67% after both markets reopened after a holiday.
The Fed’s hint came as the minutes from its April policy meeting were released on Wednesday, which said that ""a number of participants suggested that if the economy continued to make rapid progress toward the Fed’s goals, it might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meetings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchases.”
The statement caught some investors off guard.
“It was a surprise to hear the talk about Fed tapering... the market had been thinking there might be a couple of months before you really saw this particular issue come into focus,” J.P. Morgan Global Research Chair Joyce Chang told Bloomberg. However, she added that it is not the time to bet against the current broader fundamentals on the outlook for growth.
Other investors were less fazed by the Fed’s hint.
""This is very much the market view, really,"" ING economist Rob Carnell told Reuters, with the Fed expected to drop strong tapering hints by summertime and potentially shift its current dovish monetary policy by the end of the year.
""This is taking us to where we think we're going to go, and perhaps this removes a little bit of uncertainty around that, so you get a slight increase in bond yields and the dollar rallying a little bit,” he added.
The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield steadied after climbing to 1.67%.
Meanwhile, volatility continued to the name of the game in cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin recorded a drop and rally of about 30%, all in the same day while other virtual currencies such as Ether posted losses from a recent selloff. Cryptocurrency-exposed shares, including  Coinbase Global  Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN), also dropped."
3,By Reuters,"<span>May 19, 2021 09:05PM ET</span>","Exclusive-Ford Motor, SK Innovation to announce EV battery joint venture -sources","By Ben Klayman and Heekyong Yang
DETROIT/SEOUL (Reuters) -Ford Motor Co and South Korean battery maker SK Innovation are set to launch a battery joint venture in the United States to support the ramp-up of the No. 2 U.S. automaker's electric vehicle rollout, two people familiar with the matter said.
A memorandum of understanding about the joint venture will be announced on Thursday, the sources, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters. The deal may eventually include a jointly owned plant to make battery cells for use in rechargeable EV batteries, the sources said.
Ford declined to comment other than to say SK is a valued supplier, but scheduled a conference call for 9 a.m. ET on Thursday to provide ""an update on Ford batteries."" SK Innovation said in a statement it does not comment on specific projects for reasons of client confidentiality.
Talks around the joint venture picked up speed last month after SK Innovation agreed to pay $1.8 billion to LG Energy Solution, a wholly owned subsidiary of LG Chem Ltd, to settle LG's accusations of trade theft by its rival, one of the sources said.
The dispute, which the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden had been on the verge of settling with a ruling, had put SK Innovation's battery cell plant in Georgia at risk. That plant, which is under construction, will serve Ford and Germany's Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY).
Biden on Tuesday called for government grants for new battery production facilities as part of a $174 billion EV proposal during a visit to a Ford EV plant in Michigan. He also referenced his administration's role in brokering the settlement between SK and LG Chem.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in is scheduled to arrive in Washington on Thursday for a four-day stay that will include a visit to SK's Georgia plant. The Ford-SK joint venture will highlight close U.S. and South Korean ties on EVs, a key priority for Biden.
SK Innovation is expected to complete the Georgia plant's construction later this year, and is building a second facility next door that is expected to start battery production in 2023. The company has invested $2.6 billion in Georgia.
SK Innovation, with battery production sites in the United States, Hungary, China and South Korea, has an annual capacity of about 40 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of batteries. It aims to ramp up to an annual capacity of about 125 GWh of batteries in 2025, which can power about 1.8 million electric vehicles. 
A deal with SK may have Ford taking a similar path as rival General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), which has a battery joint venture with LG Energy that is building plants in Ohio and Tennessee.
The status of these battery plants is key to the United Auto Workers union, which represents GM and Ford's U.S. hourly plant workers. The union has pressed the automakers to allow workers at these plants to unionize, an approach Biden has backed.
Ford is pushing to electrify key models in its lineup, including the Transit van late this year and F-150 pickup mid-2022, and already sells the all-electric Mustang Mach-E SUV. It has said it will invest $22 billion in electrification through 2025.
The Dearborn, Michigan-based company has repeatedly stepped up efforts around batteries, with Chief Executive Jim Farley stating several times the automaker was looking at making its own batteries. Last month, after Ford reported quarterly results, he said things have changed as the automaker has boosted its EV volumes.
""We've totally entered a different zone ... so we've already made the decision to vertically integrate the company,"" he said on a conference call with analysts.

""We're now building motors, e-axles now, we've been writing our own battery management software for quite some time, and now it's time for us to lock in on the latest technology and to have a secure cell production relationship.""
While saying Ford had no news to announce, Farley added, ""To be competitive in this industry, a major brand like Ford will have to vertically integrate all the way through the system.""

4,By Reuters,"<span>May 19, 2021 08:56PM ET</span>",BlackRock's climate views put it center stage in Exxon boardroom fight,"By Jennifer Hiller and Ross Kerber
HOUSTON/BOSTON (Reuters) - Top asset manager BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) could determine the outcome of a proxy fight between  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and a hedge fund seeking to reshape the oil giant's board and future direction. 
Exxon's 12 directors are up for election on May 26, in a vote that offers a high profile test of BlackRock's approach to getting companies set a course to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius by 2050. Exxon stresses it is on a path to meet the Paris accord with a market-based approach. 
Forced board changes or splitting chairman and CEO roles would be a blow to the company's management. Unlike rivals that predict peak demand within a decade, Exxon's board has built plans that forecast growing appetite for oil and gas. 
BlackRock this year has vowed to hold corporate directors' feet to the fire on environmental matters and has done so for instance by voting against a director on another high-profile corporate ballot. 
Its votes could help hedge fund Engine No.1 gain seats on the board. The fund says Exxon continues to overspend on fossil fuels and lacks a clear strategy to prepare for a world demanding cleaner fuels. The May 26 vote has become the first major shareholder contest where climate change is the central issue. 
BACKING ESG PROPOSALS
BlackRock declined to comment on its stance on Exxon. It is the second-largest Exxon shareholder with an about 6.6% stake, and has met with Exxon executives twice as often as  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) and BP (NYSE:BP), according to its disclosures. Smaller investors have publicly supported Engine No.1's directors.
The $9 trillion asset manager's chief executive, Larry Fink, in January in his annual letter to CEOs asked for companies to lay out a strategy to operate in a net-zero economy.
In the first quarter, it backed three-quarters of environment and social-focused shareholder resolutions, compared with less than 10% a year ago. 
Some activists say BlackRock's voting to date has not fully met their expectations. But it has issued greater details about its voting practices, offering insight into what corporations should expect.
A recent disclosure showed BlackRock voted against a director at Woodside (OTC:WOPEY) Petroleum Ltd last month to express concerns with Woodside's climate targets. Woodside declined to comment.
BlackRock also voted last year against two Exxon directors, citing a lack of progress in climate reporting. In both cases, directors were re-elected though Exxon ultimately released more greenhouse gas emissions data.
'CONSTRUCTIVE' TALKS
Some Exxon holders said the pressure is on BlackRock to uphold its tougher goals in voting Exxon shares this year. Governance advisers ISS, Glass, Lewis & Co and PIRC have recommended votes for some or all the dissident nominees for Exxon.
""Investors who understand the importance of overhauling Exxon's board of directors know that major investors, like BlackRock and others, can push our efforts over the top,"" said New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. New York's pension funds have backed the call by Engine No.1 for change at Exxon. 
Church Commissioners for England, which manages the Church of England's investment fund, expects large asset managers ""to vote for the entire dissident slate in line with their stated climate and sustainability goals,"" said Bess Joffe, head of responsible investment.
Exxon's talks with investors overall have been constructive, said spokesman Casey Norton. ""We value their views and welcome input,"" he said. 

Exxon's lack of a target for restricting customers emissions makes it likely BlackRock would not support its director slate, said Kathryn Mulvey, a campaign director at climate activists Union of Concerned Scientists. Engine No.1 ""explicitly calls out"" Exxon for failing to set so-called Scope 3, or customer emissions targets, she said.
However, Exxon has embraced measures to meet BlackRock's and other investors' climate and governance goals, including expanding its board, pledging to increase spending on lower-carbon initiatives, and reducing the intensity of its oilfield greenhouse gas emissions.

5,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 19, 2021 08:18PM ET</span>",Oatly Prices IPO at Top of Range to Raise $1.4 Billion,"(Bloomberg) -- Oatly Group AB, the vegan food and drink maker, priced its initial public offering at the top of a marketed range to raise more than $1.4 billion.
The company and its investors sold more than 84 million American depositary shares for $17 each on Wednesday, according to a statement. The Swedish company had offered the shares for $15 to $17 each.
The listing gives Oatly a market value of about $10 billion based on the outstanding shares listed in its filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
U.S. markets dropped for the third day in a row, with the S&P 500 index falling 0.3% Wednesday.
The IPO underscores plant-based products’ jump into the mainstream, as environmental and health concerns spur consumers to seek alternatives to traditional meat and dairy products. Investors have been looking for ways to replicate the public-market success of Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) Inc., whose shares have surged more than 300% since it went public in May 2019.
Oatly was started in 1994 by brothers Rickard and Bjorn Oste. Using technology based on research from Sweden’s Lund University, the company turns fiber-rich oats into liquid food.
In July, Oatly secured $200 million in new capital from investors led by Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc. The group also included celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey and Jay-Z, as well as former  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX). founder Howard Schultz. The company was valued at about $2 billion in the round.
Oatly’s offering is being led by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG. The shares are expected to begin trading Thursday on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol OTLY.

6,By Reuters,"<span>May 19, 2021 08:11PM ET</span>",Oprah-backed Oatly raises $1.4 billion in IPO,"By Echo Wang and Anirban Sen
(Reuters) -Swedish vegan milk maker Oatly Group AB, which counts celebrities Oprah Winfrey and Natalie Portman among its backers, raised $1.4 billion in its U.S. initial public offering on Wednesday, the company said in a statement. 
The company, whose investors also include rapper Jay Z and former  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) head Howard Schultz, said it priced 84.4 million American depositary shares in the initial public offering at $17 each, at the top of its indicated range. This implies a valuation for the company of $10 billion. 
Oatly's share sale comes in the middle of a crucial juncture for the U.S. IPO market, which is facing significant volatility due to inflation fears that have forced investors to abandon high-growth stocks, focusing on value stocks instead. 
The outcome of offerings this week is being watched for clues on the near-term future of the U.S. capital markets, which have witnessed a stunning rally over the past 15 months as share sales of hundreds of companies, including big names such as Airbnb, Snowflake and DoorDash, breached all-time records. 
Last week, at least three IPOs, including mortgage insurer Enact Holdings Inc and hearing care services company Hear.com, were pulled due to choppy market conditions. 
The Malmö, Sweden based maker of dairy alternatives sells its products in more than 20 markets across Europe, the United States and China. Known primarily for its oat milk products, it has tie-ups with several cafes in the United States, including Starbucks. It also sells its products online and through food retailers like  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) and Tesco (OTC:TSCDY).
The stock market listing comes at a time when the plant-based food sector continues to attract mainstream investor attention, especially as fast-food chains and upscale restaurants create new menus to draw in health and environment-conscious diners.
Much of the demand for plant-based food is being led by millennials and generation Z consumers, who are more than willing to spend on sustainable products that are also healthy.
Last year, Oatly, founded by brothers Rickard and Björn Öste in 1990, raised $200 million in a star-studded investment round led by private equity firm Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) and including Winfrey, Portman, an entertainment company founded by Jay Z and Schultz.
Oatly's biggest shareholder is a partnership between Belgian investment firm Verlinvest and an entity called Blossom Key Holdings, which is controlled by China Resources Co Ltd, a Chinese government-owned company. 

Verlinvest is the investment company of the family behind brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev. Private equity firm Blackstone also owns a sizable stake in Oatly. 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), J.P.Morgan and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) are among the lead underwriters for the offering.

7,By Reuters,"<span>May 19, 2021 08:01PM ET</span>","For some of Japan's lonely workers, COVID-19 brings a homecoming","By Tim Kelly
TOKYO (Reuters) - After four years spent working and living alone, far from his family and friends, Tsuyoshi Tatebayashi packed his bags at the end of March and returned, at last, to his wife and two daughters.
Like hundreds of thousands of other white-collar workers, the 44-year-old IT engineer had been on a solo assignment, known as ""tanshin funin"", and wasn't expecting to return to his family so soon. 
But as the COVID-19 pandemic dragged on, his employer, Fujitsu, decided to bring its far-flung workers home, becoming one of Japan's first big firms to make a start in ending the long-established practice.
Solo assignments have been a regular duty for white collar workers since at least Japan's recovery from wartime devastation, becoming a crucial step in career progression despite their unpopularity among many workers. 
""If it can be helped, I don't want to have to go on a solo assignment again,"" Tatebayashi said from his home in Fukuoka, around 1,000 km (600 miles) from his work base near Tokyo. Tatebayashi was one of 4,000 solo workers at the IT consulting and equipment maker.
Manabu Morikawa, a Fujitsu personnel manager, said technology has made remote work possible and ending the unpopular practice may help Fujitsu hire workers.
""There had been discussion in the past about people working away from their families, but COVID-19 provided the impetus for change,"" Morikawa said. 
Snack maker Calbee Inc is another scrapping the practice, last year abolishing most solo assignments.
Solo workers at companies where teleworking has become a norm for all employees are also going home. At some, including Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings and beverage maker Kirin Holdings, that change may be permanent.
""There are cases where employees go back to where their families are,"" said Russell Roll, a spokesman for Kirin, adding pandemic work-at-home measures were open ended. 
Mitsubishi Chemical's new head office in Tokyo will only have enough desks for 60% of employees assigned there.
For the entire system to change, however, banks such as Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Financial Group, which need to staff extensive branch networks, and major manufacturers such as  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, would have to end the practice as well.
""Transfers are a positive step from viewpoint of the outcome by both matching the right person for the right job at the company and the career development of the employee,"" Toyota spokeswoman, Shiori Hashimoto said.
Toyota is keeping solo assignments but has also expanded work at home for all employees, she added.
An spokesman at MUFG, which is sticking with solo assignments, declined to comment when asked about their merit. 
UNPOPULAR
Firms move people every few years to nurture managers with broad experience and also as a way to ensure supplier relationships don't encourage fraud, said Rochelle Kopp, the founder of consulting firm Japan Intercultural.
""Under Japanese labour law, if you are a permanent employee, refusing a job transfer or other job assignment is the same as saying that you are quitting,"" said Kopp. ""It's so commonplace that people just think it's normal."" 
Many solo workers are middle-aged men who transfer alone to avoid disrupting family life.
Researchers at Ritsumeikan University, using census data and government surveys, estimate there may be as many as 1 million solo workers. 
On average, solo workers get an allowance of 47,000 yen ($432) a month to cover housing costs and a trips homes, according to the labour ministry.
But more than two-thirds of 3,131 respondents in a survey published by the Asahi newspaper last February described the assignments as unnecessary. Only 41 people said they were happy with them as they were.
""To get promoted, you have to do solo assignments, although it means missing out on seeing your children grow up,"" said a YouTuber, who identified himself as Nishigami. 
Nishigami, who has been alone in Tokyo for three years working for an IT company, posts videos for first-time solo workers with advice on furnishing small apartments and living frugally. 
BACK HOME 
During his four year stint in Yokohama, Tatebayashi saw his family once every two months, even less when pandemic lockdowns curbed travel. Most other weekends he worked, hung out with Fujitsu colleagues or played computer games.
He chose to live alone because he had just bought a house in Fukuoka and didn't want to take his daughters, then six and 10, out of school or away from their grandparents nearby. 
Japan's government has largely ignored solo workers in recent labour reforms that focus instead on curbing excessive overtime following several deaths from overwork, known as ""karoshi"".
Tatebayashi reckoned it will take a month or so for family life to return to normal in Fukuoka.
""My kids are happy about it because we can play together, but my wife says she'll find it hard to relax if I am around the house all the time,"" he said. 

He and most other Fujitsu employees welcome the end of solo assignments, but according to personnel manager Morikawa it has posed a problem for a few of Fujitsu's long-term corporate nomads.

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) was hit on Wednesday with five new lawsuits by women who worked in corporate or warehouse management roles, and accused the online retailer of gender bias, racial bias or both.
The women, ages 23 to 64, accused Amazon of favoring men over women in career growth, allowing supervisors to denigrate them, and retaliating after they complained.
Two plaintiffs are Black, one is Latina, one is Asian-American and one is white. They filed their lawsuits in federal courts in Arizona, California, Delaware and Amazon's hometown of Seattle.
An Amazon spokesman said the company has found no evidence supporting the accusations. He also said Amazon does not tolerate discrimination or harassment, and supports a ""diverse, equitable and inclusive culture.""
The lawsuits were filed by the Wigdor law firm, which also represents a Black manager at Amazon Web Services who sued in March over alleged systemic discrimination.
Wednesday's plaintiffs included Cindy Warner, a gay executive in that unit, who said a male manager openly called her a ""bitch,"" an ""idiot"" and a ""nobody,"" and that Amazon terminated her job after learning she had hired a lawyer.
Pearl Thomas, one of the Black plaintiffs, said a human resources employee downplayed concerns about her treatment by saying Thomas was upset by current events and that ""my name is not Derek Chauvin,"" the white former Minneapolis police officer convicted of murdering George Floyd.
The Wigdor firm has also represented women who accused now-convicted movie producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct, and Fox News employees alleging bias or harassment there.
In April, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said his company needed to take care of employees better, and Amazon said it wanted more Blacks in senior and corporate roles.

Amazon ended 2020 with about 1.3 million full- and part-time employees.
The company is urging shareholders at its May 26 annual meeting to reject a proposal requiring an independent audit analyzing its ""impacts on civil rights, equity, diversity and inclusion.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks on Wall Street ended down but well off session lows on Wednesday as minutes from the last U.S. Federal Reserve meeting showed participants agreed the U.S. economy remained far from the central bank's goals.
But trading was choppy, with stocks initially extending losses following the minutes while U.S. Treasury yields and the U.S. dollar index jumped, as the minutes also showed Fed policymakers hinted at a possible shift in future policy.
Minutes of the U.S. central bank's April 27-28 meeting said a number of Fed policymakers thought that if the economy continued rapid progress, it would be appropriate ""at some point"" in upcoming meetings to begin discussing tapering government bond purchases.
The mere hint of ""taper talk"" was enough to spark a selloff in bonds and send stocks lower, said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist and senior trader at Incapital.
Investors have been speculating whether rising U.S. inflationary pressures could prompt the Fed to pare back its support sooner than many anticipate.
""Anything short of reinforcing the uber-dovish stance the Fed has had is, at a time when the market is already getting a little jittery with regard to inflation, is what's compounding the sell-off, which could have been catalyzed by next to anything,"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 164.62 points, or 0.48%, to 33,896.04, the S&P 500 lost 12.15 points, or 0.29%, to 4,115.68 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.90 points, or 0.03%, to 13,299.74.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 1.51% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.58%.
The dollar gained ground following the release of the Fed minutes, snapping a four-day losing streak.
The dollar index rose 0.42%, with the euro up 0.02% to $1.2174. 
Cryptocurrencies plunged after regulatory moves by China.
Bitcoin briefly plunged to its lowest level since January in the wake of China's decision to ban financial and payment institutions from providing digital currency services, but pared its losses after some of its prominent backers reiterated their support.
Rival cryptocurrency ethereum was last down 22% at $2,623.
In the Treasury market, the yield on 10-year notes was up 3.8 basis points at 1.680%, pulling back slightly from a day's high of 1.6920%.
Oil prices dropped over $2 a barrel to their lowest levels in three weeks amid worries that surging COVID-19 cases in Asia would hurt demand for crude.

Brent futures fell $2.05, or 3.0%, to settle at $66.66 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell $2.13, or 3.3%, to settle at $63.36.

(Reuters) -Cisco Systems Inc on Wednesday cautioned that supply chain issues will linger through the end of 2021 and forecast its current-quarter profit below estimates, sending shares of the network gear maker down 5%.
The warning comes as all tech companies are facing a global chip shortage.
""Notwithstanding what's going on in the supply chain, our revenue guide would have been higher, which could have probably flowed through to improving EPS as well,"" Chief Executive Officer Charles Robbins said during an earnings call.
Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) forecast fourth-quarter profit of 81 cents to 83 cents per share, compared with estimates of 85 cents per share, and said it expected 6% to 8% revenue growth.
In an interview, Cisco Chief Financial Officer Scott Herren said the supply chain issues were temporary. For the third quarter ended May 1, the company reported a 7% rise in revenue to $12.80 billion from a year earlier, above analysts' average estimate of $12.56 billion according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
""Double-digit growth in orders was something we'd not seen since 2012,"" Herren said. ""There's a lot to feel good about right now.""
Cisco's service revenue surged 8% and product revenue rose 6%, boosted by a sustained demand for its videoconferencing platform, virtual private network and cybersecurity products as offices remained closed despite accelerated COVID-19 vaccinations.
Herren said 81% of the company's $3.8 billion fiscal third-quarter software revenue was recurring or from subscriptions, putting the company on track for more than $14 billion in software sales over the next 12 months. That figure ""would make us one of the largest five or six software cos in the world,"" Herren said.

Net income rose to $2.86 billion, or 68 cents per share, from $2.77 billion, or 65 cents per share.
Excluding items, Cisco earned 83 cents per share, above analysts' estimates of 82 cents per share.

This, combined with investors’ interest in precious metals as a store of value in the face of rising inflation, suggests bright prospects for the mining industry. So, small-cap mining stocks Materion (NYSE:MTRN), Nexa (NEXA), and Sierra Metals (NYSE:SMTS) are expected to generate robust returns in the near term.Rising global demand for various minerals and metals has been encouraging mining companies to increase their production capacity. Due to a shortage of manpower during the pandemic, some companies invested significantly in technology solutions last year to make alloys and control the operations in their mines. This helped mining companies lower their operating expenses significantly in the second half of 2020.
Furthermore, the interest by governments worldwide in achieving net-zero carbon emission has been driving the demand for mining products that are crucial in achieving sustainability goals. Also, rising inflation in the United States has been driving investment demand for precious metals. The global mining market is expected to grow at a 7% CAGR over the next five years to reach $2.43 billion by 2025.

The Dutch case, one of many between the former star of the global car industry and the Japanese companies he once led, centres around the Dutch-registered joint venture Nissan-Mitsubishi BV, where Ghosn was ousted as chairman in 2019.
Ghosn claims the Japanese companies violated Dutch labour laws when they dismissed him and is demanding 15 million euros ($18.3 million) as compensation for missed wages and severance payments.
But Nissan and Mitsubishi claim Ghosn only used the Amsterdam-based joint venture to inflate his own pay and to cover a personal tax debt, and are demanding he repays around 8 million euros in wages they say he granted himself without the knowledge of the boards of the holding companies.
The former chairman of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, including concerning the way he was compensated.

Ghosn was chairman of both Nissan and Mitsubishi and Chief Executive of  Renault  (PA:RENA) when he was arrested in Japan in 2018 on charges of financial misconduct, including underreporting his salary and using company funds for personal purposes. 
He fled to Lebanon in December 2019 hidden in carry-on luggage on a private jet that flew out of Kansai Airport, and has remained in that country since.

Burger King began testing the new product in September, before rolling it out to some additional locations.
Like McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD), Burger King's new sandwich will come in three versions: regular, spicy or deluxe.
But unlike any other major U.S. fast-food burger chain, Burger King's fillets are breaded by hand in stores.

The suggested price will be $3.99 to $4.99 depending on region, Chief Marketing Officer Ellie Doty told Reuters.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. securities regulator on Wednesday doled out a $28-million award to a whistleblower for information that led U.S. authorities to bring bribery charges against a subsidiary of Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) Corp , according to the tipster's lawyers.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which did not disclose the name of the company or the whistleblower, said the information led the SEC and another other agency to open investigations resulting in ""significant enforcement actions"". Attorneys Christopher Connors and Andy Rickman said they represented the whistleblower and confirmed the award related to Panasonic foreign bribery probe. 
In 2018, Panasonic Avionics Corp agreed to pay about $280 million to the SEC and Department of Justice to resolve criminal and civil charges that the company falsified its financial records to conceal payments to sales agents in China and other parts of Asia. 
The SEC did not respond immediately to a request for the identity of the firm involved, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -Walmart and  Target  are testing their own home package delivery services in the United States - stealing a page from Amazon's play book - as e-commerce demand strains traditional carriers like  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS), FedEx and the U.S. Postal Service.
The move is just the latest example of how Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and Target Corp (NYSE:TGT) are working to close the gap with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), the No. 1 online retailer. Amazon has recruited armies of small businesses to provide delivery services from vans emblazoned with the company's logo - an effort that has helped it control customer wait times and costs. 
UPS, FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) and the USPS have been inundated with packages since the coronavirus pandemic hit U.S. shores last year - forcing retailers to seek new ways to get goods into the hands of customers while containing soaring delivery costs. 
Walmart - a key FedEx delivery customer - has been trialing its first company-branded ""last-mile"" delivery vans, John Furner, Walmart's U.S. chief executive, said on the company's earnings call on Tuesday. 
Since January, a small, electric van fleet has made package deliveries in the Bentonville and Rogers (NYSE:ROG) areas near Walmart's Arkansas headquarters, company spokeswoman Camille Dunn said. The drivers work for Walmart, which also employs its semi-truck drivers. 
When asked about Walmart's project, shipping consultant Cathy Morrow Roberson said: ""Hallelujah. They can afford to build out a last-mile delivery network. They built out a trucking network."" 
Keeping package delivery operations in-house could give Walmart an advantage, said Roberson, founder of Logistics Trends & Insights. 
""I wouldn't say that they get customers away from Amazon, but they can certainly put up a good fight,"" she said. 
Retailers are dealing with a trucker shortage that threatens their ability to stock their stores. However, van drivers in theory should be easier to find because they don't require professional licenses like big-rig drivers do.
Target so far is depending on independent drivers from Shipt, which it bought in 2017. 
The retailer earlier this year began testing home package delivery from a new sorting center in its hometown of Minneapolis. Workers in that center group packages by zone and hand some over to drivers for Shipt, who use their own cars for deliveries. 

The effort, which is fortified by acquired technology from transport management provider Grand Junction and delivery firm Deliv, aims to ""add capacity, reduce costs and enable more flexibility,"" Target Chief Operating Officer John Mulligan said on a conference call on Wednesday.
Walmart, Target and Amazon use gig workers to make same-day, local deliveries. Amazon's service is called Flex (NASDAQ:FLEX). Walmart has its own Spark Driver delivery platform and taps on-demand services from companies such as DoorDash and Postmates. Target depends on Shipt and other providers.

The company operations are divided into three segments: Wood Products, Building Materials Distribution, and Corporate and Others. EVA sells and produces utility graded wood pellets.

The housing industry boom has been driving the lumber industry since last year because home construction and renovation activities have been on an upswing. Lumber prices have tripled over the past year and are expected to continue rising. Because the Fed is still holding interest rates at near zero levels, rising high demand in the housing market and surging commodity prices should drive-up lumber prices to fresh highs soon.

Investing.com –The S&P 500 ended lower Wednesday, but cut losses into the close as a chip-led rebound in tech helped soothe concerns the Federal Reserve is starting to think about broaching the bond tapering topic at upcoming meetings.
The S&P 500 fell 0.81%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.49%, or 341 points, and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.49%.
The Federal Reserve minutes from its April meeting served up the first signs that some central bank members are ready to start thinking about tapering.  
""A number of participants suggested that if the economy continued to make rapid progress toward the Committee's goals, it might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meetings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchase,"" the minutes showed.
The minutes exacerbated the selloff, and appeared to cut short the rebound in tech as U.S. government bond yields jumped.
But buying returned to the big cap and chip stocks, helping to steady the overall sector.
The iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) was up more than 1%, led by Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL), II-VI (NASDAQ:IIVI) and  Analog Devices  (NASDAQ:ADI) leading the charge.
Analog Devices Inc (NASDAQ:ADI) climbed 5% after reporting first-quarter results that topped analysts' estimates.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) were well off their intraday lows.
The dip-buying in tech, however, appears to come at the expense of the economically-sensitive cyclicals in corners of the market like energy, financials and materials.
Energy was among biggest losers on the day as oil prices fell more than 2% despite data showing a smaller-than-expected build in weekly U.S. crude stocks.
Crude oil stockpiles rose by 1.3 million barrels for the week to May 14, a lower build than the 1.6 million barrels economists had forecast.
On the earnings front,  Take-Two Interactive  Software (NASDAQ:TTWO) reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that topped Wall Street estimates, sending its share price up more than 5%.
 Target  (NYSE:TGT) was also up more than 5% after its first-quarter results beat on both the top and bottom lines.
In the midst of the selloff in crypto that has since abated - sparked by a regulatory crackdown on Bitcoin in China and broader risk-off sentiment in crypto markets during recent days - stocks including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Square (NYSE:SQ) and MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) were under pressure."

(Reuters) -The market value of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc's bitcoin holdings have fallen by half to $1.26 billion, close to the electric car maker's purchase cost, as the cryptocurrency's value plunged following a crackdown by the Chinese government.
Shares of Tesla Inc were 3% lower on Wednesday afternoon, down more than broader U.S. market indices. Chief Executive Elon Musk signaled that the company still is not selling, tweeting symbols for diamond hands https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1395027147161489412 to his 55.3 million followers.
""Diamond Hands"" is a symbol used frequently on Reddit signaling the intention to stubbornly hold on to a stock or other asset.
Musk credited Tesla's ""Master of Coin,"" referring to the title he has given Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn.
Musk has issued a stream of comments about cryptocurrencies that have sent values for bitcoin and the meme digital currency dogecoin lurching up and down over the past several weeks. 
Tesla disclosed its bitcoin investment of $1.5 billion on Feb. 8. Its bitcoin holdings helped generate profits in the first quarter, through the sale of 10% of them. But the investment is also exposing shareholders to the volatile cryptocurrency market. 
The Chinese government's move to bar financial and payment institutions from offering cryptocurrency services is the latest example of how crypto values can swing wildly on a single regulatory action or a tweet from a figure like Musk.
""With vehicle sales appearing to slow in China ... Tesla may once again need help to turn a profit by selling the cryptocurrency. However, with the price of Bitcoin almost 50% lower than its all-time high, Tesla’s opportunity to profit on crypto sales appears less likely,"" said Samuel Indyk, senior analyst at uk.Investing.com.
The current market value of Tesla's stake in bitcoin is about $1.26 billion, assuming the $2.48 billion value it recorded at the end of last quarter has fallen by 49% as the trading value has done. That would put the value at slightly less than the $1.3 billion that Tesla gave as the carrying value of the stake, essentially what it paid. 
Tesla said it must recognize ""impairment charges"" if bitcoin prices drop below their ""carrying value"" which ""may adversely affect our operating results in any period.""
But it said, ""gains are not recorded until realized upon sales.""
Bitcoin prices fell as low as $30,000 during the day, below the January average price of $32,734. 
""The rapid drop shows what a risky move it was for the carmaker to buy into the digital asset,"" said David Kimberley, analyst at investing app Freetrade.
Tesla had briefly allowed customers to pay for cars using the cryptocurrency, before withdrawing that option, citing environmental concerns that hit Bitcoin prices. 
""Tesla is flipflopping on bitcoin from one quarter to the next, which isn't a bullish sign for bitcoin or for Tesla,"" Taylor Ogan, chief executive of Snow Bull Capital, said. 
Tesla's shares were trading at $557.05 shortly after 3 p.m. Eastern time Wednesday, after falling in the session to $546.98, the lowest level since March 5. 

The stock is down about 20% so far this year, compared with a roughly 8% gain for the S&P 500, which was last down 0.5% on Wednesday.
Tesla's stock had gained 743% in 2020 compared with the S&P's 16% advance for the year.

Investing.com -- Stocks started out the day in the red and stayed there after a sell-off in cryptocurrencies and later word that the Federal Reserve is starting to think about broaching the bond tapering topic.
The Fed’s minutes from its April meeting showed the first signs that some central bank members are ready to start thinking about tapering at upcoming meetings. 
Energy was among the day’s biggest losers as the price of Crude Oil WTI Futures, the U.S. benchmark, fell more than 3%. Brent Oil Futurescrude, the international standard, fell nearly 3%. That might turn out to be good news for drivers if gasoline prices also fall going into the Memorial Day weekend, the U.S.’s unofficial start of summer.
Crude oil stockpiles rose by 1.3 million barrels for the week to May 14, a lower build than the 1.6 million barrels economists had forecast.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. More stocks make their public debuts
Squarespace debuted after setting a reference price of $50 a share Tuesday night. The company makes tools for small businesses to create websites, and its much anticipated direct listing disappointed at the start of trading midday, falling 13% as the broader market fell. 
Next up is Oatly, which makes “milk alternatives” like oat milk. Its initial range is targeted to $15 to $17 when it sets its price expected tonight. Trading is expected to begin tomorrow.
2. More retail earnings
Among a slew of retail earnings reports this week, the next batch includes Victoria Secret parent L Brands Inc (NYSE:LB) after tonight’s closing bell and reports from  BJs Wholesale Club Holdings Inc  (NYSE:BJ),  Kohls Corp  (NYSE:KSS), and Children’s Place Inc (NASDAQ:PLCE) tomorrow. So far, retailers have been blowing past expectations as shoppers returned to stores and spent their stimulus money.
3. Can bitcoin bounce back?
People will be looking to see if Bitcoin can continue to recover after plunging 30% on Wednesday to levels not seen since January only to bounce partly back. Other cryptos are also under the microscope. Ethereumfell about 20%. Cryptocurrency has been on fire in the last year, prompting companies like Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ) to take stakes. Both of those stocks also fell on Wednesday, along with a number of others associated with crypto.

President Biden’s proposed $2 trillion-plus infrastructure spending bill should further boost the sector’s growth. With this in mind, we think it could be wise to buy the dip in leading players in this space  Eaton  (NYSE:ETN), Crane (CR), and Atkore (ATKR). So, let’s evaluate these names.The industrial sector was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic last year because of business lockdowns and social distancing requirements. However, the easing of restrictions this year on the back of widespread vaccinations is facilitating an impressive recovery by the industrial sector. Furthermore, President Biden’s emphasis on industrial growth in his $2 trillion-plus infrastructure spending proposal is expected to further invigorate the sector.
Total industrial production in the United States increased 16.5% year-over-year in April 2021. If Biden’s American Jobs Plan is passed, aerospace, capital goods, and industrial technology should witness solid growth. Consequently, the sector has been benefiting from favorable investor sentiment, as evidenced by Vanguard Industrial ETF’s (VIS) 15.8% year-to-date returns compared to SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust’s (SPY) 10.2% gains.
The industrial sector’s growth is highly correlated with economic growth. So, as the economy keeps growing, industrial companies should witness solid business growth. The global market for industrial machinery is expected to grow at a 5% CAGR over the next six years to hit $794 billion by 2027. Given this solid backdrop, we think the recent price dip in Eaton Corporation plc (ETN), Crane Co. (CR), and Atkore Inc. (ATKR) provides a good buying opportunity.

The Reddit community wallstreetbets (WSB) is currently showing an interest in penny stocks Sundial Growers (NASDAQ:SNDL), Naked Brand Group (NAKD), and FSD Pharma (HUGE). But we think these companies’ poor financials and bleak growth potential make their stocks best avoided now.Penny stocks are considered high-risk/high-return investments. Generally priced at less than $5, many of these stocks gain significantly to deliver three- and four-digit returns. However, these stocks often carry big risks because the issuing companies are typically not experienced in their respective operating fields. Furthermore, penny stocks priced below $1 often carry the risk of being delisted from major stock exchanges due to stringent eligibility conditions related to share price with respect to a company maintaining its listing. But penny stocks generally perform well during periods of economic recovery because the companies are afforded an opportunity to expand their production and sales and, by extension, their market reach.
However, various macroeconomic measures, such as rising inflation, lower-than-expected job growth and sky-high commodity prices, are currently pointing to a market pullback.
Against this backdrop, Reddit community wallstreetbets has been showing interest in penny stocks  Sundial Growers Inc . (SNDL), Naked Brand Group Limited (NAKD), and FSD Pharma Inc. (HUGE). But, given their poor financials and bleak growth prospects, we think these stocks are best avoided now.

31,By Reuters,"<span>May 19, 2021 03:20PM ET</span>","Frontier lied about internet speed, FTC says in post-net neutrality case","WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Federal Trade Commission and several states filed a lawsuit against Frontier Communications (OTC:FTRCQ) on Wednesday, accusing them of lying about internet speeds, in one of the first cases the regulator has overseen since net neutrality rules were repealed.
In the complaint, the agency and state attorneys general said Frontier advertised internet via a digital subscriber line (DSL) at certain speeds to consumers but then failed to deliver.
The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The FTC was joined on the lawsuit by attorneys general from Arizona, Indiana, Michigan, North Carolina and Wisconsin. District attorneys' offices from two California counties also joined the complaint to represent California.
A spokesperson for Frontier, which is emerging from bankruptcy protection, said that the lawsuit was ""without merit.""
""Frontier’s DSL Internet speeds have been clearly and accurately articulated, defined and described in the company's marketing materials and disclosures,"" the spokesperson said. 
The complaint said Frontier has more than 3 million U.S. internet service subscribers, offering internet via DSL to some 1.3 million consumers in 25 states, many in rural areas.
Frontier has advertised different tiers of speeds to consumers, including an August 2018 mailer that offered download speeds of 12 megabits per second for $12, the complaint said.
But, the complaint said, since 2015, Frontier has ""in numerous instances"" promised certain speeds for its DSL internet access but did not deliver.
""Indeed, network limits imposed by Frontier prevent numerous 
consumers from receiving DSL Internet service at speeds corresponding to the tiers of service they pay for,"" the complaint said.
Acting FTC Chairwoman Rebecca Slaughter said her agency would do its best to take over monitoring broadband providers from the Federal Communications Commission.
""As important as this case is, it also shows why the FTC can never fully fill the regulatory gap left in the wake of the repeal of Net Neutrality,"" she said on Twitter. ""Active oversight by the proper regulator may have prevented these violations.""

SEATTLE (Reuters) -Boeing Co resumed deliveries of its best-selling 737 MAX on Wednesday, following approval of a fix for an electrical grounding issue that sidelined dozens of jets, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Reuters reported on April 16 that Boeing (NYSE:BA) stopped delivering its cash cow single-aisle 737 MAX after the electrical grounding problem - months after the plane returned to service following a lengthy safety ban due to fatal crashes.
A Boeing spokeswoman declined to comment. 
Boeing shares came off session lows but were down 1.6% on a day when the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped. 
Earlier this month, the U.S. planemaker won approval from U.S. regulators for a fix for the electrical grounding issue that had affected about 100 737 MAX airplanes.
That approval cleared the way for the jet's quick return to service. Airlines had pulled dozens of 737 MAX jets from service in early April after Boeing warned of the electrical problem, linked to a backup power control unit in the cockpit on some recently built airplanes.
The problem was then found in two other places on the flight deck, including the storage rack where the control unit is kept and the instrument panel facing the pilots.

The 737 MAX was approved to return to service in November 2020 in the United States after being grounded for 20 months following two fatal crashes that killed 346 people in 2018 and 2019.
Reuters reported on May 4 that the FAA asked Boeing to supply fresh analysis showing numerous 737 MAX subsystems would not be affected by electrical grounding issues first flagged in three areas of the jet in April.

ZURICH (Reuters) -The Swiss government said on Wednesday it recruited 75 people including federal and university employees to temporarily staff facilities at Lonza, which struggled to find personnel to make ingredients for  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s COVID-19 vaccine. 
In April, the Swiss drugmaker contacted the government for help in finding temporary workers as it sought more people for operations in Visp, Switzerland, where it has built three new production lines to make the Moderna shots.
Of 40 million vaccine doses ordered by the Swiss government, so far, 20.5 million are from Moderna. With Bern labelling the U.S. company's mRNA shots ""extraordinarily meaningful"" for its inoculation strategy, it is now directly stocking up Lonza's workforce to make sure vaccine keeps flowing. 
Swiss Health Minister Alain Berset said the first of the provisional workforce could start in May, with deployments likely to last six months. 
""We started a programme immediately to find specialists,"" Berset told a news conference. ""We've found 75 people in the federal administration, also in the universities.""
Some of those recruited are from the federal agricultural research unit Agroscope, the Office of Food Safety and the nation's testing laboratory in Spiez, the government said, with biochemistry, chemistry or pharmaceutical backgrounds.
They will remain federal employees, but Lonza will cover their salaries, food costs, travel and lodging.
URGENT GLOBAL DEMAND
""The Swiss Federal Government is supporting Lonza in the recruitment of highly qualified specialists,"" Lonza said in a statement. ""We greatly appreciate this help during this time of urgent global demand.""
Concerns over Lonza's ability to deliver ingredients on schedule emerged in April, when Moderna flagged expected second-quarter shortfalls in shots bound for countries including Britain and Canada and cited an uneven production ramp-up. 
Vaccine from Lonza's sprawling site in Visp is destined for countries outside the United States.
Even more specialists will be needed soon, as Lonza Group AG plans to double its Swiss production capacity for Moderna Inc's vaccine next year to some 600 million doses annually. 

Still, the Swiss government said these ad-hoc deployments are only meant to fill the gap during a crisis. 
""In the mid- to long-term, the temporary deployment of specialists from the federal administration and state enterprises will not be the solution,"" it said.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) made more than $100 million in commissions from Epic Games' ""Fortnite"" during the two years the online game was on the App Store, an Apple executive testified on Wednesday.
Michael Schmid, Apple's head of game business development for the App Store, took the stand during the third week of an antitrust trial in federal court in Oakland, California. Apple kicked the popular game off its App Store last year after Epic introduced its own system for in-app payments.
Epic then sued Apple alleging that the iPhone maker had abused its power over developers by forcing them to use Apple in-app payment technology, which charges commissions of 15% to 30%. Apple has said it requires developers to use its systems to ensure the security and privacy of its App Store and that the rates its charges are similar to those of other gaming platforms such as  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Xbox.
Before Apple's relationship with Epic soured, Schmid testified, the App Store, which maintains an editorial team that highlights certain apps, had featured ""Fortnite"" and spent about $1 million in marketing the game over the previous 11 months. Apple had previously disclosed that Epic earned $700 million from the iOS version of ""Fortnite"" but said nothing about its own commissions.
The disclosure of ""Fortnite"" commissions is significant because Epic's legal team has pressed Apple executives on the stand over whether the company tracks profits from its App Store, with Apple executive saying they do not and view the App Store as feature of the iPhone.
At a hearing before the U.S. Senate last month, Apple Chief Compliance Officer Kyle Andeer, a former government antitrust lawyer, testified that Apple did not produce a publicly available profit and loss statement for the App Store.

During the antitrust trial, Epic's attorneys secured a document from the files of Chief Executive Tim Cook that they argued tracked operating profits from the App Store. The document remains under seal.
Schmid said Apple's App Store team only began tracking commissions from ""Fortnite"" after it had been featured by the App Store editorial team.

Investing.com –The S&P 500 fell Wednesday as signs the Federal Reserve is starting to think about broaching the bond tapering topic at upcoming meetings offset relative rebound in tech amid dip buying in chip stocks.  
The S&P 500 fell 0.81%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.49%, or 341 points, and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.49%.
The Federal Reserve minutes from its April meeting due at 2PM ET, served up the first signs that some central bank members are ready to start thinking about tapering. 
""A number of participants suggested that if the economy continued to make rapid progress toward the Committee's goals, it might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meetings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchase,"" the minutes showed.
Tech was flat after recovering from a more than 1% drop intraday as battered chip stocks attracted dip-buying helping to steady the overall sector.
The iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) was up more than 1%, led by Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL), II-VI (NASDAQ:IIVI) and  Analog Devices  (NASDAQ:ADI) leading the charge.
Analog Devices climbed more than 4% after reporting first-quarter results that topped analysts' estimates.
Mega-cap tech, meanwhile, also pared the bulk of their losses.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) were well off their intraday lows.
The dip-buying in tech, however, appears to come at the expense of the economically-sensitive cyclicals corners of the market like energy, financials and materials.
Energy was among biggest losers on the day as oil prices fell more than 2% despite data showing a smaller-than-expected build in weekly U.S. crude stocks.
Crude oil stockpiles rose by 1.3 million barrels for the week to May 14, a lower build than the 1.6 million barrels economists had forecast.
On the earnings front,  Take-Two Interactive  Software (NASDAQ:TTWO) reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that topped Wall Street estimates, sending its share price up more than 5%.
 Target  (NYSE:TGT) was also up more than 5% after its first-quarter results beat on both the top and bottom lines.
In the midst of the selloff in crypto that has since abated - sparked by a regulatory crackdown on Bitcoin in China and broader risk-off sentiment in crypto markets during recent days - stocks including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Square and MicroStrategy were under pressure."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) unit Google and other tech giants will have to pledge to do more to curb the monetisation of false information through advertisement placements, according to a European Commission document seen by Reuters.
The EU executive also wants smaller social media or search services, private messaging services, ad exchanges, ad-tech providers, communication agencies and e-payment services, e-commerce platforms and crowdfunding/donation systems to commit to do the same, the document said.
The proposal is one of several which aims to address shortcomings in the voluntary code of practice on disinformation introduced in 2018 and to which Google, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Mozilla and TikTok have signed up.
""One area, in particular, where the Code has failed to achieve sufficient progress is in the demonetisation of disinformation, where online advertisements still continue to incentivise the dissemination of disinformation,"" the document said.
The Commission wants platforms to tighten eligibility requirements and content review processes for content monetisation and ad revenue share programmes on their services to bar participation by actors that systematically post content debunked as disinformation.
Ad-tech companies in turn should identify the criteria used to place ads and adopt measures to verify where the ads are placed.
The document also wants the companies to clearly and effectively label political and issue based ads, distinguishing them as paid-for content.

The updated code of conduct also sets out key performance indicators for the first time to allow authorities to verify that the companies are living up to their pledges.
Companies will be given until the end of September to come up with a draft of their commitments. The Commission will present the updated code on May 26.

While investors appear pleased with the government’s stimulus measures and improving employment data, the rising inflation rate is a cause for their concern. Given current market volatility, blue chip stocks are among the safest bets because among the qualities for which they are known are stable returns with negligible risks. So, we believe McDonald's (MCD), Starbucks (SBUX), 3M Company (NYSE:MMM), and  Altria Group  (NYSE:MO) could be worth adding to one's portfolio now.The U.S. economy has been exhibiting a solid recovery this year, as evidenced by its 6.4% annual GDP growth in the first quarter. Among other favorable economic data, consumer spending is steadily returning to pre-pandemic levels thanks to governmental rescue packages and steady job growth. However, rising purchasing power is creating inflationary pressure in the economy and, thus, introducing volatility to the markets.
In these circumstances, we think blue chip stocks are the best picks. Blue chip stocks represent large, well-known companies that are known for their financial resiliency and balance sheet strength. While blue chip stocks are not immune to market downturns, they are the favorites of low-risk investors because they have a history of delivering steady returns over the long-term and offer protection during short-term market fluctuations.
Given this backdrop, we think it is wise for investors to scoop up fundamentally-sound blue chip stocks McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), 3M Company (MMM), and Altria Group, Inc. (MO). They have shown decent strength over last year and are well-positioned to offer attractive returns this year.

(Reuters) - Results from Petco Health and Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) Inc are likely to show slowing revenue growth compared with last year, when stressed out families turned to their pets for companionship during pandemic-led lockdowns.
While sales will be down from the height of the pandemic, it is unlikely to fall to levels seen before the pandemic, Evercore ISI analyst Oliver Wintermantel said.
With restrictions easing and increased vaccinations, investors are worried pet owners may start returning pets to shelters as they go back to full-time work.
""I think it could be an incremental negative, but I think that there's still more demand than there is supply for pets. So, I think those pets will get readopted,"" Wedbush analyst Seth Basham said.

THE CONTEXT
Adoption rates at animal shelters in the United States jumped as much as 40% in 2020 over the previous year as people coped with isolation at the height of the pandemic.
The boom in demand for pet products resulted in the U.S. pet health industry generating sales of over $100 billion in 2020, according to trade organization American Pet Products Association, and is projected to grow nearly 6% this year.
Petco Health, which operates more than 1,500 stores across the United States, Mexico and Puerto Rico, debuted on the Nasdaq in January to cash in on the pandemic-driven surge in pet adoptions and related spending.
The company is among the largest pet retailers in the U.S. and also has more than 100 in-store veterinary hospitals. Petco's online sales grew over 90% and added 1 million new customers in the quarter ended Jan. 30.
Rival Chewy, which saw a 47% jump in its customer base year-over-year in 2020, is due to report its earnings in June.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. airlines are scrambling to add staff and upgrade technology as they face anger over prolonged call center wait times while tackling a surge in air travel following COVID-19 vaccinations.
""#Delta 9 hours wait on hold is this a way to run an airline,"" read one Twitter post from a Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) customer. 
After a year of being cooped up, travelers are balancing the prospect of sunshine in Florida or fresh mountain air in Montana and Wyoming - among the fastest growing U.S. travel markets - with frustrations during the booking process.
By July, U.S. domestic air fares and capacity could approach pre-pandemic levels, according to experts, but overall staffing at the three legacy carriers shrunk by roughly 20% last year.
While travelers can easily book new vacations online for flight changes or travel credits -- transactions that have soared during the pandemic -- they often need to go through call centers, which are also managing a flurry of questions about COVID-19 travel restrictions and requirements. To support the increase in call volumes, Delta is adding staffing and overtime, hiring temporary summer contract workers and fast-tracking technology upgrades to self-service options, a spokesman said.
""Our wait times are not currently where we'd like to them to be,"" he said. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) said it is hiring hundreds of reservations agents to help with the rise in calls, while United Airlines said it is working to shorten hold times through increased staffing and technology upgrades, without providing details. U.S. airlines received billions of dollars in government aid to pay salaries and protect jobs during the pandemic but also encouraged workers to take voluntary leave packages to slim staffing because they didn't know how long the crisis, or the government aid, would last.
Willie Walsh, the head of the International Air Transport Association, said on Wednesday that the decisions by carriers across the globe to retire aircraft and make staff redundant could hamper the aviation industry's recovery. 
An explosion in U.S. domestic leisure travel demand as more Americans become vaccinated has taken many in the industry by surprise, leaving services from airports to rental car companies and hotels short-staffed.
The strength of the rebound has possible implications beyond the airline industry since economists say air traffic is closely tied to overall economic output and is frequently seen as a guide to consumer confidence.

However, analyst John Grant of flight data specialist OAG warned on Wednesday that U.S. domestic airline traffic may be ""overheating,"" suggesting that legacy carriers are likely to reshape their networks toward more international markets once they reopen.
Still, Grant said plans by U.S. ultra low-cost carriers and start-ups to build domestic capacity ""has to be good news for all airports of all sizes across the United States in the next few years.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Detroit's Big Three automakers and the United Auto Workers union said Wednesday they will continue to require workers to wear masks pending new guidelines from a U.S. agency.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last week that fully vaccinated people do not need to wear masks in most instances including at work.
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Chrysler-parent Stellantis NV said they are awaiting guidelines from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). The UAW and automakers will reconvene in two weeks and review updates.
Other automakers are also still requiring U.S. workers to wear masks, including  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co and Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY).
GM spokesman Dan Flores said the automaker ""will continue our current practices around mask wearing until we are confident that any revisions continue to support employees’ health and safety while ensuring compliance with applicable federal and state rules.""

Flores said GM was highly encouraging employees to get vaccinated. ""Immunity is the best path toward determining when GM may be able to relax or rescind mask wearing protocols,"" he said.
A Stellantis spokeswoman said the company strongly advocates employees get vaccinated and ""will continue to mandate the use of masks in our facilities, in combination with our other health and safety protocols, for the foreseeable future.""

44,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 19, 2021 01:36PM ET</span>",Bonds Have Never Been So Useless as a Hedge to Stocks Since 1999,"(Bloomberg) -- Bonds aren’t working as a safe haven like they used to.On a day when risk aversion swept across everything from stocks and commodities to crypto currencies, Treasuries barely budged. In fact, the S&P 500 and 10-year Treasury futures haven’t been so positively correlated since 1999, with the 60-day metric reaching 0.5 on Wednesday. In contrast, the average correlation over the past two decades was negative 0.3, meaning a decline in stocks was often accompanied by a rally in bonds.
The relationship flip signals that the role of Treasuries as a shock-absorber has been eroded as the fear of inflation becomes a common denominator for both stock and bond investors. If it persists, it would mark a sea change as strategies such as risk-parity and 60/40 are likely to become more volatile.“Long bonds as your hedge worked in a Goldilocks era” of stable growth and inflation, said Charlie McElligott, a cross-asset strategist at Nomura Securities. “But now, due to the pandemic response, that old dynamic simply no longer applies. Inflation is a volatility catalyst.”
The stock-down-bond-up scenario that investors have grown accustomed to has only been a staple since 2000. Earlier, a positive correlation had been more common as inflation was more volatile.
While the core U.S. consumer price index increased in April at the fastest pace since 1982, the Federal Reserve has insisted the surge is “transitory” and the central bank will be patient in removing monetary stimulus. If the Fed is right, the bond-stock correlation could normalize, said McElligott.“Only in the case of an extreme inflation overshoot would the Fed’s hands be tied,” forcing it to raise rates more quickly and crash both bonds and stocks, he said.

So, based on that premise, we think it is wise to bet on Group 1 Automotive (NYSE:GPI), SPX FLOW (FLOW), and Kulicke and Soffa (KLIC). These names possess immense growth potential. Read on.It was widely predicted that 2021 would be a year of recovery. Meeting that expectation, the U.S. economy appears to be on the path of recovery with easing of COVID-19 related restrictions thanks to a widespread and, so far, successful vaccination drive. Industrial and manufacturing activities are on the rise, which is driving a job market recovery. Small-cap stocks have been making a solid comeback in this scenario thanks in part to the government support to small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs).
Small-cap companies usually perform well during an economic recovery due to their easy access to funds, which helps them invest in business growth. Given the current low interest rate environment, the growth for small-cap companies should continue in the near term. Investors’ increasing interest in the small-cap stocks is evident in the SPDR S&P 600 Small Cap ETF’s (SLY) 31.9% returns over the past six months compared to the large-cap focused SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust’s (SPY) 15.6% gains.
So, for investors who can tolerate some risk and want to invest in stocks with immense growth potential, Group 1 Automotive, Inc. (GPI), SPX FLOW, Inc. (FLOW), and Kulicke and Soffa Industries, Inc. (KLIC) could be the ticket. These three top-rated stocks possess solid upside potential.

Investing.com – Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) rose more than 3% Wednesday, after the company announced a $4 billion share buyback plan.
AMD expects to fund repurchases through cash generated from operations “which have been strengthened by the company’s strong operational results”, the company said.
Revenue for the first quarter ending March 27 was $3.45 billion, up 93% from the same period a year ago. Net income was $642 million, up 189%.
The company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of March 27 came at $3.12 billion, according to its April 27 earnings release. This liquidity will come in handy for the company to fund its buyback scheme.         
AMD will repurchase stocks in the open market. This will help it offset dilution from stock issuances and reduce share count over time, thereby improving its earnings per share.
The company said the exercise has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.
For the full year, AMD expects revenue growth of approximately 50% over 2020 driven by growth in all businesses, up from prior guidance of approximately 37% annual growth.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - An upcoming court decision that will decide the future role Huawei can play in Sweden could also be a potential turning point for national champion Ericsson (BS:ERICAs)'s ambitions in China.
The case stems from the Swedish government's decision last https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sweden-huawei-idUKKBN2750VZ October to ban Huawei from supplying 5G equipment due to security concerns. Huawei sued to overturn the decision and a verdict is expected in the next few weeks.
European governments have been tightening controls on Chinese companies building 5G networks following diplomatic pressure from Washington, which alleges Huawei equipment could be used by Beijing for spying. Huawei has repeatedly denied being a national security risk.
China had earlier asked https://www.politico.eu/article/sweden-faces-chinese-blowback-over-huawei-ban Sweden to ""immediately correct the mistake"" of banning Huawei and issued a veiled warning this month that it might take retaliatory action against Ericsson. 
The Global Times, controlled by China's ruling Communist Party, said https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202105/1223089.shtml on May 10 that while Ericsson has been invited to participate in 5G equipment tests in China, that does not mean it will be hired. Sweden has to carefully reconsider its China policy, the newspaper said.
An Ericsson spokeswoman confirmed that the company has been invited to participate in 5G tests in China. Ericsson last year won 5G contracts from all three major operators in China, and the country brings in roughly 10% of its revenue.
Analysts have been flagging the risk of a retaliation by China and Ericsson Chief Executive Börje Ekholm has acknowledged the concern. 
""There is always a risk that we are impacted in auctions in different countries,"" he said last month, replying to a question on diplomatic tension between Sweden and China. 
He had earlier criticized Sweden's ban on Huawei for restricting free competition.
An Ericsson spokesman declined to comment further. 
""This is a kind of a test of Sweden's credibility and we believe that we will be given a fair treatment in the court,"" said Kenneth Fredriksen, Huawei's executive vice president, Central East Europe and Nordic Region.
A potential ban of Ericsson could be a shot in the arm for Nokia (NYSE:NOK), which has yet to win any 5G business in China. 
""We have not yet made a breakthrough in 5G in China, but of course we are not excluding that possibility going forward,"" Nokia CEO Pekka Lundmark told Reuters last month.
Nokia's home country, Finland, has not banned Huawei outright, although its parliament has passed a law that allows it to ban equipment for national security reasons.

A Nokia spokesperson said the company has already completed the 5G tests in China.
China has been ahead of other countries in rolling out 5G and is a lucrative market for telecom equipment makers. It's 5G capital expenditure will amount to $223 billion between 2019 and 2025, research firm EY has estimated https://assets.ey.com/content/dam/ey-sites/ey-com/en_cn/topics/tmt/ey-china-is-poised-to-win-the-5g-race-en.pdf?download.

(Reuters) -Target Corp on Wednesday posted quarterly sales that surged about 23%, raising hopes of booming demand through the year as consumers flock to stores and shop for more than just essentials.
Shares rose 4% after the retailer also forecast growth in comparable sales for the last two quarters of the year, countering Wall Street's fears of a sales drop, as it keeps pace with surging sales recorded during the pandemic's peak.
With the reopening of the economy due to vaccinations,  Target  (NYSE:TGT), like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Macy's (NYSE:M), said shoppers are spending more on apparel and beauty products as they prepare to socialize and travel.
""With vaccinations rolling out across the country and consumers increasingly comfortable venturing out, we've seen an enthusiastic return to in-store shopping,"" CEO Brian Cornell told analysts. 
Target's focus in building its private-label brands, including designer dress collection and activewear line All in Motion, is paying off, with sales from the business rising 36% in the first quarter, their best growth so far. 
That helped drive its overall apparel sales, which rose in the low-60% range. 
Operating margin is likely to hit 8% or more this year as Target bets on the success of its private-label brands.
The executives also said the company is having no trouble in finding workers in a tight labor market, thanks to its investments, including raising minimum wage last year.
A rise in store traffic and digital sales, boosted by same-day delivery services, drove a 22.9% jump in comparable sales. Analysts were expecting a 9.93% rise, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

""Stimulus turbo boosters will inevitably ebb, yet Target's ability to win and retain consumers during and after COVID is what should hopefully serve them well into the future,"" Evercore analyst Greg Melich wrote in a note.
Excluding items, Target earned $3.69 per share, beating estimates.

Investing.com – Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares erased some of their losses but were still down more than 3% amid a collapse in cryptocurrency prices, even as Elon Musk tried to salvage the situation by tweeting ‘Diamond hands.’
The ‘Diamond hands’ signal that the EV maker's CEO is prepared for the long haul in defending Bitcoin (BitfinexUSD), the biggest crypto and his favorite till a week ago before he switched his loyalty to Dogecoin.
Musk’s tweet helped Bitcoin recoup some of the losses after plunging to $30,000 earlier in the day, the fall precipitated by China clamping down on crypto transactions and warning against its speculative trading.
Bitcoin later traded above $37,000, still 13% down. Ethereum ETH/USD and Dogecoin DOGE/USD were both trading 20% down after falling 25% earlier in the day.
Musk and his car company are both invested in Bitcoin. There had been much speculation about the fate of Tesla’s $1.5 billion investment made in Bitcoin in February before Musk clarified this week that it was intact.
Much damage to the crypto world, particularly Bitcoin, was inflicted last week by Musk when he said Tesla would stop accepting Bitcoin. He cited high energy consumption in mining of crypto behind his decision.

MADRID/PARIS (Reuters) -Airbus took a step towards closing a plant in southern Spain on Wednesday, but rowed back over proposals to sell off the production of small airplane parts elsewhere in Europe as it attempts to finalise a major post-COVID restructuring plan.
After months of protests over the future of its Puerto Real plant in  Cadiz  (NASDAQ:CDZI), Airbus said it was discussing with unions a plan to combine it with a second nearby plant, leaving one facility instead of two at the southern tip of its European network.
The politically sensitive move could lead to one of the first significant factory closures in the company's 50-year history and reflects a slump in demand for the world's largest jets, following a halt in production of the A380 superjumbo.
The proposal, which is subject to final union negotiations on matters like investment, would avoid compulsory redundancies in Spain where talks over the company's wider restructuring have been held up by disputes over the future of Puerto Real.
Work at the robot-assisted factory, where part of the A380's tail section was assembled, has plummeted. It has also suffered from a decline in demand for another long-haul model, the A330.
Puerto Real employs about 350 people and the nearby Bay of Cadiz plant, which focuses on defence and space components, has some 460 people - both in an area where skilled jobs are scarce.
Airbus said no decision had been taken on which plant in Cadiz would cease production, but a spokesman said Puerto Real would in any event have a role in the development of future industrial technology to be used across its European shopfloors.
Cadiz, in Spain's southern Andalusia region, has one of the country's highest unemployment rates, with one in every four adults jobless. Workers there fear the economic impact of shuttering a plant that provides hundreds of high-tech jobs.
PARTS RETHINK
""We won't allow the company to close any plants until we see investments, new work packages, and higher levels of employment than pre-pandemic,"" said Juan Antonio Vazquez of the UGT union.
""We'll work with the (national) government to favour an industrial climate which pushes strategic sectors in places like Cadiz, to maintain both the local economy and the whole supply chain,"" Vazquez added.
A spokeswoman for the Economic department of Andalusia's regional authority said Airbus's announcement was being studied.
Andalusia - for decades a working-class, leftwing stronghold - voted the conservative People's Party into power over two years ago, and has occasionally clashed with the progressive coalition government led by Pedro Sanchez.
The plant closure was discussed at a meeting on Wednesday with European unions. The talks also reviewed the progress of a wider plan to shed up to 15,000 positions globally in response to the coronavirus crisis.

Last month, Airbus cancelled plans to sell its two large aerostructures subsidiaries and replaced it with a new proposal to hive off the production of small mass-produced parts into a new company with a view to selling that instead.
But in a further U-turn after meeting unions on Wednesday, the planemaker said it would analyse a scenario that would involve keeping the small parts activity ""stand-alone within Airbus,"" while adding it preferred to spin it off.

Stuck-at-home Americans fueled a surge in sales of tools and building materials at Lowe's and larger rival  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD) in the last year, as homeowners with limited options for travel or leisure activities due to the pandemic used more of their discretionary income on minor remodeling and repairs. 
The boom was expected to slow following speedy vaccinations and easing of COVID-19 curbs, but the stimulus checks in March boosted demand, Lowe's said.
A surge in lumber prices also helped same-store rise 25.9% in the first quarter ended April 30, beating analysts' estimates for a 19.2% increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
""The underlying drivers of home improvement demand appear to be more resilient and stable than we originally forecasted,"" Chief Financial Officer David Denton said on an analysts call.
May comparable sales were still up around 37% compared to 2019 levels, Denton said, but added the company anticipates a modest shift in spending away from home improvement as the economy reopens.
Lowe's growth in same-stores sales fell short of the 31% jump Home Depot reported on Tuesday, the first time it has lagged its arch rival since the start of the health crisis. 

Shares of Lowe's, which have gained over 65% in the last year, fell 2.6%. Evercore ISI analysts said investors were likely expecting a bigger beat following Home Depot's blowout quarter.

Former U.S. President Donald Trump halted talks on a proposed trade agreement between the EU and the United States, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), and initiated a trade conflict with the EU.
Armin Laschet, who is the CDU's candidate for chancellor at federal elections in September, said now was the time to renew the transatlantic relationship.
""Europe's place is at the side of the USA, is at the side of Canada,"" he said in a speech on foreign and security policy to the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung, a political foundation associated with his CDU party.
""And we need a revival with new themes, with a new dynamic of the transatlantic relationship. And this will revolve around trade issues - a large free trade area as an ambition, but also a common climate foreign policy,"" he added.
Insisting ""we need a new relationship with Britain too, including on security issues,"" Laschet also said that Russia could be a partner for the EU but that Moscow must be shown the limits of international rules.
Turning to Russia's Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Europe, Laschet reiterated his position that ""this is a commercial project"", and said Germany would need gas to bridge its transition to cleaner fuels.
Should his conservative bloc end up in coalition talks after September's election with the ecologist Greens, Laschet said he would discuss Nord Stream 2 with their leader, Annalena Baerbock, who opposes the pipeline.

""If she thinks she wants to protect Ukraine strategically, I would agree with her,"" Laschet said.
The project, now about 95% complete, would bypass Ukraine, depriving it of lucrative transit fees and potentially undermining its struggle against Russian aggression.

Analyst Atif Malik’s prior neutral rating included a $217 target.
Universal Display engages in R&D and commercialization of organic light emitting diode technologies and materials for use in gadgets and smart devices.

According to Malik, Universal’s material sales will normalize on higher OLED utilization rates in 2022.
Universal Display reported its March quarter earnings on May 6. It earned $1.08 per diluted share in the first quarter, compared to 80 cents a share in the year-ago quarter.
Total revenue was $134 million, compared to $112.3 million in the first quarter of 2020.

60,By Reuters,"<span>May 19, 2021 11:37AM ET</span>","Ryanair gets rare wins in EU court over state aid for KLM, TAP","By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Ryanair won two victories in its fight against billions of euros extended in state aid to rivals as Europe's second-highest court annulled the support given to KLM and Portugal's TAP on the grounds that regulators failed to justify the huge cash injections.
The Luxembourg-based General Court, however, said the annulments - and the recovery of the money - would be suspended pending new decisions by the Commission.
Ryanair can challenge those new decisions at the same court if it is not satisfied with them.
""The General Court annuls the Commission's decision to approve the Netherlands financial aid for the airline KLM amid the COVID-19 pandemic on the grounds of inadequate reasoning,"" the Court said on Wednesday.
Judges also rejected the EU executive's clearance of state aid for Portuguese carrier TAP, citing ""an inadequate statement of reasons"" by the Commission. 
The EU competition enforcer last year cleared a 3.4-billion-euro ($4.15 billion) Dutch bailout for airline KLM and a 1.2 billion euro rescue loan for Transportes Aereos Portugueses (TAP).
""The European Commission's approvals of state aid to Air France-KLM and TAP went against the fundamental principles of EU law and reversed the clock on the process of liberalisation in air transport by rewarding inefficiency and encouraging unfair competition,"" Ryanair said after the ruling.
But KLM, the Dutch arm of Air France, said the judgment was of no consequence as the state aid will not have to be repaid until the Commission has a chance to review the decision.
TAP declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.
Portugal's Prime Minister Antonio Costa told reporters the decision was preliminary and the aid was justified in view of the impact of the pandemic.
""Given the crisis that hit the aviation sector around the world, it was unthinkable for the European Commission not to lift restrictions on state aid,"" he said. ""There is no reason to believe their legal experts did not study the matter well.""
On Wednesday, the Court rejected Ryanair's challenge to a 10 billion euro Spanish fund for virus-hit companies approved by the European Commission, saying the measure complied with EU law.
Ryanair also suffered a setback when the Court backed Lufthansa's challenge to the Commission's 2017 decision allowing state aid to Frankfurt Hahn airport, where the Irish carrier was the main beneficiary.
The Commission said it would study the rulings before deciding on its next steps.
Governments around the world have pumped billions of euros into the airline industry, which has been hit hard by virus-related restrictions and lockdowns.
Last month, the same court backed EU competition regulators' approval of support for SAS and Finnair while in February judges also upheld state aid granted to rivals including Air France and SAS.
Europe's biggest budget airline has filed 16 lawsuits against the Commission for allowing state aid to individual airlines such as Lufthansa, KLM, Austrian Airlines and TAP, as well as national schemes that mainly benefit flag carriers.

The cases are T-465/20 Ryanair v Commission, T-643/20 Ryanair v Commission, T-628/20 Ryanair v Commission and T-218/18 Deutsche Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) v Commission.

61,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 19, 2021 11:36AM ET</span>",Crypto Craze Waited for Everyone to Get In Before Coming Undone,"(Bloomberg) -- Like many things in markets, Bitcoin managed to maximize the pain. Its rise went on just long enough to pull in a bunch of otherwise sensible money. And then it made them pay.
The siren song reached a peak with Coinbase Global Inc.’s market debut on April 14. The direct listing of the largest U.S. crypto exchange supercharged theories that crypto had made it to the investing mainstream, that Wall Street’s embrace lent legitimacy to the asset class and the sky was the limit. Retail investors flooded in.
Veterans of the 2017 Bitcoin bubble no doubt had flashbacks. Back then, when the token dominated holiday conversations as its year-to-date gains approached 1,800%, CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) ushered Bitcoin into the mainstream with the introduction of the first contract on a U.S.-regulated exchange. Their debut, on Dec. 17, sent Bitcoin to a record $19,511 the next day. But pressures from the increased scrutiny from regulators around the world caused the coin to plunge about 40% by Jan. 17.
A similar dynamic is seemingly at play now as Bitcoin falls back to earth, with selloffs spurring more selloffs.
“The expansion of the holder base has been remarkable over the past year, especially thus far in 2021,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading. “New speculators are learning for the first time what happens when a bubble pops.”
The largest cryptocurrency at one point on Wednesday lost 31% to drop close to $30,000, less than half of its record of almost $65,000 in April.
“The crypto bubble has started to unravel and data from different exchanges suggest that retail investors are capitulating,” noted Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research analysts Ben Onatibia and Giacomo Pierantoni in a note Wednesday.
They found that speculative activity in Bitcoin started to drop in April, as the open interest in Ether futures rose. Then, leveraged positions in both currency futures fell sharply last week.
That’s when Elon Musk posted a mass of head-spinning tweets criticizing Bitcoin’s energy use. The coin had gained after Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. disclosed on Feb. 8 that the company had bought $1.5 billion of the coins and signaled intent to start allowing it as a way to pay for vehicles.
Earlier: Bitcoin Has Erased All Gains Since Tesla-Fueled Jump on Feb. 8
Bitcoin’s selloff continued Tuesday following a statement from the People’s Bank of China reiterating that digital coins can’t be used as a form of payment.
New entrants to crypto are especially running for the exits, according to a note from Glassnode Insights. About 23% of crypto wallets are now at a loss, and 1.1 million of the addresses have spent all coins they held during this correction.
“It speaks to some of the speculative excess that built up in thematic-type investments, whether you’re talking about some of the hyper-growth companies or Bitcoin,” said Dan Russo, portfolio manager at Potomac Fund Management. “That story got super hot and some of that speculative excess is rolling off.” He added that a case could be made the current episode is a repetition of what’s been seen in speculative manias throughout history.
Adding insult to injury, on Wednesday European Central Bank Vice President Luis de Guindos warned that crypto assets shouldn’t be seen as a “real investment” because their underlying value is hard to discern, and market participants should brace for more price swings.
“Cryptocurrencies clearly won’t reach full potential unless they can penetrate the mainstream -- all of that momentum seems to be reversing itself in the face of Tesla’s mood change, China’s new stance and the likelihood of eventual regulation on the U.S. side,” said Mike Loukas, chief executive officer at TrueMark Investments.

There's increasing evidence that its move is not a bounce but rather the resumption of a bullish trend. Taylor Dart provides more insight below.It’s been an incredible Q2 thus far for precious metals, with the price of silver (SLV) up 18% thus far, clawing back all of its previous year-to-date losses. Notably, the metal continues to outperform gold (GLD (NYSE:GLD)) and the S&P-500 (SPY). The significant outperformance for these key ratios is generally a very good sign for not only silver but the precious metals complex as a whole. As long as this outperformance continues, we should see dips continue to get bought for silver, and the prominent silver miners and GoGold Resources (GLGDF) continues to look to like one of the best small-cap names to play the sector. Let’s take a closer look below:
(Source: TC2000.com)
As shown in the chart above, silver has rallied back towards its highs, where it reversed sharply in early February, but this time around, the stock does not have caution bars just yet (red bars). This is because the stock spent the past two months correcting and wringing out the bullish speculators, with bullish sentiment now sitting at much lower levels despite higher prices. This suggests that silver might be able to re-test its early February high before year-end, and the continued outperformance in the Silver/Gold Ratio and Silver/S&P-500 ratio is a great sign as well. This is because it’s confirming that silver is leading when it comes to these two key ratios, typically denoting a bull market stance and a buy-the-dip environment.

(Reuters) - Blue Origin, billionaire Jeff Bezos' rocket company, disclosed $2 million as the current highest bid for a seat on its New Shepard spacecraft after the startup closed the first phase of its auction.
The second phase of the auction is underway and will last until June 10. The process will conclude in a final phase on June 12 with a live online auction. (www.blueorigin.com)
The rocket company is targeting July 20 for its first suborbital sightseeing trip on its spacecraft, a landmark moment in a competition to usher in a new era of private commercial space travel.

The New Shepard rocket-and-capsule combo is designed to autonomously fly six passengers more than 62 miles (100 km) above Earth into suborbital space.
Reuters reported in 2018 that Blue Origin was planning to charge passengers at least $200,000 for the ride, based on an appraisal of rival plans from billionaire Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE:SPCE) Inc and other considerations, though its thinking may have changed.

The Beijing-based company has joined rivals  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group in racking up double-digit sales growth during the pandemic, as people flocked to e-commerce websites to shop for everything from groceries to luxury goods.
Net revenue at JD.com, China's largest e-commerce company by revenue, rose 39% to 203.2 billion yuan ($31.57 billion) in the quarter ended March 31, topping analysts' average estimate of 191.83 billion yuan, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Sales in its product segment, which includes online retail sales, rose nearly 35% to 175.28 billion yuan in the quarter.
Excluding items, JD.com posted a profit of 2.47 yuan per American depository share (ADS), compared with analysts' expectations of 2.26 yuan.
Popular brands like Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and sports-retailer Decathlon, along with luxury fashion brands such as Marni and John Lobb, launched flagship stores in the quarter on JD.com's e-commerce platform, which, along with those of rivals, has seen strong demand during and after the pandemic.
JD.com's earnings beat comes on the heels of a major regulatory crackdown on Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.
In April, Chinese anti-monopoly authorities fined the e-commerce giant a record $2.75 billion for engaging in a practice known as ""choose one from two,"" wherein platforms penalize merchants for listing products on multiple sites.
Despite how that penalty targeted a rival, the uncertain regulatory environment has dampened investor sentiment across China's internet sector.
U.S.-listed shares of JD have dropped about 13% since news of the fine on Alibaba was announced.
Concurrent with the fine on Alibaba, JD withdrew its initial public offering application for its fintech subsidiary JD Digits from the Shanghai Stock exchange.

However, the company's logistics division is set to raise up to $3.4 billion in an upcoming Hong Kong IPO.

The target is 19% higher from the stock’s current price of $126.
Analyst Brian Gesuale attributed his latest recommendation that is two notches higher from his previous rating to the stock’s recent reverses, making it attractive now. He also pointed out that Axon has constantly exceeded the brokerage’s expectations.
The current valuation ""understates the improving ARR (annual recurring revenue) , adjacent market growth, mix shift and clear-cut intensification of secular tailwinds,” Gesuale said in a note.
Axon posted $195 million in first quarter revenue, up 33% over last year. Gross margin of 63.3% improved 310 basis points year over year, and was its highest in 10 quarters, reflecting strong demand for its premium TASER weapons.

Same-store sales rose by 16% at the chain's outlets that remained open during the first quarter, compared with the level recorded in pre-pandemic fiscal 2020, driven by pent-up demand from U.S. customers who are flush with stimulus checks.
TJX (NYSE:TJX) said second-quarter comparable sales trends at its open outlets were similar to the previous quarter, signaling a rebound in the business of off-price stores that rely heavily on the treasure-hunt shopping experience they offer.
But the company's shares fell about 4% in a lower overall market as it said temporary store closures in Canada and Europe due to government mandates would continue to weigh on its earnings in the second quarter.
The restrictions lowered TJX's first-quarter sales by about $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, which some analysts said was ""worse than expected.""
In the current quarter, TJX forecast its Canadian and European stores to be shuttered for 17% and 7% of the period, respectively.

Its first-quarter overall net sales more than doubled to $10.09 billion, beating a Refinitiv IBES estimate of $8.62 billion.

CEO Alessandro Profumo was sentenced last year in the first instance to six years imprisonment for false accounting in his previous role as chairman of Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena.
Activist investor Bluebell Partners, which owns 25 shares in the defence group, last month proposed launching a liability action against Profumo and seeking damages deriving from the conviction.

Reuters had reported earlier, citing sources, that shareholders voted against the proposal and that the economy ministry, which controls the defence group with a 30% stake, also voted against the proposal, reserving the right to assess future developments in the ongoing legal proceedings involving Profumo. 
Profumo was appointed as CEO of Leonardo in 2017 and is serving a second term due to expire in 2023.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) said on Wednesday it plans to enter the transatlantic market with low-fare flights from New York to London in August, disrupting what is normally one of the world's busiest international routes. 
The airline will launch daily flights to London's Heathrow Airport on Aug. 11 and to Gatwick on Sept. 29, it said in a statement.
While the COVID-19 pandemic has largely stalled travel between the United States and Britain, it opened the door for JetBlue to secure coveted slots at the two London airports, where it hopes to build a larger presence over time and expand the success of its Mint domestic business-class service.
For now, JetBlue has the slots for daily Heathrow service through October but is selling flights through March 26, 2022 because it believes it can secure slots through the winter while it works to obtain longer-term access.
""We expect Heathrow is going to want us to stay once they see what we can do in terms of driving competition,"" JetBlue President Joanna Geraghty told Reuters.
JetBlue is launching the London flights from New York's John F. Kennedy Airport (JFK) on its new Airbus A321LR jets, a longer-range variant of the A321neo, with roundtrip Core cabin fares starting at $599 for U.S.-based travelers and 329 pounds for those based in the U.K.
Fares for Mint class, which features 24 lie-flat private suites, will start at $1,979 and 999 pounds.
By comparison, a roundtrip flight from JFK to Heathrow on American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) or partner British Airways between Aug. 11 and Aug. 18 is selling at $2,573 in business class and $5,489 in first class, according to a web search.
JetBlue is among airlines calling for a speedy reopening of U.S.-Britain travel, something Geraghty was ""cautiously optimistic"" would happen before its London flights begin in August.

Once that happens, JetBlue expects demand patterns to mirror those within the United States, where leisure travel is quickly climbing toward pre-pandemic levels as COVID-19 restrictions ease and more Americans get vaccinated.
JetBlue plans to launch a London service from Boston in the summer of 2022 and continues to seek other European destinations, Geraghty said.

Let’s take a closer look at both names.Cannabis stocks remain popular with investors for good reason. The marijuana industry is still in a nascent stage, which makes it attractive for growth investors. However, while pot producers in the U.S. are on the cusp of profitability, their peers north of the border are struggling with a slew of structural issues.
The rollout of licenses for retail outlets in major Canadian provinces has been slower than expected, which has impacted demand. This in turn has hurt top-line growth and profit margins due to massive inventory write-downs. A thriving black market and a rise in competition have not helped either. Alternatively, the prospect of marijuana legalization in the U.S. at the federal level suggests potential access to a larger market for Canadian cannabis producers, which would afford them improved both revenue and profits at a fast clip.
Here, we take a look at two Canadian stocks, Aurora Cannabis (ACB) and Tilray (TLRY), that have significantly underperformed the broader markets in the last two years to see which is a better contrarian bet today.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's government on Wednesday gave permission for businessman Kenny Rozenberg to join his son in controlling flag carrier El Al Israel Airlines.
Rozenberg, the chief executive of New York-based nursing home chain Centers Health Care who recently became an Israeli citizen, will be eligible to join the airline's board.
Last October, Israel's privatisation body granted control of cash strapped El Al to his son, 28-year-old religious student Eli Rozenberg.
At the time, Rozenberg’s purchase of a controlling stake -- through the newly created Kanfei Nesharim Aviation -- was opposed by the board of El Al, which alleged he was a frontman for his non-Israeli father who financed the deal.
""We invested in El Al for Zionist motives, but we also believe in its business success,"" Kenny Rozenberg said. ""We will do everything necessary for the company to embark on a path of growth and success.""
Earlier this month, the government approved a bailout package for El Al that has the state covering $210 million of company security costs.
The aid depends on the issue of $105 million in new shares, which the carrier has said it would do by July, as well as slashing jobs and other costs.
El Al's loss swelled to $531 million in 2020 from $60 million in 2019 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The airline, which also has a new board and management, has reported losses for three years and racked up debt to renew its fleet. It suspended scheduled passenger flights last March at the outset of the health crisis when Israel closed its borders to most foreign citizens, compounding its financial woes.
Israel has begun to open up international routes to its citizens and some tourists will be allowed to enter starting next week.
El Al is currently one of just a handful of carriers flying to and from Israel after many foreign airlines suspended flights due to the latest fighting between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza.

""In these difficult times for the people and the state, El Al once again proves that it is ... Israel's national leader, in peace time and during critical times,"" Rozenberg said.

Investing.com – Qualtrics (NASDAQ:XM) shares rose more than 2% Wednesday after BofA Securities (NYSE:BAC) upgraded the stock to buy with a $45 target.
BofA analyst Daniel Bartus attributed its optimism to the company’s valuations being attractive and its revenue growth looking sustainable.
Bartus said the positives include the company’s ""leadership position in an emerging CX (customer experience) market and the SAP relationship extending Qualtrics' reach.""
Qualtrics makes software that helps companies engage better with their consumers and employees. The company went public in February.
""With Qualtrics appearing more and more like the potential category winner with likely sustainable 30%+ growth, we view the valuation (which remains a premium) as more justified,"" the analyst wrote.
Co-headquartered in Seattle, Washington, and Provo, Utah, Qualtrics raised its outlook for 2021 last month.
It expects January-December total revenue to come between $980 million and $984 million, compared to an earlier forecast of $950 million to $954 million given on March 9.
Its total revenue in the quarter was $238.6 million, up 36% from $176.1 million in the same quarter a year ago. It had expected the March quarter revenue to come between $226 million and $228 million.

DUBAI (Reuters) - A group of creditors plans to oppose the terms of an offer by Dubai-listed Emirates REIT to exchange $400 million in Islamic bonds for new instruments, four sources told Reuters.
Emirates REIT on Tuesday offered to exchange unsecured sukuk for secured ones as part of a revamp aimed at bolstering the sharia-compliant real estate investment trust's balance sheet, which has been hit by the coronavirus crisis.
The plan envisages extending the bonds' maturity to 2024 from 2022, as well as a deferral of coupon payments for a year.
Creditors will be given instead first-ranking mortgage security over certain assets in Dubai and its financial centre with an aggregate value of about $280 million.
But some creditors plan a counter proposal to Emirates REIT soon, four sources familiar with the matter said.
""A sizeable contingent of sukuk holders has been organized on an ad-hoc basis for some time with advisors in place,"" one said, adding:
""Whereas we welcome the offer as a step in the right direction and an acknowledgment of the problems at hand, there are fundamental concerns concerning the continuing operations and governance of the REIT which need to be addressed.""
The 2022 sukuk, which declined sharply last year, rallied on Wednesday, one of the sources and a trader said.
Three of the sources said some sukuk holders have been in talks with advisory firm Rothschild, which declined to comment.
Emirates REIT last year appointed Houlihan Lokey (NYSE:HLI) to advise it on a strategic review.
Houlihan Lokey managing director Arun Reddy told Reuters on Wednesday that the exchange proposal would likely generate more secondary interest for the new sukuk than the existing ones.
Sylvain Vieujot, chief executive of Equitativa, which manages Emirates REIT, said the offer on the table was ""the most investor-friendly option we could envision.""

The move comes after years of sluggish performance of Dubai real estate, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Emirates REIT's portfolio stood at $690 million at the end of 2020, while its net property income decreased by 11% year-on-year to $52 million.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened sharply lower as a crash in crypto assets - triggered by new regulations announced overnight in China - quickly spread to other risk assets.
With Bitcoin losing 20% in a single session and Ether as much as 40%, stocks seen as proxies for crypto exposure came under heavy pressure. Coinbase Global stock fell over 10% at opening before recovering slightly, while Microstrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) stock fell 11.5% and Square stock fell 3.5%. 
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). whose CEO Elon Musk has loudly trumpeted the virtues of crypto assets this year until his repudiation of Bitcoin last week, fell 4.6%. At current levels, Bitcoin is now trading below where Tesla bought it for treasury purposes around the turn of the year. The company had used unrealized profits on its holding to bolster its bottom line in its first-quarter earnings
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 417 points, or 1.2%, at 33,644 points. The S&P 500 was down 1.5% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.7%.
The slide in crypto assets had begun in the Asian session, when the central bank of China reissued guidance to the financial sector forbidding it from facilitating crypto trading in any way. Given the sizable fines handed down recently to China's biggest Internet companies. it's likely that companies such as Tencent  (OTC:TCEHY) and Ant Group - both of whom were given heavy fines recently for unrelated misdeeds - will comply conscientiously in shutting down a major source of demand for crypto assets. Tencent stock fell 1.4%, while JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) stock fell 0.4%, despite a strong set of quarterly results that should underpin the planned IPO of its logistics unit later this month.
The popularity of crypto assets with retail traders appeared to have knock-on effects to stocks popular with the same cohort of investors. AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), a favorite of this winter's 'meme stock' rally, fell 7.7% amid hints of forced selling, while GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock fell 3.4% - albeit that's a pretty small move for GameStop this year. 
Elsewhere, Cathie Wood's ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK) fell 3.9% to test a six-month low.
Back in old economy news, Target  (NYSE:TGT) stock was one of few to escape the carnage after the retailer restored annual guidance on the back of a stronger-than-expected first quarter.  Target  hit a new all-time high before slipping a little to trade up 5.1%. 
Oil and gas stocks meanwhile were hurt by the sharp drop in crude prices as money flowed out of risk assets in general.  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM),  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) and Conocophillips (NYSE:COP) stock all fell by between 3% and 4%. Mining giant Freeport-McMoran (NYSE:FCX) stock slid 7.9% as industrial metals suffered a similar fate."

BOSTON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) has hired veteran banker Darren Novak from UBS to lead its shareholder activism defense efforts in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, three people familiar with the matter said.
He will be based in London, said the sources who asked not to be identified because the matter is private.
JPMorgan declined to comment and Novak did not respond to a request for comment.
Novak joined UBS in 2017 and moved to the London office from New York in 2019. He was UBS' Global Co-Head of Activist Defense. Before that he worked as a defense banker at Houlihan Lokey (NYSE:HLI).
This is the most recent change in the activism defense ranks at JPMorgan after the bank hired Alfredo Porretti earlier this year to head its activism defense efforts in North America. 
JPMorgan restructured its shareholder advisory business several months ago with David Freedman, a veteran dealmaker, who was tapped to lead the global shareholder engagement and M&A capital markets group.
Kirshlen Moodley, who headed the practice in Europe, Middle East and Africa for JPMorgan, left the bank in late 2020. 

Activism defense has become a major franchise for investment banks, as hedge funds such as Elliott Management, Starboard Value and Third Point (NYSE:SPNT) push for changes at companies.
Novak had been global Co-Head of Activist Defense at UBS with Aneliya Crawford, a former partner at law firm Schulte Roth & Zabel, who was hired by UBS in January.

A U.S. Customs document dated May 10 said a shipment of Uniqlo men's shirts was impounded on Jan. 5 at the Port of Los Angeles due to a suspected violation of the ban. The document said a protest filed by Uniqlo's parent company was denied.
Fast Retailing said it was disappointed by the U.S. Customs ruling. 
""Uniqlo has strong mechanisms in place to identify any potential violations of human and worker rights,"" the company said in a statement to Reuters. ""All Uniqlo items use only cotton that originates from sustainable sources.""

China’s latest crackdown on crypto trading is adding to the nervousness around its fate as regulators grapple with what needs to be done to protect people from excessive speculation. All cryptos, crypto- and blockchain-linked shares are down Wednesday morning in the high single or double digits.  
Commodity prices, too, have touched multi-year highs as economic shifts happen and consumer demand comes roaring back after more than a year of the pandemic. This includes farm products, ferrous and non-ferrous metals.  
April consumer prices ran up 4.2% from a year ago, the fastest acceleration since 2008 and higher than the expected 3.6% as per a Dow Jones estimate.
While the Fed has on more than one occasion said it was focused on employment and that it was comfortable with an inflation rate higher than its long-held target of 2%, a print this high is causing anxiety.
The FAANG stocks were major beneficiaries of the sharp turnaround that happened in the markets following the March 2020 rout. As most people worked from home and gorged on services enabled by the internet, tech company revenue jumped and so did their stock prices.
With people returning to work and tech companies facing a supply crunch of chips that go into making gadgets and smart devices, growth expectations from these firms have tempered. This has reflected in their stock prices, which have weakened over the last quarter.
All-in-all, FAANG stocks in particular look set for a fall as the market opens.

MADRID (Reuters) -Santander boss Ana Botin defended the bank's actions in a court hearing over the withdrawal of a multi-million euro offer more than two years ago to make Italian banker Andrea Orcel its CEO.
The very public row, which judge Javier Sanchez Beltran unexpectedly suspended after a two-hour hearing on Wednesday, offered a rare glimpse into the inner workings of a major bank.
It ended up in a Madrid court after Spain's largest lender dropped plans to make Orcel, previously the top investment banker at Swiss bank UBS, chief executive as a result of a dispute over his pay package. 
Orcel and Botin, both wearing dark suits and masks, sat in the front row at the hearing, which was held in a conference hall instead of a traditional court due to COVID-19 protocols and because of the intense media interest in the case.
The case, which revolves around whether a four-page offer letter to Orcel was a binding job contract or a non-binding initial offer, had been expected to be concluded on Wednesday, although a verdict could take weeks or months.
But Beltran postponed the hearing after a request by Orcel's lawyer Alvaro Remon that top executives from UBS should testify as part of the banker's case. UBS Chairman Axel Weber and Mark Shelton, head of performance and rewards at UBS, were called as witnesses but had not testified on Wednesday for health reasons.
Sources have told Reuters that Weber was a key figure in blocking Orcel's move as he had resisted UBS stumping up some of a deferred compensation package that Orcel stood to lose.
Santander (MC:SAN)'s lawyer Jose Miguel Fatas had told the court he would rather all pending witnesses, including Santander's general secretary Jaime Perez Renovales, who signed the original job offer, and Roberto di Bernardini, the bank's head of human resources at the time, to testify on the same day.
Botin, her mouth and nose covered by a blue mask, told the court that the letter offering Orcel the CEO role ""was not a contract"", and that Santander's board had never approved his final compensation package. 
""The buyout figure was not agreed. The maximum figure was set and the board decided to communicate the appointment on the basis that the overall package would be in line with the market. But the board did not approve the buyout figure,"" Botin said.
She had earlier greeted Orcel, who has not been called to testify, with a ""good morning"" before taking her seat four spaces away from her former investment banking adviser.
Orcel declined to comment after the court hearing.
TRACKING THE 'RAINMAKER'
Botin surprised the banking world when she offered Orcel the top job in September 2018, but Santander changed its mind the following January, saying it could not meet his pay demands.
These centred on covering up to 35 million euros of his compensation package from UBS, where the high-profile ""rainmaker"" Orcel worked on deals for Santander as it built up its presence outside Spain over many years.
Botin said on Wednesday that Orcel's appointment as Santander CEO had never actually taken place and a contract was not fulfilled, although she had met him to discuss the Spanish bank's strategy after offering him the top job.
She said the offer letter to Orcel had stated that any payments he was set to receive from his former employer UBS would help to reduce the total compensation paid by Santander.
But Botin told the court that Orcel had not made his best effort to get UBS to pay a significant portion of his deferred pay and had ""refused to use the 13.7 million (euros) that he was to receive from UBS to reduce the buyout payment"".
After the CEO role fell through, the 57-year-old banker had initially sought as much as 112 million euros ($137 million) from Santander for breach of contract and damage to his career. 
But he cut this to 67 million euros, sources close to the matter said and a court document showed.
Santander's lawyer said after the hearing that Orcel's total claim could be around 76 million euros, taking into account a part of the variable salary that Orcel is also claiming. 
Orcel also dropped the part of his legal claim that would require the Spanish bank to hire him, because he has since been appointed as CEO of Italy's UniCredit.

Pay has also been an issue for Orcel at UniCredit, where last month he only narrowly defeated a shareholder revolt over his up to 7.5 million euro ($9 million) package.

(Reuters) -Singapore Airlines Ltd on Wednesday posted its second-consecutive annual loss, which widened to a record S$4.27 billion ($3.20 billion), and said it would issue S$6.2 billion of convertible bonds to help weather the coronavirus crisis.
The loss for the 12 months ended March 31 was worse than the average S$3.27 billion forecast by eight analysts, according to Refinitiv, and included S$2 billion of impairments largely on the 45 older planes surplus to requirements. 
It was also far bigger than the S$212 million annual loss in the prior financial year, its first ever dip into the red, when only one quarter was affected by the pandemic. 
Annual revenue fell 76.1% to S$3.82 billion in the financial year ended March 31, with strong cargo revenues not enough to offset an almost 98% fall in passenger numbers.
The airline said it expected passenger capacity to rise to 28% of pre-pandemic levels by June, but much of that is due to strong freight demand sustaining the number of flights. It filled just 13.4% of passenger seats in the financial year ended March 31.
The airline, which has no domestic market, has been one of the world's hardest hit in terms of passenger traffic alongside its Hong Kong-based rival Cathay Pacific Airways (OTC:CPCAY) Ltd. 
A proposed travel bubble between Singapore and Hong Kong that had been due to start on May 26 was postponed for the second time on Monday after a recent rise in COVID-19 case numbers in Singapore.
""This crisis is not over,"" Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY) Chairman Peter Seah said in a statement. ""While the growing pace of vaccinations has given us hope, new waves of infections around the world mean that restrictions on international travel largely remain in place.""
Like other carriers globally, Singapore Airlines has cut jobs, deferred aircraft deliveries and raised equity and debt financing to help get it through the pandemic.

The airline said it would issue S$6.2 billion of mandatory convertible bonds that were an optional part of a S$15 billion rescue package led by its majority shareholder, state investor Temasek Holdings last year.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thai Airways International's creditors have voted to approve the airline's restructuring plan, the flag carrier said on Wednesday, as it seeks to recover from financial problems suffered long before the coronavirus pandemic. 
Last year, a court approved the airline's request for bankruptcy protection and debt restructuring worth about 245 billion baht ($7.80 billion)
The plan will allow for an extension on bond payments, interest and the option for debt-to-equity conversion, said Somboon Sangrungjang of law firm Kudun and Partners, which represents creditors including 87 savings cooperatives.
The creditors proposed the appointment of finance ministry official Pornchai Thirawet, acting Thai Airways CEO Chansin Treenuchagron and former chief Piyasvasti Amranand, as plan administrators, the airline said on Wednesday.
Piyasvasti was CEO of Thai Airways the last time it was profitable. 
Two others were also proposed by Bangkok Bank Pcl.
The Thai government holds a 47.86% stake in the carrier, but it is not governed by the country's state-enterprise law.
The airline was in difficulty well before the coronavirus pandemic grounded flights across the globe, booking losses nearly every year after 2012.
It has blamed competition from low-cost carriers and an open skies policy for the poor performance. Last year it booked a record loss of 141.1 billion baht ($4.66 billion). 
So far, it has cut some 200 executive positions and sold a training facility in Bangkok to state-owned oil and gas firm, PTT Pcl for 1.8 billion baht.
The carrier in March said it plans to fly a slightly leaner fleet with 86 jets by 2025 from current levels of 103. Thai Airways says it has cut 30 billion baht ($954.5 million) in expenses. 

It had already began implementing early retirement programmes to reduce staff to a target of under 15,000 from 28,000 in 2019.

Investing.com – Shares of blockchain- and crypto-linked companies were having a rough time in Wednesday’s premarket as China clamped down on financial institutions and payment companies to stop them providing services related to cryptocurrency transactions.
MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) was down 8%, Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT) 9% and Marathon Digital (NASDAQ:MARA) 12%.
Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) fell 6%. It's now down 45% from its debut-day peak in April and 10% below its initial reference price.
Predictably, all crypto currencies were down too with Bitcoin (BitfinexUSD), which has the largest market cap of them all, slipping below $39,000. ETH/USD lost almost one-fourth of its value and so did DogeCoin.  
According to Reuters, institutions, including banks and online payments channels may not offer clients any service involving cryptocurrency, such as registration, trading, clearing and settlement. The new restrictions, which essentially only reinforce limitations that have been in place since 2017, come against the backdrop of a regulatory campaign aimed at taming the country's Internet giants such as Tencent and Ant Group, whose payment services have reportedly facilitated much of the recent rebound in Chinese crypto activity.
Last few days have been rough for the crypto world with one of its biggest champions, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, sending confusing signals. After more than a quarter of adding to the hype around Bitcoin, he suddenly repudiated it last week due to its excessive energy consumption. He remains an advocate for less energy-intensive assets such as DogeCoin, although he jokingly described even that as a 'hustle' on Saturday Night Live earlier this month.
The latest slump in cryptos also comes amid questions over their stability, store of value and their use by criminals, notably for ransomware attacks such as the one on the Colonial Pipeline Company last week."

92,By Reuters,"<span>May 19, 2021 07:47AM ET</span>","No pain, no gain for big funds hunting the next Tesla","By Ben Klayman, Paul Lienert and Echo Wang
(Reuters) - Place your bets! The race to find the next Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is on but the search is turning up plenty of clunkers as well as potential superstars.
Fidelity Investments, BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), T. Rowe Price Group Inc and Scotland's Baillie Gifford are among the fund houses helping to bankroll the shift from fossil-fueled transportation with investments in one or more of 32 electric vehicle industry companies which they believe will be long-term winners in the electrification movement.
In the short-term, there have been some bumps in the road.
In just three weeks, from late April to mid-May, the combined value of those 32 companies has slid more than $200 billion to $810 billion, according to data compiled by Reuters and investor website Pitchbook, with Tesla, the world's most valuable automaker, accounting for three-quarters of the drop. (Graphic: Short-term losses on EV investments (br) Short-term losses on EV investments (br), https://graphics.reuters.com/AUTOS-ELECTRICCARS/INVESTORS/gjnvwnkqepw/chart.png) 
The steep slide in the EV sector is, for some market observers, a natural progression from the sky-high valuations being doled out in a crowded market to companies, which in some cases have no revenues or even products to sell.
""You are going to see some roadkill,"" said Evangelos Simoudis, venture investor and author of “Transportation Transformation”.
Of the 32 companies analysed by Reuters, 17 are doing or have done reverse mergers via special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) often referred to as blank-check companies. Of the remaining 15, six are private with the rest publicly listed. Of the four big fund managers, T. Rowe Price has not invested in any of the EV-related SPACs. (Graphic: Fund managers bankroll electric vehicle surge, https://graphics.reuters.com/AUTOS-ELECTRICCARS/INVESTORS/azgvoxeorpd/chart.png) 
The market drop is particularly prevalent among those startups that have gone public through reverse mergers. From late April to mid-May, the market cap of Lordstown Motors plunged 32%, while battery company QuantumScape fell 29% and infrastructure company ChargePoint was down 24%.
During the same period, Tesla's value declined 23%.
Reuters could not quantify the overall impact of the recent slide in electric vehicle company valuations on the individual asset managers as some of the investments are private and it is unclear how much each firm has invested in each.
BlackRock has invested in 22 of the 32 companies, Fidelity in 19, Baillie Gifford in eight and T. Rowe Price in four.
The risk to mom-and-pop investors in mutual funds is somewhat limited, because portfolio managers typically spread their bets across more than 100 companies in a wide array of sectors.
The big houses also parcel out their key investments across a number of their funds. Fidelity, for instance, distributes its Tesla investments to more than 100 of its mutual funds.
""We are looking for companies that are going to compound (in value) over time,"" said Elliot Mattingly, Fidelity's chief auto analyst and portfolio manager of the Fidelity Select Automotive Portfolio.
Mattingly’s $191 million fund has posted a 102% total return over the past year. The fund’s top holding, though, is auto veteran Toyota, which accounts for 11% of the total portfolio. General Motors (NYSE:GM), Tesla and Chinese electric carmaker Nio (NYSE:NIO) rank second, third and fourth, respectively, fund disclosures show. 
ROULETTE WHEEL
With traditional stock-picking funds losing business to cheaper index-tracking players, there is pressure to find stocks that will juice returns. 
""These big investors, they're like, 'You know what, I'm going to bet on red, black.' They basically take out one quarter of the roulette wheel and they start putting money around and then they refine it,"" said Tony Aquila, chief executive of and an early investor in EV startup Canoo.
""It's no different than a sophisticated bettor in Vegas.""
An investment from a major fund firm is a huge endorsement for startups with no track record, and executives in the electric vehicle industry say such funds are accelerating the shift from fossil-fueled transportation.
""In categories where you have high innovation and it's an arms race, like with EVs, the BlackRocks and Fidelities are playing a very important role (in) stimulating innovation,"" said Aquila.
A new route for institutional investors, which have seen both traditional investment opportunities and returns dwindle as the number of public companies has shrunk, is the PIPE, or private investment in public equities (PIPE).
Backers of so-called SPACs or blank-check companies -- listed shell companies that raise money to acquire private businesses -- started offering private investments to big investors, typically at a discount, last year as a way to get them into startups ahead of their public offerings.
Buying into a company via a SPAC can be riskier because SPACs have greater latitude than companies doing a traditional IPO to make growth projections that may not materialise.
The Reuters analysis of investment data compiled by PitchBook shows a cadre of 17 EV-related startups has raised more than $9 billion in private investments backed by one or more of the big asset managers.
BlackRock declined to comment for this story but it has been vocal about the transition to a more sustainable world presenting ""a historic investment opportunity.""
LONG-TERM PLAYS
The PIPE route isn't universally popular.
Baltimore-based T.Rowe Price has steered clear of offers from blank-check sponsors in the EV space, preferring instead to invest in companies with a path to going public within two to three years, giving it time to get acquainted with their strategies and have some influence on their boards.
""We don't like to spray and pray,"" said Joe Fath, portfolio manager of the T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund. ""Some investors spread bullets in a lot of different places. We do deep industry and company-specific research (and) selectively bet on firms that we think will be durable winners.""
Fath is a board observer at Rivian where T. Rowe Price has led the last three private investment rounds. Rivian's valuation continues to climb — from about $6 billion in early 2019 to an estimated $27.6 billion after the most recent raise in January 2021.
Baillie Gifford, a 113-year-old fund firm whose early bet on Tesla has helped it outflank peers, is active as a pre- and post-IPO investor in several well-known EV makers.
It has also participated in private placements connected with aerial vehicle startups Joby and German rival Lilium.
The firm, with around $450 billion in assets under management, has a strategy of investing in companies that it expects to grow dramatically.
The firm's investment in Chinese EV and battery maker BYD, which is also backed by Warren Buffett, has shed 13% of its value from late April to mid-May. Baillie Gifford's shares in newly public ChargePoint have dropped 24% over the same period.

Investment manager Brian Lum said the firm's focus was on long-term performance. 
""We typically hold things for five years, 10 years or even longer,"" said Lum. ""EV dominance is almost inevitable.""

LONDON (Reuters) - British online fashion retailer Boohoo has bowed to pressure from lawmakers to link multimillion pound bonuses for its executives to improvements in its supply chain, including workers' rights.
In September, Boohoo accepted the recommendations of an independent review which found major failings in its supply chain in England after newspaper allegations about working conditions and low pay, and set out steps to tackle the issues.
Boohoo, which sells clothing, shoes, accessories and beauty products targeted at 16- to 40-year-olds, has also faced investor criticism over a bonus scheme which would pay up to 150 million pounds ($213 million) to its founders and executives if its share price rises 66% over three years from June 2020.
Co-founder and chairman Mahmud Kamani and co-founder Carol Kane could each be in line for 50 million pounds, Mahmud's son Samir, who is CEO of BoohooMan, could be in line for 25 million while finance chief Neil Catto could get 10 million pounds.
Parliament's Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) recommended the bonuses be linked to Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) improvements following an evidence session in December, attended virtually by Mahmud Kamani and other executives.
Boohoo has accepted that recommendation.
""Whilst we ultimately believe that the full resolution (or otherwise) of these (supply chain) issues will be reflected in long-term share price performance (and thus have an impact on the value of awards) we have also agreed with participants to add a new non-financial performance condition,"" Boohoo's annual report, published on Wednesday, said.
Under this new target, Boohoo's remuneration committee must be satisfied that the group's ""Agenda for Change"" programme to fix supply chain issues has been successfully implemented over the three-year performance period before the vesting of any management incentive plan (MIP) awards.
The remuneration committee is made up of non-executive directors.
""In the event of the committee determining that the Agenda for Change programme has not been successfully implemented in full, we will have the ability to reduce the level of vesting of awards, irrespective of the share price growth achieved over the performance period,"" the report said.

Shares in Boohoo were down 0.6% at 0743 GMT, valuing the company at 4 billion pounds.

U.S. airlines are preparing for a rebound in summer bookings after nearly a year in the doldrums as mass vaccination gains pace and countries ease travel restrictions for vaccinated travelers.
Southwest said it had seen improvements in leisure passenger travel demand and bookings for May and June this year, adding that based on current bookings, leisure fare levels in June are nearing June 2019 levels.
The company also said it was continuing to see ""modest, consistent improvements"" in business passenger demand and bookings, though it still lagged leisure travel trends. 
The company now estimates its average core cash burn, excluding changes in working capital, to be in the range of $1 million to $3 million per day in the quarter, compared with its previous estimation in the range of $2 million to $4 million per day. 
Cash burn, a measure that U.S. airlines began providing in 2020 to measure liquidity in light of the pandemic hit, was about $6 million per day in April. The company said operating revenues for the month performed in line with its expectations.

Southwest added it now expects capacity to increase about 87% in the second quarter from the year-ago quarter, compared with its previous forecast of a rise of about 90%, primarily due to changes in its service plans.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening sharply lower Wednesday, continuing the downward move from the previous session, with the tech sector under particular pressure ahead of the minutes of the latest Federal Reserve meeting.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 235 points, or 0.7%, S&P 500 Futures traded 36 points, or 0.9%, lower, and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 175 points, or 1.3%.
On Tuesday, the major indices all ended in the red after a late selloff, with tech stocks giving up their gains and energy shares dragged lower by the falling oil price. The broad-based S&P 500 fell 0.9%, the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.8% and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.6%. 
Growth stocks, and the mega tech companies in particular, have come under pressure lately on fears growing inflationary pressures could prompt the Federal Reserve to rein in its easy policies earlier than expected. 
Sentiment in the tech sector has also been hit by a sharp drop in cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin falling below $40,000 for the first time in 14 weeks. 
The Nasdaq Composite is almost 5% lower in May, the S&P 500 is just over 1% lower while the DJIA is still marginally higher. 
The minutes of the April meeting of the Fed’s Open Market Committee will be published later Wednesday. While this get together came before the big April jobs miss and last week’s higher-than-expected CPI number, investors will still study the details for clues on the Fed’s monetary intentions.
In corporate news, the retail sector will remain in focus Wednesday after Tuesday’s blowout numbers from Walmart (NYSE:WMT),  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) and Macy's (NYSE:M).  Target  (NYSE:TGT) continued the good news with a 23% jump in first-quarter sales, while Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) numbers beat expectations on robust home improvement spending. L Brands (NYSE:LB), the owner of Victoria’s Secret, reports after the close.
Oil prices weakened Wednesday as investors digested the prospects of more supply entering the market following reports of progress in the talks between the United States and Iran to revive a deal limiting the Persian Gulf country’s nuclear program, which could lead to a lifting of sanctions on its crude exports.
Additionally, data from the American Petroleum Institute showed that U.S. crude inventories rose by 620,000 barrels last week. If confirmed by U.S. government data later in the session, that would be the first weekly increase in three weeks. 
U.S. crude futures traded 2.1% lower at $64.12 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 2% to $67.34.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.5% to $1,858.95/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.2208.

104,By Reuters,"<span>May 19, 2021 05:55AM ET</span>","Analysis-To tackle climate change, China must overhaul its vast power grid","By Muyu Xu and John Geddie
BEIJING/LONDON (Reuters) - One of the most pressing challenges for China to meet its pledge to cap carbon emissions this decade and pivot toward renewables is overhauling its electricity grid, the world's largest, officials and analysts say.
    Beijing's surprise announcement last year that it would hit peak emissions by 2030 and become carbon neutral by 2060 could presage the biggest reduction in projected global warming of any climate commitment to date, researchers say.
    But building new solar plants and wind farms is the easy part, analysts say. Upgrading the system that transmits that green power to faraway consumers could be five times more costly, and depends on rapid technological progress.
    ""When we talk about the challenges, most people focus on the (electricity) grid,"" said Chunping Xie, an expert on China's policies on climate change and energy at the London School of Economics and Political Science. ""It's the first step in this long journey.""
Investments in China's grid and other associated costs are expected to exceed 6 trillion yuan ($896 billion) over the next five years, Mao Weiming, former chairman of State Grid, said in a speech in October.
China, the world's biggest electricity generator, power consumer and carbon emitter, has said it is aiming for renewable power to account for more than 50% of its total electricity generation capacity by 2025, up from 42% now. 
    This mainly involves pivoting to solar and wind energy and away from coal, of which China is the biggest global consumer. Beijing plans to more than double its solar and wind power capacity to 1,200 gigawatts (GW) by 2030, from 535 GW now.  
    Such a drastic swing from coal, which generates a stable baseload power supply, to renewables, which can fluctuate with weather conditions, could play havoc with China's electricity network, officials say.
    A senior manager in charge of dispatch at China's State Grid - the world's largest utility, which manages 75% of the country's network - told Reuters the system had already ""reached its ceiling"" of how many renewable sources it could handle and still maintain stable operations. The official asked to remain anonymous as he is not authorised to talk to the media.
But China, which runs the world's largest power system, with a total installed capacity of 2,201 GW compared with 1,107 GW in the United States, is pressing on. 
By 2030, it has said it will force grid operators to buy at least 40% their of power from non-fossil fuel sources, up from around 28% now.
MAJOR COSTS
    Alex Whitworth, a research director at Wood Mackenzie, said that the pace of grid investment would most likely be maintained until the end of the decade, and would be five times higher than the cost of building additional renewable plants in that period.
    The major costs involve new power lines, re-tooling hundreds of coal plants as backup generators, and ramping up storage capacity, analysts and officials say.
    At least seven new ultra-high voltage power lines would be built over the next five years to better connect the country's far western regions, where solar, wind and hydropower plants are mainly located, to China's big cities, the State Grid said. China has 29 such lines already.
    That buildout could cost an estimated $34 billion. 
    ""We have reached a consensus that China will preserve coal plants, but only for emergency uses,"" said Shu Yinbiao, president of Huaneng Group, China's second-largest power generation firm, and a former State Grid president. 
    But China is struggling to promote costly modifications to coal plants allowing them to offset gyrations in renewable power. It typically costs 150 million yuan ($23.27 million) to upgrade a 300-megawatt coal plant. 
    Only about 10% of coal-fired power plants in China have been modified, according to data from State Grid and China Electricity Council.
""China will need to establish a mechanism to make coal power unfavourable in the renewables' booming moment,"" said Zhang Shuwei, a director at Draworld Energy Research Centre. ""Otherwise China is not able to advance its green agenda.""
TECH PROBLEMS 
    Power storage is another obstacle.
Bing Han, a senior research analyst at IHS Markit, expects China to need about 120 GW of energy storage to support additional solar and wind power needs by 2030. That is four times more than the 32.3GW capacity in place as of 2019, according to China Energy Storage Alliance.
    For battery storage, Wood Mackenzie's Whitworth said China is expected to install 47 GWh by 2030, more than four times the total global storage capacity today.
    But it is not just a question of cost. Chinese officials have said they are worried about slow technological developments. 
    ""Power storage technology has not realized revolutionary progress,"" said Li Gao, director of Climate Change Department at the Ministry of Ecology and Environment at a media briefing in April.
    Michal Meidan, director of the China Energy Programme at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, said ""geopolitical tensions"" and ""technological rivalry"" between China and Western countries could also hinder the collaboration needed to improve Beijing's storage capacity. 
    ""It's not to say China cannot innovate, but it could take longer until China has its home-grown innovation,"" she said.
    Other analysts questioned China's commitment to renewable power plans given its lack of clarity on phasing out coal and continued expansion of new power plants. China put 38.4 GW of new coal-fired power capacity into operation in 2020, more than three times the amount built elsewhere around the world.
    But all agreed tackling the power system is an essential first step of a project critical to the future of the planet.

    ""The world just can't achieve climate targets without China,"" said LSE's Xie. ""China's role in the world is now of a magnitude that makes its actions in the immediate future critical to how the world goes forward.""

A retreat in commodity prices made miners and oil and gas stocks among the top losers in Europe, with BP (NYSE:BP) down 1.2%, Shell (LON:RDSa) off 1.8%, BHP Group (LON:BHPB) 2.2% lower and Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) down 1.9%.
Oil prices weakened Wednesday as investors digested the prospects of more supply entering the market following reports of progress in the talks between the United States and Iran to revive a deal limiting the Persian Gulf country’s nuclear program, which could lead to a lifting of sanctions on its crude exports.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.4% lower at $64.61 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 1.3% to $67.86.
This weak tone followed a late selloff on Wall Street, with all the major tech stocks ending in the red as investors feared holding growth companies into the release of the minutes of the last Federal Reserve meeting.
Stocks have been pressured of late on concerns that growing inflationary pressures could force the U.S. central bank to rein in its ultra-easy monetary policies.
With this in mind, investors will study the minutes of the April Fed meeting, when they are released later Wednesday, for clues of when the central bank could consider cutting back its bond purchases, a move likely to precede increases in interest rates.
Further evidence of these global inflationary pressures was seen in the U.K., as Britain’s inflation rate doubled in April. Consumer prices rose 1.5% from a year earlier last month after a 0.7% gain in March, driven mainly by a jump in domestic energy prices and clothing. 
In corporate news,  Julius Baer  (SIX:BAER) stock rose 2.4% after the Swiss wealth manager said it was on track to deliver on financial targets as it posted an 8% rise in assets under management for the first four months of 2021.

(Reuters) -Private equity firm KKR aims to buy John Laing Group in a deal that values the British infrastructure investor at about 2 billion pounds ($2.84 billion), it said on Wednesday.
It makes John Laing the latest British company to be taken private as London-listed firms carry a discount to global peers, undermining the value of staying public, and private equity sees a chance for handsome returns.
""Under private ownership and with flexible access to capital, John Laing can take a longer term view as an owner and operator of assets during the next phase of its growth,"" KKR's Co-Head of European Infrastructure Tara Davies said.
John Laing shareholders will be entitled to 403 pence per share in cash, a premium of 27% to the stock's close on May 5, the day before the company confirmed it was in takeover talks.
Shares rose as much as 11.4% to 402 pence, just below the offer price. They have gained 22% in value this year.
In March, it reported a loss before tax of 65 million pounds for the year ending Dec. 31, 2020, compared with a loss of 95 million pounds a year earlier.
It could benefit as major economies, including the United States and the United Kingdom, invest heavily in infrastructure projects, with U.S. President Joe Biden pushing through a $2 trillion plan. 
""KKR is a strong partner, providing long-term capital and global expertise to accelerate John Laing's strategy,"" said John Laing Chairman Will Samuel.
John Laing, which owns and develops infrastructure assets across the Americas, Australia and Europe, plans to recommend shareholders back the deal.
It has invested in over 150 projects straddling transport, social infrastructure, the energy transition and digital infrastructure.
KKR said it has agreed to partner with infrastructure investor Equitix, which will buy a 50% stake in the British company's existing asset portfolio.

A source close to the deal, asking not to be named, said the company will continue to be operated from the United Kingdom by the existing management.

By Vera Eckert
FRANKFURT (Reuters) -The European Energy Exchange (EEX) could double the number of participants in its Japanese power futures market from around 20 players in 2021, having traded over 3 terawatt hours (TWh) in its first 12 months, executives said.
Interest in wholesale trading was boosted by extremely cold weather early this year, which left Japanese retail suppliers undercovered, said Steffen Riediger, director for Power Derivatives at the EEX, a unit of Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn).
The harsh weather highlighted Japan's reliance on gas imports for power, if nuclear and renewables do not provide enough supply.
""This demonstrated the rationale behind hedging supply gaps,"" Riediger said in an interview. ""It demonstrated the importance of futures, especially bourse-traded ones, which eliminate counterparty risks.""
The 3 TWh EEX futures traded in Japan since May 18, 2020 are equivalent to supplying electricity to a city of 350,0000 inhabitants for a year, Riediger said.
While that is still small compared to Japan's power consumption of 1,000 TWh a year, it shows the huge size of trading potential in a country that has twice Germany's power usage.
In its European core futures markets, EEX traded 4,736.3 TWh in 2020, up 19% from 2019.
EEX offers weekly, monthly, quarterly, seasonal and annual delivery periods up to six years in advance, based on the index set by local spot power bourse JEPX.
Commodities and freight activities by the EEX span all time zones, including North America.
""Japan was much faster than we thought,"" said EEX Chief Operating Officer Steffen Koehler, comparing Japan with Germany's year-long trek to arrive at mature power markets.

EEX benefited from its clearing arm, the ECC, which was known to international banks and brokers, who took their customers along.
In 2021's first quarter, traded volumes in Japan amounted to 2.32 TWh, representing 96% market share, leaving the remainder to local rival TOCOM.

At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.2% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 1.2% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.9%. 
The major indices on Wall Street failed to hold onto early gains on the back of strong retail earnings Tuesday, suffering a sharp selloff into the close. All the major tech stocks ended in the red as investors feared holding these growth companies into the release of the minutes of the last Federal Reserve meeting.
Stocks have been pressured of late on concerns that growing inflationary pressures could force the U.S. central bank to rein in its ultra-easy monetary policies.
With this in mind, investors will study the minutes of the April Fed meeting, when they are released later Wednesday, for clues of when the central bank could consider cutting back its bond purchases, a move likely to precede increases in interest rates.
Ahead of that, U.K. consumer prices rose 0.6% on the month in April and 1.5% on the year, a sharp rise from the 0.3% and 0.7% respective figures seen the previous month.
In corporate news,  Julius Baer  (SIX:BAER) will be in focus after the Swiss wealth manager said it was on track to deliver on financial targets as it posted an 8% rise in assets under management for the first four months of 2021.
Other companies set for the spotlight include E.ON (DE:EONGn), Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn), Experian (OTC:EXPGF) and  Premier Foods  (LON:PFD), as they publish their latest results.
Oil prices weakened Wednesday as investors digested the prospects of more supply entering the market following reports of progress in the talks between the United States and Iran to revive a deal limiting the Persian Gulf country’s nuclear program, which could lead to a lifting of sanctions on its crude exports.
Additionally, data from the American Petroleum Institute showed that U.S. crude inventories rose by 620,000 barrels last week. If confirmed by U.S. government data later in the session, that would be the first weekly increase in three weeks. 
U.S. crude futures traded 1.1% lower at $64.78 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 1.1% to $67.98.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,874.10/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.2240.

111,By Reuters,"<span>May 19, 2021 01:40AM ET</span>",Julius Baer confirms targets as AuM grow 8% through April,"(Corrects to reflect day is Wednesday (not Tuesday) in final paragraph)
ZURICH (Reuters) - Julius Baer said it was on track to deliver on financial targets as the Swiss wealth manager posted an 8% rise in assets under management for the first four months of 2021 to 470 billion Swiss francs ($523.9 billion).
""The increase was driven by continued net new money inflows (4% annualised), positive stock market performance, and the softening of the Swiss franc ‒ particularly against the US dollar, euro, and British pound,"" Switzerland's third-largest listed lender said in a statement on Wednesday.
Wealth managers saw a boon from increased client activity amid the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, benefiting from high transactions levels and amassing fewer loan loss risks than high street peers.
Baer, meanwhile, has been increasing its focus on the ultra-wealthy under Chief Executive Philipp Rickenbacher, who assumed the role in late 2019, and trimming costs.
That helped the group achieve an adjusted cost/income ratio of around 60% through April, an improvement from 66% in the second half of 2020 and far ahead of the target it had previously set for 67% by 2022.
The Zurich-based lender, which did not provide profit and revenue figures in its four-month interim statement, also reported an improvement in gross margin to 90 basis points, up from 84 basis points in the final six months of 2020. 
The bank in February posted a 50% rise in 2020 net profit, as booming markets and strong client trading helped it overshoot its mid-term targets.
But analysts had expected low and negative interest rates to weigh on the group this year, while they also anticipated a slowdown from frenzied activity levels.

Baer on Wednesday said client activity levels had remained elevated throughout the first quarter, but slowed to ""more subdued levels"" in April.

113,By Reuters,"<span>May 18, 2021 08:21PM ET</span>","Biden pitches $174 billion EV plan in Michigan, takes truck for a spin","By Nandita Bose and David Shepardson
DEARBORN, Mich./WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden made the case on Tuesday for his $174 billion electric-vehicle proposal, urging automakers not to build zero-emission vehicles abroad for U.S. consumers - and even got to take a new zero-emission truck out for a drive.
""We need automakers and other companies to keep investing here in America and not take the benefits of our public investments and expand electric vehicles and battery manufacturing abroad,"" Biden said on a visit to a Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co electric-vehicle plant in Dearborn, Michigan, to see the EV version of its best-selling F-150 pickup truck.
The United Auto Workers (UAW) has criticized General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) for announcing a $1 billion investment in Mexico to build EVs and Ford for opting to build some EVs in Mexico rather than Ohio.
GM noted it had recently announced nearly 9,000 new U.S. jobs and $9 billion in U.S. EV and battery facilities. Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford said at the event that Biden ""understands that building things in this country matters"" and added the company employs more UAW workers than its Detroit rivals.
The UAW also wants GM to recognize the union at joint-venture battery facilities. Ford is considering similar ventures. ""We need you to deepen your partnership with the UAW,"" Biden added.
UAW President Rory Gamble urged Biden to make sure investment encourages strong labor standards, good union jobs and U.S.-built vehicles.
Biden argues the United States is falling behind China, which is selling more EVs. 
""We're going to set a new pace for electric vehicles,"" the Democratic president said, vowing to reverse what he called the Trump administration's ""short-sighted"" rollback of vehicle emissions standards.
Biden went to a Ford test track to briefly drive the EV truck still camouflaged ahead of its official reveal on Wednesday. U.S. presidents are typically not allowed to drive by security officials.
""This sucker's quick,"" Biden told reporters, adding it could go from 0-60 miles an hour in just 4.4 seconds. ""It feels great."" 
REBATES, TAX CREDITS
Biden ruled out consumer incentives for high-priced electric luxury models, according to a White House fact sheet, as he argues for dramatic government spending to prod Americans to buy electric vehicles.
His electric-vehicle plan, first announced on March 31, cheered investors who bought shares in several electric-vehicle startups that have struggled. Shares in electric truck maker Lordstown Motors Corp rose more than 20% and shares in Nikola Corp were up more than 6% in late trading.
Biden is pushing for electric vehicles in the auto industry's heartland, and trying to win over auto workers worried that more electric cars and trucks will mean fewer jobs.
The White House wants to encourage new battery production facilities, which are key to ramping up U.S. electric vehicle manufacturing.
Biden's plan ""proposes cost-sharing grants to support new high capacity battery facilities in the United States"" and backs grants to fund the retooling of shuttered factories ""to build advanced vehicles and parts.""
The centerpiece of Biden's EV plan is $100 billion in consumer rebates. Biden backs a further $10 billion in new tax credits for zero-emission medium- and heavy-duty work vehicles.

Biden faces resistance from many congressional Republicans on his EV focus. Republicans are poised to release a counterproposal to Biden's infrastructure plan and Republicans will meet with Biden's commerce and transportation chiefs later on Capitol Hill.
The president wants $15 billion to build 500,000 EV charging stations by 2030 - including in apartment buildings and public parking - and $45 billion to electrify a significant number of school and transit buses. He also wants to fund shifting the federal fleet to more EVs, including for the Postal Service to begin using EV delivery trucks.

(Reuters) -  Under Armour  Inc (NYSE:UAA) shareholders may pursue a lawsuit accusing the sports apparel company of concealing how it pulled sales forward from future quarters to meet Wall Street revenue forecasts, the subject of a recent regulatory settlement, a federal judge ruled on Tuesday.
U.S. District Judge Richard Bennett in Baltimore said the shareholders' securities fraud claims were ""plausible,"" after taking into account Under Armour (NYSE:UA)'s $9 million civil settlement on May 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The SEC had found that the Baltimore-based company misled investors by not disclosing that significant portions of its revenue and revenue growth resulted from its having accelerated sales orders over six quarters in 2015 and 2016.
It said Under Armour ""pulled forward"" about $408 million of orders, a practice that raised ""significant uncertainty"" it could meet its future revenue guidance.
Bennett had dismissed the proposed shareholder class action in August 2019, before the SEC probe became known.
But he said the SEC settlement ""lends support"" to the shareholders' claims, citing allegations that Under Armour and top officials including then-Chief Executive Kevin Plank knew the sales practice could be misleading.
James Wareham and Jon Talotta, who are lawyers for Under Armour and Plank respectively, declined to comment.
Plank, who founded Under Armour in 1996, is now executive chairman.
Lawyers for the lead plaintiff, the Aberdeen City Council as Administrating Authority for the North East Scotland Pension Fund, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Under Armour did not admit or deny wrongdoing in settling with the SEC. Plank was not charged, and Under Armour said SEC staff confirmed it did not intend to recommend charges.
The case is In re Under Armour Securities Litigation, U.S. District Court, District of Maryland, No. 17-00388.

(Reuters) -Alphabet Inc's Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) on Tuesday unveiled updates across many services, including Maps, Photos and operating systems, as the company showcases its role in a world that has become more digitally connected during the pandemic.
The announcements during the virtually-held Google I/O developer conference add up to a boost for the company's smartwatch efforts, which compete with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) , and for its collaboration tools that rival offerings from  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). 
They also show how Google is aiming to demonstrate that its advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) will keep users attracted to its ad-supported or paid services for shopping, communication and entertainment even as pandemic lockdowns ease and people resume in-person activities.
Google said its smartwatch operating system, Wear OS, would be adopted by its newly-acquired Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) unit and Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co , both of which had used their own systems for years. Now working together, the companies could attract more app developers and better compete with Apple Watch.
The company also shared new editing and viewing options for Google Docs and other work software, including a simple tool that suggests using inclusive terms instead of gendered words.
Chief Executive Sundar Pichai has made advocating for social justice a priority across the company, and in another move the company said by this fall its Pixel smartphones would better capture darker skin tones and curly and wavy hair in photos.
AI updates included a new effort to help drivers using Google Maps reduce sudden braking by navigating them on ""safer"" routes. Google Photos will offer users a reminder that they can search Google Images for specific objects in screenshots. 
Google also said a more powerful computer chip, TPU v4, important to AI development would be available this year to Google Cloud customers.

Android 12, the latest version of the mobile operating system active on over 3 billion devices globally, will arrive later this year packed with personalization features such as customizing apps' color schemes. It will also enable devices to be used as a digital key for some cars.
In a tease of futuristic collaboration software, Pichai revealed Project Starline, video-conferencing booths that use so-called light-field displays to let people view a 3D representation of their counterparts. Healthcare and media companies would test the system, Pichai said.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended down on Tuesday, slumping on a sharp decline in telecom stocks and weak housing starts data that overshadowed better-than-expected earnings from Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD). 
AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) shed 5.8%, among the biggest percentage decliners in the benchmark S&P 500. It extended declines from Monday, when the telecoms firm said it would cut its dividend payout ratio as a result of its $43 billion media asset deal with Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Inc.
T-Mobile and  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ) also dropped 3.71% and 1.31%.
Eight of 11 major S&P sectors ended the session in the red, with Energy and Industrials having largest percentage decline, according to Refinitiv data. Utilities were basically flat. 
The three main indexes opened higher after Walmart, the world's biggest retailer, raised its full-year earnings forecast and Home Depot reported quarterly same-store sales above estimates.
""Those are both emblematic of strength in the corporate sector and also of the consumer. I mean, you can't have Walmart and Home Depot have blowout earnings without the consumer really stepping up spending stimulus checks, adopting ecommerce, as well as getting back into stores"", said Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird in Louisville, Kentucky. ""And a lot of the bull thesis for the market right now is still built on a really strong reopening of the economy.""
Despite its strong results, Home Depot's shares went down 1.02%, under pressure due to the lack of a solid outlook and the housing data.
Latest data showed U.S. homebuilding fell more than expected in April, likely pulled down by soaring prices for lumber and other materials.
Minutes from the Fed's April policy meeting will be parsed on Wednesday for the central bank's view of the economy.
""The market is bracing for a transition,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey. ""So there's a little bit of de-risking going on.""
Wall Street has been volatile in recent days, with investors worried that an overheating economy could prompt the Federal Reserve to rein in its monetary support following a spike in volatility last week after strong inflation readings.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 267.13 points, or 0.78%, to 34,060.66, the S&P 500 lost 35.46 points, or 0.85%, to 4,127.83 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 75.41 points, or 0.56%, to 13,303.64.
Fund managers recently trimmed their overweight positions on technology stocks to a three-year low as inflation worries left growth stocks vulnerable to a pullback, and turned overweight on UK stocks for the first time in seven years, a survey from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) showed.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.01 billion shares, compared with the 10.48 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days. 

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.09-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.07-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 43 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 105 new highs and 50 new lows.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Two key U.S. lawmakers said on Tuesday they are seeking records from Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on production issues involving the 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner.
House of Representatives Transportation Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio and Rick Larsen, who chairs a subcommittee, said they were seeking records after multiple issues recently emerged ""regarding the 737 MAX as well as the 787, including electrical problems, the presence of foreign object debris in newly manufactured aircraft, and other issues.""
The panel conducted an extensive investigation into the 737 MAX after two fatal crashes led to a 20-month grounding that was lifted in November. The committee's report was part of the reason Congress approved an overhaul of the FAA's aircraft certification program in December.
The two Democrats want the FAA and Boeing to ""provide records regarding production-related issues and the FAA's oversight of Boeing's manufacturing operations.""
The FAA said it was reviewing the request ""and will make every effort to respond to them as quickly and completely as possible.""
Boeing, which said it had seen a letter from DeFazio and Larsen and would review it, last week won approval from the FAA for a fix of an electrical grounding issue that had affected 109 737 MAX airplanes worldwide.
The top three U.S. 737 MAX operators - Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Airlines - removed more than 60 jets from service after the notice from Boeing.
American said Tuesday 10 of its 18 affected 737 MAX planes had resumed flying and the remainder expected over the next few days.

The FAA said in September it was investigating manufacturing flaws involving some Boeing 787 Dreamliners. Boeing said in August airlines operating its 787 Dreamliners removed eight jets from service as a result of two distinct manufacturing issues.
In March, the FAA said it was taking ""a number of corrective actions"" to address multiple 787 production issues, including retaining authority to issue approval certificates for four specific aircraft.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks fell on Tuesday, with technology shares turning lower in late New York trading, while the U.S. dollar touched its lowest level since late February.
The Nasdaq also reversed course to end the day lower, while the Dow and S&P 500 added to declines late in the session. The S&P 500 technology index was the biggest drag on the benchmark S&P 500.
Investors were anxious ahead of Wednesday's release of minutes from the Federal Reserve's April policy meeting. Rising inflationary pressure in the United States has been increasing investor speculation the Fed could possibly raise interest rates sooner than anticipated.
While few market-watchers expect big surprises from the minutes, ""the market is bracing for a transition,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey. ""So there's a little bit of de-risking going on.""
Fed Vice-Chair Richard Clarida on Monday pointed to the weak April jobs report as proof of lingering weakness in the economy. 
Telecommunications shares lost ground, while retailers mostly gained. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, the world's biggest retailer, raised its full-year earnings forecast. AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) added to declines from Monday, when it said it would cut its dividend payout ratio.
Concern over the Israel-Palestinian conflict added to investor unease, Krosby said. 
World powers including the United States urged a truce in the conflict as Israel bombarded Gaza with air strikes and Palestinian militants resumed cross-border rocket fire on Tuesday.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.17% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.04%.
Still, the dollar dipped for the fourth straight session on waning fears over the Fed's outlook. The progress of COVID-19 vaccine deployment and easing of measures to contain the pandemic have lifted higher-risk currencies that stand to benefit most from economic revival.
The dollar index fell 0.437%, with the euro up 0.02% to $1.2222.
Bitcoin dipped 1.9% to a more than three-month low, extending its slide after Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc boss Elon Musk dampened enthusiasm for the cryptocurrency over the weekend. 
Nominal U.S. Treasury yields remained little changed, with the yield on 10-year Treasury notes up 0.9 basis point at 1.649%, below a spike above 1.75% reached in late March.
Investors are awaiting the release of the Fed minutes, but nothing significant is expected, said Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.
""It's unlikely that we're going to get material changes out of the FOMC minutes,"" he said.
Oil prices settled lower. Media reports said the United States and Iran have made progress on reviving a deal restricting the OPEC country's nuclear weapons development, which would boost crude supply.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Colonial Pipeline's said its scheduling system was back online on Tuesday after a network outage earlier in the day prevented customers from planning upcoming shipments on the biggest U.S. fuel pipeline.
The disruption was caused by efforts by the company to harden its system as it restored service following a week-long outage due to a cyberattack, Colonial said, and was not the result of a reinfection of its network. [nFWN2N50UY]
Last week's closure of the 5,500-mile (8,900-km) system was the most disruptive cyberattack on record, preventing millions of barrels of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel from flowing to the East Coast from the Gulf Coast. 
After the ransomware attack forced Colonial to shut its entire network, thousands of gas stations across the U.S. southeast ran out of fuel. Motorists fearing prolonged shortages raced to fill up their cars. 
Colonial has been using its shipper nomination system to schedule batches of fuel deliveries to bring flows back to normal. 
Colonial's shipping nomination system is operated by a third party, privately-held Transport4, or T4, which handles similar logistics for other pipeline companies. T4 did not comment on whether its systems for other pipelines were affected.
Though Colonial's scheduling network was back online, it was still moving slowly, said a market source.
As of Tuesday, more than 10,400 filling stations were still without fuel, according to tracking firm GasBuddy, down from more than 16,000 at the peak last week. 
In North Carolina, one of the hardest-hit states, gas outages dropped below 50% on Tuesday, GasBuddy said. South Carolina, Virginia and Georgia all also had outages below 50%.

Just under 70% of gas stations in Washington, D.C., were still without fuel, down from around 90% over the weekend.
""The number of stations without gasoline is likely to drop under 10,000 today,"" said GasBuddy's Patrick De Haan on Tuesday.

As a result, crypto mining stocks Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT) and Ebang International Holdings (EBON) experienced significant selling pressure last week. So, let’s take a closer look at these two companies' fundamentals.The market has been very upbeat about cryptocurrencies over the past several months. Both retail and institutional investors have been considering adding cryptocurrencies to their portfolios to hedge against uncertainties in the financial markets and use them as a store of value. Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, received a solid boost in the beginning of the year from a large strategic investment in it by Tesla (TSLA), which announced its intention to accept bitcoin as a mode of payment from people for its vehicles.
This led to increased confidence in cryptocurrencies by investors. Crypto investors even ignored warnings issued by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen that bitcoin is an “extremely inefficient” way to conduct monetary transactions and that federal regulations on cryptocurrencies may soon be forthcoming. But then Elon Musk tweeted that TSLA had suspended vehicle purchases using bitcoin amid concerns surrounding the use of fossil fuels in mining. This precipitated a correction by major cryptocurrencies. Investors have been up in arms and have been selling crypto mining stocks because the decline in crypto prices directly affects the top-line of these companies.

(Reuters) -Amazon.com Inc said on Tuesday it is extending until further notice a moratorium it imposed last year on police use of its facial recognition software.
The company had halted the practice for one year starting in June 2020. Its announcement came at the height of protests across the United States against police brutality toward people of color, sparked by the killing of George Floyd, a Black man, during an arrest in Minnesota.
Civil liberties advocates have long warned that inaccurate face matches by law enforcement could lead to unjust arrests, as well as to a loss of privacy and chilled freedom of expression.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s extension, which Reuters was first to report, underscores how facial recognition remains a sensitive issue for big companies. The world's largest online retailer did not comment on the reason for its decision.
Last year, it said it hoped Congress would put in place rules to ensure ethical use of the technology, though no such law has materialized.
Amazon also faced calls this month from activists who wanted its software ban to be permanent.
Nathan Freed Wessler, a deputy project director at the American Civil Liberties Union, expressed support for Amazon's move and called on federal and state governments to ban law enforcement's use of the software.
""Face recognition technology fuels the over-policing of Black and Brown communities, and has already led to the false arrests and wrongful incarcerations of multiple Black men,"" he said in a statement.
Amazon offers face-matching with ""Rekognition,"" a service from its cloud computing division. Customers relying on the program to find human trafficking victims have still had access to the facial recognition capabilities, Amazon has said.
Critics have noted research born out of a project called Gender Shades, which showed Rekognition struggled to determine the sex of individuals with darker skin tones. Amazon has contested this.

Due to Amazon's prominence and prior defense of facial recognition, its moratorium has carried significance. Rival  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) said shortly after Amazon's announcement last June that it would await U.S. federal regulation before selling its face recognition software to police.
Pharmacy chain Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) Corp also stopped use https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-riteaid-software of the technology at its stores, it said the following month.

127,By StockNews,"<span>May 18, 2021 04:30PM ET</span>",Is Inflation a Concern for Value Stocks?,"The last week was like starting a roller coaster in the middle. For the first three days, the S&P 500 (SPY) fell fast and hard, only to recover on Thursday and Friday. Now the question is, are we headed for another fall, or is the ride over? Either way, volatility has been the name of the game as inflation worries deepen. Higher inflation discounts a growth stock’s present value and raises the likelihood that the Fed will raise rates, harming cyclical value stocks. Due to the sky-high valuations, I see growth stocks as more susceptible to losses. Value stocks, in general, have much more room to grow. Plus, we are picking the best of the best, which should succeed in any market environment. Read on below for what to do next….(Please enjoy this updated version of my weekly commentary from the POWR Value newsletter).
Last week started with a thud as stocks finished down on Monday as investors kept a close eye on the cyber-attack on a major U.S. pipeline. While the Dow hit an intraday record earlier in the day, it slid in the afternoon. Value stocks were relatively flat, while growth stocks, represented by the SPDR S&P 500 Growth (SPYG) ETF, lost 2%. Value stocks performed better as shares are still trading at an attractive level.
This continued Tuesday morning until losses extended to cyclical shares by midday as inflation fears returned to the forefront. A cocktail of rising prices, labor constraints, and potentially more stimulus has added fuel to the fire that inflation could take off. The losses on Tuesday were broad-based, with 84% of S&P 500 components down on the day. Faster inflation could mean sooner rate hikes by the Fed, despite their current stated position.

However, growing concerns surrounding the legality of CBD in dietary supplements could negatively affect the sales of CBD producers. This, along with uncertainty surrounding the legalization of marijuana at the federal level in the U.S., makes the prospects bleak for financially weak CBD stocks  Canopy Growth  (NASDAQ:CGC), Village Farms (VFF), Charlotte’s Web Holdings (CWBHF), and Neptune Wellness Solutions (NASDAQ:NEPT). Let’s discuss.Cannabidiol (CBD) has gained immense popularity recently owing to its growing use in various sectors, such as healthcare, cosmetics and wellness, food and additives. However, a persistent confusion related to CBD and its benefits, coupled with uncertainty surrounding the legality of hemp-derived supplements, remain a concern for the industry. In fact, the longer the FDA takes to legalize CBD in dietary supplements, the higher the odds of people losing faith in its benefits. This could negatively impact the sales of leading CBD producers.
Although the legalization of cannabis by different states for recreational purposes could be pivotal for the cannabis industry, the use of marijuana has yet to be legalized at the federal level. In addition, given the increase in competition in the cannabis industry, a few stocks have failed to generate sufficient revenues to stay afloat.
Against such a backdrop, we think financially-weak CBD companies Canopy Growth Corporation (CGC), Village Farms International, Inc. (NASDAQ:VFF), Charlotte's Web Holdings, Inc. (OTC:CWBHF), and Neptune Wellness Solutions Inc. (NEPT) may not be able to show any improvement in their businesses. So, we think it could be wise to avoid these stocks now.

(Reuters) -A federal judge on Tuesday questioned a $2 billion proposal by  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) that would create a framework for resolving future claims that its Roundup weedkiller causes cancer, casting doubt on the plan a day before a key hearing.
Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) and class action attorneys hope U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria in San Francisco will give preliminary approval on Wednesday to create a class of people exposed to Roundup who could get sick in the future.
The agreement would provide free medical exams and up to $200,000 in compensation if a class member is diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a cancer.
Chhabria in a court filing asked if it was possible to contact the potentially millions of homeowners and farmworkers who have been exposed to Roundup to notify them they were going to be bound by the settlement.
He also wanted to know how he would determine if the compensation was adequate and whether he should evaluate the plan against other options, including Bayer adding a cancer warning label to Roundup, something the company has resisted.
Chhabria noted in his final question that jury trials have gone very well for plaintiffs. Given that, the judge asked why class members should agree to a settlement that requires them to present at future trials a report from a science panel that will spend the next four years determining if Roundup causes cancer.
""The last question is a killer,"" said David Noll, a professor at Rutgers Law School.
The company has said decades of studies have shown Roundup and its active ingredient glyphosate do not cause cancer and are safe for human use. Consumer groups and personal injury lawyers have criticized the plan because it prevents lawsuits for four years and bars class members from seeking punitive damages.
Bayer said in a statement that judges often raise questions for parties to address prior to hearings. 
""We look forward to working with the court and the parties through the approval process to ensure the class plan is fair to all parties,” the company said.
Chhabria said if his nine areas of concern were addressed at the hearing, a second hearing would be scheduled to deal with smaller concerns.

The company in June agreed to commit $9.6 billion to settle the existing 125,000 claims over Roundup, which is separate from the class settlement aimed at resolving future claims.
Bayer inherited the glyphosate-based herbicide Roundup, and the litigation, as part of a $63 billion acquisition of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) in 2018.

Investing.com – The Dow closed lower on sharp selling into the close Tuesday as tech stocks gave up gains and energy shares were dragged lower by falling oil prices on fears an Iran nuclear deal will boost global oil supplies.   
The S&P 500 fell 0.89%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.78%, or 267 points,  and Nasdaq Composite fell 0.57%.

The company denied claims in the report. ""We never compromised the security of our users or their data in China or anywhere we operate.""
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shrugged off reports that famous shorts-seller Michael Burry reportedly has initiated a $534 million bet against the stock.
Energy was the biggest laggard as oil prices slumped on fears of a wave of Iranian supply amid reports that a nuclear deal will be sealed on Wednesday. A Russian envoy, however, clarified that there had been no major breakthrough in Iranian nuclear talks, though significant progress had been made.  
The reopening trade - bullish bets on stocks tied to the progress of the economic reopening – remain in demand, shaking off the broader market struggles as Covid-19 restrictions continue to ease.
Casino and travel stocks were among the top gainers in the consumer discretionary sector, with MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM), Carnival (NYSE:CCL) and Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) in the ascendency.
On the earnings front, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) was the standout performance, closing up 2% after reporting better-than-expected first-quarter results, driven by strong grocery and e-commerce sales. The supermarket giant also raised its outlook on full-year sales.  
Macy’s ended roughly flat despite posting a surprise first-quarter profit and raised its full-year guidance amid ongoing momentum as the pace of reopening of the economy gathers pace.
On the economic front, housing data that fell short of economists' forecast was largely shrugged off as home-building activity remains elevated.

Investing.com -- Markets were up, markets were down, apparently a bit uncertain of where to go. 
Tech stocks slipped, as did energy, with oil prices lower on fears Iranian oil may soon come to market in a revived U.S.-Iran nuclear deal.
Alternative energy darlings FuelCell, Workhorse and  Plug Power  (NASDAQ:PLUG) jumped thanks to President Joe Biden's push to subsidize electric vehicles.  
AT&T (NYSE:T) dropped after it said it will spin off its media business and merge it with Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) to create a streaming giant to take on Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Disney. That did prompt smaller entertainment producers like ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) and Lions Gate to jump on speculation that further consolidation is ahead as rivalries heat up.
Tomorrow, investors will parse through the minutes from the latest Federal Reserve meeting to figure out the thinking on inflation and possible stimulus tapering.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Retail reports 
 Target  (NYSE:TGT), Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) and TJX (NYSE:TJX) will try to match the strong results posted by Walmart (NYSE:WMT),  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) and Macy's (NYSE:M), all of which easily topped forecasts. If tech is more your speed, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) reports after the close. The company is expected to post modest gains in profit (82 cents a share) and revenue ($12.6 billion).
2. Fed minutes
Economists and investors alike can peruse the minutes of the Fed's April meeting, but the views represented therein came prior to the big April jobs miss and the higher-than-expected CPI number from last week. Still, there might be some useful bits in there for those that want a more granular take on what ""transitory"" means. 
3. Start spreading the news
New York City reopens on Wednesday. Grab some friends and be a part of it. Capacity restrictions on restaurants, theaters, museums and stores end after more than a year. Neighboring New Jersey and Connecticut will be doing the same, but nobody sings about them.

BERKELEY, Calif. (Reuters) -The family office run by ""Big Short"" investor Michael Burry has disclosed a large bearish bet via options on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.
Scion Asset Management said in a regulatory filing on Monday that it had put options on 800,100 shares in Tesla as of the end of the first quarter. Based on Tesla's closing price of $667.93 at the end of the first quarter the value of that many shares would be about $534 million.
Details on the strike price of the puts, their value and whether they are part of a broader trade were not available. Scion Asset Management did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the matter.
While the actual value of the options position was not known, the Securities and Exchange Commission rules state positions under 10,000 shares and less than $200,000 in total market value are not required to be disclosed.
Put options give investors the right to sell shares at a certain price in the future.
It is possible the puts disclosed in the filing may be part of a larger trade that would curb losses if the put position goes against the fund, options analysts said.
""That could be the long leg of a put spread,"" said Henry Schwartz, head of product intelligence at Cboe, referring to a strategy involving a combination of purchase and sale of put options.
""That said, since they reported no long shares, and Burry is a pure 'value' investor it probably is a short bet,"" he said.
One of the investors profiled in the book ""The Big Short' and the film of the same name for betting more than $1 billion against the U.S. housing bubble, Burry has been skeptical of Tesla's sky-high valuations.
Powered by strong sales and its first annual profit, Tesla shares jumped more than 700% last year and hit a record high of $883 per share in January. But they have since fallen as hedge fund managers raise concerns that the stock is overvalued.
The shares closed at $576 per share on Monday, valuing the electric car maker at around $555 billion. 

Burry also said last year that sales of green regulatory credits to Fiat Chrysler which Tesla has relied on to generate profits will dwindle.
Stellantis, owner of Fiat Chrysler, said this month it expects to achieve its European carbon dioxide emissions targets this year without environmental credits bought from Tesla.

Let’s find out.Bloom Energy Corporation (BE) and  Cummins Inc . (NYSE:CMI) are two established players in the hydrogen-generated energy space. BE provides solid oxide fuel cell technology and is known mainly for its Bloom Energy Server. CMI designs, manufactures, distributes and services diesel and natural gas engines and engine-related component products.

Because President Biden is aiming to cut U.S. emissions by as much as 52% by 2030, the hydrogen fuel segment is expected to get a major boost, along with other alternative energy sources.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -JPMorgan Chase & Co told employees on Tuesday that fully vaccinated staff do not have to wear masks at its U.S.-based offices, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.
Employees are asked to enter their vaccination status into an online database organized by the bank. Employees who have not been vaccinated must continue to wear a face covering in all public and common spaces, private offices and meeting rooms, according to the memo.
The change in policy comes one day after the bank began requiring employees to return to work in offices, and it follows similar moves by Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc,  Target  (NYSE:TGT) and others that lifted mask-wearing mandates in accordance with the U.S. government's new guidance.
Last week, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised that fully vaccinated people do not need to wear masks outdoors and can avoid wearing them indoors in most places.
Employees working at its Chase bank branches or in receivables operations will still have to wear masks, the company said, ""due to the high levels of client interaction (and) other factors,"" according to the memo, which was verified by a bank spokeswoman.
Employees may also need to wear masks in some common areas, like lobbies in buildings where JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) is leasing its offices. Staff should also continue practicing social distancing and must complete daily health checks at all bank facilities, the company said.
But for fully vaccinated employees, ""life in the office will be a bit closer to what it used to be,"" the memo said.
JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon has been a strong advocate for the COVID-19 vaccines and has said the bank is looking into whether it can legally require staff to get the shots. 

""We strongly believe that the more people who are vaccinated, the safer we all are from the spread and impact of COVID-19,"" the bank said in the unsigned memo. 
JPMorgan on Monday began requiring its employees to return to work at offices in the United States at least for a few days each week. The bank's goal is for nearly all employees to return to working in the office on a rotational basis by July.

Hohn's TCI Fund Management, which has a 2.93% stake in Canadian National (CN), said the company should not go ahead with its plan to create a voting trust structure for the takeover.
""CN regularly engages with and welcomes constructive input from its shareholders. CN's board believes its pro-competitive combination with Kansas City Southern is in the best interest of CN's shareholders,"" a spokesperson for CN in a statement.
CN and  Canadian Pacific  (NYSE:CP) Railway are seeking to buy U.S. railroad Kansas City Southern to create a North American railway spanning the United States, Mexico and Canada.
Kansas City last week accepted CN's $33.6 billion acquisition offer, upending a $29 billion deal with Canadian Pacific.
""We think it is negligent and hugely irresponsible for the CN board to commit C$2 billion of shareholders' money on whether the STB will approve the voting trust for the CN-KCS transaction,"" TCI said in a letter to CN Chairman Robert Pace.
The C$2 billion stems from the $700 million breakup fee CN would pay Canadian Pacific for upending their deal, and the $1 billion it would pay Kansas City if the U.S. Surface Transportation Board (STB) shoots down the voting trust.
A voting trust is a temporary ringfenced structure that CN would use to hold Kansas City after the deal closes without exercising control over it, until the STB approves or rejects the acquisition.
TCI is also the largest shareholder of Canadian Pacific with an 8.38% stake, according to Refinitiv data.

""It is now clear that CN should abandon its pursuit of KCS unless the merger agreement is amended such that it is not conditional on a voting trust being approved,"" TCI added.
TCI said it believes the STB reviewing CN's bid under the new rules makes approval for the deal uncertain.

MADRID (Reuters) -Italian banker Andrea Orcel has cut his claim against Santander (MC:SAN) over a rescinded offer to make him chief executive by tens of millions of euros, sources said and a court document seen by Reuters on the eve of a hearing show.
The case, which stems from Santander's decision more than two years ago to ditch plans to make Orcel its CEO after a disagreement over pay, is due to be heard in a Madrid court on Wednesday after several earlier hearings were delayed.
The hearing will revolve around whether a four-page offer letter was a binding job contract or a non-binding initial offer as argued by Santander. It is expected to be concluded in a day but a verdict could take weeks or months.
Orcel, who quit his job as the top investment banker at UBS in 2018 to join Santander, had been seeking as much as 112 million euros for breach of contract and the damage to his career from the last minute U-turn.
But he has now dropped the part of his legal claim that would require the Spanish bank to hire him because he has since been appointed CEO of Italy's UniCredit, a source with knowledge of the matter, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
Earlier on Tuesday, the source said that the Italian banker was now seeking slightly more than 45 million euros ($55 million) from Spain's largest bank. 
That claim includes 17 million euros related to a bonus and around two years' fixed salary at Santander, estimated at around 11 million euros, and around 20 million out of a 55 million compensation package that he was due to receive in future years from UBS, according to the source.
That figure does not include around 10 million euros for alleged damage to Orcel's reputation or an additional 10 million euros relating to a tax equalization scheme, which brings the total claim to 67 million euros, the court document shows.
This tax scheme was part of the compensation package from his then employer UBS.
The source with knowledge of the matter said that the reputational damage was unlikely to be accepted by the Madrid court given Orcel had landed a new job at UniCredit.
The legal rationale for the case, which centred on defending Orcel's integrity and honour, was unchanged, the source said.
Santander and a spokesman for Orcel declined to comment.
BOTIN IN COURT
The two sides will face off in front of judge Javier Sanchez Beltran in a hearing, which was twice postponed, that is expected to include testimony from Santander Chairman Ana Botin.
Orcel, who has been out of a job for more than two years, is expected to attend the court hearing in person though he has not been called to testify, the source said.
Botin surprised the banking world when she offered Orcel, her go-to investment banker for advice on deal-making and strategy, the top job at Santander in September 2018.
It is less common for investment bankers to go directly to a top position in commercial banking and hiring a highly-paid dealmaker to run the largest bank in Spain, still recovering from recession and negotiating job cuts, proved contentious. 
Santander changed its mind the following January, saying it could not meet Orcel's pay demands, which centred on paying up to 35 million euros of the compensation package from UBS.
In addition to Botin, Roberto di Bernardini, who was Santander's head of human resources at the time, is also expected to testify at Orcel's request. 
Santander has only asked for its general secretary Jaime Perez Renovales, who signed the original job offer, to testify, but this could be dropped, two sources said.
One of parties had requested Renovales to be removed from the list because he should not be allowed under Spanish law to testify as a witness and be the bank's legal representative.
A court spokesman said the judge would take a final decision on Renovales on Wednesday.
UBS Chairman Axel Weber and Mark Shelton, head of performance and rewards at UBS, will not testify due to health reasons, a Madrid court said.

UBS and UniCredit both declined to comment.

141,By Reuters,"<span>May 18, 2021 02:36PM ET</span>","Lawmakers say AbbVie exploits U.S. patents to protect Humira profits, price hikes","By Diane Bartz
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday accused the chief executive of  AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV) of profiting from Americans by repeatedly raising U.S. prices on its widely-used Humira rheumatoid arthritis drug while cutting the price abroad.
The increases should prompt Congress to pass a law allowing the Medicare federal health plan to negotiate prices with drug companies, said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, chair of the House Oversight Committee.
The committee issued a staff report that said AbbVie exploited the U.S. patent system to fend off competitors and increased the price of Humira to $77,000 for a year's supply, while the price of its cancer drug Imbruvica was raised to $181,529 per year.
""This investigation also revealed something even more distressing: drug companies are actively targeting the U.S. for price increases, while cutting prices in the rest of the world,"" Maloney said.
AbbVie CEO Richard Gonzalez testified about the high cost of bringing a drug to market. He did not directly address concerns about the company's use of patents, including allegations that it applied for more than 200 patents for Humira, known as a ""patent thicket,"" so it could file multiple lawsuits against companies seeking to sell cheaper generic, or biosimilar, versions of the medicine.
That angered Republican Clay Higgins, who pressed Gonzalez to explain the company's patent practices.
When Gonzalez attempted to defend the patents, Higgins cut him off. ""They're frivolous,"" he said. ""You have a right to make an honest profit but it's a question of whether or not it's an honest profit.""
Representative James Comer, the top Republican on the committee, also took aim at AbbVie's patent practices.
""While seeking hundreds of patents on a medication or vaccine is not illegal under our existing system, it can be anti-competitive and result in higher costs,"" he said.

Democratic lawmakers were no happier. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz denounced the ""greed"" of drug companies while Katie Porter said: ""You lie to policy makers when you tell us that R&D (research and development) justifies ... price increases.""
Humira - the world's top-selling prescription medicine - is expected to have more than $20 billion in sales in 2021, according to Refinitiv data.

The Beijing-based tech giant has diversified its revenue sources by expanding its cloud services, artificial intelligence, and smart transport technology footprint as competition for advertising sales heats up from local internet giants  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and ByteDance.
The company, which obtained a secondary listing in Hong Kong in March, said total revenue rose 25% to 28.13 billion yuan ($4.38 billion) in the first quarter, boosted partly by the 70% year-on-year growth of its non-advertising revenue, which includes the fast-growing cloud business.

(Reuters) -Walmart Inc on Tuesday raised its full-year earnings forecast after shoppers armed with government stimulus checks ventured back into stores, driving demand that is expected to continue through the year as Covid-19 restrictions ease.
Shares in the world's biggest retailer were up about 3% after it reported a strong quarterly sales beat and said it expects fiscal 2022 earnings to increase by high single digits. It had previously forecast a slight decline in profit for the year. 
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) has had a bumper year bolstered by a big push into e-commerce and delivery. While this trend towards shopping online is expected to continue, people are also making their way back to brick-and-mortar stores as vaccinations become more widely available.
Visits to Walmart stores around the country grew by 21.7% in April, according to data firm Placer.ai. 
On Friday, Walmart began allowing fully-vaccinated people to shop without wearing masks, making it the first major retailer to walk back its mandatory mask policy.
""My optimism is higher than it was at the beginning of the year,"" Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon said on a post-earnings call. ""In the U.S., economic stimulus is clearly having an impact, but we also see encouraging signs that our customers want to get out and shop.""
Walmart executives added that with savings rates at an all-time high, there will likely be enough appetite later this year to help sustain demand after the stimulus money dries up.
U.S. same-store sales rose by a better-than-expected 6% in the quarter as people gravitated towards apparel, recreation and home improvement products like outdoor living and sporting goods, the company said.
""We expect ecommerce inroads made into grocery, consumables, and general merchandise categories to be very sticky resulting in growing digital market share gains,"" Ken Perkins, founder of research firm Retail Metrics, said.
Online sales in the quarter lost some momentum, but still rose 37%, compared with a surge of 74% in the year-earlier period and 69% in the prior quarter.
The retailer has invested heavily in its online delivery business, hoping to sneak an edge over rival Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) with its membership plan Walmart+, drone delivery pilot programs as well as a bigger third-party marketplace.

Earlier this year, Walmart also said it would convert two-thirds of its U.S. hourly store roles to full-time positions, while also increasing pay for some of its hourly U.S. workers to an average above $15 an hour.
Operating income rose 32.3% to $6.91 billion in the quarter, while Walmart reported adjusted earnings of $1.69 per share beating estimates of $1.21 per share. Total revenue rose 2.7% to $138.31 billion.

(Reuters) -CVS Health on Tuesday named former Aetna (NYSE:AET) Chief Financial Officer Shawn Guertin as its new finance chief, in the latest hiring of a former executive of the health insurer since Karen Lynch was named chief executive.
Shares rose about 5% as the company, best known for its national chain of retail drugstores, also reiterated its recently issued 2021 adjusted earnings per share forecast range of $7.56 to $7.68.
CVS bought Aetna in 2018 to help tackle soaring healthcare spending through lower-cost medical services in pharmacies, and Guertin played a key part in the $69 billion deal. 
""Guertin is no stranger to CVS. He was lined up to become CFO of the company following the Aetna deal in 2018,"" Baird analyst Eric Coldwell said in a client note. 
Guertin, who was with Aetna for eight years, left CVS in 2019 for ""personal and family reasons"", according to the company. 
He will now take charge on May 28 and succeed Eva Boratto, who is leaving the company after 11 years. 
This is the second top-level appointment of a former Aetna executive at CVS. The health services company had in February named former Aetna President Karen Lynch as its chief executive officer to succeed long-time boss Larry Merlo.

""His (Guertin's) appointment marks further migration of CVS's senior leadership toward the MCO (managed care organization) side,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Anton Hie said. 
CVS is betting on its Aetna health insurance and pharmacy benefits management units to drive growth this year as its retail segment recovers from a sales hit due to the curbs imposed last year to control the pandemic.

But which stock is a better investment now? Read more to find out.KLA Corporation (KLAC) is an international process control and yield management supplier for semiconductor and nanoelectronics companies. With a $45 billion-plus market capitalization, KLAC is a dominant player in the U.S. semiconductor industry. ASML Holding N.V (ASML) is a Netherlands-based semiconductor equipment manufacturer with sales concentrated in Europe, the United States and Asia.
The rising demand of semiconductors, given their applications in almost every technology-oriented industry, has grabbed investor attention in this space. Furthermore, with an adverse supply shock currently gripping global markets, semiconductor prices have been rising sharply, allowing manufacturing companies to generate hefty profits on roughly the same volume of sales. With budding industries, such as electric vehicles (EVs) and 5G magnifying the demand for semiconductors, most manufacturing companies are taking steps to boost their production capacity through multiple new “fab” manufacturing factories. The Chips Act, which is a part of President Biden’s proposed $2 trillion in infrastructure spending allocates approximately $50 billion to developing the domestic semiconductor infrastructure. 
These factors should allow the semiconductor industry to grow rapidly over the next few years to meet the high demand.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A leading U.S. banking regulator announced Tuesday it was reconsidering a recently updated rule on fair lending standards, setting aside an effort finalized under the Trump administration.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said it was revisiting a rule update completed in 2020 around the Community Reinvestment Act, a 1977 community lending law that requires banks to show how they are supporting lower-income communities. 
The agency added that banks no longer had to update their systems to comply with the 2020 modifications, and it was also shelving proposed rules related to implementing the rewrite.
The move effectively acknowledges that the OCC is abandoning earlier efforts to update the rules single-handedly. Under former chief Joseph Otting, a Republican, the OCC pushed forward to update the rules, finalizing the new requirements in 2020 even as two other banking regulators that share responsibility for enforcing the law failed to do so.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Federal Reserve jointly share CRA authority with the OCC, but both agencies have yet to complete an update to rules around the law, which were last changed in 1995.
The previous OCC effort was aimed at giving banks more clarity and flexibility in terms of what activities they could do to earn a passing grade with regulators. But some community groups and Democrats cautioned it could allow banks to do less to support lower-income communities while staying in regulators' good graces.

Investing.com – Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) shares rose 6% Tuesday as Rosenblatt Securities upgraded the stock to a buy, citing several tailwinds it believes will help the company exceed the brokerage’s estimates.
Rosenblatt’s Blair Abernethy has given a $285 target for the stock. This is nearly 27% higher than its current level of $225.
Snowflake will report its April quarter earnings, its first for the financial year, on May 26.  
“Given the healthy IT spending environment so far this year, the accelerating digital transformation trends, and the strong first quarter performance from the leading cloud service providers, we expect Snowflake to meet and possibly exceed our 93% year-on-year product revenue growth estimate,” Abernethy wrote.
Snowflake’s product revenue growth in the fourth quarter of last financial year was 116% from the year-ago period. Its total revenue in the last quarter was $190 million and $109 million in the first quarter of last financial year.
The analyst estimates Snowflake to report revenues of $209 million in the first quarter of this financial year. This will translate into a 92% year-on-year growth."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A group of Democratic U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday urged  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) to drop plans for a version of photo-sharing app Instagram for children younger than 13, saying the social media company had failed to ""make meaningful commitments to protecting kids online.""
Senators Ed Markey and Richard Blumenthal and Representatives Kathy Castor and Lori Trahan said Facebook had not addressed their concerns. Facebook told the lawmakers in an April 26 letter made public on Tuesday that it does not have a set timeline for the version, but expects development will ""take many months.""
“Facebook has a clear record of failing to protect children on its platforms,"" the lawmakers said in a joint statement. ""When it comes to putting people before profits, Facebook has forfeited the benefit of the doubt, and we strongly urge Facebook to abandon its plans to launch a version of Instagram for kids.""

A Facebook spokesman said Tuesday ""as every parent knows, kids are already online. We want to improve this situation by delivering experiences that give parents visibility and control over what their kids are doing.""
The company said previously it will not show ads in any Instagram version for people under 13.

The letter from the state attorneys general cited 2019 media reports that Facebook’s Messenger Kids app, intended for kids between the ages of six and 12, ""contained a significant design flaw that allowed children to circumvent restrictions on online interactions and join group chats with strangers that were not previously approved by the children’s parents.""

Air France flight 342 took off from Charles de Gaulle airport with a 16% mix of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in its fuel tanks, produced in France by Total from used cooking oil.
The flight signalled a ""shared ambition to decarbonize air transportation and to develop a SAF supply chain in France"", the companies said in a joint statement with airport operator ADP.
Jet fuel produced from biomass or synthetically from renewable power has the potential to slash carbon emissions, albeit at a heavy cost by comparison to the price of kerosene.
Starting next year, flights departing from France will be required to use 1% SAF, ahead of European Union goals to reach 2% by 2025 and 5% by 2030 under the bloc's Green Deal policy.
But traditional network airlines have sought to exempt long-haul flights, arguing that a Europe-only SAF requirement could expose them to unfair foreign competition.
That has drawn an angry response from low-cost airlines including Ryanair, Wizz Air and easyJet (LON:EZJ), which wrote to the EU in March to demand that the rules apply to all flights originating in Europe.
Airlines have a ""major responsibility"" to cut emissions, Air France-KLM Chief Executive Ben Smith said on Tuesday - while reiterating doubts about European SAF quotas for long-haul.
""We have to be on a level playing field,"" Smith told Reuters. ""We can't have a situation where airlines that are based outside Europe can undercut us, (and) that is a real concern.""
Transport and Environment, a Brussels-based campaign group that signed the budget carriers' open letter, again rejected calls to exclude long-haul from biofuel rules.

Any such exemption would have ""no logic"", the group's aviation director Andrew Murphy said.
Green fuel used for the Paris-Montreal flight was produced by Total at its Oudalle plant near Le Havre as well as La Mede, a refinery in southern France converted to biofuels in 2019.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - More Americans are starting to shop in stores again for everything from sports equipment to jewelry, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, Macy's Inc (NYSE:M) M.N> and  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD) said on Tuesday, as Covid-19 restrictions ease and the U.S. economy opens up.
All three retailers topped Wall Street's quarterly sales estimates, propped up by the increased foot traffic and government stimulus checks that fattened shoppers pocketbooks. Visits to Walmart and Home Depot stores in April grew by 21.7% and 23.6% respectively, according to Placer.ai, a data firm that tracks foot traffic.
Brick-and-mortar stores, which had already been falling out of fashion, have struggled with sales in the past year with the pandemic keeping people from leaving their homes. 
The increased level of vaccinations boosted store traffic, an encouraging sign as consumers move toward a post-pandemic lifestyle and start to spend more for in-person activities, travel and events, Macy's Chief Executive Officer Jeff Ganette said on a call to discuss earnings.
Walmart CEO Doug McMillon called out similar trends, saying customers want to get out and shop. The company on Friday became the first major retailer to walk back its mandatory mask rule for shoppers, a move that is likely to encourage more store visits.

After U.S. homebuilding jumped to a nearly 15-year high in March, Home Depot benefited from builders and contractors rushing to stores to get through a backlog of projects put on hold during the pandemic.
""It feels like stimulus is playing a larger role in driving sales, but economic reopening is also an important underlying component,"" retail metrics analyst Ken Perkins said.

(Reuters) -Bank of America plans to raise its minimum wage for U.S. workers to $25 an hour by 2025, the latest among major firms promising to pay employees more after a year of pandemic risks and government subsidies that fueled conversations on whether companies pay their workers enough.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)'s announcement on Tuesday went further than other companies with large U.S. workforces in the retail space. The figure was higher than at competitors, and the second-largest U.S. bank is also requiring its vendors to set a minimum wage of $15 an hour.
That could help spread the influence of higher wages to smaller companies that have lucrative contracts to provide services like marketing, technology services and maintenance. Bank of America deals with more than 2,000 U.S. vendors and 43,000 vendor employees.
Bank of America already pays its U.S. workers at least $20 an hour and is boosting that figure to attract the best and brightest, Sheri Bronstein, its chief human resources officer, said in a statement.
""Our commitment to being a great place to work … means investing in the people who serve our clients,"" she said. 
The news comes as the country is grappling with a fierce debate over worker rights and compensation, especially for those who had to contend with COVID-19 risks during the pandemic.
McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) last week laid out a plan to pay employees 10% more, on average, at company-owned locations. Those 660 stores do not include the many McDonald’s franchises. The company’s move came after a planned worker strike over low wages was reported by media outlets.
Others, including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Corp,  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), have also outlined plans to boost wages.
Their employees, as well as those at grocery stores and health-care centers, kept working through most of the pandemic, facing risk of infection as dozens or hundreds of customers passed through their workplaces every day.
Companies have sometimes been prodded to boost wages by employee complaints that spill into the public sphere. But there are also political pressures and a competitive reality in which one big company outlines a higher pay scale and others follow suit.

The current minimum wage at the federal level is $7.25 per hour, enacted more than a decade ago. President Joe Biden is pushing Congress to pass a $15 minimum wage as part of another pandemic rescue package.
It is not clear whether $25 an hour will seem as hearty in 2025 as it does now, given the trajectory of wages in recent years. Health-care benefits, paid time off and parental leave have also become competitive factors.

(Reuters) -Home Depot Inc on Tuesday cautioned it was difficult to predict how its business would be impacted by a potential change in shopping habits in the coming months as the reopening of the U.S. economy threatens to slow a pandemic-fueled sales boom. 
The lack of a solid forecast from the top U.S. home improvement retailer, which benefited in the last year from a strengthening housing market, came as data showed homebuilding fell more than expected in April, likely pulled down by soaring prices for lumber and other materials.
Supply shortages and surging demand have caused lumber prices to more than triple in the past year, helping buoy sales at  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) but hitting its margins.
The company's same-store sales jumped 31% in the first quarter, while higher lumber prices alone hit gross margins by about 35 basis points.
A fresh round of government stimulus checks in March also added to resilient demand for home improvement products, but analysts have warned that growth will likely slow as the benefits run dry and COVID-19 vaccinations increase. 
""The stimulus will taper off... and once the economy truly opens and people can start spending their money in other areas like concerts or a movie, they're going to redirect their funds,"" said Adam Coons, portfolio manager at Winthrop Capital Management, which holds shares in Home Depot.
Home Depot's overall first-quarter net sales jumped 32.7% to $37.50 billion, beating estimates of $34.96 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
The company said sales in May had started strongly as well, but it did not provide an outlook for the rest of the year.

""With respect to sales, we're not going to extrapolate what we've seen into the future. Obviously, there's a degree of uncertainty on how the consumer is going to respond this year,"" finance chief Richard McPhail said on an analyst call.
Home Depot's shares fell marginally in morning trading.

Investing.com – Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) shares weakened Tuesday following its decision to raise minimum pay to $25 an hour by 2025, up from $20 now.
In addition, the bank said all its U.S. vendors are now required to pay their employees dedicated to the bank, at or above $15 per hour. It said already 99% of the company’s more than 2,000 U.S. vendor firms and 43,000 vendor employees are at or above the $15 per hour rate.
Bank of America is not the first to raise minimum wages. Many employers, including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD), have announced wage increases in the last one month to attract more workers in a tight labor market.
Some have raised wages without increasing the minimum hourly pay.
BoA said since 2010, its minimum hourly wage will have increased by more than 121%. The shares fell 0.4% on Tuesday.

However, in this environment, investors could profit by investing in ETFs that are structured to benefit from inflationary conditions. In this regard, we think iShares TIPS Bond ETF (TIP), Invesco DWA Basic Materials Momentum ETF (PYZ), SPDR Gold Trust (P:GLD (NYSE:GLD)), and Vanguard Real Estate ETF (VNQ) could be solid bets now. Let’s discuss.The stock market has recovered and galloped ahead since a major correction in March 2020. And the U.S. economy has been showing a solid recovery this year, which is evidenced by its 6.4% annual GDP growth in the first quarter of 2021.
Among other favorable economic data, consumer spending is steadily returning to pre-pandemic levels thanks to fiscal stimulus packages and steady job growth. However, this is creating inflationary pressure in the economy. And because investors typically rotate away from stocks to safer, fixed-income assets in an inflationary economy, some experts expect the stock market to be under pressure in the near term.
Notably, the consumer price index (CPI) jumped 4.2% in April 2021 from its year-ago level, its fastest in growth rate 13-years, and increased 0.8% from the prior month. To put things in perspective, consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of domestic economic activity, also climbed 10.7% in the first quarter of 2021, following a mere 2.3% increase in the fourth quarter of last year. And, according to Statista, the annual rate of inflation this year is expected to be 2.26%. Though the Fed views any rise in inflation as temporary, economists fear that rising inflation might force the central bank to tighten its monetary policies earlier than expected.

Tiny activist fund Engine No. 1 has taken aim at Exxon's board and its future direction in the first major shareholder contest to make climate change a top issue. The fund has criticized Exxon for poor financial returns and a lagging approach to the transition to lower-carbon energy.
Glass Lewis recommended votes for former Andeavor Chief Executive Gregory Goff and Alexander Karsner, former U.S. Assistant Secretary of Energy for efficiency and renewable energy.
It is the third proxy advisor to support part or all of Engine No. 1's slate.
""Electing even a portion of Engine 1's slate would send a clear message of shareholder dissatisfaction with Exxon's recent direction and strategy,"" Glass Lewis said in its report. It also said Exxon had underperformed peers and its energy transition plan was ""generally insufficient and lacking in key areas.""
Exxon and Engine No. 1 could not be immediately reached for comment.
Exxon had a historic loss in 2020 but shares are up more than 40% this year.
In addition to backing Goff and Karsner from the activist slate, Glass Lewis recommends votes in favor of eight current Exxon directors including CEO Darren Woods. 
By choosing Engine No. 1's proxy card instead of the company's, Glass Lewis' recommendation leaves out current Exxon directors including former MetLife (NYSE:MET) CEO Steven Kandarian, former  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) CEO Douglas Oberhelman, former  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) CEO Samuel Palmisano and former Petronas CEO Wan Zulkiflee.
The 12 nominees with the most votes will win board seats.

Proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services backed three of the four dissident directors while Pensions & Investment Research Consultants (PIRC) has backed all four Engine No. 1 candidates.
The recommendations are influential for institutional investors. Exxon's shareholders meet on May 26.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The billionaire Italian family that until recently owned Brooks Brothers has been accused in a lawsuit of driving the iconic apparel retailer into bankruptcy instead of selling it, to avoid paying millions of dollars to an investor.
In a complaint on Monday, Hong Kong clothing maker Tal Apparel said Claudio Del Vecchio and his son Matteo pressured it to invest $100 million in Brooks Brothers in 2016, and promised it would be ""made whole"" if they later sold the retailer for less than $652 million.
The complaint said the Del Vecchios lined up ""several"" bids for Brooks Brothers in 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, but did not pursue them because they would owe Tal money, and even asked if Tal would take a ""haircut"" on any payment.
Instead, the family put Brooks Brothers into Chapter 11 last July, making Tal's original investment ""nearly worthless,"" according to the complaint in Manhattan federal court.
The defendants include the Del Vecchios and Delfin SARL, a holding company for family investments including eye wear giant EssilorLuxottica and Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY). Claudio Del Vecchio bought Brooks Brothers in 2001.
A person close to the Del Vecchios said: ""The allegations in the complaint are false and we expect the court will dismiss the case."" Delfin, which owns a small Brooks Brothers stake, declined to comment.
Tal is seeking $100 million of damages, less sums received from Brooks Brothers' bankruptcy estate.
The 70-year-old family-run firm said it makes one in six dress shirts sold in the United States, and Brooks Brothers had been its largest customer.
Forbes magazine said on Tuesday the Del Vecchio family is worth $27.9 billion.
Founded in 1818, Brooks Brothers is the oldest continually operating U.S. apparel brand, known for its suits, preppy clothing, and dressing 40 U.S. presidents including Abraham Lincoln, John F. Kennedy and Barack Obama.

A venture backed by licensing company Authentic Brands Group and mall owner Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) acquired Brooks Brothers in bankruptcy for $325 million.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's executive on Tuesday adopted a plan for a more unified corporate tax regime across the bloc, whose 27 national systems are struggling to cope in a world where cross-border business, often via the Internet, is commonplace.
Under its proposal, certain large companies operating in the EU would have to publish their effective tax rates to ensure greater transparency, and there would be new anti-tax avoidance measures to tackle the abusive use of shell companies.
""It's time to rethink taxation in Europe,"" Paolo Gentiloni, European Commissioner for the economy, said in a statement.
""As our economies transition to a new growth model... so too must our tax systems adapt to the priorities of the 21st century.""
Governments worldwide are desperate to raise extra revenue to rebuild their pandemic-ravaged economies, and corporate taxation has become an obvious target after decades of decline.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is to agree in June on global rules on where to tax large multinational corporations like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and at what effective minimum rate.
The OECD aims to stop governments cutting tax rates competitively to attract investment, and to create a way to tax profits in countries where the customers are, rather than where a company sets up its office for tax purposes.
The European Commission plans to use the OECD deal as a stepping stone to more unified rules for business taxation across the EU.
Its plan would also address the debt-equity bias in current corporate taxation, encouraging companies to finance their activities through equity rather than debt.
EuroCommerce, which represents Europe's retail and wholesale sectors, welcomed the plan, saying different tax regimes are a major cost barrier across the EU's single market.

""The digital transformation of our ecosystem, and of the economy as a whole, needs a tax system which matches it,"" it said in a statement.
The European Commission's latest plan will now go to member states and EU lawmakers for approval. Its plans for EU corporate taxation rules have failed before, as setting tax rates is a jealously guarded prerogative of national parliaments.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fidelity Investments on Tuesday launched a commission-free brokerage account for 13- to 17-year-olds that lets them trade stocks on a mobile app, as well as save and spend using a debit card, in an effort to capture the next generation of investors.
Individuals have flooded into the market since October 2019 when large brokers like Fidelity and  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp dropped their trading commissions, following fast-growing startups like Robinhood and Social Finance Inc (SoFi) that have courted young adult traders. 
Boston-based Fidelity said its Fidelity Youth Account is the first brokerage account designed exclusively for teens.
""Importantly, our goal for the Fidelity Youth Account is to encourage young Americans to learn through action and foster meaningful family conversations around financial topics,"" said Jennifer Samalis, Fidelity's senior vice president of acquisition and loyalty.
The youth accounts are available to teens whose parents or guardians - who can monitor the accounts - are Fidelity customers. 
Teens can access Fidelity's educational tools, and can buy and sell domestic stocks, including through fractional shares, which lets them buy slices of stocks for as little as $1, as well as most exchange-traded funds, and Fidelity mutual funds, through the accounts. 
When the investor turns 18, the account transitions to a standard brokerage account that comes with more choice and flexibility, Fidelity said.
The new youth accounts were tested by children of Fidelity employees who volunteered them for a pilot program starting in mid-2020, with 759 accounts opened by the end April.
Fidelity said earlier this month that investors opened 4.1 million new brokerage accounts in the first quarter, up 156.3% compared with the same period last year. Around 1.6 million of those new accounts were opened by people 35-years-old or younger, an increase of 222.8% versus the first quarter of 2020, it said.

""Because of the great significance of transatlantic air travel for the global economy, we now need a clear perspective on how travel between the USA and Europe can return on a larger scale,"" executive board member Harry Hohmeister said.

Lake, the CEO of the bank's consumer lending arm, and Piepszak, the chief financial officer, will replace Gordon Smith, who is also the chief operating officer of the bank.
Smith had recently informed Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon of his decision to retire at the end of this year, the bank said.
Lake has long been viewed as a potential successor to Dimon. Lake held the job of CFO from 2012 to mid-2019 when she was named the head of consumer lending. Piepszak was heading card services at the time and was named to replace Lake as CFO.
The consumer and community banking unit accounts for roughly 40% of the bank's total revenue, making both appointments an important stepping stone for Piepszak and Lake.
During the many years that Dimon has run the bank, he has made it a practice to move top executives into different roles to give them more experience across the banking franchise. https://reut.rs/3fvlUb4
Dimon has made something of a joke of perpetually saying he will resign in five years. In 2019, he said the five-year clock had actually begun.
Daniel Pinto, co-president and chief operating officer of the bank and CEO of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s corporate and investment bank, will become the sole president and chief operating officer of the firm when Smith leaves.
Smith and Pinto ran daily operations at the bank when Dimon was away for heart surgery last year. 

Jeremy Barnum, head of global research for the corporate and investment bank unit, will succeed Piepszak as finance chief, effective immediately, the bank said.

MADRID (Reuters) - Siemens Energy said on Tuesday it has no current plans to buy the one third of wind turbine maker Siemens Gamesa it does not already own, denying a Spanish newspaper report it had engaged banks to help it make such a move.
Spain's stock market regulator suspended trading in Siemens Gamesa's shares after Expansion newspaper said Siemens AG (OTC:SIEGY) had hired  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) to review options for the Spain-based business, including a possible takeover and withdrawal from the market.
Expansion said Siemens AG had hired the bank through Siemens Energy, which owns 67% of Siemens Gamesa. The conglomerate holds 35% of Siemens Energy directly, and another 10% via its pension fund.
The paper said Siemens had also hired  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) to give an independent valuation.
Hours after the shares were suspended, Siemens Energy wrote in a letter to the Spanish regulator that it regularly reviewed its entire portfolio and that this included its stake in Siemens Gamesa.
""While we can of course not exclude any scenario in the future, we can confirm that SIEAG (Siemens Energy) is currently not working on a takeover bid in relation to SGRE (Siemens Gamesa),"" the letter said, adding none of the mentioned banks had been mandated.
At current market valuations, the 33% share in Siemens Gamesa that Siemens Energy does not already own is worth around 5.7 billion euros ($6.96 billion).
Analysts at Citi, in a note triggered by the newspaper report, said they would prefer Siemens Energy to cut its stake to just above 50% to free up cash for growth, including in hydrogen.
Shares in Siemens Energy retreated after gaining as much as 4% on the news, while Siemens Gamesa's stock rose more than 3.5% after the suspension was lifted.
Siemens Energy Chief Executive Christian Bruch said earlier this month it was too early to talk about buying out the rest of Siemens Gamesa, but that this would become an issue at some point.

Siemens Gamesa was formed in 2017 through a merger of Spain's Gamesa and what was then the wind business of Siemens.

Production is on track to start in the fourth quarter of next year, Fisker reiterated on Tuesday, and it will show the final production version in November at the Los Angeles auto show.

The carmaker also said it would begin deliveries of right-hand drive Ocean to the UK market within the first half of 2023. 
The deal comes days after Fisker said it had finalized its vehicle-assembly agreement with Foxconn Technology Co Ltd, including plans to open a U.S. plant in 2023.

(Reuters) -U.S. department chain Macy's Inc (NYSE:M) on Tuesday raised its annual sales and profit forecasts, as speedy vaccinations encourage Americans to return to its stores to upgrade their wardrobes after being stuck at home for more than a year. 
The New York-based retailer's shares gained about 2% after a surprise first-quarter profit and comparable sales that beat Wall Street estimates.
""As the weather warms up and vaccines are more readily available, customers are feeling increasingly confident to get dressed up and venture outside. They're also starting to attend events again,"" Chief Executive Officer Jeff Gennette told analysts. 
Consumers, flush with cash from additional stimulus, are also splurging on expensive fragrances, shoes, fine jewelry and dresses, Macy's said, as pajamas and t-shirts give way to more formal wear. 
With more Americans readying to travel as restrictions also ease, summer travel essentials including sandals, swimsuits and luggage are also in demand.
Macy's forecast adjusted earnings per share between $1.71 and $2.12 for 2021, compared with its earlier outlook of 40 cents to 90 cents.
It expects sales between $21.73 billion and $22.23 billion, much higher than the $19.75 billion to $20.75 billion it forecast earlier. 
""We don't see this as a short-term pop. There are pent-up demand opportunities,"" Gennette said. 
The owner of Bloomingdale's and beauty store chain Bluemercury, however, was cautious on tourist spending.
International tourism, which historically has made up for 4% of Macy's and Bloomingdale's business, is not expected to improve until next year, Gennette said. 

""(Macy's) has improved in very difficult times. In many ways Macy's is in much better shape than pre-pandemic times,"" said Craig Johnson, president at retail consultancy Customer Growth Partners.
The company earned 39 cents per share on an adjusted basis, compared with expectations of a 41-cent loss, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

TORONTO (Reuters) -Toronto-Dominion Bank agreed to pay $41.5 million (C$49.93 million) to settle a U.S. class action lawsuit for charging excess insufficient funds fees on customer accounts, court documents showed. 
The settlement includes $20.75 million in cash and an equal amount in debt forgiveness. TD, Canada's second largest lender with large operations in the United States, also agreed to pay $500,000 in expenses, the papers showed. The settlement requires a judge’s approval.
The lawsuit was brought against TD in November 2018 by customers who were charged fees for insufficient funds multiple times when merchants repeated attempts to process the same transaction.
A TD spokeswoman declined to comment. 
TD shares were flat at C$88.35 in morning trading in Toronto, compared with a 0.2% decline in the Toronto stock benchmark. 
The agreement proposes TD will make the cash payment into the settlement fund within 14 days of preliminary approval, and forgiveness of uncollected fees will be automatic 90 days after the effective date of the settlement. 
On May 14, court documents showed Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) agreed to pay $75 million to settle a similar lawsuit.

Separately, TD is awaiting judgment in a trial in an Ontario court in which the liquidators of the collapsed Antigua bank of former Texas financier Robert Allen Stanford are seeking $4.5 billion in damages.

While upgrading MGM to overweight with a $47 target, analyst Joseph Greff said the traffic at its Las Vegas casinos is improving, which will help revenue and margin improvement. He said this could drive estimates higher.
The latest target is 16% higher from the stock’s current price of $40.50. Greff’s previous neutral rating for the stock came with a target of $45.

The two companies have signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding to form Mobile Drive, a 50-50 joint venture based in the Netherlands focused on infotainment, telematics and cloud service platform development. 
Stellantis Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said the partnership with Foxconn was one of the bricks in the group's business plan, which is expected between the end of this year and the beginning of 2022
""It is a 'must' of our future strategic direction,"" he said. 
The partnership however appears less extensive than the market had expected, after Fiat Chrysler, now part of Stellantis, said last year it was planning to set up a joint venture with Hon Hai Precision Industry, Foxconn's parent company, to build electric cars and develop internet-connected vehicles in China.
The deal also leaves open questions on how Stellantis plans to pursue one of its main goals, a relaunch in Asia, where it currently makes less than 3% of its revenues. 
Stellantis Chief Software Officer Yves Bonnefont said the decision to enter a joint venture with Foxconn was mainly driven by the need to move fast and to access the best expertise available. 
No financial details of the tie-up were disclosed.
Mobile Drive will operate as an automotive supplier, aiming to provide software systems and related hardware both to Stellantis and other interested automakers, the companies said in a joint statement.

187,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 18, 2021 09:45AM ET</span>",Bank Lobbyists Blast Lawmakers’ Plans for ‘Unbanked’ Americans,"(Bloomberg) -- The biggest U.S. banks criticized a pair of proposals designed to help consumers who don’t use their services.
Lawmakers’ recent proposals, such as opening bank branches in post offices or offering Federal Reserve checking accounts to every U.S. consumer, may not work to resolve the problem of the so-called unbanked Americans, industry trade groups argued in a paper published Tuesday.
Instead, they urged officials to consider creating new types of identification that consumers can show to access financial services, or encouraging Americans to open low-cost bank accounts when they’re enrolling to receive government assistance.
“Instead of establishing a large, duplicative and potentially expensive banking infrastructure to create bank accounts through the Federal Reserve or the U.S. Postal Service (postal banking), there are more effective and less costly ways to address the unbanked/underbanked challenge,” the trade groups said in a statement accompanying the paper.
The groups represent U.S. banks and credit unions and include the Clearing House, the American Bankers Association, the Consumer Bankers Association, the Credit Union National Association, the Mid-Sized Bank Coalition of America and the National Bankers Association.
Racial Gap
For years, lenders have offered low-fee checking accounts as part of an industrywide initiative known as Bank On. But those efforts haven’t been a total success: Consumers still spend billions each year in overdraft and other account fees, and 7.1 million households across the country continue to lack access to a bank account.
While that number has declined in recent years, the proportion of unbanked Black and Hispanic households remains higher than the national average. As protests over racial inequality engulfed the U.S. last year, policy makers and banks alike vowed to do more to ensure communities of color could access low-cost financial services as a way to close the persistent racial wealth gap.
“Obviously it’s important because of the spotlight last year on all of the horrific events that our country endured,” Alice Rodriguez, managing director and head of JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).’s community-impact organization, said in an interview. “Several years ago we absolutely saw the need to lean in more, particularly from a financial-health perspective, and that led us down this path of the unbanked and the underbanked.”
Without access to traditional financial services, consumers often turn to non-bank competitors, which typically charge higher rates or bigger fees. Check-cashing companies, for instance, can take as much of 10% of a check’s value for their services. Relying on prepaid debit cards can cost consumers as much as $300 a year.
Hearings Planned
The paper comes just days before members of the Senate Banking Committee and House Financial Services Committee plan to question the chief executives of the largest U.S. banks, including JPMorgan and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., in a pair of virtual hearings.
President Joe Biden and Democratic lawmakers including Representative Maxine Waters (NYSE:WAT) and Senator Bernie Sanders have been advocating for the U.S. Postal Service to begin offering banking and for the Fed to provide checking accounts to consumers. They say those solutions would create a widely available, lower-cost way for Americans to access financial services.
In Tuesday’s paper, banking trade groups argued such proposals don’t account for the costs that would be tied to the government operating “what would be the largest retail-banking operation in the United States.” They also said a consumer’s proximity to a bank branch or post office location has historically been unrelated to their banking status.
“The importance of physical access to financial-inclusion status may be a less important factor than is often portrayed, or may be important for certain alternative financial products and services, such as check cashing, but not for banking status and credit,” the groups said in the paper.
Instead, they argued, many consumers find it costly to obtain a driver’s license or passport -- documentation often needed to open a bank account. The trade groups urged policy makers to study some of the underlying households that remain unbanked.
“The best way to determine how to make further progress is really to look at the reasons why individuals are underbanked or unbanked to examine what actually has been working to drive down those rates,” Rob Hunter, deputy general counsel of the Clearing House, said in an interview. That analysis should also examine “what further work needs to be done that the private sector can’t do.”

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Tuesday, as extremely strong earnings from retailers revived fears about inflation and a possible early tightening of monetary policy, undermining overnight gains in futures contracts.
Both Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) blew past expectations with their quarterly reports, apparently more than able to pass on higher input costs to consumers flush with cash after the latest round of stimulus checks.
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 36 points, ior 0.1%, at 34,364 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.4%. All three major indices had opened the week with losses on Monday. 
The mood was also hit by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen refreshing the theme of higher corporate taxes in a speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Yellen told the Chamber that U.S. corporate taxes are 'at a historic low'. 
However, it was the retail earnings that most caught the eye. Walmart stock rose 3.5% after the company reported a 6% rise in same-store sales excluding fuel in the three months through April. CEO Doug McMillon said he was now more optimistic than at the start of the year, anticipating pent-up demand to keep sales buoyant all year. 
Home Depot stock meanwhile fell 0.1%, despite signs that customers not been put off buying lumber (around 10% of its sales) despite the sharp rise in prices for it this year. Sales rose 33% from a year earlier.
Analysts expect the last quarter to represent something of a high-water mark for the home improvement sector, as the reopening of the economy drains money away from merchandise goods and into services and experiences. There was some corroboration of that in April's housing starts numbers, which fell nearly 10% from March. Building permits in April rose modestly, but fell short of expectations. Home Depot itself didn't feel able to give guidance for the full year.
Elsewhere, AT&T (NYSE:T) stock fell another 7% as analysts concluded that its deal to retreat from media and place its assets in a joint venture with Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) would make it harder to sustain its generous-looking dividend in the future. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock rose 0.3%, shrugging off news that Michael Burry, famed for his bet against mortgage-backed securities before the 2008 crash, had taken a fresh short position in the electric carmaker."

LONDON (Reuters) -British retailer Marks & Spencer (OTC:MAKSY) has promoted strategy chief Katie Bickerstaffe and food boss Stuart Machin in a major shake-up of its management team's responsibilities, making them the internal frontrunners to succeed Steve Rowe as chief executive.
Marks & Spencer (M&S) said the changes were to help the clothing and food group shift from the ""fixing the basics"" phase of its latest turnaround plan to a phase that will see it move on from the COVID-19 crisis, reinvest and restore growth.
M&S said Bickerstaffe and Machin will become joint chief operating officers, reporting to Rowe who has been CEO since 2016.
Machin, whom media reports had linked with the CEO's job at supermarket Asda, will continue as managing director of food but also oversee operations, property, store development and IT.
Bickerstaffe will oversee the data, services, clothing and home and international businesses.
If Bickerstaffe does eventually take over from Rowe she would become M&S's first female boss in the group's 137-year history.
M&S said finance chief Eoin Tonge will also take on strategy and transformation planning, while Sacha Berendji, currently retail, operations and property director, will move to focus on the future of the retailer's store estate.
Richard Price and Paul Friston will remain as managing directors of clothing and home and international respectively.
""Stuart and Katie will bring even more impetus to our core businesses,"" said Rowe.
""With that I will, with Eoin’s support, be better able to concentrate on building the M&S of the future and our path to growth.”
After decades of failed turnaround attempts, Rowe and chairman Archie Norman have attempted to transform M&S's culture, closed stores, increased the use of technology and improved product and value to broaden the retailer's appeal.
But M&S was still struggling to reinvent itself before the pandemic hit.
A year ago it said the crisis would indelibly change its business and it would speed-up its latest plan, delivering three years of change in one.

In August, M&S cut 7,000 jobs and in November it reported the first loss in its 94 years as a publicly listed company.
Full year 2020-21 results will be published on May 26.

(Reuters) -Britain's FirstGroup recommended that shareholders back the $4.6 billion sale of its two North American bus businesses to Swedish private equity firm EQT (NYSE:EQT) Infrastructure, after the company's top investor urged against it.
Coast Capital, which holds nearly 14% of the transport operator, late on Monday urged fellow shareholders to vote against the proposed disposal of the ""crown jewel assets"", unless the terms of the proposal were ""rapidly and substantively improved"".
FirstGroup said the sale ""followed a comprehensive and competitive process in order to seek the best possible price for First Student and First Transit, which was well publicised for more than a year"".
Analysts at RBC Capital Markets believe the sale price is above its valuation of FirstGroup's North American assets.
Activist investor Coast Capital, however, criticised the portion of proceeds that shareholders stand to receive from the deal. 
FirstGroup last month agreed the sale of the assets and said it planned to use the proceeds to pay down debt, contribute to its UK pension schemes and return money to shareholders.
It said on Tuesday it will consider making additional distributions to continuing shareholders on top of the 365 million pounds ($518 million) it earmarked last month.
Shares of the FTSE 250 company, which will hold a general meeting on May 27 to vote on the proposed divestment, were up 3.2% by 1236 GMT.
FirstGroup, which had net debt of nearly 3 billion pounds at the end of September, said it was committed to keeping the balance sheet position of the retained group under review.
FirstGroup will focus on its First Bus and four train contracts in Britain after the deal as well as on finding a buyer for its Greyhound intercity coach service.
Coast Capital in 2019 pushed for a review of the company's U.S. assets and sought a demerger of the group's North American businesses in 2020.

MADRID (Reuters) - Hotel bookings in Spain have boomed since a national state of emergency and ban on leisure travel expired last week, unleashing pent-up local demand and fuelling optimism within the COVID-battered sector despite a shortage of foreign visitors. 
Reservations reached over 70% of pre-pandemic levels in the days after the emergency decree ended, according to hospitality data provider SiteMinder. Global hotel bookings, by contrast, are at around half 2019's levels. 
""We continue to have positive expectations, although we must exercise some caution,"" said Sara Padrosa, SiteMinder's country director for Spain. ""We aren't going to find ourselves in the same situation as two years ago from one day to the next.""
Driving the upswing is a surge in last-minute bookings from Spaniards, who had been banned from travelling outside their home regions since October.
But with most reservations allowing flexible cancellation and generous refunds, hoteliers cannot yet breathe a sigh of relief, Padrosa said. 
""What we need is for (guests) to follow through on all these bookings ... Until they arrive at the hotel we can't be 100% sure,"" she told Reuters.
Ramon Estalella, secretary general of Spain's CEHAT hotels federation, welcomed the return of local tourism but stressed that a full recovery would depend on the return, en masse, of international travellers. 
""Let's not kid ourselves - the domestic market only covers 30% of Spanish tourist beds,"" he said. 
Underscoring the importance of visitors from abroad, booking platform eDreams, said it expected domestic tourists to spend around 150 euros per person on travel this summer, down 46% from 2019. 
Spain is rushing to define rules for safe travel, hoping to entice foreign visitors and salvage some of the crucial summer season after international arrivals crashed 80% last year.
The government expects a rebound to just over half 2019's levels this summer, but Estalella said some regions could see a recovery of up to 70% by September if a European vaccination passport scheme is rolled out on time.
Mallorca-based hotel chain Melia said bookings from German tourists over the past two weeks had surpassed 2019's levels, with demand concentrated on the Balearic and Canary Islands, which Berlin considers safe destinations.
""The big gap and the big unknown is the British market, which is the most important for Spain overall,"" Communications Director Maria Umbert said. 
Britain allowed international travel to resume on Monday, but Spain is not on its so-called ""green list"", meaning returnees must isolate on arrival. 

Madrid is lobbying the UK government to re-classify individual regions like the Balearic Islands and Valencia, which have a lower infection rate than Britain, as safe holiday spots. 
After London allowed travel to Portugal, hotels there were inundated with enquiries from Britons.

Like other carmakers in India, Tata Motors was navigating the pandemic's impact on sales when a global chip shortfall piled on more pressure, forcing it to suspend operations at two JLR car factories in April.
The disruptions have become more difficult to mitigate and are now impacting production plans for the first quarter, Tata Motors said https://archives.nseindia.com/corporate/NSEBSELETTERFINAL_18052021164736.pdf on Tuesday. 
The COVID-19 crisis has driven a shift to remote work and learning, boosting demand for laptops and other gadgets that use semiconductors. The resulting shortage has forced automakers including General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) to flag production cuts.
Tata Motors incurred a charge of 149.94 billion rupees ($2.05 billion) related to asset write-downs and restructuring costs at JLR. 
Still, the JLR unit's sales in China jumped 127% from a year ago. Overall retail sales, which accounts for most of Tata Motors' revenue, was up 12.4% from a year ago.
For the quarter ended March 31, Tata Motors reported a consolidated net loss of 76.05 billion rupees ($1.04 billion), compared with a loss of 98.94 billion rupees a year earlier.
Analysts were expecting the carmaker to log a profit of 26.72 billion rupees, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Quarterly revenue rose 41.7% to 877.72 billion rupees.

197,By Reuters,"<span>May 18, 2021 08:35AM ET</span>",Shell shareholders increase pressure for further climate action,"By Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) shareholders overwhelmingly backed the company's energy transition strategy on Tuesday, but increased support for a second climate resolution filed by an activist group pointed to growing pressure to tackle climate change.
A non-binding resolution submitted by Shell with the support of a large group of investors to vote on its recently unveiled climate strategy won 88.74% shareholder support at its annual general meeting (AGM) which was held online.
The plan, announced in February, aims to reduce planet-warming carbon emissions to net zero by 2050 by slowly reducing oil and gas output, growing its renewables and low-carbon business and offsetting emissions through carbon capturing technologies and measures such as forestation. nL1N2KH0LV]
Shell CEO Ben Van Beurden said at the AGM that the strategy, which will be updated every three years, was ""comprehensive... rigorous and... ambitious.""
The vote comes on the same day the International Energy Agency (IEA) said investors should halt funding for new oil, gas and coal supply projects if the world wants to reach net zero emissions by 2050.
Shell plans to grow its investment in low-carbon in the coming years, but at least 75% of its spending will continue to go towards oil and gas. (Graphic: Shell's energy transition spending, https://graphics.reuters.com/SHELL-SPENDING/yxmvjwbnepr/chart.png) 
ABSOLUTE REDUCTION
A second resolution filed by activist group Follow This urging the Anglo-Dutch company to set ""inspirational"" targets to battle greenhouse gas emissions, was rejected by 69.53% of the votes, according to a tally of most votes.
Still, the nearly one-third of votes supporting the resolution, which Shell's board urged shareholders to reject, is a sharp increase from last year's vote where a similar resolution won 14.4% support.
Several investors, proxy advisories and activist groups including Follow This have criticised Shell for setting intensity-based carbon reduction targets, which allow Shell in theory to grow its emissions, rather than absolute reduction targets.
Shell CEO Ben van Beurden however said setting absolute reduction targets would mean Shell will have to unwind its oil and gas business, which would be replaced by other producers. 
Follow This director Mark van Baal told Reuters the vote ""tells the board that investors don't accept long-term targets without short and medium-term targets. You need to decrease emissions dramatically and shift investments dramatically in the next decade.""
In a statement following the vote, the Church of England Pension Board, which led the investor talks with Shell on its strategy, welcomed the support for the plan and also urged Shell to set short and medium-term targets to reduce emissions in absolute terms.

Adam Matthews, Director of Ethics & Engagement for the Church of England Pensions Board said at the AGM that if Shell doesn't meet its 2023 targets the fund would divest its stake in Shell.
Last week, BP (NYSE:BP) investors rejected a Follow This resolution demanding tougher emission reduction targets, which nevertheless was supported by 20.6% of votes, pointing to growing investor pressure.

Investing.com – The  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) shares were up more than 2% in Tuesday’s market on upbeat earnings that were driven by consumer spending coming out of a year hit by the pandemic.
Home Depot’s business benefitted from being termed ‘essential’ as people took time at home to improve their surroundings and feel better.
The home improvement retailer reported sales of $37.5 billion for the first quarter, 33% higher from the same period a year ago. Comparable sales, as well as comparable sales in the U.S., rose 30%-31%.
The retailer reported diluted net earnings of $3.86 per share, up nearly 86% from $2.08 a year earlier. A survey of analysts by Refinitiv expected this to come at $3.08.

As Wall Street sours on speculative tech bets, ETF assets tracking electric and battery-focused cars are set to drop this month for the first time since March 2020, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Prices of exchange-traded funds in the sector have largely stalled in recent weeks, and traders have pulled $34 million from them in May. That could make this the first month of outflows since April last year and compares with record inflows of $1.4 billion in January.
“As these industries evolve, you go through these ebbs and flows in investor sentiment,” said Tom Hainlin, national investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. “It’s not surprising to see the level of volatility in those areas that are still fairly new.”
Enthusiasm for everything in the green sector soared earlier this year, buoyed by optimism that President Joe Biden would unleash a wave of clean-energy policies alongside a Democratically controlled Congress.
That brought billions of dollars into electric-vehicle stocks, prompting Arnott at Research Affiliates to warn that investors were getting ahead of themselves. The combined value of eight manufacturers had soared to $1 trillion, he pointed out, despite the likelihood that not all of them would succeed.

But now investors are reassessing their most speculative bets as an economic recovery from the pandemic gathers steam. The prospect of rising inflation in particular is making them rethink pricey investments based on hoped-for future earnings.
“We are seeing it deflate,” said Phil Toews, chief executive officer of asset manager Toews Corp., of the EV sector. “Valuations had moved into completely unrealistic levels, it was clearly ready to burst.”
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc., the most famous electric-vehicle maker, is down more than 33% from its January peak. CEO Elon Musk’s unpredictable commentary on areas of the market like Bitcoin and fatal incidents involving its cars have added to the wider valuation worries.
The KraneShares Electric Vehicles and Future Mobility Index ETF (NYSE:KARS)) and the Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF (NASDAQ:DRIV) have dropped about 17% and 7% from their February highs, respectively. During the same period, the S&P 500 gained about 6%.
Alongside stock declines it all means that total assets in the category have dropped to $4.8 billion from $5.1 billion in at the end of April.
Still, many investors have stayed loyal to their bets.
The flood of cash funneled into the funds earlier this year may have slowed to a trickle, but huge outflows haven’t materialized yet either. DRIV has lost only $1.8 million in May, while KARS hasn’t seen inflows or outflows.
“If an investor has a 10- to 15-year time horizon, electric vehicles are the place to be,” said Wayne Wicker, chief investment officer at Vantagepoint Investment Advisers. “If an investor has a two-year time horizon, I think valuations at the beginning of the year really made it a lot harder to justify going all in.”

LONDON (Reuters) - The City of London's 'Golden Age' as Europe's financial capital is over following Brexit, but it will remain a major and profitable centre, NatWest bank chairman Howard Davies said on Tuesday.
The City has been largely cut off from the EU since Britain's full departure on Dec. 31, 2020, with bankers and City officials not expecting any direct access to the bloc anytime soon.
""Almost five years after the Brexit referendum, and five months after Britain's exit from the European Union, the future of London as a global financial center seems secure,"" Davies said in a column for Project Syndicate on Tuesday.
""But although the City will remain Europe’s largest financial marketplace, its Golden Age as Europe’s financial capital is over,"" said Davies, a former Deputy Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the UK Financial Services Authority.
The debate about the future of the City so far has remained a ""dialogue of the deaf"" as backers of Brexit say the hit would be minimal, while opponents of leaving the EU forecast ""gloom and doom"", said Davies.
COVID-19 has confused the picture, making it harder for staff to relocate from London to the EU, he said.
Trading in euro shares and swaps shifted from London to the continent, but it will take time for any putative rival in the EU to develop a plausible matching offer, Davies said.
Bankers want Britain to focus on making the City more attractive for global investors and Brussels is scrutinising Britain to see how far it will go in diverging from EU rules.
David Frost, the UK minister in charge with ties with the EU, said on Monday it was important for Britain to use its freedom from the bloc to de-regulate in the most productive way possible.
""We are looking at financial services regulations and seeing what we can do now we are able to move on from EU arrangements in financial services,"" Frost told lawmakers. He is setting up a new unit to start a ""journey that will bring huge benefits"".

NatWest, formerly Royal Bank of Scotland (NYSE:RBS_old_old), has slashed back its overseas operations since its balance sheet ballooned to bigger than the size of the UK economy before requiring a government bailout in 2008 during the financial crisis.
But its minnow investment bank NatWest Markets retains a presence in the eurozone in Amsterdam, which the bank bulked up ahead of Brexit.

MILAN (Reuters) -Generali beat first-quarter profit forecasts driven by its non-life and asset management businesses, as Italy's top insurer scouts for opportunities for further growth.
Generali (MI:GASI) has spent 1.8 billion euros ($2.2 billion) on targeted acquisition since 2019 and still has around 2.3 billion for merger and acquisitions.
""We continue to assess M&A opportunities with a disciplined approach as a way to diversify our sources of cash-flow,"" head of finance Cristiano Borean told a news briefing on Tuesday. 
Borean said other options, including a share buyback, would be considered if M&A opportunities did not arise.
Despite robust earnings, CEO Philip Donnet has come under fire over the past year by some leading Italian investors who want the company to bulk up to better compete with larger European rivals.
Boardroom discussions over governance are expected to intensify as Generali prepares to appoint a new board in 2022.
Generali said in November it aimed to become a top player in asset management, where operating profits rose by 46% in the three months through March to 136 million euros.
Generali said it would continue to identify investment opportunities through the expansion of its ""multi-boutique platform"". 
It reported a quarterly operating profit of 1.6 billion euros, up 11% from a year ago and above a company-provided analyst consensus of 1.5 billion.
Net profit also came in above analysts' consensus at 802 million euros. 
It also confirmed all targets of its strategic plan including an EPS compound growth rate of 6-8% between 2018-2021.
The life segment proved resilient despite the current low interest rates environment thanks to the ongoing rebalancing towards unit-linked and protection lines, the company said.
""The growth in unit-linked (products) continues to surprise us positively and the high growth in asset management revenues is driving operating leverage,"" analysts at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) wrote in a note.
Generali shares were up 1% as of 1100 GMT, outperforming the European insurance sector. 

Generali's solvency ratio stood above 230% as of Friday despite the recent widening of the spread between Italian and German 10-year government bonds, Borean said.

Investing.com – Walmart (NYSE:WMT) shares were trading more than 3% higher in Tuesday’s premarket as the company, encouraged by growth in March quarter earnings, raised its guidance for the year.
Walmart President and CEO Doug McMillon said the company expects the company to profit from pent-up demand through 2021. He said optimism is now higher than it was at the beginning of the year, an outcome of increasing vaccinations and the stimulus that has kept people spending.
The management’s commentary was upbeat following growth in all the business segments the company operates. To make it even better, it gained market share in the super-competitive groceries segment.
The company now expects its annual EPS to increase in high single digits as opposed to a slight decline it forecast earlier. It hopes to increase its consolidated operating income in mid single-digit in constant currency terms. This was expected to decline slightly as per its previous estimates.
The outlook is built on a conservative basis that there will be no significant additional government stimulus packages for the remainder of the year.
Total revenue in the March quarter was $138.3 billion, a 2.7% increase from the same quarter last year. Operating income was up by as much as 32% to $6.9 billion.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - BioNTech, the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) partner that invented the Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine, has appointed former Morphosys executive Jens Holstein as chief financial officer to help it grow into a global immunotherapy company. 
Sierk Poetting, who is finance chief and chief operating officer, will focus on the latter role when Holstein joins in July, to further expand BioNTech's global vaccine production network, it said in a statement on Tuesday.
BioNTech in December became the first Western company to win preliminary approval for its vaccine to prevent the life threatening disease caused by the novel coronavirus. 
Holstein will oversee a massive inflow of cash that will potentially fuel the ambitions of BioNTech's co-founder and Chief Executive Ugur Sahin to develop precision immunotherapies against various forms of cancer and other diseases.
Vaccine supply deals lined up for this year alone are worth 12.4 billion euros ($15.1 billion) in revenue for BioNTech, with more contracts on the cards.
Holstein quit as Morphosys CFO in December to pursue new challenges after almost 10 years there. During his tenure, Morphosys added a Nasdaq flotation to its listing in Germany and won approval for its first product, Tremfya against psoriasis.

Previously, Holstein served in various finance and management positions at diversified healthcare group Fresenius SE (DE:FREG).

The Combivacs study, run by Spain's state-backed Carlos III Health Institute, found the presence of IgG antibodies in the bloodstream was between 30 and 40 times higher in people who got the follow-up Pfizer shot than in a control group who only received one AstraZeneca dose.
Meanwhile, the presence of neutralising antibodies rose sevenfold after a Pfizer dose, significantly more than the doubling effect observed after a second AstraZeneca shot.
Around 670 volunteers between the ages of 18-59 who had already received a first dose of AstraZeneca's vaccine participated in the study, with some 450 given a Pfizer dose. 
Just 1.7% of the participants reported severe side effects, which were limited to headaches, muscle pain and general malaise, said Dr Magdalena Campins, one of the study's leaders.
""These are not symptoms that can be considered serious,"" she said.
In a U.K. ""mix-and-match"" study, first findings recently showed that people vaccinated with a shot of Pfizer's vaccine followed by a dose of AstraZeneca's, or vice versa, were more likely to report mild or moderate symptoms such as headaches or chills than if they received two of the same type. Data on immune responses are expected in the coming months. 
Spain embarked on the study to determine how best to proceed after limiting AstraZeneca's shot to people aged over 60 due to concerns about blood clotting in younger people.

That restriction caused widespread uncertainty and meant some younger people who had already received a first dose have been excluded from getting a second.
""Today's results support the possibility of vaccinating patients who have received the first dose from AstraZeneca, but the decision is not up to the investigators of this study,"" said Jesus Antonio Frias, clinical director at Carlos III.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Tuesday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite leading the way, helped by renewed confidence in the Federal Reserve retaining its ultra-easy monetary policy, while strong earnings from the retail sector again testify to the strength of consumer demand.
Large-cap retailers Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) reported blowout first quarters, helped by the last round of stimulus checks that put more money in consumers' pockets, while Macy’s (NYSE:M) raised its forecast for annual sales and earnings, betting on pent-up demand as shoppers return to its stores.

Growth-heavy tech stocks have been under pressure in recent sessions as investors fret over whether a surge in inflation will prompt the U.S. central bank to tighten monetary policy in near future.
However, Fed officials have been at pains of late to point out they see the surge in consumer prices as temporary. This commentary continued Monday, as Dallas Federal Reserve President Robert Kaplan said he doesn’t expect interest rates to rise until next year, while Federal Reserve Vice Chair Richard Clarida pointed to the recent disappointing jobs report as evidence monetary help was still required. 
U.S. economic data Tuesday will center around the housing market, with April building permits and housing starts due. Overseas, the Eurozone economy shrunk by 0.6% in the first quarter of 2021, confirming a technical recession, while Japan’s recovery stalled last quarter, with gross domestic product shrinking an annualized 5.1% in the quarter. 
Oil prices pushed higher Tuesday, with the Brent contract hitting $70 a barrel for the first time since March, as the major oil-consuming economies of the U.S. and Europe further reopen on the back of successful vaccination programs.
U.S. deaths from Covid-19 last week fell to their lowest in nearly 14 months and the number of new cases continued to decline for a fifth week in a row, prompting New York to lift the mask requirement for vaccinated people. 
In Europe, the U.K. further relaxed restrictions and both Portugal and the Netherlands have opened up travel.

212,By Reuters,"<span>May 18, 2021 06:21AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Airbus turns up heat on suppliers over production and quality,"By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus has ordered suppliers to demonstrate as soon as possible that they are factory-fit for increased single-aisle jet output, in a letter that lays bare the extent of recent industrial quality problems.
In the letter to suppliers in late March, seen by Reuters, Chief Procurement Officer Juergen Westermeier gave no specific targets but called for ""immediate actions"" to prepare for higher output, in the latest evidence of a recovery for mid-range jets.
Airbus declined to comment on contacts with suppliers.
The straight-shooting letter from Airbus highlights a slim margin for error as the world's largest planemaker reboots an industrial ecosystem weakened by a global travel slump.
Reuters reported last week Airbus had told suppliers to be ready for output of 53 A320neo-family jets a month by the end of 2022, up from current monthly output of 40 and a target of 45 by end-2021.
Airbus has declined to comment on any preliminary goals beyond 2021. But underscoring advanced planning for higher output, Airbus urged suppliers in the letter to ""demonstrate rate and capability readiness as early as possible.""
Required actions include ensuring parts are ordered from suppliers' own sub-contractors on time. Suppliers must also implement ""proper buffers"" or inventory to anticipate future output increases.
Industry sources say the last point may trigger fraught negotiations as some suppliers - squeezed by the industry's worst ever crisis - are reluctant to spend cash without payment guarantees from planemakers, fearing new coronavirus setbacks.
Medium-haul jets like the A320neo are expected to lead the recovery as regional travel reopens in China, the United States and increasingly Europe, overshadowed by India's health crisis.
'TOO MANY ISSUES'
Airbus also set out a tough line on quality-control problems seen disrupting its factories or affecting airline operations. 
In 2020, Airbus experienced 370 quality problems from suppliers, equivalent to 1.6 per day, of which half had some impact on aircraft, the letter said.
""We are still facing too many issues ... We count on you to secure with rigour and discipline a much better containment and prevention plan,"" it said, adding: ""Our first priority is to raise the bar on quality.""
Airbus has given suppliers ""72 hours max"" to contain any new quality defects once they have been discovered. There is no suggestion that such snags have compromised airline safety, but analysts say they can cause costly production delays.
U.S. rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) is also wrestling with production quality problems on best-selling models.
Airbus operates one of the world's most valuable supply chains, with 8,000 direct suppliers and 18,000 indirect ones providing millions of parts worth some $50 billion a year. 
In normal times, suppliers must tell Airbus whenever parts use components or material from a different source or get built at a different site - a change known as a Transfer of Work.

At any one time, manufacturers monitor dozens of such changes. But ensuring that the rising number of switches driven by the crisis happens without any impact on quality and deliveries has moved up the planemaker's list of concerns.
""Over 2021-22, more than 680 Transfers of Work will be ongoing across the globe, illustrating the deepness of the crisis,"" the Airbus letter said, instructing suppliers to act early to head off any disruption.

A video circulated on China's Twitter-like Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) and in local state media showed a Tesla Model X next to two police officers lying on the ground after an accident.
The driver of the vehicle involved in the Monday accident has been detained, police in the eastern city of Taizhou said in a post without explaining the circumstances of the accident.

News of accidents involving Tesla cars in China have gone viral on social media in recent weeks after an unhappy customer made headlines by clambering atop a Tesla at the Shanghai auto show to protest the company's handling of her complaints.
China is the electric car maker's second-biggest market, accounting for about 30% of its sales.

216,By Reuters,"<span>May 18, 2021 05:52AM ET</span>",Sustainable finance scramble reaches currency derivatives market,"By Tommy Wilkes
LONDON (Reuters) - A rush by companies to boost their sustainability claims has reached foreign exchange markets in the form of currency hedging products where the cost is tied to a firm's environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals. 
Sustainable finance to date has mostly centred around the issuance of debt to fund 'green' environmental or climate-related projects, or with interest payments linked to the achievement of social and governance targets. 
But energy firms Drax and Italy's  Enel  (MI:ENEI) are among those to have recently signed up to ESG-linked FX derivatives, the price of which depends on anything from cutting greenhouse emissions to improving workforce diversity.
Keen to promote their own sustainability pledges, banks selling the derivatives, which lock in a future exchange rate, tout them as a way for companies to tap into demand for ESG finance, a market that has soared in popularity but which critics say is often more marketing gimmick than a true incentive for change. 
Early adopter Olam, a commodity trader, last year bought a U.S. dollar/Thai baht forward contract at a discount to a conventional forward, on condition it meets several targets including cutting carbon emissions and boosting farmer training. 
How a value is assigned to an ESG goal, and hence how such products are priced, for now remains between banks and their clients in the fledgling market, but Fabio Madar, global head of FX sales and structuring at NatWest Markets, said there can be decent financial gains for clients that buy and sell currencies frequently. 
He cited the example of a company purchasing 400 million euros. If the euro/dollar swap rate was set at $1.2130, the client could lock in a price of $1.2128 if targets are met -- saving $80,000.
The impetus is not just financial, he said, with firms keen ""to show that it's not all talk and that the company is real about (sustainability)"".
QUANTIFIABLE TARGETS 
Jeremy Hamon, head of group finance at engineering business Primetals Technologies, thought sustainability-linked finance was limited to debt products such as those issued by Primetals' parent company Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.
But Primetals developed a framework with  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) around its day-to-day currency hedging needs using ""quantifiable"" ESG targets, including increasing the proportion of revenue from projects that aim to cut greenhouse emissions, and promoting a ""safe and healthy work environment"". 
If it misses the targets -- which are verified by a third party -- Primetals pays a penalty to a charity. It has already bought such options in more than 10 currency pairs. 
""This represented all the FX options we have traded in 2021 since the ESG incentive pretty much ensures a strong competitiveness,"" Hamon said. 
UK energy firm Drax has signed ESG-linked derivative deals with  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and NatWest, whereby it is paid a premium by the banks for meeting a carbon intensity reduction target.
""Most of our banking group, and even some banks not in our group, have contacted us to see how they can do something similar in the FX and financial derivative space,"" said Lisa Dukes, Drax's director of corporate finance and derivatives.
GREEN OR GIMMICK?
Sustainable finance has its critics who say it is too loosely-defined, with many products little more than marketing tools prone to so-called greenwashing where environmental claims don't stack up. 
Banks insist targets in the ESG-linked derivatives are ambitious, measurable and independently verified. 
""These structures are a very good way for a company that doesn't have a funding or capex need related to ESG, to still make a commitment to ESG,"" said Claire Coustar, Deutsche Bank's global head of ESG for fixed income and currencies.
Mimi Rushton, Barclays' co-head of global FX sales believes ESG incentives could start ""extrapolating out to a number of other financial instruments"" beyond FX.
One challenge is that banks must bear the cost of the premium or the discount -- the company's reward for hitting targets -- eroding its profit and limiting the size of incentives.
Market growth therefore hinges on such derivatives becoming tradeable. For that, banks must find a way to embed sustainability performance into the option. 
One possibility is for ESG targets to be quantified through a regulatory-approved scoring system.

""We may be able to transfer ""ESG points"" from one entity to another. With this shift, banks would be able to price ESG linked products differently,"" said Max Poulin from Deutsche Bank's FX structuring team. 
""We are still quite far away from that.""

217,By Reuters,"<span>May 18, 2021 05:21AM ET</span>",Lamborghini maps a cautious course toward electrification,"DETROIT (Reuters) - Supercar brand Lamborghini plans to invest $1.5 billion to produce an entirely gas-electric hybrid lineup by 2024, but its first fully electric model will not appear until the second half of the decade, the brand's CEO said.
Lamborghini, part of Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY)'s Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) Group, and other players in the rarified market for high-performance sports cars, including  Ferrari NV  (NYSE:RACE), Aston Martin Lagonda and McLaren, are wrestling with how to shift their lineups to battery power without losing the visceral performance that supports their premium pricing https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/how-mclaren-aims-rebuild-supercars-roar-into-electric-era-2021-02-16. 
Lamborghini's plan is to shift its current models - the Huracan and Aventador sports cars and the Urus sport utility - to hybrid, gasoline-electric powertrains by the end of 2024, the brand's chief executive, Stephan Winkelmann, told reporters in a video briefing ahead of Tuesday's announcement. 
During the second half of the decade, Lamborghini plans a new, all-electric model which will likely have seating for four, Winkelmann said. The exact design of that model has not been decided, he said, but, ""in terms of the design, the sexier car is a two-door car.""
That timetable would put Lamborghini behind Ferrari, which has promised to have a battery-electric model by 2025 https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/ferrari-postpones-2022-targets-due-pandemic-shares-dip-2021-05-04.
Governments around the world have begun proposing deadlines as early as 2030 for phasing out petroleum-fueled internal combustion vehicles in order to hit climate goals. 
For makers of high-performance sports cars, abandoning internal combustion is both a technical and emotional challenge. The roaring sound of a 12-cylinder engine is as core to the Lamborghini brand as the edgy, aggressive styling of its cars or its rampaging bull logo. 

On a technical level, lithium-ion batteries cannot operate for long at top speed on a track.
""We have to define what sportiness is in the new era, in the battery electric era,"" Winkelmann said. ""Range is the top priority. This is still something we have to work on.""

218,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 18, 2021 05:09AM ET</span>",Oatly’s About to Go Public in an Increasingly Crowded Milk Aisle,"(Bloomberg) -- Consumers can’t seem to get enough plant-based alternatives, and Oatly Group AB, the vegan food and drink maker, is looking to cash in.
This week, as the Swedish producer of oat-based milk and dairy alternatives will finally make its highly anticipated U.S. initial public offering, investors will have to gauge not just how popular its products are now, but how much hotter they can get in a market that’s both bigger -- and more crowded -- than ever before.
“There’s a lot of competing products in the dairy alternative market. There is oats and soy, almond milk, nut-based milks. There’s quite a lot of choice out there,” said Mark Lynch, partner at Oghma Partners, a corporate finance advisory firm specializing in the food and beverage sector. Still, Oatly’s IPO “reflects the maturity and the staying power of the plant-based business. It’s also highlighting it’s not just a fad.”
Oatly, one of at least 10 initial public offerings originally expected this week in the U.S., is seeking to raise as much as $1.65 billion. It’s offering 64.7 million American depositary shares for $15 to $17 each. The company declined to comment ahead of the offering.
Beyond Comparisons
Its market value would be $10.1 billion at the top of its IPO price target, according to calculations by Bloomberg, and this would be 7.1 times its forecast 2022 revenue, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing private information. While numerous companies are focused on healthier alternatives to traditional food products, few operate as standalone public companies, making comparisons inexact.
Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND), by comparison, is valued at 15.5 its revenue for the 12 months ended April 3. Snack maker Simply Good Foods Co. (NASDAQ:SMPL), another publicly traded company that advertises its products like protein bars as healthier, currently has a market value of about 3.4 times its revenue for the past year.
The IPO underscores plant-based products’ jump into the mainstream, as environmental and health concerns spur consumers to seek alternatives to traditional meat and dairy products. Investors have been looking for ways to replicate the public-market success of Beyond Meat, whose shares have surged more than 300% since it went public in May 2019. Oatly, with its multi-continental expansion plans, offers a way for institutional investors to tap booming interest in a foodtech space often dominated by venture capital and private funding.
Oatly is the number two milk-alternative brand in Western Europe, comprising about 9.2% of the market, according to an RBC Capital Markets report, citing researcher Euromonitor International. But it doesn’t even appear on the North American list of top plant-based milks, which is dominated by the likes of Danone’s Silk and Blue Diamond Growers’ Almond Breeze. Global milk alternatives generated $16.9 billion in sales in 2020, accounting for some 12% of the total milk sales, Euromonitor data show.
With plant-based demand surging, more companies are elbowing their way into the space. Nestle SA (SIX:NESN), a latecomer to the industry, is rolling out a new pea-based milk in Europe to compete with Oatly. A set of newcomers with a range of technologies are also coming for the dairy alternatives space. For instance, Halsa Foods and Yofix Probiotics Ltd. promise to offer “clean label” plant-based products made with simple ingredients, according to Maria Mascaraque, industry manager for food and nutrition at Euromonitor. PitchBook estimates that 30 new plant-based dairy companies have received a first funding round since 2004.
“Competition has been incredibly intense in the past few years. We hear that every month a new brand launches,” said Emma Letheren, an analyst at RBC, noting that those with a foothold already are in the best position. “We wonder if it’s become generally harder to compete because now major players have carved out the market; it might become harder for newcomers to gain a market share.”
Cow’s milk shouldn’t be discounted, either. It’s less expensive and it’s the incumbent. “With rare exceptions, a substitute never replaces the original,” said Nicholas Fereday, a consumer foods analyst at Rabobank.
Reported Shortages
Still, Oatly has been gaining a following, and fast. At a May 12 conference hosted by the Wall Street Journal,  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX). Chief Executive Officer Kevin Johnson said that alternative milks like soy and almond made up 17% of U.S. beverages last year. Then it rolled out Oatly, and now roughly 25% use alternative milks.
Oatly’s biggest obstacle might be itself. Since its entrance into the U.S. market in 2017 -- first aimed toward professional baristas and then mass consumers -- finding Oatly in coffee shops and in supermarkets has become something of a treasure hunt for shoppers looking for their fix. The company opened a $15 million Millville, New Jersey, plant in 2019 to help meet the growing demand, but even now, shortages are frequent, as Covid-related delays have kept a planned second U.S. production from coming online.
In March, supermarkets across the country -- and even its new splashy customer Starbucks -- reported trouble procuring orders. To meet demand and fuel further market expansion, Oatly is also developing factories in the U.K., China and Singapore.
Other leaders in plant-based food, including Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, experienced shortages as well when they were getting off the ground. “It signals that demand outstrips supply,” said Rachel Dreskin, chief executive officer of the Plant Based Foods Association, speaking of the recurring problems in the category. “It’s a more exciting signal than the opposite.”

220,By Reuters,"<span>May 18, 2021 04:55AM ET</span>","Inflation sparks buy UK stocks, sell tech shares trades - BofA survey","LONDON (Reuters) - Fund managers turned overweight on UK stocks for the first time in seven years and cut exposure to tech stocks as rising inflation leaves growth stocks vulnerable to pullbacks, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)'s May fund manager survey showed on Tuesday.
Unprecedented stimulus measures to tackle the pandemic-induced recession have now sparked worries about inflation, which featured in the BofA survey as the biggest tail risk for markets.
Last week, data showed U.S. consumer prices unexpectedly rose by the most in nearly 12 years in April, triggering worries that the Federal Reserve may have to raise rates sooner than it currently expects.
That in turn is a boon for UK stock indexes, which are heavy on stocks that do well in a rising rates environment, such as banks, miners and energy firms.
Allocation to UK stocks touched the highest level since March 2014, BofA's survey of 215 fund managers with $625 billion in assets under management showed, also supported by the clearing of the Brexit fog and an economy gearing to reopen fully after a couple of strict COVID-19 lockdowns.
Britain formally exited the European Union last year, removing a source of uncertainty that lasted for years.
Tech stocks are particularly sensitive to rising rate expectations because their value rests heavily on future earnings, which are discounted more deeply when rates go up. Investors cut down overweight positions on technology stocks to a three-year low, according to BofA.
Elsewhere, long bitcoin topped the list of most crowded trades with 75% of the investors surveyed saying the most popular digital currency was in a ""bubble"".
Bitcoin fell to a three-month low on Monday in a volatile session that saw investors selling and buying the digital currency after Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) boss Elon Musk tweeted about the carmaker's bitcoin holdings.

221,By Reuters,"<span>May 18, 2021 04:36AM ET</span>",Imperial Brands' turnaround plan gets off the ground with solid U.S. performance,"(Reuters) -Imperial Brands reported a modest rise in first-half revenue on Tuesday, helped by higher cigarette prices and double-digit sales growth of e-cigarettes and cigars in the United States. 
Shares of the company rose 2.5% after the maker of Gauloises Blondes and Winston cigarettes also reiterated its full-year outlook and lifted its dividend, as Chief Executive Stefan Bomhard said his five-year plan to turn around the group, laid out in January, was working.
The company said organic adjusted revenue for the six months ended March 31 totalled 3.57 billion pounds ($5.06 billion), up 3.5% year-on-year in constant currencies, even as it faced ""lower U.S. trade inventories"" compared to the same period a year earlier, when global lockdowns spurred tobacco retailers to stock up on cigarettes.
Cigarette sales, however, were hit by a drop in sales at airport duty-free stores as well as a weaker tourist season in parts of southern Europe, compared to a year ago, CEO Bomhard told journalists on a call.
Revenue was bolstered by an average 5.3% rise in tobacco prices in its fiscal first half and a strong performance in the United States, where restrictions on movement were easing. 
The company raised its first-half dividend to 42.12 pence a share, up from 41.70 pence last year. This comes after the company announced a cut to its annual dividend by a third last year as it sought to retain cash to ride out the pandemic.
The United States, where sales rose 8.8% in the first half, is Imperial's biggest market by sales and cigar volumes there jumped 62.5%, helped by new products. 
Steve Clayton, portfolio manager of  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV)'s Select UK Income Shares fund, which has a stake in Imperial, was cautious on the results.
“Imperial are generating plenty of smoke, but still without any real fire,"" Clayton said.
""The numbers were solid enough, but despite the reported growth, the underlying performance of the tobacco business was actually a small decline in profitability,"" he said.
The company's shares have fallen about 2.4% over the past year, while Britain's blue chip FTSE 100 index rose nearly 16% over that period.
Bomhard's plan to turnaround the company includes focusing investments on its top five cigarette markets and expanding sales of tobacco-heating products in Europe and e-cigarettes in the United States.
On Tuesday, the CEO, who joined Imperial last July, said the plan was working after the company managed to stabilised its aggregate market share in the United States, the UK and Spain, after years of declines.
He also said that disciplined execution in its next- generation products business that sells e-cigarettes, tobacco heating and oral nicotine products has curbed losses in the unit, which has been a drag on the business for years. 
Adjusted earnings per share for the six-month period came in at 107 pence, slightly lower than the 107.7 pence analysts had expected, according to Refinitiv data. 

The UK-based company, however, kept its full-year forecast of low- to mid-single digit organic adjusted operating profit growth at constant currencies and said it expects to see modest profit growth in its tobacco business in the second half.

The United States and Britain have blamed Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), successor to the foreign spying operations of the KGB, for the hack which compromised nine U.S. federal agencies and hundreds of private sector companies.
""These claims are like a bad detective novel,"" SVR Director Sergei Naryshkin, a close ally of Kremlin chief Vladimir Putin, told the BBC in Russian. 
Asked directly if the SVR was responsible for the SolarWinds attack, Naryshkin quipped with a smile that he would be ""flattered"" if the SVR had been responsible for such a sophisticated attack but that he could not ""claim the creative achievements of others as his own"".
Naryshkin said he did not want to accuse the United States of being behind the attack but quoted from documents leaked by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden to suggest that the tactics of the attack were similar to those used by U.S. and British intelligence agencies.
The United States and Britain cast Russia as a dangerous former superpower which they say has poisoned enemies with nerve agents and radioactive isotopes, meddled in Western elections and carried out hacking operations across the world.
Naryshkin said such accusations were absurd and that Russia was not responsible for the cyber-attacks, poisonings, hacks, or meddling in elections that it was blamed for.
The hack of SolarWinds, which was identified in December, gave access to thousands of companies and government offices that used its products. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) President Brad Smith described the attack as “the largest and most sophisticated attack the world has ever seen"".
Britain's GCHQ cyber spying agency said that it was highly likely that SVR was responsible for the SolarWinds attack. 

Asked about a view that only 10% of Russian intelligence operations in Europe were uncovered, Naryshkin, who along with GRU military intelligence boss Igor Kostyukov, is one of Russia's two most powerful spy chiefs, smiled and raised his eyebrows.
He added that correspondence between Russian intelligence and Britain's Secret Intelligence Service, known as MI6, had been re-established.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Shares of  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) touched a record high on Tuesday as investors flocked back to automakers and other relatively cheap cyclical stocks while ditching tech companies that shone earlier in the pandemic. 
Toyota's shares rose as much as 2.6% to 8,869 yen, surpassing their 2015 peak, and closed up 2.0%. 
""With earnings out of way, the market trend has clearly shifted in favour of value stocks from growth stocks which had been bought only based on expectations (of future growth),"" said Hiroyasu Mori, strategist at Okachi Securities.
""There's no doubt that Toyota, once called an eternally cheap stock, is a leader in this."" he said.
Toyota, the top Japanese company by market capitalisation and the world's biggest automaker, has weathered a global semi-conductor chip shortage better than many of its rivals and is forecasting a return to pre-pandemic profit levels this year.
""As supply chain disruptions due to the chip shortage hamper the automaker industry, Toyota has been regarded as the automaker investors can buy,"" Nobuhiko Kuramochi, senior strategist at Mizuho Securities, said.
Toyota's gains also reflect investors' renewed interest in traditional automakers, which have valuations below those of electric vehicle makers such as Elon Musk's Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).
Shares of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) have gained nearly 40% this year, while Stellantis has risen 28%.
In contrast, Tesla shares have dropped 18% and Nikola's 15% since the start of 2021.
Although Toyota has been regarded as a rare winner in an industry squeezed by competition from electric vehicle manufacturers, shares of rival Honda Motor shares also rose 3.3%, outperforming a broader market that was up about 1.5%. (T)
Steelmakers, financials and retailers also gained sharply.
Nippon Steel rose 4.5% while Dai-ichi Life Insurance jumped 5.8% and Isetan Mitsukoshi gained 3.6%. All three trade far below their book value.
""Value stocks, which had underperformed until recently, look more attractive now,"" said Taku Ito, chief portfolio manager at Nissay Asset Management.

Liberum analysts said the increased supply deal was a ""huge endorsement"" of Oxford Biomedica's capabilities, and that a further extension from AstraZeneca feels ""increasingly likely"".
AstraZeneca has had a bruising start to the year as it struggled with vaccine production and faced a legal battle after cutting deliveries to Europe.
Oxford Biomedica was spun off in 1995 from the University of Oxford, which developed the COVID-19 vaccine before licensing it to AstraZeneca in April 2020.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Tuesday, helped by promises of continued Federal Reserve largesse along with better than expected U.K. employment data.
At 3:30 AM ET (0830 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.6% higher, at an all-time high, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.6%, climbing to a new 52-week high, the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.7%, while the blue-chip Euro Stoxx 50 gained 0.7%, also to an all-time high.
European stock markets have struggled of late over worries that growing inflationary pressures could force the Federal Reserve to start tapering its ultra-easy monetary policies in the near future.
However, Dallas Federal Reserve President Robert Kaplan on Monday reiterated his view that he does not expect interest rates to rise until next year, while Federal Reserve Vice Chair Richard Clarida pointed to the recent disappointing jobs report as evidence the U.S. economy had not yet reached the threshold to warrant scaling back the central bank’s massive bond purchases.
These comments have helped to reassure the markets, and put the focus firmly on Wednesday’s release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's April policy meeting, which could shed more light on the policymakers' outlook on inflation.
Adding to the positive tone, Britain's unemployment rate unexpectedly fell again to 4.8% between January and March, a period which the country spent under a tight Covid lockdown, and hiring rose further in April as the country reopened.
In the Eurozone, Germany's Constitutional Court rejected a suit that aimed to stop the ECB's buying of government bonds, helping sentiment at the margins. 
""Slowly but surely, Karlsruhe is losing its role of lender of last resort for German euro critics,"" said Carsten Brzeski, an economist with ING, via Twitter.
Next up is the release of the flash estimate of Eurozone first-quarter gross domestic product, which is expected to show that the bloc contracted by 0.6% in the first quarter, and by 1.8% on an annual basis, as the region struggled with fresh lockdowns.
In corporate news, Generali (MI:GASI) stock rose 1.1%, to a 52-week high, after the Italian insurer’s first-quarter profits beat expectations, helped by the positive contribution from the non-life and asset management businesses.
Imperial Brands (OTC:IMBBY) stock rose 2.4% after the tobacco company maintained its full-year outlook despite its first-half profit and sales falling short of expectations, hurt by lower retailer demand for cigarettes in the United States.
On the flip side, Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) stock slumped 6.2% after the mobile operator reported a 1.2% drop in full-year adjusted earnings, coming in at the bottom of its guidance and missing market expectations, after Covid-19 hit roaming revenue and handset sales. Warnings of higher capital spending ahead also weighed on the stock.
Oil prices pushed higher Tuesday, continuing the optimism of the previous session as the major oil-consuming economies of the U.S. and Europe further reopen on the back of successful vaccination programs.
That said, worries still exist about the Covid-19 situation in India, the third largest consumer of oil in the world, as well as new outbreaks in other parts of Asia, including Taiwan and Singapore.  
Investors now await U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute, due later in the day.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.1% higher at $67.00 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.1% to $70.20, climbing above the $70 level for the first time since early March.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,870.60/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.4% higher at 1.2199.

This is the first time the Tencent group has publicly commented on the matter.
Reuters reported last month that Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY), which controls music streaming company Tencent Music, was told by Chinese anti-trust regulators to pay a fine, give up exclusive music rights and sell some of its music assets. Tencent did not comment then.
The action against Tencent came amid a sweeping anti-trust clampdown by China on its internet giants.

Yip declined to comment further or predict the outcome of the talks with the regulators, but said ""we are committed to comply with all relevant laws and regulations, including those related to anti-trust.""

(Graphic: Tencent Music shares: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gjnpwnklwvw/image-1621308296927.png)
Tencent Music beat quarterly profit and revenue estimates on Monday, driven by strong growth in subscription and advertising revenue from its music streaming platform. But its monthly active users numbers fell.
The company, known as China's Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), has been expanding its music library through new partnerships and multi-year licensing deals. That, coupled with efforts to diversify its content base through long-form shows and live talk shows have helped lure more paying users as well as advertisers.
Although paying users for its music platform jumped, monthly active users (MAUs) for both music and social entertainment platforms declined by 6.4% and 14.2%, respectively.

228,By Investing.com,"<span>May 18, 2021 02:07AM ET</span>",European Stock Futures Higher; Fed Officials Calm Inflation Fears,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening higher Tuesday, helped by promises of continued Federal Reserve largesse ahead of the release of the latest growth data for the region.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.4% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.3% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.7%. 
European stock markets have struggled of late over worries that growing inflationary pressures could force the Federal Reserve to start tapering its ultra-easy monetary policies in the near future.
However, Dallas Federal Reserve President Robert Kaplan on Monday reiterated his view that he does not expect interest rates to rise until next year, while Federal Reserve Vice Chair Richard Clarida pointed to the disappointing jobs report as evidence the U.S. economy had not yet reached the threshold to warrant scaling back the central bank’s massive bond purchases.
These comments have helped to reassure the markets, and put the focus firmly on Wednesday’s release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's policy meeting last month, which could shed more light on the policymakers' outlook on inflation.
In Europe, attention will now turn to the release of the flash estimate of Eurozone first-quarter gross domestic product, which is expected to show that the bloc contracted by 0.6% in the first quarter, compared with the final quarter of last year, and by 1.8% on an annual basis, as the region coped with fresh lockdowns.
Earlier Tuesday data showed that Japan’s GDP contracted a more-than-expected 5.1% year-on-year and 1.3% quarter-on-quarter during the first quarter of 2021, as the Asian country struggled to contain a fresh outbreak of the Covid-19 virus.
U.K. unemployment data for March surprised positively, with the claimant count dropping by 15,000 and the unemployment rate falling to 4.8%.
In corporate news, Italian insurer Generali (MI:GASI) will be in focus after its first-quarter profits beat expectations, helped by the positive contribution from the non-life and asset management businesses.
Earnings from the likes of HomeServe (LON:HSV), Imperial Brands (OTC:IMBBY) and Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) are also scheduled.
Oil prices pushed higher Tuesday, continuing the optimism of the previous session as the major oil-consuming economies of the U.S. and Europe further reopen on the back of successful vaccination programs.
U.S. airports recorded 1.85 million passengers on Sunday, the highest number since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in early March 2020. In Europe, the U.K. further relaxed restrictions and both Portugal and the Netherlands have opened up travel.
That said, worries still exist about the Covid-19 situation in India, the third largest consumer of oil in the world, as well as new outbreaks in other parts of Asia, including Taiwan and Singapore.  
Investors now await U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute, due later in the day.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% higher at $66.45 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.3% to $69.66.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,870.75/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.2172.

229,By Reuters,"<span>May 18, 2021 12:00AM ET</span>",China close to kicking off long-awaited REITs market,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China is close to kicking off its long-awaited public REITs market, with regulators approving the first batch of nine real estate investment trusts that will raise an estimated 30 billion yuan ($4.7 billion) for infrastructure projects.
Late on Monday, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) approved the registration of the nine REITs, which will channel investors' money into projects ranging from tollways and warehouses, to industrial parks and sewage plants.
The green light, which will allow China's first REITs to be sold and traded on stock exchanges, comes a year after Beijing announced plans for a pilot scheme.
But unlike other markets such as Hong Kong, Singapore or the United States, China only allows REITs - investment vehicles that are backed by income-producing properties - to be invested in infrastructure initially. Eligible underlying assets don't include commercial properties such as shopping malls or offices.
REITs widen the financing channel for infrastructure projects and provide more investment options for investors, said the Shanghai Stock Exchange, where five of the approved REITs will be traded.
The instrument will help reduce China's macro leverage ratio, and fend off financial risks, the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, where four REITs will be traded initially, said in a statement.
A broader China REITs market that eventually covers commercial properties could reach over $3 trillion, according to a Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) estimate - surpassing the United States as the world's largest.
But China's REITs market faces numerous challenges including a lack of sufficient returns, stakeholder reluctance as well as legal and tax issues, analysts have said.
One of the approved REITs invests in Chinese warehouses owned by logistics property developer GLP, while another will channel money into an industrial park in Shenzhen, according to the prospectuses.
The nine projects will raise an estimated 30 billion yuan, according to brokerage Shenwan Hongyuan Securities.

230,By Reuters,"<span>May 17, 2021 10:38PM ET</span>",AT&T set to end media voyage with $43 billion Discovery deal,"By Kenneth Li and Subrat Patnaik
(Reuters) - AT&T (NYSE:T), owner of HBO and Warner Bros studios, and Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA), home to lifestyle TV networks such as HGTV and TLC, said they will combine their content to form a standalone global entertainment and media business.
Discovery Chief Executive David Zaslav will lead the proposed new company, which will comprise one of Hollywood's most powerful studios, including the Harry Potter and Batman franchises, news network CNN, sports programming and Discovery's unscripted home, cooking and nature and science shows.
Monday's move marks the unwinding of AT&T's ambitious plan to forge a telecoms and media powerhouse through a flurry of deals including the 2018 $108.7 billion acquisition of U.S. media conglomerate Time Warner and the 2015 purchase of satellite TV service DirecTV for $68 billion. 
Shares in Discovery climbed about 16% to $41.3 in premarket trade but later fell 2% as investors digested that it would take time for Discovery to scale up in streaming, Rich Greenfield, partner at LightShed Partners, said.
""This company is going to take a year to be in position to take control of the assets,"" he said. ""The new company will be better after the deal, but it will take time.""
Shares in AT&T rose about 3% to $33.23 after the announcement of the new company, which will be 71% owned by AT&T shareholders and 29% by Discovery investors.
AT&T said it will use the $43 billion proceeds from the tax-free spin-off of its media assets to pay down its more than $160 billion of debt.
The telecoms giant also said it planned to cut its dividend payout ratio, which is the percentage of earnings paid to shareholders in dividends, to the low 40% range, down from around 60% in the previous quarter.
The enterprise value of the new combined company will be more than $120 billion, carrying $58 billion in debt, including $43 billion from WarnerMedia and $15 billion from Discovery.
The name of the new company will be disclosed by next week, while other details, including the future role of WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar and how the combined properties and services will be arranged, have yet to be worked out, executives said on a call with reporters.
The deal underscores the movement of TV viewership to streaming, where scale is required to take on the likes of Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co.
""The opportunities in direct to consumer streaming are rapidly evolving, and to keep pace and maintain a leadership position, several things are required - global scale, access to capital, a broad array of high quality content and industry best talent,"" AT&T Chief Executive John Stankey told a news briefing.
Combined the company will spend about $20 billion on content, more than the $17 billion Netflix will spend this year, and Zaslav said he expected to increase programming investment in the future. 
""While further details have yet to emerge, the proposed horizontal combination would create a global content behemoth uniting WarnerMedia's premier news and entertainment assets with Discovery's industry-leading cache of non-scripted programming networks,"" Keith Snyder at CFRA Research said.
The deal is not surprising, Snyder added, after pressure on traditional pay-TV ramped up during the coronavirus pandemic as consumers binge-watched streaming shows while stuck at home. 
With Time Warner, former AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson sought to create a media and telecoms giant, combining content and distribution. 
This proved a costly strategy as AT&T simultaneously sought to expand next generation wireless services, most recently spending $23 billion to buy more spectrum.
TELCO TURNAROUNDS
AT&T is not the first telco to shed its media assets.
 Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) announced plans on May 3 to drop its media businesses, which include Yahoo and AOL, for $5 billion, ending an expensive and unsuccessful run in the media and advertising world.
AT&T and Discovery's new combined venture is projected to have 2023 revenue of about $52 billion and adjusted EBITDA of about $14 billion.
The deal is anticipated to close in mid-2022, pending approval by Discovery shareholders and regulatory approvals.

The new company is expected to see $3 billion in cost synergies and has no plans to sell any assets. 
LionTree and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) advised AT&T, while Allen & Company and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) advised Discovery. Perella Weinberg advised the independent directors of Discovery.

231,By Reuters,"<span>May 17, 2021 10:37PM ET</span>","Analysis: AT&T, Discovery deal highlights media's thirst to be like Netflix","By Helen Coster
(Reuters) - Since AT&T bought Time Warner in 2018 to compete with Netflix and  Disney , the world of streaming video has only gotten more cutthroat. 
The telecom giant’s deal with Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Inc, announced Monday, marks the latest shift in the remaking of the media industry and the potential beginning of another round of consolidation. An earlier wave three years ago resulted in media mogul Rupert Murdoch leaving Hollywood and Viacom and CBS recombining.
The deal combining Discovery with AT&T Inc (NYSE:T)'s WarnerMedia underscores the value of scale in today’s media landscape, where industry leaders Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) Co are looking outside the United States for growth.
Discovery brings a global footprint with its pan-European television sports network Eurosport, as well as a portfolio of broadcast channels across Europe. 
“The opportunities in direct-to-consumer streaming are rapidly evolving, and to keep pace and retain a leadership position several things are required: global scale, access to capital, a broad array of high-quality content and industry-best talent,” said AT&T Chief Executive John Stankey during a press call Monday morning. 
The new company, with a name announced by next week, will have over 200,000 hours of programming and include 100 brands - from HBO to Animal Planet to CNN and the Food Network. It will include streaming services such as HBO Max and Discovery+, which are growing, but still significantly smaller than Netflix and Disney+. 
HBO and HBO Max have 63.9 million global subscribers. Discovery has 15 million global streaming subscribers, most of them for Discovery+. That compares to 103.6 million for Disney+ and 207.6 million for Netflix. 
ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) Inc and Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA) could be feeling pressure to consider bulking up, analysts said on Monday, as the landscape is set to change once again.
Rich Greenfield, a partner and analyst at LightShed Partners, said in a note on Monday that ViacomCBS was the only obvious potential partner for Comcast, but its CBS network and local news stations ""are clear regulatory problems."" 
DEAL FRENZY 
Discovery’s global footprint will help WarnerMedia’s international expansion once the deal closes in mid-2022. HBO Max is scheduled to launch in June in 30 territories across Latin America and the Caribbean, and to roll out in another 21 markets across Europe in the second half of the year. 
WarnerMedia has a number of U.S. TV distribution rights, including deals with Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League and the N.C.A.A. through Turner Sports. Discovery has broadcast rights in Europe for the Olympic Games through 2024, among others.
The other opportunity is in news, Zaslav said, where Discovery has recently invested in GB News, a conservative-leaning channel in the United Kingdom. Zaslav said the company intends to be long-term owners of CNN and teased further global expansion, mentioning Discovery's news business in Poland.​
“The direct-to-consumer momentum on both sides will accelerate our ability to be one of the top streaming companies in the world,"" said Zaslav. 
The deal builds on the earlier round of consolidation that saw Disney bulking up through multiple transactions over many years: from its 2017 deal to buy Murdoch's Twenty-First Century  Fox Inc  (NASDAQ:TFCF) - which brought franchises like “Avatar” and “The Simpsons” inside the company - to previous purchases by then-CEO Bob Iger, which included Pixar Animation Studios, Marvel Entertainment and “Star Wars” producer Lucasfilm.

Those deals helped propel Disney’s launch of its Disney+ streaming services in November 2019, which quickly exceeded expectations, reaching 10 million sign-ups in its first day. 
The 2019 merger of Viacom and CBS had a similar intention, positioning the company to rebrand its CBS All Access streaming service into Paramount+, bolstered by content across the CBS television network, CBS News and Showtime cable networks with MTV Networks, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central and the Paramount movie studios.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up Tuesday morning, firming as investors gauge the diverging stages of economic recovery from COVID-19 in different countries.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 2.14% by 10:21 PM ET (2:21 AM GMT). Data released earlier in the day said that Japan’s GDP contracted a lower-than-expected 5.1% year-on-year and 1.3% quarter-on-quarter during the first quarter of 2021.
Japan also extended its state of emergency to three more prefectures at the beginning of the week, with the measure now covering nine prefectures in total and in place until May 31.
South Korea’s KOSPI rose 1.14%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was up 0.60%. The Reserve Bank of Australia released the minutes from its latest meeting earlier in the day.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 1.45%.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched up 0.01% while the ShenzhenComponent was down 0.39%.
COVID-19 continues to be on investors’ minds, with Taiwan reporting a record 333 new cases on Monday. Hong Kong also delayed its travel bubble with Singapore for a second time as the latter detected more cases of the B.1.617 variant strain of the virus first seen in India. The World Economic Forum, scheduled to be hosted by Singapore in August 2021, has been canceled.
Meanwhile, the U.S. recorded its lowest number of both new cases and deaths related to COVID-19 since the early days of the pandemic in 2020.
Investors are also awaiting the release of the minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s latest meeting, due on Wednesday, which will be scoured for any discussion on inflationary pressure and clues as to when the central bank will shift from its current dovish policy.
However, Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida said on Monday that the previous week’s weaker-than-expected April employment report, including non-farm payrolls, indicated that “we have not made substantial further progress” on the Fed’s employment and inflation goals.
Some investors remained positive, however.
“Hotter inflation has materialized and market volatility is rising as the economic restart gathers pace,” BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Investment Institute analysts led by Jean Boivin said in a note.
“This is playing out in line with our view that the economy is in a ‘restart.’ We prefer to look through any volatility and see a later ‘lift-off’ from zero rates than markets expect. This means higher-than-expected inflation in the medium term, and underpins our pro-risk stance,” the note added.
On the cryptocurrency front, bitcoin continued a volatile week as Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk’s tweet over the weekend continued to reverberate in the market.  Coinbase Global  Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) dropped to a record low, slipping below the reference price used in its April direct listing."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A senior American labor union leader will tell U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday that the government should require human operators in all self-driving passenger services to take over in the event of an emergency.
Greg Regan, president of the Transportation Trades Department for the AFL-CIO, will tell a U.S. House of Representatives Energy and Commerce subcommittee that autonomous vehicles place ""millions of jobs at risk"" and any legislation to speed deployment of self-driving cars should not apply to commercial trucks weighing 10,000 pounds or more, according to his written testimony released by the panel on Monday.
""We do not allow passenger airplanes to operate without pilots or passenger rail to run without engineers, and we should use a similar approach with AVs that operate on our often-congested roadways and in complex transit networks,"" Regan says in his testimony.
Regan's testimony comes after Reuters reported last week that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc’s Waymo and rival Cruise have applied for permits to start charging for rides and delivery using autonomous vehicles in San Francisco.
""Our call here is not to say: 'Stop Tech,'"" Regan said in an interview. ""You are talking about millions of jobs that are professional drivers ... and if we're not thinking about that now, there may be really dire consequences.""
Waymo said it planned to start with ""drivered operations"" and Cruise expects to deploy vehicles without humans behind the wheel, according to documents seen by Reuters.
Concerns raised by major unions, including the Teamsters, are one reason that legislation to grant U.S. regulators the power to exempt tens of thousands of self-driving cars from U.S. safety regulations has not been approved despite five years of efforts.
""We have seen the impacts of automation on other sectors — manufacturing, health care, and retail, to name a few — and the consequences when public policy fails to protect the workers and users it impacts,"" Regan will tell lawmakers, also raising concerns about ""alternative design vehicles such as delivery bots. Any vehicle that is under the 10,000-pound threshold that will travel on public roads must be properly regulated.""
The efforts come at a turning point for Waymo, which Google launched over a decade ago. Cruise, backed by General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Honda Motor Co Ltd and SoftBank Group Corp, has focused on San Francisco since its beginning.

Cruise declined to comment on the testimony, while Waymo said in a statement that U.S. regulators ""should have a leading role in ensuring the safe deployment of AVs. ... The phased approach to regulation that we’ve recommended would ensure a smart balance between close federal oversight and innovation.""
Senator John Thune, a Republican, last week blamed ""the trial lawyers and the Teamsters"" for blocking self-driving car legislation that he said could save thousands of lives.

The COVID-19 pandemic meant it was not possible to hold such a large event as planned on Aug. 17-20, they said.
""Regretfully, the tragic circumstances unfolding across geographies, an uncertain travel outlook, differing speeds of vaccination roll out and the uncertainty around new variants combine to make it impossible to realise a global meeting with business, government and civil society leaders from all over the world at the scale which was planned,"" the WEF said in a statement.
The event, which attracts VIPs from the worlds of politics and business, has been held since 1971.
It was shifted from the Swiss Alpine resort of Davos in December over concerns about safeguarding the health of participants.
Separately, the Shangri-La Dialogue Asian security summit, which is to take place from June 4–5, plans to go ahead with the event. 
""IISS remains on track to convene the 19th Shangri-La Dialogue in person in Singapore in early June,"" the organiser, the International Institute for Strategic Studies said in a statement.
""The World Economic Forum’s decision does not affect our plans. We have a full line-up of ministers and other senior leaders from around the world planning to attend our event,"" said IISS.
In a statement, Singapore's defence ministry said it was ""encouraged by the positive response to invitations"" to the meeting. 
""Nevertheless, as the COVID-19 situation is fluid and continues to evolve in the run-up to the meeting, the Singapore government will continue to monitor the local and global COVID-19 situation and make the necessary adjustments."" 
Singapore has in recent days imposed some of the tightest restrictions since it exited a lockdown last year to combat a spike in local COVID-19 infections.
Acknowledging WEF's decision to cancel the event, the Singapore trade ministry said on Monday that it ""fully appreciates the challenges caused by the ongoing global pandemic, particularly for a large meeting with a broad span of international participants."" 
The WEF's next annual meeting will instead take place in the first half of 2022. Its location and date will be determined based on an assessment of the situation later this summer, it added in a statement.
Last year nearly 3,000 participants from 130 countries came to the WEF in Davos, which bills itself as a place for global leaders to work together to shape the global, regional and industrial agenda. Speakers last year included environmental activist Greta Thunberg and U.S. President Donald Trump.

Founder and Executive Chairman Klaus Schwab said the decision to cancel had been difficult, particularly as many people wanted to ""come together not just virtually but in person, and to contribute to a more resilient, more inclusive and more sustainable world,""
""But ultimately the health and safety of everyone concerned is our highest priority,"" he said.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Investment firm ValueAct liquidated its stake in  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and trimmed holdings in  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc and SLM (NASDAQ:SLM) Corp in early 2021, pointing to a shift away from some financial firms that it has owned for several years, a regulatory filing released on Monday showed.
ValueAct sold 8.2 million shares of U.S. bank Morgan Stanley stock during the first quarter, exiting the remainder of an investment it first told clients about in 2016. At that time ValueAct said it owned 38 million shares worth $1.1 billion.
At that time Morgan Stanley's stock traded around $30.55. At the end of the first quarter 2021 it was at $77.66. 
ValueAct in 2017 announced an investment in KKR. Mason Morfit, who is now ValueAct's chief executive officer and chief investment officer, said then that the stock price could climb to $37 a share. 
ValueAct cut its KKR holding by 16% during the first quarter, selling 6.4 million shares, the filing showed. The firm owned 31.6 million shares at the end of the quarter, and KKR's stock price closed at $55.44 on Monday.
The San Francisco-based investment firm also trimmed its holding in Citigroup, an investment it announced in late 2017. It cut its stake by 19% to 21.7 million shares at the end of the first quarter. Earlier this year, Jane Fraser succeeded Michael Corbat as Citi's CEO.
The firm cut its holding in SLM Corp, which it has owned since early 2018, by 18%, when it sold 6 million shares to own 26.3 million shares on March 31. 
The so-called 13F filings show the U.S. stock holdings of investment managers at the end of certain period. While the disclosures are backward looking, they are closely watched for clues about investment trends and what activist hedge funds might be planning next.

While ValueAct is considered an activist fund, it rarely makes public demands and prefers to make suggestions behind the scenes, often without having a board seat.
It took new stakes in Insight Enterprises (NASDAQ:NSIT), TopBuild (NYSE:BLD) Corp and OUTFRONT Media during the first quarter, the filing shows.

(Reuters) - Several investment firms purchased shares in ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) Inc, Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Inc, which made big market moves linked to the implosion of investment firm Archegos Capital Management, while others on Monday disclosed bets against retail-trading favorite  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME).
A number of investment managers bet on companies that plummeted when large banks sold them in a hurry amid the collapse of Archegos at the end March.
Other funds used the first quarter to take out put option positions, which are bearish bets, in GameStop. Gamestop was at the center of a battle earlier this year between retail investors who thought the ailing video retailer should trade higher and hedge funds like Melvin Capital, which bet that its stock would fall. 
Melvin Capital, which was badly hurt after holding bearish GameStop positions, did not disclose any put positions in its latest filing. Melvin's Gabriel Plotkin in February said he was wary about holding big short positions again. 
Regulatory filings show that Soros Fund Management and hedge funds HG Vora Capital Management and Coatue Management entered positions in media stock ViacomCBS Inc after disclosing no holdings in the previous quarter.
The so-called 13F filings do not disclose the date the purchase was made but give a snapshot of what U.S. stocks fund managers owned at the end of the quarter.
Archegos, a family office run by ex-Tiger Asia manager Bill Hwang, was highly exposed to ViacomCBS, leaving the firm to face a huge margin call from its prime broker banks, which in March were forced to sell large blocks of shares of ViacomCBS, media peer Discovery Inc and Chinese search giant Baidu. ViacomCBS plunged 57% in March while Discovery dropped 44% and Baidu fell 30%.
Soros Fund Management, founded by billionaire George Soros, bought $194 million in ViacomCBS shares according to its filing https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1029160/000090266421002758/xslForm13F_X01/infotable.xml, while HG Vora picked up $78.9 million and Philippe Laffont's Coatue Management purchased $77.1 million over the same period.
British hedge fund firm Rokos Capital Management, run by former Brevan Howard partner Chris Rokos, also purchased $167.8 million of Baidu stock in the first three months of the year, the filings showed.
Laurion Capital Management added $231.6 million in Baidu over the same period while Soros picked up $77 million and Hong Kong-based activist fund Oasis Management raised its bet in the company by 42% to $46.5 million.
Soros, currently led by Chief Investment Officer Dawn Fitzpatrick, and London-based hedge fund behemoth Marshall Wace both picked up more than 200,000 shares in Discovery after holding no position in the previous quarter.
Many of the investment funds did not hold shares in ViacomCBS, Baidu or Discovery in the previous quarter, showed the filings.
Several hedge funds also disclosed new put options on GameStop Corp over the same period, including Robert Citrone's Discovery Capital Management and Caxton Associates, which bets on macroeconomic events. 
Taconic Capital Advisors, Hunting Hill Global Capital and Hudson (NYSE:HUD) Bay Capital Management also took similar positions.

Put options, which give the holder the right to sell at a specified price, can be used as a way for a hedge fund to short a stock without using equity markets.
Melvin, which closed its GameStop position earlier in the year with a large loss, did not list the company as one of its positions in its latest filing.

237,By Reuters,"<span>May 17, 2021 07:31PM ET</span>","How a golf tournament led to the merger of Discovery, WarnerMedia","By Krystal Hu and Kenneth Li
(Reuters) -It all started with two friends commiserating.
Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Inc CEO David Zaslav emailed his counterpart at AT&T Inc (NYSE:T), John Stankey, on a Sunday afternoon in February to lament how the COVID-19 pandemic had led to them missing the AT&T Pebble Beach golf tournament in California, where the two friends had planned to meet. 
After reading Zaslav's email, which included emojis of a person playing golf and another one with sunglasses, Stankey got on the phone, and the pair spoke for two hours. 
The conversation turned to business. That led barely three months later to the announcement on Monday of a merger deal between Discovery and AT&T's WarnerMedia with an enterprise value of more than $120 billion.
This account of how the transaction came together is based on details from interviews with Stankey and Zaslav as well as from sources close to the deal.
WarnerMedia, which AT&T acquired for $108.7 billion in 2018, had become an albatross for Stankey, who came in as CEO last year. He wanted to reduce the strain on AT&T's finances. The company was investing heavily in the race for 5G phone services, including spending $23.4 billion in a wireless spectrum auction in February. 
Stankey felt that no matter how well WarnerMedia, which owns HBO, CNN and TNT, performed, its value would not be reflected in AT&T's share price. Investors still valued the company primarily as a wireless carrier.
Zaslav, on the other hand, wanted to double down in media. The rise of TV streaming had left Discovery, owner of lifestyle networks such as Food Network, TLC and OWN, competing against Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Zaslav believed Discovery needed scale and felt its $14.6 billion acquisition of  Scripps Networks Interactive  (NASDAQ:SNI) in 2018 was not enough. He flirted briefly with the idea of combining Discovery with Viacom and CBS, which was itself in the process of merging in 2019. But nothing materialized.
The Discovery and AT&T CEOs started talking regularly. The two had become acquainted through the industry and negotiated a deal in the early days of AT&T's ownership of DirecTV.
Stankey flew from Dallas, where AT&T is headquartered, to meet Zaslav at his Greenwich Village brownstone in New York City for negotiations, later joined by advisers.

AT&T stands to receive $43 billion in the tax-free spin-off of WarnerMedia, which will be merged with Discovery. 
Zaslav will lead the combined company, which will be 29% owned by Discovery shareholders.

The Endless Frontier Act would authorize most of the money, $100 billion, to invest in basic and advanced research, commercialization of the research, and education and training programs in key technology areas like artificial intelligence (AI). 
Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said the Senate will debate the bill for a week or two beginning on Tuesday.
""We can either have a world where the Chinese Communist Party determines the rules of the road for 5G, AI, and Quantum (NASDAQ:QMCO) Computing — or we can make sure the United States gets there first,"" Schumer said, calling it a ""once-in-a-generation investment in American science and American technology.""
The bill under consideration includes $2 billion to boost semiconductor production and research for the auto and defense sector, but a group of senators are also working on a measure to include $52 billion for chips, according to draft summary of a proposal.
Despite discussions throughout the weekend, no final agreement on funding chips provisions that were authorized in a defense bill adopted in January have been reached.
Other China related bills are likely to be included in a final package.
Schumer said the bill ""will fortify weak spots in our economy like semiconductors.""

The White House said Monday it supports the Endless Frontier bill that ""would authorize historic investments in critical science and engineering research, from artificial intelligence to advanced energy... It would strengthen scientific research and technology commercialization activities at academic institutions across the country.""
Republican Senator Steve Daines said he will introduce an amendment this week to include critical mineral production as part of a new program to help the United States remain globally competitive.

239,By Reuters,"<span>May 17, 2021 07:15PM ET</span>",California regulator reviews Tesla's self-driving claims,"BERKELEY, Calif. (Reuters) - A California regulator said on Monday it is reviewing whether Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc violated regulations by falsely promoting its advanced driver-assistance systems as being ""full self-driving.""
Tesla's driver assistant features, which it describes as ""Autopilot"" or ""full self-driving"" are under growing scrutiny following a series of accidents and online videos of Tesla cars driving with no one in the driver's seat. 
Tesla charges $10,000 for its semi-automated features such as lane changing and parking assistance under its full self-driving (FSD) software. 
Tesla says on its website that the features do not make the vehicle autonomous, but the term FSD is widely used by CEO Elon Musk who has over 50 million Twitter followers. 
Consumer Groups and experts have criticised Tesla for misleading consumers into believing that the car can drive by itself without providing an adequate driver monitoring system to prevent the system's misuse, contributing to fatal accidents. 
A Tesla car driver killed in a recent accident in California had praised the automaker's ""full self-driving"" features and posted videos of himself apparently driving with his hands off the wheel.
A 25-year-old man was also arrested earlier this month after driving a Tesla while in the backseat in the San Francisco Bay Area. 
The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) said in a statement it has ""the matter under review,"" referring to the regulation that ""prohibits a company from advertising vehicles for sale or lease as autonomous...""
A violation of the rule could lead to the suspension or the revocation of a manufacturer's occupational license, among other administrative actions, it added, without elaborating.

Tesla was not immediately available for comment.
""We call on Tesla to stop using hyperbolic terminology to sell its already impressive technology,"" Jason Levine, executive Director at Center For Auto Safety, told Reuters.

(Reuters) -Parler, a social media app popular with U.S. conservatives, returned to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s App Store on Monday, after the iPhone maker dropped it following the deadly Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.
Parler also named George Farmer, the company's chief operating officer since March, as its new chief executive and said interim CEO Mark Meckler would be leaving.
Apple said last month it would readmit Parler into its iOS App Store, after Parler proposed updates to its app and content moderation policies. 
""The entire Parler team has worked hard to address Apple's concerns without compromising our core mission,"" said Meckler in an emailed statement. 
""Anything allowed on the Parler network but not in the iOS app will remain accessible through our web-based and Android versions. This is a win-win for Parler, its users, and free speech.""
The Washington Post said Parler's Chief Policy Officer Amy Peikoff likened the iOS version of the app to a ""Parler Lite or Parler PG."" Parler is still pushing Apple to allow users to see hate speech behind a warning label, the newspaper reported.
Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Several tech companies cut ties with Parler after the Capitol riot, accusing the app backed by prominent Republican Party donor Rebekah Mercer of failing to police violent content on its service.
Parler went dark for about a month after Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) suspended web-hosting services. Parler returned online in February with Los Angeles-based private cloud infrastructure SkySilk. Amazon Web Services declined to comment on Monday. 
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google also removed Parler from its app store. 
""Parler has remained available on Android because of the openness of the platform even if it isn't currently distributed through Google Play,"" a Google spokesman said on Monday.

""As we stated back in January, Parler is welcome back in the Play store once it submits an app that complies with our content moderation policies, which preclude things like physical threats to individuals and inciting violence.""
Parler co-founder and CEO John Matze was fired by the board earlier this year. In an emailed statement Parler said new CEO Farmer had been an active financial supporter and candidate for UK's Brexit Party and ""remains actively involved in business and politics on both sides of the Atlantic.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stock indexes edged lower globally on Monday, with technology shares weighing the most on the benchmark U.S. S&P 500 index, while gold prices hit their highest in more than three months as investors sought safety. 
U.S. Treasury yields, however, traded little changed even after a report showing the highest prices ever paid in a May manufacturing survey for New York State.
The Empire State Manufacturing Survey, produced by the New York Fed, showed the prices paid index rose to a record 83.5, the highest since the data series began in 2001, said Tom Simons, money market economist at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) & Co. 
The S&P 500 technology sector was down 0.7% and the biggest drag on the benchmark index. Wall Street's declines also follow the S&P 500's biggest one-day jump in more than a month on Friday.
While the week is expected to be relatively quiet for economic data, investors will be anxious to see minutes on Wednesday from the Federal Reserve's policy meeting last month, which could shed more light on the policymakers' outlook on an economic rebound.
""The Fed has been pretty consistent in its message that it's going to be quite tolerant of inflation, it's not going to cause them to raise rates prematurely or pull back on asset purchases,"" Simons said.
The spread of the coronavirus was also a drag in some markets, with Singapore reporting the highest number of local infections in months and Taiwan seeing a spike in cases.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 54.34 points, or 0.16%, to 34,327.79, the S&P 500 lost 10.56 points, or 0.25%, to 4,163.29 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 50.93 points, or 0.38%, to 13,379.05.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.05% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.09%.
In the Treasury market, the yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes was near flat at 1.65%, well below a spike to 1.77% in late March.
The dollar weakened slightly as inflation worries supported riskier currencies at the greenback's expense.
The dollar index fell 0.082%, with the euro unchanged at $1.2151.
Bitcoin dropped to a three-month low after Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc boss Elon Musk suggested over the weekend that the electric automaker may have already sold some of its holdings in the digital currency. 

Oil prices climbed. Brent crude rose 1.1% to settle at $69.46 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude gained 1.4% to settle at $66.27.
Spot gold jumped 1.3% to $1,866.84 per ounce, after hitting its highest since Feb. 1 at $1,868.26.

(Reuters) - Wall Street ended lower on Monday, weighed down by tech shares as signs of growing inflation worried investors about the potential for tighter monetary policy.
Of the 11 major S&P sectors that declined, technology, utilities and communication services were the biggest losers, each down between 0.7% and 0.9%.
""What is causing the decline, no surprise to anybody, is the worry about inflation and interest rates,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York.
""As a result that's causing the growth group, in particular technology and consumer discretionary stocks, to experience weakness, while some of the more value-oriented groups are holding up a bit better.""
The S&P 500 scored its biggest one-day jump in more than a month on Friday as investors picked up beaten-down stocks following a pullback earlier in the week on worries about inflation and a sooner-than-expected tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 56.12 points, or 0.16%, to 34,326.01; the S&P 500 lost 10.42 points, or 0.25%, at 4,163.43; and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 50.93 points, or 0.38%, to 13,379.05.
Earnings this week will be scrutinized for clues on whether rising prices had any impact on consumer demand and if retailers can sustain their strong earnings momentum.
Cryptocurrency-related stocks like Marathon Digital, Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT) and Coinbase fell between 3% and 7% as bitcoin swung in volatile trading after Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc boss Elon Musk tweeted about the carmaker's bitcoin holdings.
With the earnings season at its tail end, overall earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to have climbed 50.6% from a year ago, according to Refinitiv IBES, the strongest pace in 11 years.
AT&T Inc (NYSE:T), owner of HBO and Warner Bros studios, and Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Inc, home to lifestyle TV networks such as HGTV and TLC, said on Monday they will combine their content assets to create a standalone global entertainment and media business. AT&T shares declined 2.69%, while Discovery fell about 5.04%.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.8 billion shares, compared with the 10.5 billion average over the last 20 trading days.
On the Nasdaq 100 the largest gainer was Trip.Com Group Ltd, which rose 3.8%, while the largest decliner was Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA), down 5.5%.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.13-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.06-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 38 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 110 new highs and 63 new lows.

243,By Reuters,"<span>May 17, 2021 06:43PM ET</span>","Buffett's Berkshire buys Aon, slashes Chevron and Wells Fargo","By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) -Berkshire Hathaway Inc said on Monday it has taken a $943 million stake in insurance brokerage Aon (NYSE:AON) Plc and sold large portions of its investments in  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co.
The changes were disclosed in a regulatory filing detailing Berkshire's U.S.-listed holdings as of March 31.
Berkshire also shed two smaller holdings entirely, Canada's Suncor Energy (NYSE:SU) Inc and private label credit card issuer Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) Inc.
The sales suggest that Buffett and his investment managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler may be growing more wary of valuations as stocks regularly set new highs.
Berkshire sold $6.45 billion of equities and bought just $2.57 billion in the quarter. It ended March with a near-record $145.4 billion of cash and equivalents.
Buffett is ""likely shoring up reserves"" for a major acquisition, said Doug Kass, a principal at Seabreeze Partners Management LLC in Palm Beach, Florida. ""He is clearly in no rush and is sitting on his hands, awaiting the right pitch.""
At Berkshire's May 1 annual meeting, Buffett said his Omaha, Nebraska-based company would like to spend $70 billion or $80 billion, but would probably not get a chance until the market offered better values.
Berkshire did not immediately respond to a request for comment to Buffett's assistant.
The Aon investment extends Berkshire's bet on insurance brokerages, including a stake in Marsh & McLennan Cos that it boosted in the first quarter.
Aon is awaiting regulatory approvals to buy Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WLTW) Plc for about $30 billion and create the world's largest insurance brokerage, ahead of Marsh.
Berkshire has long been known for its insurance holdings, which are overseen by Vice Chairman Ajit Jain, and include Geico auto insurance, General Re reinsurance, and a unit that insures against major and unusual risks.
The sale of 51% of Berkshire's stake in Chevron represented an unusual reversal. Berkshire had disclosed a new $4 billion stake only in February, and Buffett even said at the annual meeting that the oil company benefited society.
""I have no compunction ... in the least about owning Chevron,"" Buffett said. ""And if we own the entire business, I would not feel uncomfortable about being in that business.""

Less surprising was Berkshire's revelation that it owned just $26.4 million of Wells Fargo stock, down from $1.58 billion in December and about $32 billion in early 2018.
Buffett was displeased with the bank's response to address a series of scandals over how its employees treated customers. Berkshire has owned Wells Fargo since 1989.

However, a global semiconductor chip shortage and overvaluation concerns have caused EV stocks to retreat this year. This, along with the rising competition in the EV space, makes us think the near-term growth prospects are bleak for prominent EV players Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and NIO (NIO). Read on.
The global electric vehicle (EV) industry moved steadily into the spotlight in recent years with significant government initiatives worldwide. And although the industry has significant growth potential over the long term, there are a few short-term challenges before it.
The ongoing global semiconductor chip shortage has significantly hampered the production lines of many established players in this space. Furthermore, because the EV space is getting crowded with new entrants, many dominant players are losing market share.
These factors, along with overvaluation concerns, are motivating some investors to rotate away from EV stocks. This is evident in the Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF’s (DRIV) 6.5% loss over the past three months. Shares of leading EV players Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) and NIO Inc. (NIO) tumbled more than 7% last week. And we think the condition of the industry currently may lead to further decline in these stocks in the near term.

Though the pace of increase in users could be a little slower this year, with people beginning to again view outdoor activities as an entertainment option (at the expense of video games), this trend is expected to benefit the video game companies. As such, we think Both Roblox (RBLX) and Playtika (PLTK) are well-positioned to capitalize on the industry tailwinds. But let’s find out which of these stocks is a better buy now.Roblox Corporation (RBLX) develops and operates an online entertainment platform internationally. It offers Roblox Client, an application that allows users to explore 3D digital worlds, Roblox Studio, a toolset that allows developers and creators to build, publish, and operate 3D experiences and other content, and Roblox Cloud, a solution that provides services and infrastructure to power the human co-experience platform.
Playtika Holding Corporation (PLTK) is an Israel-based digital entertainment company that develops and publishes mobile games worldwide. The company distributes its games to customers through various web and mobile platforms and its own proprietary platforms.
The video games and virtual entertainment industry saw a huge increase in demand driven by the remote lifestyle compelled by the pandemic. The surge in daily active users over the last year incentivized companies to develop new and interesting video games. Also, the huge success of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Corporation’s (MSFT) Xbox Series X/S and  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Corporation’s (SONY) PlayStation 5 last year motivated video game companies to focus on launching next-generation video game consoles. Though the economy's reopening could draw some investor attention away from video games, because many people are expected to resume outdoor activities the industry is expected to witness continued growth, even if at a slower pace. The global video game industry is expected to generate $207.60 billion revenue by 2025.

He advocates holding stocks for a prolonged period rather than trading on short-term fluctuations. His popular holdings Apple (AAPL), Goldman Sachs (GS), DaVita (NYSE:DVA), and Axalta Coating (AXTA) helped Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) “break” the maximum price set on Nasdaq exchange’s computers earlier this month. So, how can we not take a closer look?.The world’s most admired investor, Warren Buffet, made headlines as the price of class A shares of his holding company Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) crossed the algorithmic limit of $424,840 on May 5. BRK.A continued to rally to hit its $445,000 all-time high on May 7, making it the most expensive stock to date. BRK.A has gained 25.2% year-to-date, surpassing the broader S&P 500 index’s 10.8% returns over this period.
With a net worth of $109.90 billion, Buffett is one of the most successful investors of all time and is known for his fundamental value investing strategy. He preaches a long-term investing strategy in which investors should commit to holding a stock for extended periods, despite “investment noise” that may cause short-term fluctuations.
With rising inflation and the Treasury yields, the stock markets look less attractive now. The “Buffett indicator,” which is the Wilshire 5000 index to GDP, grew more than 25% from its all-time high in 2000 (during the dot-com bubble) in March this year. Despite the broader market overvaluation, Buffett is betting on several stocks from multiple industries that possess significant upside potential, backed by sound financials and industry tailwinds. Thus, we think Warren Buffett’s all-time favorite stocks—Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), The  Goldman Sachs Group , Inc. (NYSE:GS),  DaVita Inc . (DVA) and  Axalta Coating Systems Ltd . (NYSE:AXTA) — could be solid bets now.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The New York attorney general’s office is preparing an insider-trading lawsuit against Eastman Kodak Co and its top executive, focusing on stock purchases that preceded an ill-fated deal with the Trump administration to finance a pharmaceutical venture during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the company and people familiar with the matter.
The emerging civil case centers on Executive Chairman Jim Continenza’s June 23, 2020, purchase of nearly 47,000 Kodak shares, Kodak said in a quarterly Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Monday. Continenza, the company chairman starting in September 2013 and executive chairman since February 2019, took on the additional role of CEO in July 2020.
The trades occurred weeks before the Trump administration unveiled a tentative agreement to lend the company $765 million backing production of pharmaceutical components for help fighting the pandemic. Kodak’s stock experienced a roller coaster following the late-July announcement, skyrocketing more than 1,000% before falling.
A spokesman for New York Attorney General Letitia James had no immediate comment.
The investigators are seizing on Continenza’s alleged knowledge of material nonpublic information surrounding negotiations for the government loan when he purchased Kodak shares, according to the company and people familiar with the matter.
In a statement provided to Reuters, Kodak said Continenza did not possess material nonpublic information when he purchased his shares and ""did not engage in insider trading."" Kodak declined to make Continenza available for comment.
Kodak pointed to an investigation conducted by its outside law firm, which found Continenza’s purchases were approved by the company's general counsel. The purchases, made at a weighted average price of $2.22 per share, were in compliance with Kodak’s insider-trading policies and did not violate securities regulations or other relevant laws, the review found.
Continenza has also regularly purchased stock during internally approved time windows, which included the June 2020 trades, and has never sold his shares, the company said.
STOCK SOARS 
Kodak, a former blue-chip photography pioneer that failed to keep pace with the digital revolution, emerged from bankruptcy proceedings in 2013 and has faced financial challenges.
Its shares closed around $2.62 July 27, the day before the government announced it had signed a letter of interest to provide the loan. By July 29, they had soared as high as $60 before closing at $33.20. Investigations from congressional committees and securities regulators ensued. 
The company's stock tumbled over the next several days and the Trump administration halted Kodak’s loan application process amid the frenzy. Kodak has since said it does not expect the loan. 
The investigation conducted by the outside law firm, Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP, found Continenza viewed Kodak’s chances of receiving the loan as uncertain when he bought shares. 
Kodak's general counsel, Roger Byrd, shared that view and believed market reaction to the company taking on such a large amount of debt was difficult to predict, leading him to conclude Continenza did not possess material nonpublic information, the Akin Gump review found. Kodak declined to make Byrd available for comment.
Investigators have built their case under the Martin Act, Kodak's filing said. The state law empowers the attorney general to investigate and bring financial fraud cases without proving intent or knowledge of wrongdoing.
Officials in the New York attorney general’s office have emphasized that legal leeway in their probe, the company said. Kodak views legal precedents as requiring a breach of fiduciary duty to prove insider trading, which can’t exist without intent or knowledge of wrongdoing on the trader’s part.
Kodak, in its statement, called the attorney general’s approach a ""novel application of insider trading law that seeks to impose liability in the absence of evidence of intent."" The Rochester, New York-based company said the contemplated lawsuit would discourage executives from investing in good faith alongside other shareholders due to fear that trades approved by internal lawyers could be second-guessed as unlawful.
In April 2020, Kodak held an initial discussion with White House officials including trade adviser Peter Navarro about leveraging its longstanding and lesser-known chemicals business to produce pharmaceutical ingredients that can be sold to drugmakers.
In May 2020, then-President Donald Trump signed an executive order authorizing the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) under the Defense Production Act to lend money supporting domestic production and supply chains to help combat the pandemic.
Kodak was soon steered to the DFC, an agency that typically provides money to the developing world. But the Akin Gump review found that Kodak executives, including Continenza, became pessimistic about obtaining financing when a follow-up call with Navarro was canceled and a less senior DFC official became Kodak's main contact.

Nevertheless, the DFC, after some due diligence, decided to enter into a nonbinding letter of interest with the company regarding the loan, which it announced the morning of July 28. Kodak’s stock rose. Trump called the tentative deal a ""breakthrough"" that evening, and Kodak’s shares soared the following day. 
The DFC halted the loan application process amid scrutiny of trading surrounding the announcement.

(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc has sold nearly all of its holdings in  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co, as Warren Buffett abandoned a more than 31-year-old investment that had been among his most successful before the bank was felled by scandals for mistreating customers. In a regulatory filing on Monday, Berkshire said it owned just $26.4 million of shares in the fourth-largest U.S. bank as of March 31, down from around $32 billion in January 2018.Berkshire began investing in San Francisco-based Wells Fargo in 1989, and spent at least $12.7 billion on its shares, building a 10% stake.The bank's reputation was shattered by revelations that employees facing aggressive sales goals opened millions of unwanted accounts, charged unnecessary mortgage fees and forced drivers to buy car insurance they did not need. The conduct grew out of Wells Fargo's longstanding strategy of selling more products per customer, or cross-selling. Buffett, who is Berkshire's chief executive, told CNBC in February 2020 that Wells Fargo had a ""dumb"" incentive system and was slow to make things right. ""The big thing is they ignored it when they found out about it,"" he said. ""You absolutely have to attack a problem as soon as it occurs, and you know about it. And if that had happened, Wells Fargo shareholders would be a lot better off."" 
Berkshire, based in Omaha, Nebraska, still owns shares of other banks, including Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), its largest common stock holding other than Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).Wells Fargo paid $3 billion in February 2020 to settle criminal and civil probes.

Last November, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged two former top Wells Fargo executives with misleading investors about its financial results. Wells Fargo remains under a February 2018 Federal Reserve directive barring asset growth until it makes sufficient improvements.
Shares of Wells Fargo closed Monday up 94 cents at $47.90. Although the price has more than doubled since October, it is 28% below its January 2018 peak.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A number of well-known U.S. hedge funds bought value stocks and blank-check acquisition companies, selling some winners from the technology-led stock rally as bond yields rose during the first quarter, filings released on Monday showed. 
Special-purpose acquisition companies, known as SPACs, proved popular among hedge fund managers, with funds such as Third Point (NYSE:SPNT) and Saschem Head adding shares of SPACs, including FinTech Acquisition Corp V and healthcare company Orion Acquisition Corp to their portfolios. 
Tiger Global added shares of Revolution Healthcare Acquisition Corp and Soaring Eagle Acquistion Corp and trimmed its position in  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). 
Activist investor Starboard Value invested in a string of other so-called SPACS that exist to buy private companies and take them public, including Montes Archimedes Acquisition Corp, Altimar Acquisition Corp, Churchill Capital Corp II and Forest Road Acquisition Corp. 
Over 400 SPACs have listed their shares since the start of 2021, though the majority are underperforming the broad stock market, a Reuters analysis https://www.reuters.com/business/spac-returns-trail-sp-500-retail-investors-temper-interest-2021-05-04showed. 
At the same time, several hedge funds added to financial, energy and consumer companies. Third Point added a new position in  Carvana  Co (NYSE:CVNA) and Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc, while Epoch Investment Partners added new positions in energy firms such as  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM),  Pioneer Natural Resources  (NYSE:PXD) Co and Diamondback (NASDAQ:FANG) Energy Inc. 
Billionaire Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates, the largest hedge fund manager in the world, added a new position in General Motors (NYSE:GM) Corp,  Ecolab Inc  (NYSE:ECL) and  Johnson Controls  (NYSE:JCI) International PLC while selling out of its position in media companies, including the New York Times Co, News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) and Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA). 
The moves into stocks that benefit from a broadly growing economy came during a quarter in which so-called value stocks - in industries such as financials and materials that rise on economic growth - surged and interest rates rose as investors positioned for a reopening of the global economy after the coronavirus pandemic. 
The Russell 1000 Value index, for instance, is up 17% for the year to date, while the Russell 1000 Growth index - which is top-loaded with shares of technology companies like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) that surged during the economic lockdowns - is up 3.5% over the same time. 
Bond yields, meanwhile, rose to reflect rising inflation expectations, increasing borrowing costs for consumers and companies. Consumer prices rose in April by the largest measure in 12 years, prompting some mutual fund managers to increase their cash positions and turn more defensive.
Hedge fund managers' positions were revealed in 13F filings that show what fund managers owned at the end of the quarter. While they are backward-looking, these filings are one of the few public disclosures of hedge fund portfolios and are closely watched for clues on trends and what stocks certain fund managers are favoring.

Rising demand for food commodities from China, primarily, is expected to drive food prices even higher. To meet this demand will require an increase in supply. And as the demand for agricultural equipment to boost food production rises, we think the stocks of Deere & Company (NYSE:DE), Mosaic (MOS), and AGCO Corporation (AGCO) will benefit significantly.Food prices have been rising at an accelerated rate since the beginning of this year, due primarily to crop failures in China and a consequent increase in demand for agricultural commodities from the world’s largest consumption-driven economy. This, together with rising raw material costs and global supply chain disruptions, has resulted in a 2.4% year-over-year rise in food prices, as of April 2021, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The rising demand for agricultural commodities requires an equivalent rise in supply to stabilize prices. Rising prices will no doubt incentivize agricultural companies to produce more. Consequently, the global agricultural equipment market is expected to grow at a 5.6% CAGR over the next three years to hit $265.90 billion by 2025.
Given this backdrop, we think the of stocks agricultural equipment and supply companies Deere & Company (DE), The  Mosaic Company  (NYSE:MOS), and AGCO Corporation (AGCO) should continue advancing in the coming months.

TAIPEI (Reuters) -Much-needed COVID-19 vaccines should be coming to Taiwan soon, the GAVI Vaccine Alliance said on Monday, as the chip-producing island's limited supplies run short during a spike in cases that has left the government scrambling for supplies.
A surge of coronavirus infections in Taiwan, one of the world's COVID-19 mitigation success stories, has led to its stock of 300,000 doses rapidly running out, with only about 1% of its 23 million people vaccinated.
Taiwan has been a model of how to control the pandemic but over the past week has reported more than 700 domestic cases, out of a total of 2,017 infections recorded in all, triggering panic buying at supermarkets as the government tightened curbs.
The GAVI Vaccine Alliance, which with the World Health Organization is jointly running the COVAX scheme to provide doses to countries that may have difficulties obtaining them, said more AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) vaccines were coming to Taiwan. 
COVAX expects Taiwan should receive allocated doses by the end of June at the latest, the alliance said in a statement to Reuters.
""The target remains to have 76 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine from AZ delivered between February and June to supply up to 80 countries and we expect next tranches of deliveries of vaccines to Taiwan soon,"" it said.
Taiwan has ordered 20 million vaccine doses, mostly from AstraZeneca Plc but also from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc, though global shortages have curtailed supplies.
Taiwan has said it expects to get more than 1 million AstraZeneca shots via COVAX.

U.S. President Joe Biden announced on Monday he will send at least 20 million COVID-19 vaccine doses to other countries by the end of June, marking the first time the United States is sharing vaccines authorized for domestic use.
Biden announced he will send doses of the  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) PFE.N/BioNTech SE, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) vaccines, on top of 60 million AstraZeneca doses he had already planned to give to other countries.
The White House has not said which countries will receive the shots and the U.S. State Department did not respond when asked what specific assistance was being offered to Taiwan, which counts Washington as its most important security ally. 
Taiwan only has AstraZeneca vaccines and last week health authorities stopped giving shots to people who are not on priority lists that include the elderly and medical staff. 
AstraZeneca said that through the COVAX facility it was committed to broad and equitable access to the vaccine, including to supply Taiwan.
Moderna did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Taiwan Health Minister Chen Shih-chung told reporters there was ""no new progress"" to report on the arrival of more vaccines but that lots more would gradually be coming. He gave no details.
CHIP MAKER
The opposition Kuomintang party has called for the world to ensure that the island, a major semiconductor maker, gets priority help.
""Taiwan's pandemic is related to the stability of the global electronic product supply chain,"" party chairman Johnny Chiang said on Sunday.
A further concern for the government has been China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory and has a deep antipathy towards its democratically elected leaders.
China has been shipping its domestically developed vaccines around the world and has offered them to Taiwan via COVAX, but Taiwanese law does not permit the use of Chinese vaccines.
A security official watching Chinese activity in Taiwan told Reuters the Taipei government believed Beijing was engaged in ""cognitive warfare"" to ""create chaos"" and undermine public trust in how the pandemic is being handled.

""They are trying to highlight the efficacy of the Chinese vaccines and how the government is blindly pinning its hopes on vaccines from the United States and home-made vaccines.""
China's Taiwan Affairs Office told Reuters ""most"" Taiwanese hoped they could access Chinese vaccines, and called on Taiwan to remove ""political obstacles.""

Investing.com -- Stocks wobbled on Monday as good news on vaccine rollouts and reopenings across the U.S. blunted concerns about interest rates.
Energy stocks helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average overcome losses on the tech side, while oil prices climbed even after the Colonial Pipeline said it was back online. This is a big week for retail earnings, with Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) kicking things off.
President Joe Biden announced the U.S. would ship 80 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine abroad, including 60 million doses of AstraZeneca PLC (LON:AZN)’s vaccine that still awaits approval. Some 20 million doses of  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE),  Moderna  Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) vaccines will be sent by the end of June.
New York’s Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced the state would lift the mask mandate as of Wednesday.
The Federal Reserve will release the minutes of its latest meeting on Wednesday, and investors will be waiting to see what they say about inflation expectations.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Walmart earnings
Walmart kicks off a week of retail earnings. Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect profit of $1.21 a share on revenue of $132.2 billion. Analysts will be watching for trends in its membership service, Walmart+, what effect stimulus checks had on sales, and what the outlook for sales is given rising consumer prices.
2.  Home Depot  earnings
Home Depot Inc (NYSE:HD)is seen reporting earnings of $3.06 a share on revenue of $34.6 billion. The home improvement retailer had a booming year during the pandemic as people took to do-it-yourself projects and as moved houses. Analysts will be listening for the outlook, especially given the red-hot housing market. 
3. Macy's earnings
Macy’s Inc (NYSE:M) is expected to report a loss of 39 cents a share on revenue of $4.3 billion, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com. Department stores and malls were forced to shut for much of last year but have been able to reopen to shoppers in the last few months, so analysts will be listening to hear whether the company’s executives think the worst is behind them.

While some energy stocks are expected to continue riding a wave created by rising oil prices, the initiatives of governments worldwide to transition to an emissions-free future make the prospects bleak for many energy companies. China Petroleum (NYSE:SNP) & Chemical Corporation (SNP) and  Exxon Mobil  (XOM) are uniquely positioned to deliver substantial returns in the coming months. However, we think ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG) may not be able to capitalize on the industry’s recovery and could witness a share-price pullback. Let’s pore over these companies.The continued easing of pandemic-induced restrictions has been leading a reopening of industrial activities and, thus, driving rising energy consumption this year. According to the EIA, the global consumption of petroleum and liquid fuels will average 97.7 million b/d for all 2021, which is a 5.4 million b/d increase from 2020. Furthermore, the global oil and gas EPC market is expected to chart a 5% CAGR from 2019 to 2027.
Investors’ increased optimism about the industry’s growth prospects is evident in the Vanguard Energy ETF’s (VDE) 56% returns over the past year, compared to SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust’s (SPY) 45.5% gains over this period.
However, increased federal scrutiny of energy companies’ efforts to transition to solar and wind, coupled with the further tightening of policies and rising carbon taxes, could mar the industry’s growth. While energy companies China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation (SNP) and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) are well positioned to weather these challenges and capitalize on secular tailwinds, we think ConocoPhillips (COP) and EOG Resources, Inc.

In fact, the recent, infamous Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack starkly highlighted the importance of advanced cybersecurity services. Investors’ interest in the cybersecurity sector is evident in the First Trust NASDAQ Cybersecurity ETF’s (CIBR) 17.3% returns over the past six months versus the tech-heavy Nasdaq's 12.6% returns.
Of late, investors have been rotating out of tech stocks into cyclical stocks to take advantage of the economic recovery. Rising inflation has also been a major concern for investors as they drop expensive tech stocks. However, cybersecurity companies’ products and solutions are expected to be high in demand going forward.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -Harley-Davidson Inc's shares soared to their highest level in over three years on Monday after the European Union decided to suspend a planned increase in retaliatory tariffs on the company's motorcycles as part of a partial trade truce with the United States.
The EU had threatened to double the tariffs on Harley motorcycles, American-made whiskey and power boats to 50% on June 1 in retaliation for steel and aluminum tariffs imposed by former President Donald Trump.
The European Commission, which oversees EU trade policy, said on Monday it would suspend the planned hike of retaliatory tariffs for up to six months.
Harley's shares gained 8.5% on Monday to $51.73, their highest level since January 2018.
While the company welcomed the truce, it plans to continue legal challenges to an EU ruling that revoked a concession allowing it to ship bikes from facilities outside the United States at a tariff rate of 6%.
""This is the first step in the right direction in a dispute not of our making,"" said Chief Executive Jochen Zeitz. ""Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) employees, dealers, stakeholders and motorcycles have no place in this trade war.""
Harley's bikes are now subjected to a 25% retaliatory tariff, increasing the overall duty on its bikes shipped to the European Union to 31%.
The Milwaukee-based company is betting heavily on Europe, its second-largest market after the United States, to help fuel its turnaround strategy. But higher tariffs would give its rivals including Triumph, Honda and Suzuki a massive pricing advantage.

The 118-year-old American brand had tried to escape the punitive measure by shifting the production of motorcycles for European markets to Thailand from the United States - a move that prompted Trump to back a boycott of the motorcycle manufacturer.
However, the EU last month ruled that its bikes produced in Thailand would be treated as U.S.-made.

PARIS (Reuters) - French food group Danone said on Monday it had picked outgoing Barry Callebaut boss Antoine de Saint-Affrique as its new chief executive to lead a turnaround.
Saint-Affrique had announced on April 22 he was stepping down as CEO of Swiss chocolate maker Barry Callebaut at the end of August, fuelling speculation he could be headed for the top job at Danone..
The appointment at Danone will be effective Sept. 15.
Danone had been looking to replace Emmanuel Faber, who was ousted in March following calls from activist shareholders to replace him after the group's sales growth and share price performance became sluggish compared with those of rivals.
Chairman Gilles Schnepp said in a statement released after a meeting of the board that Saint-Affrique brought ""the right blend of strategic vision, international consumer goods experience, and operational execution skills to Danone.""
Several people close to the matter had previously told Reuters that Saint-Affrique was one of the people in the running for CEO, and one had said he was the front-runner for the job.
Saint-Affrique, 56, joins Danone after spending nearly six years at the helm of Barry Callebaut and about 15 years in senior positions at Unilever (NYSE:UL), where he notably led the foods division.
Since he took the reins in October 2015, Barry Callebaut's share price has more than doubled. Group sales rose by 17% and profit by more than two-thirds before the pandemic hit in 2020.
""His focus on so called smart growth – profitable, cash-generative growth with improving returns and focus on sustainability – probably did a lot to change the perception of Barry Callebaut from a volume-driven commodity supplier to a specialty ingredients company. I would expect him to bring the same discipline to his next role,"" KeplerCheuvreux analyst Jon Cox said. 
""Antoine’s proven ability to successfully deliver a purpose-led growth strategy in a sustainable way fits well with our mission and long-term goals,"" Schnepp said.
CHALLENGES
Saint-Affrique's main challenge at the helm of the world's largest yoghurt maker will be to boost lagging profit margins and sales.
Activist investors have called for more investment behind innovation and for Danone to sell its less profitable brands.
Schnepp said that Saint-Affrique ""will have all the room and resources a CEO can have to best assess and direct Danone's strategy for the future""
But the new boss may have limited room to chart a new path as Danone's board has already committed to back some of the changes set in motion by Faber.

These changes notably entail reorganising Danone around regional hubs rather than brands, alongside a broader drive to cut costs and axe 2,000 jobs.
Danone shares have gained 7% so far this year, outperforming their European sector and supported by speculation around activist intervention. This followed a 27% fall last year.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Monday began its formal defense in an antitrust trial brought by ""Fortnite"" online game creator Epic Games, by calling its App Store chief Phil Schiller to the stand.
Schiller, who has spent three decades at the iPhone maker, is expected to spend more than 10 hours on the witness stand in federal court in Oakland, California, rebutting Epic's allegations that Apple has monopoly over mobile developers that it abuses by requiring them to use its in-app payments system and pay commissions.
Over the past two weeks, Epic's executives and expert witnesses argued that Apple has such a strong lock on customers that the world's more than 1 billion iPhone owners constitute their own separate market over which Apple exercises strict control. Apple and its experts have framed it differently, arguing that Epic's complaints are related to video game transactions, a market where Apple charges a similar commission to  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Xbox and  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Group Corp's Playstion.
But as the trial enters its final week, Schiller is shifting to the second layer of Apple's defense: That the controls it imposes on developers are necessary to make the iPhone more private and secure, which has in turn built consumer trust and expanded the market for mobile apps. 
Legal experts say that is important because even if Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers (NYSE:ROG) finds that some of Apple's rules have anticompetitive effects, she could rule that those effects are outweighed by benefits to consumers overall.

On the stand on Monday, Schiller testified that the iPhone originally did not come with any third-party apps because Apple executives felt they had no time to create a secure system for third-party developers to write them. But once the phone went on sale, developers soon started ""jailbreaking"" devices to put software on them, and Apple rushed to create a formal system, which later became the App Store, for third-party software. 
""We were very concerned this could create unreliable, unstable devices,"" Schiller said of the jailbreaking phenomenon.

Investing.com – AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), GameStop (NYSE:GME) and Koss (NASDAQ:KOSS) all rose Monday amid indications that retail investors and the big institutional guys may be renewing their battle.
#AMCSqueeze is among the top Twitter trends on Monday, an indication that it may again be experiencing a short squeeze, sending the shares higher.
AMC and GameStop were both up around 6% while Koss was up 1% percent. If the session goes as it has so far for AMC, it would be the seventh consecutive day of gains for the stock.
Last week, AMC wrapped up raising $428 million in fresh equity. The company raised that money before commissions and fees at an average price of $9.94 per share.
AMC crossed $14 today earlier during the session, fired up on hopes that people will flock to its multiplex screens as movies are released in theaters after more than a year.
GameStop, the favorite of the retail investors last five months, may be trading 64% off its year’s high but it’s still some 127 times the 52-week low. Its efforts at reinventing itself into an online retailer is keeping some believers still glued.

268,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 17, 2021 01:36PM ET</span>","U.S. Banks Could Shed 200,000 Jobs in Decade in Efficiency Drive","(Bloomberg) -- U.S. banks could cut as many as 200,000 jobs in the next decade as they try to boost efficiency to compete with fintech and other upstarts encroaching on their territory, according to  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co.
The eliminations are likely to accelerate as the economy reopens following the Covid-19 pandemic and conditions normalize, Wells Fargo analysts led by Mike Mayo said in a note, adding that “this will be the biggest reduction in U.S. bank headcount in history.” Banks have little choice but to improve productivity in the face of stiffening competition from fintech, technology and retail firms, he said.
Non-banks offering lower-cost products online have steadily chipped away at the businesses of traditional lenders, with efforts intensifying over the past year as the pandemic pushed consumers to digital options. Earlier this year, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. lured a pair of senior  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). bankers to run its fledgling fintech startup -- a move that struck fear on Wall Street. Mainstream lenders have pleaded with regulators to halt efforts by retailers and startups to offer core banking products.
“Technology is impacting banking more than even before,” Mayo said in an interview. “For banks, technology is both friend and foe.”
Goliath Winning
The moves will ultimately improve productivity as banks become leaner with less layers of management, Mayo said. That’ll enable them to keep up with competitors, in a capital-for-labor swap that leads to 100,000 to 200,000 reductions over the decade.
“Goliath is winning,” Mayo said. “The largest banks have more scale to deploy greater amounts of technology to better serve customers while becoming more efficient.”
Branches will likely continue to close, with many shuttered by the pandemic unlikely to reopen. Employment per branch will also probably fall amid more self-service options, Mayo said. While the pandemic increased headcount by about 2% as banks took care of employees and pledged not to eliminate jobs, that short-term trend is likely to reverse, he said.
Mayo said that the push for greater efficiency could end up forcing a smaller share of staff to shoulder more of the workload as the distance between the lowest-level employee and top executives shrinks.
“What you’re seeing is flatter organizational structures with de-pyramiding, greater scope of responsibility and more expectations that each employee will generate either more revenues or greater efficiency,” Mayo said.

We think that because the housing market remains hot, with low inventory and rising prices, it could be beneficial to bet now on fundamentally-sound homebuilding stocks  Lennar  (LEN), PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM), Tri Pointe (NYSE:TPH), and Century Communities (NYSE:CCS). Read on.The housing market has remained red hot amid the COVID-19 pandemic thanks to a near-zero interest-rate environment and a rising demand for bigger and better living spaces in suburban areas to make living and remote working more practical and comfortable. Because the work-from-home trend is expected to continue even in the post-pandemic world--given its benefits for employees and employers--the demand for new houses is not expected to decline any time soon.
The NAHB housing market index in the United States edged up 1 point to 83 in April 2021. The demand for single-family houses has increased significantly. According to the Census Bureau, the sale of new single-family houses increased to its peak since 2006 in March to a seasonally adjusted 1.021 million annual rate, up 21% from February 2021. Given the favorable industry backdrop, investors are rewarding homebuilding stocks, as evidenced by the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF’s (XHB) 16.8% gains over the past three months compared to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust’s (SPY) 6.1% returns.
So, we think it could be wise to bet on established homebuilding companies Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), PulteGroup, Inc. (PHM), Tri Pointe Homes , Inc. (TPH), and Century Communities, Inc. (CCS). We believe they are well positioned to capitalize on the industry tailwinds.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund has increased its U.S. stock holdings to $15.4 billion in the first quarter from nearly $12.8 billion at the end of 2020, according to a U.S. regulatory filing on Monday.
The Public Investment Fund (PIF) bought 2.9 million class A shares in SoftBank Group Corp-backed Coupang Inc, equivalent to $141 million, and dissolved its share stake in Suncor Energy (NYSE:SU), according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.
It more than doubled its position in Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) to 33.4 million shares from 15 million shares at the end of the fourth quarter, which led it to a $3.1 billion exposure from $1.4 billion. 
The fund increased its shares in  Electronic Arts Inc  (NASDAQ:EA) to 14.2 million, equivalent to $1.9 billion, from a $1.1 billion position at the end of the previous quarter.
PIF, which did not immediately respond to a comment request on the filing, is at the centre of Saudi Arabia's plans to transform the economy by creating new sectors and diversifying revenues away from oil.
The $400 billion fund is expected to inject at least $40 billion annually in the local economy until 2025, and increase its assets to $1 trillion by that date, which would make it one of the world's biggest sovereign wealth funds.
""PIF would have wanted to take advantage of the bullish sentiment in equity markets in Q1 to make opportunistic investments and add to its portfolio,"" said Rachna Uppal, director of research at Azure Strategy.
""In line with domestic efforts to achieve the objectives of Vision 2030, the Saudis also appear to be favouring investments into sectors such as technology, mobility, and especially future mobility, tourism and entertainment,"" she said.
At the start of last year PIF piled up minority stakes in companies worldwide, taking advantage of market weakness caused by the coronavirus crisis.
Monday's filing showed the value of its biggest U.S. stock holding, Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER), rose to nearly $4 billion in the first quarter, from $3.7 billion as of Dec. 31, as the ride-hailing company's shares gained value during the period.
PIF was an early investor in Uber, taking a $3.5 billion stake in 2016, three years before its listing in 2019.

(Reuters) - European stocks ended flat on Monday as underwhelming Chinese data and caution over the spread of a COVID-19 variant outweighed optimism on the reopening of the British economy, while Sweden's Kinnevik surged and was the top performer. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index ended flat with travel and leisure stocks being the top losers, down 2.3%, while telecommunication stocks jumped the most, led by gains in Spanish telecom firm Telefonica (NYSE:TEF) Dampening sentiment was data showing that China's factories slowed their output growth in April and retail sales significantly missed expectations as officials warned of new problems affecting the economic recovery. 
Meanwhile, fresh restrictions across Asia following a new wave of COVID-19 cases and concerns over the spread of a fast-spreading coronavirus variant first identified in India overshadowed optimism on UK's economic reopening. 
""Airlines are on the back foot once again today, with optimism over the reopening of international travel proving short-lived given concerns over the growth of the Indian COVID variant,"" said Joshua Mahony, senior market analyst at IG. 
""Unfortunately, the risks posed by this latest strain also raise questions around those same businesses that have just found reprieve from lockdown restrictions, with pub and restaurant chains all on the back foot despite the resumption of indoor dining,"" added Mahony. 
Britain's domestically focused mid-cap index dropped 0.6%, with restaurant and pub operator SSP Group and airlines Easyjet and Wizz Air Holdings being the top drags. Irish airline Ryanair fell 2.8% after reporting a record annual after-tax loss, as it said there were signs the recovery had begun. European stocks have performed well so far and surged to all-time highs this month, with the STOXX 600 up nearly 11% so far this year as economic recovery prospects and strong earnings drew buyers of equities. 
The European Union has agreed to a partial truce with the United States in a dispute over metal tariffs imposed by former President Donald Trump and to start discussions on global overcapacity and China's ""trade-distorting"" policies. Mining stocks gained 0.9%. 
In corporate news, Sweden's Kinnevik jumped 8.5% to the top of the STOXX 600 index after the company transferred its stake in online fashion retailer Zalando to shareholders. 

Spanish telecoms group Telefonica gained 3.5% as it is seeking buyers for its logistics and express-delivery unit Zeleris, a source familiar with the offer said on Monday, amid a months-long boom in the business as COVID-19 pushes people to shop online. 
Drugmakers  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) and GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) jumped 1% and 0.7% respectively after their experimental COVID-19 vaccine showed a robust immune response in early-stage clinical trial results, enabling them to move to a late-stage study.

Investing.com – Apellis Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:APLS) shares surged nearly 20% Monday after the U.S. Food and Drugs Administration gave its approval Friday for its therapy that increases hemoglobin in patients and reduces the need for blood transfusion.
The company claims that the therapy, Empaveli, is the first and only targeted C3 therapy for the treatment of adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. C3 is a protein that contributes to immunity and triggers a response in the body when it is attacked by foreign elements or pathogens like virus and bacteria.  
Empaveli is approved for use in adults with PNH who are treatment naïve as well as patients switching from the C5 inhibitors Soliris® (eculizumab) and Ultomiris® (ravulizumab).
Apellis was able to prove that the therapy is superior to Soliris in treating hemoglobin level. Soliris is an existing prescription medicine for the disease.
The prescribing information for Empaveli contains a boxed warning. Empaveli may increase the risk of meningococcal and other serious infections caused by encapsulated bacteria.

(Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday dashed Novartis AG's hopes of launching a generic version of  Amgen Inc  (NASDAQ:AMGN)'s multibillion-dollar rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel, declining to hear the company's challenge to two patents. 
The justices turned away Novartis subsidiary Sandoz Inc's appeal of a lower court decision that upheld the validity of the patents. 
Enbrel, also known as etanercept and used to treat adults with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis, is Amgen's top-selling drug, accounting for nearly $5 billion of the company's $24.2 billion in product sales for 2020. Enbrel was launched in 1998 by Immunex Corp, which Amgen acquired in 2002.
At issue in the case is a principle of U.S. patent law that prevents inventors from extending the life of their existing patents by obtaining more than one patent on the same invention, or an obvious variation of it. 
The case involves the active ingredient in Enbrel. After Sandoz sought to market Erelzi, a generic version of Enbrel, Immunex sued in 2016 for patent infringement.
Sandoz accused Immunex of impermissibly extending the life of its monopoly on Enbrel through a 2004 deal that effectively took over rival Roche's patent applications on similar research and amended them to cover Enbrel. The successful applications now protect Enbrel from competition until 2029.
In 2020, the Washington-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which specializes in patent cases, rejected Sandoz's argument, saying that Immunex did not fully take over the Roche patents, which were therefore still valid.

""We are disappointed the Supreme Court decided not to review our case,"" Keren Haruvi, president of Sandoz US and head of its North America business, said in a statement.
Haruvi said the decision meant Erelzi, which is more affordable than Enbrel, ""will not be available to U.S. patients with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases until 2029; nonetheless we remain committed to providing important treatment options for patients affected by these diseases.""

(Reuters) - Shares of Airbnb dropped almost 6% in a busy session on Monday after insiders in the home rental firm became free to sell their shares for the first time since the company's December IPO.
It was among Wall Street's five most-traded stocks as of mid-day, with about $3.3 billion worth of shares bought and sold, compared with an average of under $1 billion a day over the past 20 sessions, according to Refinitiv data.
The San Francisco-based company on May 13 beat Wall Street's expectations for first-quarter gross bookings and revenue as COVID-19 vaccinations and easing restrictions encouraged more people to check into its vacation rentals.
Airbnb has weathered the pandemic better than rivals as people booked locations away from major cities in the era of social distancing. Following Airbnb's report last week, Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Brent Thill called the company ""the best growth story in travel.""
Airbnb said in the prospectus for its Dec. 9 initial public offering that up to 27.8 million shares, including those owned by employees, could be sold as of the second trading day immediately after the company's first-quarter report. Airbnb has about 608 million shares outstanding, according to Refinitiv.

The shares traded down 5.7% at 133 at midday, after earlier falling as low as 130.25.
Airbnb is up 92% from the price set in its IPO, which was Wall Street's largest in 2020, but it has fallen about 40% from its February high.

In a filing in federal court in Manhattan, lawyers for Trump and the Democrats said they believed they were ""close to an agreement"" in talks concerning the scope of the subpoenas and a process for resolving privacy concerns. They asked a judge for another 30 days to continue talks.
Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn), Trump's main bank, said in the same filing that both sides would invite it to raise any concerns ""at an appropriate time."" Deutsche Bank has maintained it took no position on the subpoenas and would comply with the law.
The House Financial Services Committee and House Intelligence Committee subpoenaed Deutsche Bank in 2019, seeking years of banking records concerning Trump, his adult children and his businesses.
Last July, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Trump's claim that as president he possessed an absolute right to block the release of its records. But the justices said that while Congress had the power to seek evidence from the president, a lower appeals court failed to adequately consider whether the demands by lawmakers were overbroad or too intrusive.

In a separate decision, the Supreme Court also said Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance could obtain eight years of Trump's tax returns for a criminal probe into the former president and his businesses. Vance now has those returns.
With the original House subpoenas having expired, an agreement regarding the Deutsche Bank records would eliminate a need to reissue them.

Hence, we think investors seeking to capitalize on the turnaround in gold prices could bet on mining stocks  Kinross Gold  (NYSE:KGC),  Yamana Gold  (NYSE:AUY), Alamos Gold (AGI), and Centamin (CELTF). They are all still trading at reasonable prices.Investors turned to safe haven gold last year to protect their wealth during the coronavirus-led economic slowdown and general uncertainty. However, the precious metal came under relentless selling pressure after hitting an all-time high last August on investor optimism over the potential for a robust global economic recovery with the mass vaccination drive. Since then, gold prices have slid from more than $2,000 and are currently trading a little above $1,850.
However, the yellow metal is expected to rebound on worries surrounding rising inflation. Fiscal stimulus spending and an improving job market have been boosting investors’ purchasing power, which is fueling inflation. According to Statista, the annual rate of inflation this year is expected to be 2.26%.
While the recovery witnessed by the economy so far has boosted investors’ risk appetite, uncertainties continue to loom over the pace of recovery. As a result, gold’s demand as a safe-haven asset is increasing. Economists believe that the yellow metal’s secular bull market is far from over. In addition, experts anticipate gold will break the crucial $2,000-level again in the near term.

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) -Bitcoin fell to a three-month low on Monday in a volatile session that saw investors selling and buying the digital currency after Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) boss Elon Musk tweeted about the carmaker's bitcoin holdings.
Bitcoin fell to as low as $42,185, its lowest since Feb. 8, and was last down 6.2% at $43,564.
In his latest tweet, Musk said ""Tesla has not sold any bitcoin"". A day earlier, he suggested Tesla may have done so, and last week, Musk said Tesla would stop taking bitcoin as payment due to environmental concerns about energy use to process transactions.
Musk has boosted crypto markets with his enthusiasm for the asset class, but has lately roiled trade by appearing to cool on bitcoin in favor of its one-time parody, dogecoin. While bitcoin, dogecoin and ether still enjoy strong gains year to date, their latest gyrations are beginning to spook even steeled traders.
""At this rate of fall, bitcoin is likely to see support at $40,000 if the selling continues, and surviving this fundamental onslaught can set a new run that will create a new all-time high of $70,000 in the mid-to long term,"" said Alexander Vasiliev, co-founder and chief commercial officer of global payment network Mercuryo.
""The market has proven it can react to Elon's tweets and should his comments continue to stream in unbridled, (bitcoin's)price may be kept below $50,000 for much longer,"" he added.
Ether, linked to the ethereum blockhain, fell to as low as $3,123.94, and last traded down 8.3% at $3,291. Dogecoin fell 6% to US$0.48, according to crypto data tracker CoinGecko.com.
Tesla disclosed in February that it had bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin in the first quarter. At the end of April, Musk said the company sold 10% of its holdings for liquidity purposes.
Bitcoin, designed as a payment tool, is little used for commerce in major economies, hampered by high volatility and relatively costly transactions.
The most popular digital currency is now down a third from its record high in mid-April and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s crunching of fund flow data shows investors exiting positions in recent weeks.
An unverified Twitter account called @CryptoWhale, said https:// ""Bitcoiners are going to slap themselves next quarter when they find out Tesla dumped the rest of their #Bitcoin holdings. With the amount of hate @elonmusk is getting, I wouldn't blame him...""
In response, Musk wrote: ""Indeed."" 
It was not clear whether he was confirming sales or whether he referred only to the fact that he had faced criticism.
Bitcoin has dropped by almost a quarter since Musk's reversal on Tesla taking it as payment. Dogecoin has yet to fully recover from Musk describing it as a ""hustle"", although it did rise last week when Musk said he was working to improve its efficiency.

For an asset class that has surged this year, with dogecoin up about a hundredfold, ether up more than fourfold and bitcoin gaining 45%, some are beginning to call time on the wild ride.
""Why would I want to buy bitcoin right now - even if I’m bullish - until the liquidation is over and you see some consolidation in price?"" said Chris Weston of brokerage Pepperstone in Melbourne.

Investing.com – Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares rose in a weak market after  Morgan Stanley  's (NYSE:MS) latest bullish target for the stock: $6,000 by 2023.
According to StreetInsider, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak reiterated his overweight rating on Amazon with a target of $4,500, while going on to make a case for the $6,000 per share mark.
The online retailer and cloud services provider currently trades at around 1.2 times 2022 earnings on a PEG basis, an approximately 30% discount to its median tech peer group.
Nowak believes that with Amazon’s scaling profitability and given its discount relative to the peer group, the stock would warrant a $4,500 level at even 1.7 times PEG, according to StreetInsider. But this may not be enough.
Factors like a large addressable market across Amazon’s business lines, including retail, advertising, logistics, healthcare, cloud, autonomous driving and the rising user base of its Prime service all combine to ask for an even higher target for the company’s stock price, the analyst believes, as per StreetInsider.
""These factors could justify a higher PEG, and a PEG of ~2-2.5X would imply a ~$5,000-$6,000 share price within the next 12 months (potentially a double from here),"" Nowak wrote.

The bank will also be the first Japanese lender to join the United Nations' Net-Zero Banking Alliance, it said in a statement.
""In order to lead the way to solutions for climate change, one of the most serious issues facing the world, we will further expand support for customers' efforts towards decarbonisation,"" the statement said. 
The bank will also aim for carbon neutrality in its own operations by 2030, it said. The lender will provide annual updates on its progress toward the 2050 target.
Activist shareholders have turned their attention to Japanese banks and other companies in the last year, submitting resolutions for annual general meetings to push them to align their business with the Paris Agreement that was agreed in 2015. 
Investors in MUFG submitted in March a resolution to the bank for its AGM that will be held in June.
While welcoming the move, one of the shareholders told Reuters that the bank has not gone far enough in its latest statement on emissions.

""Given the urgency of the climate crisis, its approach is still quite slow,"" said Kimiko Hirata, International Director of Kiko Network, a Japanese non-government organisation that holds shares in MUFG.

The Microsoft spokesman declined to comment on whether the board had decided Gates should go.
In a statement to the Wall Street Journal, a spokesman for Gates said his decision to leave the board of Microsoft had nothing to do with his involvement with an employee.
""There was an affair almost 20 years ago which ended amicably. Bill's decision to transition off the board was in no way related to this matter,"" the statement said.

However, finalising the deal was delayed by merger talks between Fiat Chrysler and France's Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY) maker PSA, which led to the creation of Stellantis, the world's fourth-largest carmaker, at the start of this year.
A re-launch in China is one of Stellantis' main goals. 
Taiwan's Foxconn and China's Zhejiang Geely Holding Group said in January they were joining forces to provide contract manufacturing for automakers including electric vehicle maker Faraday Future.
Foxconn will also help build electric sport-utility vehicles in 2022 for Chinese startup Byton.
More recently, Foxconn and electric car maker Fisker finalised a vehicle assembly deal, including plans to open a U.S. plant in 2023.
Electric vehicles are expected to become a major contributor to Foxconn revenues in the coming years.

Stellantis and Foxconn will hold a call on Tuesday to present the partnership, with Stellantis Chief Executive Carlos Tavares and Foxconn Chairman Young Liu among others, they said in a joint statement, without providing further details. 
Stellantis shares were up 1.5% at 1500 GMT, compared with a 0.5% rise for Milan bourse blue chip index.

(Reuters) -Goldman Sachs Group Inc hired a top executive from Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc to lead its consumer banking business, the bank said in a memo on Monday.
Peeyush Nahar joins Goldman as the global head of its consumer business, which includes its online bank, Marcus. At Uber, he was vice president of technology. 
Nahar takes over Goldman's fledgling consumer business at a time of turnover in the division that Chief Executive David Solomon has identified as a key area of growth for the bank.
He is the third global head of consumer banking since last September, when Harit Talwar stepped aside to become division chairman, giving the top job to Omer Ismail. Ismail officially took over in January, but soon left for a position at Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc's fintech venture. [nL2N2KY0EK]
A Goldman spokesman confirmed the contents of the memo. 
An Uber spokeswoman confirmed Nahar's departure and declined to comment further. 
At Uber, Nahar managed technologists who worked on the ride-hailing app's payments, infrastructure, fintech and other services. Before that, Nahar worked at Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), where he helped build the retailer's lending and machine-learning platform for its Alexa product. 
Nahar, who officially takes over June 1, joins several new hires in Goldman's business division. 

Brian King was rehired in April from  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co to be Goldman's consumer chief risk officer and head of business operations.
The bank also recently hired Rob Cochran to be lead of digital products for consumer and wealth management and Swati Bhatia as head of proprietary business for the consumer business.

Investing.com – Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) shares fell 4% Monday as cryptos took a hammering on concerns governments and regulators would come down hard on them.
Coinbase reported its March quarter earnings, its first since going public in April, Thursday. It did not provide any revenue guidance, not a very surprising event given the volatile nature of the crypto world.
The crypto exchange earns most of its revenue through cryptocurrency transaction fees.
Both Bitcoin (BitfinexUSD), the largest cryptocurrency, and Ethereum ETH/USD, a distant second, are trading 9% lower. Dogecoin DOGE/USD, a recent favorite of crypto champion and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, is 5% lower. BNB/USD and ADA/USD were both down around 12%.
Bitcoin slipped below another psychologically crucial mark of $44,000. It is now down by more than 44% from the $63,500 it touched just over a month ago. The crypto is also suffering from Musk's recent flip-flops who till last week was its biggest champion. He remains a fan of crypto but not so much of Bitcoin, which requires a lot of energy to mine new coins.  
The world of crypto and particularly that of Bitcoin has recently been mired in debates over its stability, energy consumption, and use by criminals.
Recently, Colonial Pipeline, the largest energy pipeline in the U.S., shut down after a cyberattack by ransomware gang DarkSide. According to Bloomberg, Colonial paid DarkSide the ransom in cryptocurrency to take back its network.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Wells Fargo has launched a 10-year commitment to help unbanked individuals in the United States gain access to affordable, mainstream bank accounts, the company said on Monday.
The initiative aims to help Black and African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans, who account for more than half of the country's 7 million unbanked households, have easier access to low-cost banking,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) said.
As part of the plan, the bank has committed to redesigning 100 branches in low-to-middle income neighborhoods to enable one-to-one consultations, offer digital banking access and conduct financial health seminars.
Banks are under pressure from lawmakers and advocates to increase financial inclusion and access to banking services for underserved communities.
The need to address the issue had been heightened by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has said the number of unbanked households will likely increase in the aftermath of the pandemic.
According to FDIC data, 12.2% of Hispanic households, 13.8% of Black households, and 16.3% of American Indian/Alaska Native households in the U.S. don’t have access to a mainstream checking account – compared with 2.5% of White and 1.7% of Asian households.
""We recognize the high number of unbanked households is a complex and long-standing issue that will require gathering the best minds, ideas, products and educational resources from across our communities to bring about change,"" Wells Fargo Chief Executive Charlie Scharf said in a statement.
Wells Fargo is focusing on three areas with the initiative - expanding access to financial education and advice, increasing access to affordable products and launching a National Unbanked Advisory Taskforce.
The taskforce will include representatives from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) and the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI).
Through the initiative, the bank said it would deepen its existing relationships with Black-owned Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs), which are more likely to lend in underserved minority communities. That will include allowing customers of those institutions to withdraw cash from Wells Fargo's ATMs and incur no Wells Fargo fees. 

It will also increase funding and support to expand the Credit Builders Alliance (CBA) low-cost, credit-building consumer loan program. That will enable more low-to-moderate income individuals to meet short term cash needs and establish or improve their credit scores, it said.
Wells Fargo declined to say how much it is investing in the initiative.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - S&P Dow Jones Indices will pay a $9 million fine to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges that its negligence in managing one of its indexes caused huge losses for securities issued by  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG during extreme market volatility.
The SEC said S&P DJI should have disclosed that its S&P 500 VIX Short Term Futures Index ER contained an ""auto hold"" feature that caused its value to remain static for more than an hour on Feb. 5, 2018, even as the underlying CBOE Volatility Index (""VIX"") was spiking 115% higher.
According to the SEC, the stale data contributed to a 96% drop in the value of the Credit Suisse's VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term Exchange-Traded Notes (""XIV Notes""), whose value was dependent on the S&P DJI index.
Investors in the XIV Notes have estimated that the plunge caused $1.8 billion of losses.
""When index providers license their indices for the issuance of securities, as S&P DJI did here, they must ensure that the disclosure of critical features of their products as well as the publication of real-time values are accurate,"" said Daniel Michael, chief of the SEC enforcement division's complex financial instruments unit.
S&P DJI is a joint venture between S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Inc, which owns a majority, and CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) 
It did not admit or deny wrongdoing in agreeing to settle, and said in a statement it was committed to ""transparency and the integrity of its benchmark determination process.""

Last month, a federal appeals court in Manhattan revived a fraud lawsuit by XIV Notes investors accusing Credit Suisse of trying to collapse that market to profit at their expense.
The price of XIV Notes plunged as low as $4.22 from $108.37 during the volatility. Credit Suisse later redeemed the notes at $5.99 each. The bank said last month it was ""confident"" that the lawsuit would eventually be dismissed.

GENEVA (Reuters) -The head of the World Health Organization called on COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers to make shots available to the COVAX vaccine-sharing facility earlier than planned due to a supply shortfall left by Indian export disruptions.
COVAX, which supplies doses to poorer countries, relies heavily on India's Serum Institute's exports of the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) shot but many of these are instead being used by the country as it battles a massive second wave of infections.
The head of UNICEF on Monday asked wealthy G7 countries ahead of a summit next month to donate supplies as an emergency measure to make up the shortfall estimated at 140 million doses by end-May.
""While we appreciate the work of AstraZeneca who have been steadily increasing the speed and volume of their deliveries, we need other manufacturers to follow suit,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a virtual briefing. 
Specifically, he asked  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) to bring forward deliveries of some 40 million doses in the second half of the year and asked  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) to make doses pledged for 2022 available this year.
""We need doses right now and call on them to bring forward deliveries as soon as possible,"" he said.
G7 member France has already given some AstraZeneca shots to COVAX and talks with Washington on donations are ongoing. 

WHO senior adviser Bruce Aylward defended COVAX's work so far in providing 65 million doses to 120 countries, calling it a success. But wealthy countries need to donate more vaccines now they have vaccinated their most vulnerable populations, he said. 
""We are moving in the right direction. We are not moving there fast enough and we are not moving there at large enough volumes,"" he said.

FARO/LISBON, Portugal (Reuters) -Sun-hungry Britons landing in Portugal on Monday after a four-month coronavirus travel ban between the two countries was lifted at midnight were elated to be back on holiday.
""It's fantastic. The feeling is unbelievable. We got the sun, the people, the beaches, the bars. Can't wait,"" said British tourist Matthew Bolden, giving the thumbs up at the arrivals gate at Lisbon airport.
Twenty-two flights from Britain were due to land in Portugal on Monday, with most heading to the southern Algarve region, famous for its beaches and golf courses but nearly deserted over the past months as the pandemic kept tourists away.
""It feels amazing. Happy, everyone's happy. We were on the first flight out of the UK,"" said Kim, 27, who arrived from Manchester at Faro airport, where Algarve tourism office workers handed out packs of hand sanitiser and face masks.
Tourism businesses hope the return of Britons, who pumped around 3.2 billion euros ($3.9 billion) into Portugal's economy in 2019, will provide a much-needed boost to the sector, accounting in normal times for 15% of the country's GDP.
""We were massively affected by the pandemic. It was so sad to see the arrivals gate empty. But today it's better. It's a breath of fresh air,"" said Maria Joao, 55, whose tiny shop in Lisbon airport sells drinks and snacks.
'TAKE IT EASY'
Visitors from Britain must present evidence of a negative coronavirus test taken 72 hours before boarding their flights to Portugal and there is no need to quarantine for COVID-19 when returning home.
Portuguese doctor Rute Castelhano, who has been battling the pandemic in Britain, was exhausted but over-the-moon to see her parents at Lisbon airport after months apart.
""I'm so happy to see my family again,"" she said through hugs and tears. ""It's great to be back home.""
Tourists from European countries with fewer than 500 infections per 100,000 people were also allowed in for the first time on Monday.
Portugal, which imposed a strict four-month lockdown to tackle a devastating COVID-19 surge in January, has reopened restaurants and shops but some capacity limitations remain in place and restaurants must close at 10:30 p.m.
Masks must be worn while walking on the beach. Nightclubs and indoor bars selling only alcohol remain closed.

""We are still living in a pandemic,"" cautioned Marisa Semedo, manager of a riverside cafe kiosk in Lisbon. ""They must take it easy, don't drink too much, don't get out of control because the British really like to drink.""

So, let’s evaluate if either of these two stocks is a buy now. Vipshop Holdings  Limited (VIPS) and Coupang, Inc. (CPNG) are prominent players in the growing e-commerce sector in Asia. China-based VIPS is an online discount retailer that operates through the Vip.com, Shan Shan Outlets, and Others segments. CPNG is an e-commerce business operator in South Korea that offers various products and services home goods, beauty products, groceries, and electronics categories, in addition to delivery services, among others.
The Asian e-commerce industry has experienced exponential growth amid the COVID-19 pandemic, bolstered by the increasing online shopping activity and advancements in delivery systems. The shift in consumers’ shopping behavior regarding online purchasing has helped major players in the Asian e-commerce market—including JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD),  Pinduoduo  Inc.

While VIPS and CPNG have also been beneficiaries of the industry’s exponential growth, they look relatively less appealing now given their weak financials. And we think the competitive landscape could negatively impact the market shares of these two companies and impact their near-term growth prospects.

Power was restored by 1340 GMT, electricity provider Taipower said.
Taiwan, which major chip makers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) call home, already imposed phased blackouts on Thursday following an outage at a plant in the southern city of Kaohsiung. 
TSMC, which has factories across the island, said it had seen ""no impact so far"" from Monday's power cuts.
Taipower said 660,000 homes were affected by the power cuts, fewer than the roughly 4 million affected last week. 
Taipower blamed a rise in demand coincided with the suspension of some generators due to a technical failure at the southern Hsinta Power Plant, the same facility that caused the problem last week.
The state-own company said that the worst drought to hit the island in more than half a century meant electricity generated by hydropower plants was insufficient to meet the unexpected demand on Monday evening, a record high for May. 
By 8:40 p.m., only 40% of the supply had been restored in the coal- and gas-fired power plant, Taipower said.
Taiwan's cabinet offered an apology and urged citizens to stay safe. 

Taiwan's main opposition party, the Kuomintang, said the outages showed the government's power policy was inadequate and called for Economy Minister Wang Mei-hua to step down. 
Taiwan is currently experiencing an unusually hot May with temperatures in parts of the island peaking at around 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit).

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a bid by Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) to overturn a $70 million jury verdict against the pharmaceutical company for its failure to warn about risks associated with off-label uses of its antipsychotic drug Risperdal.
The court turned away the company's appeal of a November 2019 ruling by the Superior Court of Pennsylvania that upheld the verdict in favor of a Tennessee man named Adam Yount, who was prescribed the drug at age 4 in 2003. 
A jury in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas in 2016 found that the company failed to warn Yount's healthcare providers about the risk of gynecomastia, an enlargement or swelling of breast tissue in males caused by a hormonal imbalance, and that it intentionally falsified, destroyed or concealed evidence in the case.
Warnings contained on drug labels are overseen by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. But ""off-label"" uses - to treat patient populations outside of the FDA's approval or for conditions and dosage beyond the agency's approval - by doctors are commonplace.
Yount developed gynecomastia at age 5 as a result of taking Risperdal, according to his lawyers. J&J has said that Yount's doctor discontinued the treatment but that the patient's mother requested that it be resumed. The drug at the time had not been approved for pediatric use so the label did not include a specific warning about gynecomastia in children.
J&J's lawyers have said the verdict was impermissible under federal law. It said it could not have included the warning because manufacturers are barred from changing their labels to include information about off-label uses.
The FDA approved Risperdal in 1993 to treat schizophrenia and bipolar mania in adults, but it was only in 2006 that its use was approved for irritability associated with autism in children.

New Brunswick (NYSE:BC), New Jersey-based J&J and its Janssen Pharmaceuticals unit have faced thousands of Risperdal-related lawsuits and 10,000 remain pending, according to the company. One case resulted in an initial $8 billion jury verdict, which was later reduced to $6.8 million.
The company agreed separately in 2013 to pay $2.2 billion to settle U.S. criminal and civil probes into its marketing of Risperdal and two other drugs.

Monday's move marks the unwinding of AT&T's $108.7 billion acquisition of U.S. media conglomerate Time Warner in 2018, and underscores its recognition that TV viewership has moved to streaming, where scale is required to take on the likes of Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co.

Combined the company will spend about $20 billion on content, more than Netflix's $17 billion it will spend this year. Zaslav said he expected the company to increase its programming investment in the future. 
""While further details have yet to emerge, the proposed horizontal combination would create a global content behemoth uniting Warner Media's premier news and entertainment assets with Discovery's industry-leading cache of non-scripted programming networks,"" Keith Snyder at CFRA Research said.
The deal is not surprising, Snyder added, after pressure on traditional pay-TV ramped up during the coronavirus pandemic as consumers binge-watched streaming shows while stuck at home. 
With Time Warner, AT&T's former Chief Executive Randall Stephenson sought to create a media and telecoms powerhouse, combining content and distribution. The deal was challenged by former U.S. President Donald Trump's antitrust regulators, but won court approval in June 2018. 
Yet it proved a costly strategy as AT&T simultaneously sought to expand next generation wireless services, most recently borrowing $14 billion to buy more spectrum.
AT&T is not the first telecoms company to shed its media assets. On May 3,  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) announced plans to get rid of its media businesses that include iconic brands Yahoo and AOL for $5 billion, ending an expensive and unsuccessful run in the media and advertising world.
AT&T and Discovery's new company is projected to have 2023 revenue of about $52 billion and adjusted EBITDA of about $14 billion as well as $3 billion in expected annual cost synergies.

The deal is anticipated to close in mid-2022, pending approval by Discovery shareholders and regulatory approvals.
The new company is expected to see $3 billion in cost synergies and has no plans to sell any assets.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) said it screened 1.85 million passengers on Sunday at U.S. airports, the highest number since March 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic slashed travel demand.
The U.S. air industry has been setting a number of new post March 2020 highs in recent days. Sunday's tally is 100,000 travelers higher than Thursday's 1.74 million, which had been the best in 14 months. Still Sunday's demand was about 70% of pre-pandemic air travel on the equivalent day in May 2019.
By comparison, just 253,000 people were screened at U.S.
airports on the same day in May 2020.
U.S. airlines have been adding more flights, anticipating
rising summer travel demand as more Americans get vaccinated.
On Monday, United Airlines said it would add more than 400 daily flights to its July schedule and increase service to reopened European destinations.
United plans to fly 80% of its U.S. schedule compared with July 2019 – and bookings for summer travel are up 214% versus 2020 levels. It is increasing its domestic network by 17% from its June schedule.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) said in April it expects to fly
more than 90% of its domestic seat capacity compared with summer
2019 and 80% of its international seat capacity compared with
2019, and it will operate more than 150 new routes this summer.
One big question mark remains: When will the United States and Europe ease travel restrictions?

The United States since March 2020 has barred nearly all non-U.S. citizens who have recently been in much of Europe from the United States.
Nearly all of Europe still bans most U.S. travelers from visiting, while Britain allows American visits but requires a 10-day quarantine upon arrival and two COVID-19 tests.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday turned away Uber (NYSE:UBER)'s bid to avoid a lawsuit over whether drivers for the ride-hailing company's limousine platform UberBLACK are employees and not independent contractors as the company claims.
The justices left in place a lower court's 2020 ruling that revived the lawsuit filed by Ali Razak, Kenan Sabani and Khaldoun Cherdoud, who worked as drivers for UberBLACK in Pennsylvania. 
Razak, Sabani and Cherdoud accused Uber of violating federal minimum wage and overtime pay requirements, arguing that they should be classified as employees due certain benefits and protections denied to contractors. 
The Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out a 2018 ruling by a federal judge in Philadelphia that the drivers were independent contractors under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act. 

The legal classification of workers has been a major issue for ""gig economy"" companies including Uber that rely on independent contractors rather than employees who often receive a range of benefits such as medical insurance and have certain taxes withheld from wages paid. Uber, in particular, has been hit with dozens of lawsuits in recent years claiming that its drivers are employees and are entitled to protections not afforded to contractors.
The case will now return to the 3rd U.S. Circuit for further litigation.

Bain now sees a 30% probability that sales of high-end handbags, clothes and jewellery will return to or exceed their 2019 level of 280 billion euros ($340 billion) this year, depending on how quickly vaccines are rolled out and tourism picks up.
Its more likely scenario is for a full rebound in 2022, which would still imply a faster convalescence than Bain predicted in November, when it said the sector may have to wait until 2023 to put the crisis squarely behind it.
Luxury goods sales fell by 23% to 217 billion euros last year, their largest-ever drop and the first decline since 2009, as the pandemic forced shop closures and brought international tourism to a virtual halt.
But the crisis does not seem to have had a lasting impact on consumers' appetite and spending power for high-end wares. 
Soaring sales in China, the biggest market for luxury goods, and a stronger-than-expected U.S. rebound thanks to a big stimulus programme have helped revenues bounce back sharply in the first quarter of 2021.
""The U.S. market has been the unexpected bright spot,"" Bain said. By contrast, Europe is lagging behind, hampered by a slower vaccination campaign and restrictions on tourism.
The speed of the recovery has been uneven. The industry's biggest groups such as LVMH, Hermes and  Kering  (PA:PRTP) are already above their 2019 levels, while smaller labels like Ferragamo and Tod's still have to catch up. 
The crisis has forced brands traditionally more reluctant to sell online to fully embrace e-commerce, which is set to become the leading channel for luxury purchases in the next few years. 

Bain said that as people moved to countryside homes and worked remotely, sales in second-tier cities often went better than in big luxury capitals like New York or Milan - a factor brands will have to consider as they review their footprint. 
And while handbags, leather goods and jewellery have been driving the recovery, spending on clothes, make up and perfumes is expected to pick up too as lockdowns ease and people resume going out. ($1 = 0.8239 euros)

Investing.com – Square (NYSE:SQ) shares fell more than 3% Monday after word of its plan to raise $2 billion in debt.
Square intends to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include potential acquisitions and strategic transactions, capital expenditures, investments and working capital, it said in a statement.
The deal includes two notes, and the interest rate, redemption provisions, maturity date and other terms will be determined by negotiations between Square and the initial purchasers.
The offering comes after CFO Amrita Ahuja’s statement Friday that the company had no plans to buy more bitcoin (BitfinexUSD), the largest cryptocurrency.
""We don't have any plans at this point to make further purchases,"" Ahuja told Financial News.
Square lost $20 million on its bitcoin investment last quarter, Financial News said.
According to Business Insider, Square holds 8,027 bitcoins. They are worth around $360 million at the current price."

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks opened the week mostly lower, against a background of concern that the weakness seen in crypto assets over the weekend could herald trouble for other high-volatility, speculative assets. 
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 3 points - effectively flat - at 34,379 points, while the S&P 500 was down 0..2% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.4%. 
The cautious start to the week came amid heavy losses in most cryptocurrencies after Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO founder Elon Musk repeated his criticism of Bitcoin, while still asserting that his company hasn't sold any of the Bitcoin it bought earlier in the year. Tesla's bottom line in the first quarter was helped not least by a $100 million unrealized gains on its holdings of crypto assets. Tesla stock fell 1.5%.
Proxies for cryptocurrency exposure were also struggling in early trade.  Coinbase Global  (NASDAQ:COIN),. which operates the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchange, fell 7.4%, going below the reference price of $250 at which it went public through a direct listing last month. Microstrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), a company that has reinvented itself as a holding company for Bitcoin. fell 7.4% to its lowest since December. And shares in payments company Square (NYSE:SQ), which derives most of its revenue from processing Bitcoin transactions, fell 4.2% as the market reacted badly to news of a $2 billion debt offering. 
The morning's big winners were Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Communications (NASDAQ:DISCB)  stock and AT&T (NYSE:T) stock, which rose 16% and 4.0% respectively after the two decided to combine their media assets in a new company. The deal comes only a few weeks after a sharp fall in Discovery's share price as the collapse of Bill Hwang's Archegos Capital Management forced its prime brokers to dump the stock on the market.
Other companies in the video streaming space were hit by the news, which not only presages more focused competition but also attached a relatively sober valuation to the new streaming giant, which will include HBO Max, Warner Bros and Discovery's nature, cooking and home renovation programs. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock was down 1.0%, while Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) stock was down 1.6%. Both companies disappointed analysts with their first-quarter subscriber numbers in recent weeks. Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), the owner of NBC's Peacock streaming service, was down 2.1%.
Elsewhere, Airbnb  (NASDAQ:ABNB) stock fell 6.3% to a new low for 2021 as the lockup on existing shareholders expired. The room-sharing company's first-quarter figures last week had suggested it may struggle to capitalize on the expected rebound in tourism and business travel this year due to a shortage of hosts (and massive spare capacity in the hotel sector).

The airline is currently in talks with the U.S. planemaker over its fleet planes, a review brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, which has devastated the travel industry.
Asked if the airline could swap its orders to take fewer 777X jets and more Dreamliners, Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum told reporters: ""It is always a possibility.""
""We are assessing our fleet requirements as we speak.""
Emirates, the world's biggest long-haul airline before the pandemic, has recently expressed frustration with Boeing over the 777X programme, which is three years behind schedule, urging the planemaker to share more details on the in-production jet.
Sheikh Ahmed said the delays had been ""tough"" for Boeing, which is emerging from its worst crisis after fatal crashes of 737 MAX jets and a 20-month safety ban that has since been lifted.
Emirates reduced its order for 150 777X to 126 jets as part of a deal that saw the airline order 30 Dreamliners in 2019.
Sheikh Ahmed, who has headed Emirates since it was founded in 1985, did not say when the airline would make a decision on it future fleet.
The airline is due to report its annual results for the financial year ended March 31. 
Sheikh Ahmed said it had been a very tough year, with the airline carrying around 30% of the 56.2 million passengers it carried in the previous year, without providing further details.
He said he was optimistic for the upcoming summer travel season, even as the airline was reviewing its cash reserves on a monthly basis due to the deterioration in demand caused by the pandemic.
""A lot of people (who have) stopped travelling for the last year and a half ... want to travel.""

However, Sheikh Ahmed suggested the airline was taking a conservative approach to restoring capacity, telling reporters Emirates would only operate flights that make commercial sense.
""We don't just open a route for the sake of opening or just for a publicity reason.""

AT&T shares rose 4.4% in early trading.
The new combined entity is projected to have approximately $52 billion in revenue by 2023 and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization of around $14 billion.
The deal gives Discovery content from WarnerMedia to compete against the likes of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Disney (NYSE:DIS) in the online streaming business. Discovery itself has a global footprint, deep local-language content and regional expertise. WarnerMedia includes CNN, HBO, and the Warner Brothers movie studio and makes up half of AT&T's $230 billion market value.
For AT&T, the deal will provide the much-needed cash to trim a $169 billion debt load that ballooned by $21 billion in March quarter alone. It will also help it focus on 5G, the next broadband frontier for telecom companies.
AT&T will receive $43 billion in a combination of cash, debt securities, and WarnerMedia’s retention of certain debt. Its shareholders will get stock representing 71% of the new company; Discovery shareholders will own 29% of the combined entity.

LONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) will launch an app for UK users of its digital bank Marcus over the following weeks and plans to offer automated investment management to clients in the country by the first quarter of next year.
The U.S. bank has attracted just over $30 billion in UK deposits since launching a savings account in 2018, accounting for 30% of Marcus's deposits globally, Des McDaid, the head of Marcus UK, told Reuters.
""We are pivoting more into an investment and wealth provider rather than a full service digital bank,"" he said. 
""We have been delighted with how fast and how quickly we have grown. The challenge now is how do we repeat the formula we used for savings to offer our customers an accessible platform for investing products.""
Goldman is shifting the focus of Marcus UK to wealth management to stay within UK banking rules which demand retail deposits totalling more than 25 billion pounds ($35 billion) be ring-fenced. 
Ring-fencing would require Marcus UK to become a separate legal entity and restrict how much capital could be shared with the rest of Goldman's business in the country.
Goldman Sachs opened Marcus in the United States in 2016 to diversify its revenue and funding sources by offering savings accounts and personal loans to retail customers. It has been expanding the range of U.S. services, including checking accounts and a credit card with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). 
The bank also launched Marcus Invest in the United States, a robo-adviser that allocates customer funds across managed portfolios made up of exchange-traded funds for stock and bonds.
Similar to other robo-advisers, the bank evaluates a customer's risk tolerance and investment timeline and models developed by the firm's investment strategy group recommend a conservative, moderate or growth portfolio.
Marcus is now in the process of adapting its U.S. product for the UK market.
""We are building on the U.S. platform but making the back end and regulatory changes that are required to make it work."" McDaid said. ""Our opportunity is strong, we start with a strong investment base of existing savers looking for an opportunity to do more with their money.""
Deposits in Marcus UK surged during the pandemic as more homebound consumers held off on discretionary spending and reorganised their finances. It offers 0.4% annual interest on its savings account, down from 1.5% when it launched.
British consumers will be able to access their Marcus accounts through an app on iOS devices this month and Android in June, McDaid said. 
While the bank is not currently planning to offer checking accounts in the United Kingdom, McDaid said the local digital retail banking market was attractive. 

Rival JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) said in January that it would launch a digital consumer bank in Britain under its Chase brand over the coming months.

Investing.com – Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares were just short of 2% down in Monday’s premarket following CEO Elon Musk’s sharp reversal of his stance on Bitcoin (BitfinexUSD), the cryptocurrency he had championed until just last week.
After a Twitter exchange at the weekend hinting that Musk would push Tesla into selling over $1.5 billion of Bitcoin that it bought earlier this year, Musk said Monday that Tesla has not sold any Bitcoin and does not intend to. The exchange has nonetheless hit prices not just for Bitcoin but for most other crypto assets, causing an angry reaction from the online community of crypto enthusiasts.
Since Musk’s first tweet Thursday on not accepting Bitcoin against sale of Tesla vehicles, there was much speculation over the fate of the money the company had invested in February. Tesla's first-quarter earnings had profited to the tune of over $100 million in unrealized profits on its Bitcoin holdings.
Musk last week said the company only intended to use Bitcoin for transactions once its mining transitioned to a more sustainable energy, a move that is in any case symbolic since the vast majority of Tesla cars are sold in fiat currency anyway.
He then went on to lend even stronger support to Dogecoin, a crypto asset that he recently embraced. He said the company is working with Doge developers to improve its transaction efficiency. "

SK Hynix has expressed intention to negotiate for the full acquisition of the 8-inch wafer foundry, Korea Economic Daily reported on Monday citing unnamed sources in the tech and investment banking industries. 
SK Hynix said that it is considering various measures to expand its foundry business, but nothing has been finalised. A spokesperson for Key Foundry could not be immediately reached. 
SK Hynix is already a minority investor in Key Foundry, having infused about 207 billion won ($181.93 million) into a private equity fund last year that owns the chip contract manufacturing firm, and now is interested in buying out the rest, Korea Economic Daily said. 
Key Foundry has a chip manufacturing capacity of 82,000 8-inch wafers per month, and is the only pure-play foundry in Korea, with the ability to make chips for applications in the consumer, communications, computing, automotive and industrial industries, according to its website. 
SK Hynix said last week that it is considering doubling its chip contract manufacturing capacity from a low base in ways that could include M&A.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian bus company Itapemirim is launching a new airline in June, betting it can dodge the financial ruin that has grounded many rival carriers even though the land transport company just spent five years reorganizing under bankruptcy protection. 
The carrier expects to have a fleet of 50 Airbus A320 planes by next year, all painted in Itapemirim's signature bright yellow color, trying to beat the odds that have led 11 airlines to fail in Brazil so far this century. 
""We have the intention of being the largest airline in Brazil, with all due respect to our competitors,"" said Sidnei Piva, president of Grupo Itapemirim, which will emerge from bankruptcy this month. 
""We are not going to stop at just those 50 aircraft, we plan to multiply that number several times."" 
Key to its business pitch is selling tickets that mix air and bus travel, lowering travel time between Brazil's smaller cities without adding much to the cost.
The idea of a bus company starting an airline is not as unusual as it might seem in Brazil, where the founders of country's largest carrier Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes also made their initial fortune in bus transport.
But Gol and Brazil's other main domestic carriers,  Azul SA  (NYSE:AZUL) and LATAM Airlines (OTC:LTMAQ) Group are struggling because of their large debt and low liquidity - worsened by the pandemic's severe blow to demand. 
LATAM filed for bankruptcy last May, while Gol and Azul drag a combined 33 billion reais ($6.27 billion) in accumulated losses. 
Still, a rival with a clean balance sheets could upend the market, analysts say. Piva said Itapemirim does not have debt payments for the next four years and is running on a $500 million investment from a United Arab Emirates sovereign fund that he declined to name. 
Piva added that Itapemirim will not follow the ultra low-cost model that is in vogue now but will instead focus on a high quality of inflight service, generous leg room and free checked bags. 

Rivals in Brazil and the rest of the world have generally moved away from that model, lowering ticket prices but then selling other services as add-ons.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Australian expatriate investment bankers are returning home in large numbers, lured by the launch of new boutique advisory firms, a sharp pick up in deal-making and the safety of a country relatively unscathed by the coronavirus pandemic.
Signs of a strong economic rebound from a brief pandemic- induced recession are underscoring a trend that is starting to reverse a long tradition of Australian bankers heading overseas to more tax-friendly global financial centres.
""There is a brain gain happening in Australia, we are acquiring additional knowledge and experience,"" said Nick Hughes, Australia co-head at UBS. 
Corporate Australia has set a scorching start to 2021, with $6.21 billion worth of M&A deals already underway, more than seven times higher than the same period last year, according to Refinitiv data. That puts Australia second in the Asia Pacific in terms of deal value, behind only China, compared to its seventh place ranking over the same period in 2020.
The trend is expected to continue in the near-term, with big-ticket deals such as the possible sale of casino operator Crown Resorts, and the divestment of some financial businesses in the pipeline.
The entry of two boutique firms, Barrenjoey Capital and Jarden, into the fray has fuelled a talent war in the country and pushed up wages by at least 20%, making it a rare bright spot for rainmakers.
Jarden, the Australian offshoot of the New Zealand investment bank, has hired eight Australian expatriate bankers traders and analysts as part of its campaign to build out its local franchise, according to a spokeswoman. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) has had eight Australian staff return from offshore to work in Australia, and Swiss bank UBS has had four returnees in the recent months, according to the banks' spokeswomen.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) has hired two senior expatriate bankers, the bank's country head Joseph Fayyad said.
""With new entrants establishing a presence and the incumbents defending their positions, there are more available seats for senior bankers,"" Sydney-based Fayyad told Reuters.
Most of the returnees are landing in Sydney from London and New York. Their experience ranges from mid-career to senior bankers and legal and compliance staff.
They are among a lucky few currently allowed to enter Australia, which closed its international border to almost all travellers but returning nationals and permanent residents months ago as a pandemic shield. The dramatic step has appeared to pay off with Australia recording under 30,000 COVID-19 cases and 910 deaths, far fewer than many other developed countries. 
""I think Australia's outperformance during COVID has put a real spotlight on the benefits of working and living down under, so the combination of more available seats and a greater desire from Australians to come home has really fuelled the trend,"" said Fayyad.
'A BIT OF HUSTLE' 
The return of the expatriates counters a long-established trend of Australian finance professionals moving offshore, partly to gain experience and partly to escape Australia's relatively high personal income tax rates.
Local banking executives said increased onshore deals activity means banks are able to offer fatter paychecks for returnees used to New York and London salaries.
Jarden Australia head of investment banking Aidan Allen said the ""brain gain"" had helped the emerging bank build its team to almost 100 since its launch a year ago. 
""A lot of our talent has come from offshore, people wanting to return home has been a massive opportunity for us,"" Allen said. ""We think it's a point of difference, it's given us the opportunity to have a more diverse and experienced bench.""

Rival Barrenjoey launched in September with 50 staff and now has about 220 people, a spokeswoman said.
The influx of the expatriates should also be a warning for incumbents, BofA's Fayyad said: ""Bankers that have been here for some time need to acknowledge there is a new crop of talent who have a bit of hustle, a spring in their step, who want to make their mark.""

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Indonesian ride-hailing and payments firm Gojek and e-commerce leader Tokopedia are merging to create a multi-billion dollar tech company called GoTo in the country's largest-ever deal, as rivals bulk up in the fast-expanding sector.
The combined entity, which will span online shopping, courier services, ride-hailing, food delivery and other services in Southeast Asia's largest economy, will be the biggest privately held technology firm in the region.
It plans to list in Indonesia and the United States later this year, company executives said on Monday.
Two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that GoTo was seeking a pre-IPO funding that could enable it to raise about $2 billion followed by public market floats with a potential valuation of roughly $40 billion for the group.
In a joint statement, the companies said their combined past valuation was $18 billion based on fundraisings done in 2019 and early 2020, and declined comment on future valuations.
The merger of Gojek and Tokopedia - each backed by global heavyweight investors – comes amid a surge of competition in the ride-hailing and food delivery markets in Southeast Asia. Stay-at-home pandemic restrictions have stoked demand for food delivery, e-commerce and e-payments.
Last month, Southeast Asia's largest ridehailing and food delivery firm Grab clinched a $40 billion merger with a special purpose acquisition company and Singapore-based regional internet firm Sea Ltd, which runs e-commerce platform Shopee, is also muscling into food delivery and financial services.
""GoTo will still need to face stiff competition from larger regional rivals Shopee and Grab, which are leading in market share in both e-commerce and food and which have their dominance in other parts of Southeast Asia to cushion the long term investment commitment into Indonesia,"" said Jianggan Li, CEO of venture outfit Momentum Works.
GoTo's biggest investors include  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding, SoftBank Group Corp, Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY).
Sources said Gojek's shareholders will own 58% of the holding company with the balance held by Tokopedia's investors.

""GoTo will be unique in its ability to cover two-thirds of Indonesian consumer expenditure"", Tokopedia President Patrick Cao told reporters. ""If you look at our regional peers, they exceed only at covering one sector."" 
Cao will become GoTo's president and Gojek CEO Andre Soelistyo will be CEO of the group that says it has more than 100 million monthly active users and a registered driver fleet of more than 2 million.
GoTo's deal came together quickly in December after months of negotiations between Gojek and Grab fell apart. 
Gojek and Tokopedia's senior executives have personal and family ties and held discussions about a deal in 2018, sources said.
Using the model of Alphabet, Gojek and Tokopedia plan to remain separate but work together on payments, logistics and food deliveries.
While e-commerce is booming in Indonesia, with its digital economy expected to grow to $124 billion by 2025, according to a 2020 study by Google, Temasek Holdings and Bain & Company, its 17,000 islands are spread across an area bigger than the European Union, making it extremely costly.
GoTo is also betting on its financial arm, which will own 22% of Indonesian digital lender Bank Jago.
Of Indonesia's population of 270 million, half lack bank accounts but most now have mobile phones.
Investors told Reuters the merger will herald a wave of Indonesian listings, with e-commerce company Bukalapak and travel app Traveloka expected to list this year.
""This is the beginning of us proving how local startups can grow at scale and from Indonesia to the world"", said East Ventures founder Willson Cuaca, an early backer of Tokopedia and Gojek shareholder.

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is the financial advisor to Gojek, and Citi is the financial advisor to Tokopedia.
Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP and Assegaf Hamzah & Partners are Gojek's legal advisors and Allen & Overy LLP is Tokopedia's legal advisor.

New construction starts have jumped by a fifth in the six months ended March to 3.1 million square feet, Deloitte's London Office Crane Survey showed, with 56% of the pipeline expected to involve an extensive upgrade of existing office stock.
Lockdowns since early last year have forced millions of people to work from home, but easing restrictions are driving companies to chart a return with less hot desking, more room and better health regulations. 
""Occupiers' needs are shifting and buildings that meet their ESG principles while taking into account the welfare of their people are top of mind. Grade A, well-connected and eco-friendly office spaces, designed to maximise the benefits of new ways of working, will be the most desirable,"" said Mike Cracknell, director in real estate at Deloitte.
The survey showed 4.5 million square feet of development has been delivered between October 2020 and March 2021, the highest level of completions in 18 years. In a sign of less speculative building, 59% of that was pre-let. 
The survey also showed that the share of Technology, Media and Telecoms (TMT) pre-lets in all space under construction increased to 40%, reaffirming the importance of the TMT sector in the London leasing market.

Still, many companies have embraced work-from-home as a cost effective and flexible option that is here to stay, hurting demand for work spaces in London. 
The city's developers anticipate new working patterns to reduce office demand on average by 10% to 15% in terms of square footage.

Investing.com – Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) shares were up more than 16% in Monday’s premarket after AT&T (NYSE:T) confirmed reports it will spin off its media assets and merge them with the company behind TLC and Animal Planet.
AT&T shares were up too, rising more than 4%.
The merger of AT&T’s WarnerMedia unit with Discovery will create a new streaming giant with a market value of around $150 billion, according to various reports.
WarnerMedia houses HBO, CNN and the Warner Brothers movie studio and accounts for nearly half of AT&T’s $230 billion market capitalization.
Discovery’s unscripted cooking and home refurbishment shows account for a large part of its $18 billion market valuation.
Parting with media assets underscores AT&T’s struggles as it tries to cut its debt of $169 billion and strengthen its 5G network.
The deal could give Discovery ammunition to take on the likes of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) in the booming streaming business.

HEATHROW AIRPORT, England (Reuters) -The bosses of British Airways and London's Heathrow Airport urged the UK government on Monday to open up more routes for travel, including to the United States, and to simplify the testing hurdles needed to fly.
Britain lifted a ban on international movement on Monday but the government has designated only 12 countries and territories safe for quarantine-free travel on its ""green list"", limiting any recovery in the industry.
""What's crucial is that travel becomes easier for people,"" said British Airways Chief Executive Sean Doyle at a joint press conference. 
He said a meaningful return of flying this summer, needed to help airlines and travel companies survive after over a year of COVID-19 restrictions, would require the government to relax some measures.
But there is scant political appetite for doing so. 
Ministers have said people should not go on holiday to countries which are not on the green list, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday that it would not be extended any time soon because of the risk of new variants.
Heathrow said the limited reopening meant that it had 11,000 people flying out on Monday, up from 7,000 a day last week but well below the 120,000 typical at this time of year pre-pandemic.
BA said it was flying just a fraction of the 200 flights per day it would usually be operating in this period.
The United States, the Caribbean, France, Greece and Spain should all make it onto the green list before the summer, said the two bosses. 
""We are calling on the government to help people to plan ahead by publishing a list of countries expected to be on the green list for the summer,"" said Heathrow's Chief Executive John Holland-Kaye. 
The bosses also said fully vaccinated people should not require a COVID-19 test upon return from a low-risk country, and that a cheaper lateral flow test should be sufficient for those who are not vaccinated.
Multiple COVID-19 testing requirements can cost more than the flight for some people. Different country requirements are also hampering a travel bounceback.
At Heathrow, there was joy for some, permitted to travel again after four and a half months of lockdown restrictions. 
Erica Stolton, 29, was heading to Madrid to introduce her baby to her family for the first time. ""It feels absolutely magical. It's been really hard, the situation with this pandemic,"" she said. 
Some others were left disappointed. Jane Sunley, 60, was turned away from her flight to Mykonos, Greece on Monday for not having filled in forms 24 hours before departure. 

""We'll lose our flights, we'll lose our hotel, there's not another flight until Friday,"" she said. ""It's not simple, is it?"" 
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday a tough border regime would stay in place for the foreseeable future. The UK has low overall infection rates thanks largely to the success of its vaccine rollout, but concerns are growing about a fast-spreading variant first identified in India.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening lower Monday, handing back some of the gains of the previous session ahead of the release of the latest minutes from the April Federal Reserve meeting.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 125 points, or 0.4%, S&P 500 Futures traded 14 points, or 0.4%, lower, and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 60 points, or 0.4%.
The broad-based S&P 500 rose 1.5% on Friday, its biggest one-day jump in more than a month, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.3%. However, all three indices still ended the week lower, posting their worst week since Feb. 26, on the back of hefty losses early in the week when fears of runaway inflation - with the CPI at its highest since 2008, -prompted investors to sell.
The CPI release intensified fears that the Federal Reserve could be forced to start tapering its ultra-easy monetary policies sooner than the central bank is currently guiding.
With this in mind, the Fed’s minutes from its last meeting, released Wednesday, and will be studied carefully to see if it offers any new clues on policymakers’ thinking.
In corporate news, the first-quarter earnings season is coming to the close, with more than 90% of the S&P 500 companies having reported their results. 
The media sector is likely to be in focus following reports that telecoms giant AT&T (NYSE:T) is nearing a deal to combine its media assets, including CNN and HBO, with Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA), the owner of a number of cooking, nature and science shows.
The deal would confirm the importance of streaming in terms of TV viewing, where scale is required to take on the likes of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS).
JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) is also likely to be in the spotlight after the Chinese online retail giant’s logistics arm said it would aim to raise some $3.4 billion through an IPO in Hong Kong of a 10% stake.
Oil prices edged lower Monday as new Covid-19 restrictions in parts of Asia raised concerns of reduced demand in the region.
Worries are growing that the highly transmissible coronavirus variant which has hit India so hard is spreading to other countries. Singapore and Taiwan, are seeing new outbreaks, while Japan has further expanded a state of emergency casting fresh doubt over its ability to host the Tokyo Olympics in July.
That said, losses are small as China and the U.S., the two biggest oil consumers in the world, and most of Western Europe are reopening in the wake of successful Covid-19 vaccination programs. 
U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% lower at $65.27 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.2% to $68.60. The two contracts jumped nearly 2.5% on Friday and managed to book a small gain last week, marking a third consecutive weekly increase.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.7% to $1,850.15/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.2166.

RCS launched arbitration proceedings in late 2018 to nullify the 2013 sale of its historic headquarters in central Milan to Blackstone, saying the U.S. investment firm had paid too low a price at a time when RCS faced financial difficulties. 
The Milan tribunal rejected all claims advanced by RCS on Friday, a court document seen by Reuters showed.
Shares in RCS Mediagroup were down 3.4% and Cairo Communication stocks fell 7.2% by 0900 GMT, compared with a broadly flat market.
A Milan-based analyst said the shares fell because of concerns that RCS now faced financial risks as a result of two U.S. lawsuits filed by Blackstone that had been put on hold pending the Italian arbitration ruling. 
Blackstone declined to comment. RCS referred to comments it made on Friday after the arbitral award, saying the ruling confirmed the group did not act ""unfairly or recklessly"".
It had said on Friday that this ""strengthens the position of the company before the Supreme Court of the State of New York"".
The U.S. investment firm previously filed two lawsuits in New York accusing RCS of falsely claiming it still owned the building and of improperly blocking its sale to Germany's Allianz (DE:ALVG). RCS denies any wrongdoing.
A source close to Blackstone said it was seeking up to $600 million in damages from the Italian publisher and from its chairman and main shareholder Urbano Cairo, who took control of the company in 2016.

RCS' financial report, published on its website, shows it has not set aside risk provisions for the legal dispute.
Italian broker Banca Akros wrote in a report on Monday it was ""very sceptical of the actual chances for Blackstone in winning a large compensation"".

GENEVA (Reuters) - The head of UNICEF on Monday asked G7 countries to donate supplies to the COVAX vaccine-sharing scheme as an emergency measure to address a severe shortfall caused by disruption to Indian vaccine exports.
India has curbed exports of the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) vaccine made by its Serum Institute, which had been pledged to COVAX, to be used by the country as it battles a massive second wave of infections.
U.N. agency UNICEF, which is in charge of supplying coronavirus vaccines through COVAX, estimates the supply shortfall at 140 million doses by the end of May and about 190 million by the end of June.
""Sharing immediately available excess doses is a minimum, essential and emergency stop-gap measure, and it is needed right now,"" said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore, adding that this could help to prevent vulnerable countries from becoming the next global hotspot.
As G7 leaders prepare to meet in Britain next month, the head of the World Health Organization last week denounced the ""moral catastrophe"" of vaccine inequity, urging wealthy countries to donate doses rather than use them for children who are less vulnerable to severe disease.
Citing new research from scientific information and analytics company Airfinity, UNICEF's Fore said that G7 countries could donate about 153 million doses if they shared only 20% of their available supply over June, July and August.
This could be done while still meeting commitments to vaccinate their own populations, she said without providing further detail.

COVAX, run jointly by the WHO and the GAVI vaccine alliance, relies heavily on the AstraZeneca shot, which accounts for the bulk of the vaccines earmarked for early rollout as it seeks to provide 2 billion doses this year. 
UNICEF said that other manufacturing limitations outside India had also slowed supply of COVAX doses but those delays are expected to be resolved by the end of June.

The mobile and broadband provider has entrusted the sale of Zeleris, which operates around the world and employs 1,200 people, to consultancy firm Ernst & Young, which valued the asset at up to 100 million euros ($121 million), said the source, who is familiar with the logistics sector. 
A spokesman for Telefonica declined to comment. Ernst & Young was not immediately available for comment. 
If realised, the divestment would represent another step towards reducing Telefonica's high debt following the sale of its mobile mast business, Telxius, to American Tower (NYSE:AMT) for 7.7 billion euros earlier this year.
Telefonica's strategy has so far included signing on investors in its Brazilian, Chilean and German businesses, swapping its data centres for equity, and joining its British brand O2 with Virgin Media in a 31.4 billion pound merger ($44.28 billion).

Last week, Telefonica's quarterly results prompted relief among investors, although CFO Laura Abasolo told analysts that up to 1 billion euros of the Telxius sale proceeds would go not to reducing debt, but paying future rental contracts for the mobile towers.

LONDON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Oil major BP (NYSE:BP) has lobbied for the EU to support natural gas, a move that exposes divergent views among investors and reflects a wider European dispute about the role of the fossil fuel in the transition to a lower-carbon world.
The European Commission - aiming to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 - had planned to omit gas-fuelled power plants from a new list of investments that can be marketed as sustainable, but delayed the decision last month following complaints from some countries and companies. 
Britain's BP was among those lobbying against the plan. In a December 2020 response to the Commission's public consultation on the issue, it said the new rules could threaten financing of gas projects, and obstruct a shift away from more polluting coal. 
BP called for an increase in the emission limits that gas plants would have to meet to allow them to be labelled green without requiring the immediate installation of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, which is still deemed too expensive for wide-scale use.
Natural gas emits roughly half the CO2 emissions of coal when burned in power plants. But gas infrastructure is also associated with emissions of the greenhouse gas methane.
When asked about its lobbying, BP said it strongly supported the EU's climate goals. It added that natural gas was enabling the transition from coal.
However investors gave mixed responses when asked whether BP's championing of gas was at odds with its pledge to support the Paris Agreement. As well as committing to bringing carbon emissions from the barrels it produces to net zero by 2050, the company has pledged to align its lobbying activities to support net-zero carbon policies.
Natasha Landell-Mills, head of stewardship at asset manager Sarasin and Partners, said BP's lobbying raised questions about its commitments. 
""If their capex (capital expenditure) was oriented towards full decarbonisation by 2050, then you'd naturally expect to see lobbying align with this goal. The fact it seems to be pushing the other way suggests a problem,"" she added.
Others, though, pointed to the question of what aligning with the Paris Agreement means in practice.
""It's not like a standard setter has said 'here, exactly, is what Paris-aligned means, industry by industry',"" said John Streur, CEO at U.S. asset manager Calvert Research and Management.
Another institutional investor, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he did not see a problem with BP's response and that there was no blueprint for what Paris-aligned means, adding however it was not a good time ""to stick your head out"".
'FAIR TRANSITION'
The European Commission had originally said gas plants must emit below 100g of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilowatt hour (CO2e/kWh) to be labelled green - a level even the use of CCS would make it tough to achieve, according to BP.
In its December submission to the Commission, BP urged the EU to set a higher emissions limit to encourage power suppliers to shift more capacity to gas from coal plants.
""Natural gas should have a dedicated threshold, above the current 100g CO2e/kWh, to reflect its role to facilitate an affordable and fair energy transition by enabling a shift away from coal in power generation and heating, providing dispatchable power to complement renewables and offering an alternative fuel in transport,"" it said.
BP is far from alone in its support of gas. 
At least nine EU countries, including Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, lobbied the Commission to label gas plants as sustainable, documents seen by Reuters showed. Other governments including Denmark, Spain and Ireland urged Brussels to exclude the fuel. 
European oil and gas producer Eni criticised the 100 g/kWH threshold as too low in December, while a group including Total and Repsol (OTC:REPYY) signed an open letter from several energy firms in support of gas as a means to replace coal in the energy mix.
""Any tonne we don't emit today is much more valuable in terms of avoiding global warming then a tonne that is with the best intention avoided in 2040,"" said Mario Mehren, Chief Executive of Wintershall Dea, who signed that letter.
'UNABATED GAS'
The Paris Agreement set a target to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and aim for 1.5 degrees. 
The EU aims to cut its net greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030, from 1990 levels, and eliminate them by 2050. 
The role of gas depends on factors such as what volume of emissions can be captured and stored in the future, and fixing methane leaks from gas infrastructure, said Joeri Rogelj, a lead author on Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports and Director of Research at the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London.
""In that context, unabated gas, without carbon capture and storage, is not part of the key sustainable investments,"" he added.

Sandrine Dixson-Declève, co-president of the Club of Rome think-tank and one of the EU's expert advisers on the sustainable finance taxonomy, said the rules needed to reflect climate science.
""No one is denying that gas can help the transition, but that does not mean it is Paris Agreement compliant.""

By Sarah White
PARIS (Reuters) - The reopening of Paris museums this week finally gives billionaire tycoon Francois Pinault the chance to showcase his vast contemporary art collection in the French capital, with works ranging from stuffed pigeons to slowly melting chairs.
The museum's launch in a converted 19th-century commodities exchange, blocks away from the Louvre, was put on hold twice due to the coronavirus pandemic after having suffered earlier planning mishaps, with an initial project abandoned in 2005.
Pinault, 84 - who made his fortune in timber trading before shifting into retail under the group now known as  Kering  (PA:PRTP), run by his son - joins rival French luxury goods tycoon Bernard Arnault in trying to stamp his legacy on Paris' art scene and landscape, with museums and renovation projects.
But the Bourse de Commerce - Pinault Collection, opening on May 22, will also give visitors a glimpse of the businessman's vast trove of art purchases since the 1980s, including pieces by photographer Cindy Sherman and painter Peter Doig. 
The 200 works on display for the opening, many straight out of storage, feature artists who have never had restrospectives in France, such Kerry James Marshall, known for his paintings of Black figures and explorations of African-American history. 
An ephemeral work by Swiss-born artist Urs Fischer will take centre stage at the launch, with wax sculptures installed in the central space, including of chairs and a marble-like statue, set to slowly melt over six months as they are set alight.
Overhead, stuffed pigeons peer down into the gallery, in an art installation called ""Others"" by Maurizio Cattelan designed to give visitors a startling sense of being observed. 
The project follows Pinault's attempt to build a new museum in western Paris on the site of a former  Renault  (PA:RENA) car factory, which became bogged down in wrangling with local authorities. The billionaire has since opened two museums in Venice, Italy. 
Arnault, who is behind the LVMH luxury goods conglomerate, built his Louis Vuitton foundation in the west of the French capital, opening the futuristic ship-like Frank Gehry design to public exhibits in 2014. 
The Cartier Foundation, linked to the jewellery brand owned by Switzerland's Richemont, has been a cultural hotspot for contemporary art exhibits in Paris since the 1980s.
CROWDED ART
Many museums in France are re-opening for the first time since October on May 19 as COVID-19 restrictions ease. The Bourse de Commerce - Pinault Collection will welcome 600-700 visitors a day, a reduced intake compared to its 1,700 capacity. 
In Paris' crowded art world, once dominated by public institutions, private museums now offer a fresh perspective, the Bourse de Commerce's managing director Martin Bethenod said. 
""Now it's a much more balanced art scene, it's a kind of ecosystem in which private and public can work together,"" Bethenod told Reuters. 
Housed in a circular former grain trading hall, the Bourse de Commerce's exterior has been restored, while inside old and new mingle. A cement walkway imagined by Japanese architect Tadao Ando gives visitors a closer view of the imposing glass dome, as well as a late 19th-century painting depicting an antiquated Europe-centric world view, with colonial stereotypes. 

Part of the concept was to keep the work, in a form of dialogue with contemporary artists, Bethenod said. 
""Mr Pinault's point of view is very much linked to issues in society, social issues, political issues, gender issues, cultural issues,"" he added.

Profit for the year ended in March came in at 777 billion yen ($7.11 billion) compared with 528.2 billion yen a year ago, MUFG said in a statement. That also compared with an average estimate of 708.9 billion yen from eight analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.
MUFG's profit in the three months through March was 170 billion yen, compared to a 56.1 billion yen loss in the same period a year earlier, according to Reuters' calculations based on the bank's statement.
Japanese banks have seen an increase in lending as companies rushed to borrow amid the COVID-19 pandemic, while low interest rates and a shrinking population have eroded their profits. Bank lending in Japan rose 4.8% in April from a year earlier, according the Bank of Japan. 
MUFG, which owns about 20% of Wall Street bank  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), booked 515.5 billion yen of credit-related costs in the last financial year, up from an initially expected 500 billion yen.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia's troubled casino operator Crown Resorts on Monday rejected an all-cash $6.5 billion buyout proposal from Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) as too low, but said it was seeking more information from rival suitor Star Entertainment Group.
The rebuff comes as Crown, which has prized tourism and real estate assets in major Australian cities, faces intense regulatory scrutiny and is grappling with a slump in profits due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Crown said while it had considered a range of scenarios given regulatory enquiries, the U.S. private equity giant's offer of A$12.35 per share or A$8.4 billion did not take into account the full value of its assets, a potential jump in earnings once the pandemic eases and plans to pay down a significant amount of debt.
Blackstone, which owns 10% of Crown, declined to comment. It has not had access to Crown's books, said a person familiar with the matter who was not authorised to comment publicly and declined to be identified.
In contrast to Blackstone, Star has made an all-stock offer that it argues values Crown in excess of A$14 per Crown share or A$9 billion.
Crown said in a separate statement it had not yet formed a view on the merits of the Star merger proposal but had asked for certain information to better understand preliminary matters. 
Its shares were up 0.8% on Monday at A$$13.15. Star's shares also gained, climbing 1%.
Star's proposal is expected to attract antitrust scrutiny since it would create a single gambling behemoth in Australia without a competitor.
Crown has also received a proposal by Oaktree Capital Group to bankroll a A$3 billion purchase of founder James Packer's 37% stake to remove regulatory concerns. 
Crown executives on Monday were facing their first day of six-week hearings at a government-mandated inquiry in Victoria to assess whether Crown is fit to keep its operating licence in the country's second most populous state and the home of its largest operating casino. 
That enquiry was called after Crown was found by a separate probe in Sydney to have enabled money laundering on its premises and knowingly dealt with tour operators linked to organised crime. That probe cited the influence of Packer over the Crown board as a governance problem.

Crown, which lost its CEO in the inquiry fallout, said this month it had appointed Steve McCann, the head of property developer Lendlease Group to the role.

336,By Investing.com,"<span>May 17, 2021 03:49AM ET</span>",European Stocks Edge Lower; Bayer Hit by Court Ruling,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets edged lower Monday, as investors weighed concerns over a rise in global inflation as well as disappointing Chinese economic data.
At 3:55 AM ET (0855 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.1%, and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.3%.
European stock markets struggled last week after U.S. consumer prices jumped at the fastest rate since 2008, increasing worries that the Federal Reserve could be forced to start tapering its easy monetary policy earlier than guided.
This weak tone has continued Monday after data showed that China’s economy, the second largest in the world, is continuing to grow but the recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic is uneven and still has a long way to go.
Chinese industrial production grew 9.8% year-on-year in April, a healthy increase but lower than March’s 14.1%, and retail sales increased 17.7% in April year-on-year, below March’s 34.2% growth.
In corporate news, Ryanair (LON:RYA) stock rose 0.8% after the budget Irish airline said there were signs the recovery had begun even as it reported a record annual after-tax loss due to Covid-19 restrictions forcing it to scrap over 80% of its flights last year. The airline wasn't able to give formal guidance for the current year, due to uncertainty over the pace of reopening in Europe.
Stellantis (PA:STLA) stock rose 0.9% after the automaker said it would announce a strategic partnership with iPhone assembler Foxconn on Tuesday, likely involving the building of electric cars and internet-connected vehicles in China.
On the flip side, Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) stock fell 1.8% after a U.S. federal appeals court upheld a $25 million judgment and trial verdict finding the company's Roundup caused a California resident's non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
Italian consumer price data are due later in the session, the highlight of Monday’s thin European economic data slate.
Oil prices edged higher Monday, continuing the recent gains as China and the U.S., the two biggest oil consumers in the world, and most of Western Europe reopen in the wake of successful Covid-19 vaccination programs. 
However, gains are small as worries grow that the highly transmissible coronavirus variant which has hit India so hard is spreading to other countries. Singapore and Taiwan, are seeing new outbreaks, while Japan has further expanded a state of emergency casting fresh doubt over its ability to host the Tokyo Olympics in July. 
U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% higher at $65.50 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $68.78. The two contracts jumped nearly 2.5% on Friday and managed to book a small gain last week, marking a third consecutive weekly increase.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.9% to $1,853.75/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.2137.

337,By Reuters,"<span>May 17, 2021 03:36AM ET</span>","Long working hours are a killer, WHO study shows","By Emma Farge
GENEVA (Reuters) - Working long hours is killing hundreds of thousands of people a year in a worsening trend that may accelerate further due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization said on Monday.
In the first global study of the loss of life associated with longer working hours, the paper in the journal Environment International showed that 745,000 people died from stroke and heart disease associated with long working hours in 2016.
That was an increase of nearly 30% from 2000.
""Working 55 hours or more per week is a serious health hazard,"" said Maria Neira, director of the WHO's Department of Environment, Climate Change and Health.
""What we want to do with this information is promote more action, more protection of workers,"" she said.
The joint study, produced by the WHO and the International Labour Organization, showed that most victims (72%) were men and were middle-aged or older. Often, the deaths occurred much later in life, sometimes decades later, than the shifts worked. 
It also showed that people living in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific region -- a WHO-defined region which includes China, Japan and Australia -- were the most affected.
Overall, the study - drawing on data from 194 countries - said that working 55 hours or more a week is associated with a 35% higher risk of stroke and a 17% higher risk of dying from ischemic heart disease compared with a 35-40 hour working week.
The study covered the period 2000-2016, and so did not include the COVID-19 pandemic, but WHO officials said the surge in remote working and the global economic slowdown resulting from the coronavirus emergency may have increased the risks.
""The pandemic is accelerating developments that could feed the trend towards increased working time,"" the WHO said, estimating that at least 9% of people work long hours. 
WHO staff, including its chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, say they have been working long hours during the pandemic and Neira said the U.N. agency would seek to improve its policy in light of the study.

Capping hours would be beneficial for employers since that has been shown to increase worker productivity, WHO technical officer Frank Pega said.
""It's really a smart choice not to increase long working hours in an economic crisis.""

338,By Reuters,"<span>May 17, 2021 02:46AM ET</span>","Next Digital shares halted, jailed owner Lai pleads guilty to illegal HK assembly","By Donny Kwok and James Pomfret
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Next Digital Ltd shares were suspended on Monday after authorities froze assets of its jailed owner Jimmy Lai under a new national security law in Hong Kong, while the tycoon pleaded guilty to taking part in an illegal protest in October 2019.
The shares will remain on a trading halt ahead of a company announcement regarding the freeze in Lai's assets, including his majority stake in the pro-democracy media publisher, Next Digital said. 
The move against Lai's assets has raised worries about the future of Next Digital, which he has been keeping afloat with loans, although the company's CEO has said that the frozen assets have no link with its bank accounts.
Given this is the first time a listed firm has been targeted under the new security law imposed by China in 2020, it also fuels concerns about the broader investment environment in the Asian financial hub.
Lai, a democracy activist and staunch Beijing critic, was sentenced to 14 months in prison for taking part in unauthorised assemblies during anti-government protests in Hong Kong in 2019, and is among the most high profile arrests made under the security law. He faces three alleged charges under the new law, including collusion with a foreign country.
Lai and nine other activists pleaded guilty in the District Court to charges of organising an unauthorised assembly on Oct. 1, 2019, China's national day, as a trial began on Monday. 
Lai's guilty plea was widely expected after a similar plea in his previous illegal assembly trial https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-security-idUSKBN2BU11S. 
Sentencing is expected on May 28.
Lai has a 71.26% stake in Next Digital worth around HK$350 million ($45 million) based on Friday's closing share price. 
But the freeze of assets belonging to Lai will not affect company operations as the frozen assets have nothing to do with Next Digital's bank accounts, CEO Cheung Kim-hung told the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily newspaper.
Next Digital runs Apple Daily, Hong Kong's most influential pro-democracy newspaper.
A senior management source at Apple Daily told Reuters last week, before the asset freeze was announced on Friday, that the group had tried to ""firewall"" its media operations from Lai's other businesses, but they believed authorities still had ways to ""neuter"" the paper, without elaborating.
""It's simply a matter of if they want to do it. If they want to move (on us), they'll move,"" the source said.
CASH-STRAPPED
Without fresh cash injections, Next Digital can only survive another nine or 10 months, Apple Daily cautioned on Saturday. 
A shareholder's loan of HK$756 million, of which HK$500 million had been drawn as of end-September, was an ""important source of funding"" and may not be available anymore given the freeze, the paper added.
The group's bank borrowings amounted to HK$262.3 million as of end-September, repayable within three years. Its net cash position was HK$228.7 million at the time.
The paper reported on Friday its Taiwan arm would stop publishing its print version given declining advertising revenue and more difficult business conditions in Hong Kong linked to politics. It said ""pro-China forces"" in Hong Kong were boycotting various advertising resources.
Authorities say media freedom is intact, but have warned China's national security is a red line. 

Officials have criticised Apple Daily's coverage and flagged the introduction of a ""fake news"" law. 
""I just hope that you know our friends outside can withstand the continuing oppression that we are witnessing in Hong Kong, especially with the media,"" Avery Ng, one of the 10 defendants in Monday's illegal assembly trial, said before entering court.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair fears it may not take delivery of its first 737 MAX aircraft until after its peak summer period and the Irish airline is ""quite upset with Boeing (NYSE:BA)"", Group Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said on Monday. 
But he said he believed the production issues would resolve in the medium term and said the Irish airline, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, was in talks with Boeing about a significant order of the larger, 230-seat, MAX 10 aircraft. 
The largest European customer of the MAX with 210 firm orders of the 197-seat MAX200 model, Ryanair in late March said it expected that before summer it would take delivery of 16 of the aircraft, down from an earlier forecast of 40. 
But Boeing is now promising the first delivery of the jet, which has been delayed in part due to a recent electrical grounding issue, in late May.
""We are now being told the first delivery will be in late May. I am not sure we necessarily believe that,"" O'Leary said in a pre-recorded presentation following the release of the company's full-year results. 
""As the management team in Seattle continues to mismanage that process I think there is a real risk we might not see any of these aircraft in advance of summer 2021,"" O'Leary said. 
Ryanair was initially due to take delivery of its first MAX two years ago before the jet was grounded for 20 months after two fatal crashes. 
The airline has agreed ""reasonable and fair"" compensation for that delay, it said in its results statement on Monday. 
Ryanair is confident it will have 60 of the aircraft in place for the summer of 2022, he said. 
Ryanair remains in talks with Boeing for a significant order of the larger MAX 10 aircraft, but ""we are not quite there on price yet,"" Chief Financial Officer Neil Sorahan said in an interview.

Asked how big such a deal would be, Sorahan said it would cover both fleet renewal and growth in the 2026 to 2030 period. 
""We don't tend to do small deals,"" he said.

340,By Reuters,"<span>May 17, 2021 02:41AM ET</span>",UK firms seek staff after lockdown but foreign workers missing - survey,"LONDON (Reuters) -British businesses ramped up their search for new staff as pubs, restaurants and other hospitality and travel firms got ready for Monday's lifting of coronavirus restrictions in England, a survey showed.
But an exodus of foreign workers is aggravating a shortage of candidates, with more than 10 jobs on offer for every job-seeker in some cities, according to the survey by job search website Adzuna.
Job adverts on Adzuna jumped to 987,800 in the first week of May, up by 18% from the end of March, which was before the reopening of non-essential retailers and hospitality firms for outdoor service on April 12.
A further lifting of restrictions to allow pub and restaurants to serve customers indoors takes place in England on Monday.
Adzuna said companies seeking to hire included pub firms  Whitbread  (LON:WTB), Stonegate Pub Company and JD (NASDAQ:JD) Wetherspoons, restaurant chains Nando's and Pizza Express, Marriott hotels and airline Ryanair.
However, a lot of workers had given up on looking for hospitality and retail jobs in favour of more secure work after three lockdowns in the past year, it said. 
""There are also far fewer foreign workers seeking employment in the UK with overseas interest in UK jobs more than halving from before the pandemic, hitting these industries hard,"" Andrew Hunter, a co-founder of Adzuna, said.
Adzuna said 250,000 fewer job-seekers from western Europe and North America applied for work in the United Kingdom per month between February and April than before pre-pandemic.
""UK employers can no longer rely on overseas workers to plug employment gaps,"" Hunter said.
A combination of Brexit and the coronavirus pandemic are believed to have cut the number of foreign workers in Britain.
Britain's statistics office estimates the number of non-UK nationals employed in the country in the last three months of 2020 fell by 4.0% from the same period of 2019 to 4.22 million, based on tax data, compared with a 2.6% fall for UK nationals to 24.0 million. 
Adzuna said there were 13 jobs on offer for each job-seeker in Manchester while the ratio in Cambridge and Oxford stood at 11. In Maidstone, southeast England, there were 20 jobs for every job-seeker.
The shortage of workers is not unique to Britain. Hospitality firms in parts of the United States have said their holiday seasons are threatened by a lack of staff, echoing recent problems in Australia. 
A feared surge in job losses in Britain has not happened, thanks largely to a massive public jobs subsidy scheme. That furlough scheme is due to be phased out over the summer before ending in September.
A separate survey showed British employers were the most optimistic about hiring since 2013 and basic pay expectations were set to increase from 1% to 2% in the next 12 months.

The survey by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development of more than 1,000 employers also found that redundancy intentions had returned to pre-pandemic levels.
""Despite the evident optimism in this quarter’s survey, it remains likely that  such strong employment growth will soften during the course of  2021,"" said Gerwyn Davies, senior labour market adviser at the CIPD.

In corporate news, Ryanair (LON:RYA) reported a record annual after-tax loss of 815 million euros ($989 million) on Monday after Covid-19 restrictions forced it to scrap over 80% of flights, but the Irish airline said there were signs the recovery had begun.
Oil prices edged lower Monday as new Covid-19 restrictions in parts of Asia raised concerns of reduced demand in the region.

Jahez International Company for Information Technology picked HSBC Saudi Arabia as the sole financial adviser and global coordinator for its potential IPO on Nomu, the Saudi stock exchange’s secondary market, which imposes lighter listing requirements to encourage smaller businesses and startups to raise equity.
Founded in 2016, the homegrown firm serves around 2 million customers in the kingdom, and processed about 20 million restaurant orders through its app in 2020, it said on Monday, without disclosing details about its potential valuation. It closed a $36.5 million funding round last year.
“We will continue to expand our platform to tap into new growth opportunities offered by rapid, technology-enabled changes in consumer behavior, both in Saudi Arabia and in the wider region,” said Ghassab Al Mandeel, chief executive officer at Jahez.
Food delivery companies have been flooded with cash from investors betting the pandemic brought a permanent shift in shopper habits.
Getir, Deliveroo
Startups including Turkish retail delivery app Getir and Berlin-based grocery delivery app Gorillas have rapidly hit billion-dollar valuations. In the U.K., Deliveroo raised 1.5 billion pounds ($2.1 billion) in its listing March 31 but then saw its shares plunge more than 30% in their debut.
Jahez is the biggest locally owned player in the kingdom, competing with the likes of Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc.-owned Careem Now and Delivery Hero SE-backed Hunger Station and Talabat. Jahez has also been expanding in other areas such as last-mile logistics and cloud kitchens.
The IPO could add to a string of listings in Saudi Arabia, where companies are taking advantage of investors’ demand for new offerings and as state entities look to raise money to bankroll efforts to diversify the economy.
Saudi grocery delivery app Nana also raised $18 million last year, tapping investors including venture capital fund STV and Middle East Venture Partners to expand across the Middle East.
Saudi Arabia’s consumer spending is on the mend, with its non-oil economy -- the engine of job creation -- rebounding in the first quarter to pre-pandemic levels following a recession.
Jahez said “an improving Saudi economy and the resulting rise in employment and disposable income” will fuel further food and e-commerce spending.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mixed Monday morning as some countries in the region deal with spikes in the number of COVID-19 cases and inflation worries continued to weigh on investor sentiment.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched down 0.01% by 10:38 PM ET (2:38 AM GMT) while the Shenzhen Component jumped 2.09%. Data released earlier in the day said that industrial production growth slowed down to 9.8% year-on-year in April.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 1.06%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.24% and South Korea’s KOSPI edged down 0.15%.
In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.69%. The Reserve Bank of Australia will publish the minutes of its latest meeting on Tuesday, and employment data for April, including employment change and unemployment rate figures, are due two days later.
Treasury yields steadied after their tumble on Friday. U.S. data released that day said that retail sales did not grow month-on-month in April.
COVID-19 was front and center in the region as Singapore and Taiwan deal with their latest outbreaks. A record 206 new cases were recorded in Taiwan on Sunday, while Singapore shifted primary, secondary, junior college and Millennia Institute students to full home-based learning from May 19 till the end of the school term on May 28.
Commodities seem to have hit pause on their recent rally, with copper and iron ore prices coming down from record highs amid Chinese efforts to cool red-hot prices.
Investors also remain concerned that central banks will start pulling back support earlier than expected as concerns about runaway inflation linger and continue to weigh on global stocks.
Investors also look to the minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s latest meeting, due to be released on Wednesday, for clues as to when the current dovish policy will be shifted.
“Record highs in copper prices and fears over extended oil price gains will be hard to ignore” heading into the second half of 2021, Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) global head of research Eric Robertsen said in a note.
“The Fed believes this is part of the economic reopening narrative, and for now, it is likely to let the dust settle. But it might start looking over its shoulder if prices stay high,” the note added.
Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester insisted that the Fed’s policy is currently in a good place while glossing over economic data that will be volatile as the economy reopens.
Mester’s colleagues, Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, will also speak later in the week.

(Reuters) -JD Logistics will price its shares between $HK39.36 and $HK43.36 each as the company aims to raise up to $3.4 billion, according to the company's filings, in one of Hong Kong's largest share sales in 2021. 
The logistics offshoot of JD (NASDAQ:JD).com Inc will sell 609.1 million shares in the deal which is 10% of the company's total shares, the filings said. 
An over-allotment option, or so-called greenshoe, exists to sell a further 91 million shares that would raise up to a further $510 million.
At that size, JD Logistics will be one of the biggest deals in Hong Kong this year following the Kuaishou Technology IPO in late January which raised $5.4 billion.
The company recorded 22.4 billion yuan ($3.5 billion) in revenue in the first quarter of 2021, up 64.1% from the same period in 2020. 
Its gross profit for the quarter reached 230.7 million yuan ($35.8 million), down 72.7% from the same time last year, which it blamed on the pandemic impact and adding 60,000 workers to its headcount during the year.
In its prospectus, JD Logistics said it expected an insignificant impact on its business from the Chinese government's tighter anti-monopoly regulations of internet platform businesses.
The company, it said, controls 2.7% of the integrated supply chain logistics market.
JD Logistics' IPO is expected by analysts to be a barometer of investor appetite towards major share sales following volatility in global equities markets over the past week, led by concerns inflation is starting to emerge around the world.
JD Logistics will be valued at $34 billion at the top of the price range and seven high profile cornerstone shareholders led by SoftBank Group Corp's Vision Fund and Temasek have taken shares worth up to $1.53 billion, or 45% of the IPO, according to the filings.
The final price will be set on Friday and the stock will start trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on May 28.
JD Logistics said 55% of the funds raised would be spent on upgrading its logistics network in the next 12 to 36 months, while a further 20% would go towards technology development. 
JD.com spun off its logistics unit into a standalone entity in 2017 and then opened up its delivery and warehousing services to third-party companies. 

JD.com carried out a Hong Kong secondary listing in June last year which raised $3.87 billion.

CAS Investment Partners in a letter to At Home's board of directors on Sunday said that it plans to vote against a $2.8 billion sale of the retailer to private-equity firm Hellman & Friedman.
CAS holds about 17% of the retailer's shares.
The shareholder believes the current deal to sell At Home for $36 per share ""grossly undervalues the company and deprives stockholders of anything resembling a fair premium"", the letter said, adding that it expects to contend for a more realistic valuation at $70 per share or more. 
At Home did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Wall Street Journal first reported that CAS plans to oppose the deal to sell the retailer at $36 per share. 
The move comes as hedge fund Honest Capital said on Tuesday that it opposes the deal between At Home and Hellman & Friedman, even as the U.S. home goods retailer searches for a higher bid.
Honest Capital wrote to the company's board of directors to argue the $36-per-share all-cash deal was too low a valuation for At Home, given that it has plans to more than double its number of stores to 600 and consumers have more cash to spruce up their decor.
Earlier this month, At Home Group said that Hellman & Friedman will take the company private in a deal valued at $2.8 billion, at a time when demand for home decor and home-furnishing products is booming.

(Reuters) -Gasoline shortages that have plagued the U.S. East Coast slowly eased on Sunday, with 1,000 more stations receiving supplies as the country's largest fuel pipeline network recovered from a crippling cyberattack.
The six-day closure of Colonial Pipeline's 5,500-mile (8,900-km) system was the most disruptive cyberattack on record, preventing millions of barrels of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel from reaching fuel tanks throughout the eastern United States.
Thousands of gas stations ran dry as supplies failed to arrive and drivers fearing a prolonged outage filled tanks and jerry cans. Refiners and fuel distributors are racing to recover before the Memorial Day holiday weekend at the end of May, the traditional start of the peak-demand summer driving season.
""Colonial Pipeline is currently shipping at normal rates, based on shipper nominations,"" company spokesman Eric Abercrombie said in an email. ""It will take some time for the supply chain to fully catch up.""
In Washington, D.C., about 70% of stations were still empty, according to tracking firm GasBuddy.
Elsewhere, more than half of the stations were still out in North Carolina, while less than half of stations were without fuel in South Carolina, Maryland, Virginia and Georgia, GasBuddy data showed.
U.S. gasoline demand on Saturday dropped nearly 15% from a week earlier, according to GasBuddy, as drivers pulled back on fuel hoarding. 
Widespread panic buying even caused shortages in some areas not served by the pipeline.
Average nationwide gasoline prices are at their highest since 2014, with a gallon of regular unleaded at $3.04 on Sunday, up from $2.96 a week ago, according to the American Automobile Association.
U.S. gasoline futures opened in Asian trade on Sunday at $2.1271 a gallon, down from a three-year high of $2.2170 a week ago, Refinitiv Eikon data showed. 
'GETTING BETTER'
Overall outages stood at 12,405 stations, down from 13,450 on Saturday and a peak of more than 16,000, said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, as panic buying ebbed and stations replenished supplies. There are around 150,000 gas stations in the United States, the world's largest oil consumer.
""Every day, gasoline supplies are getting better as Colonial operates at capacity and additional oil tankers from the Gulf Coast make their way to the East Coast,"" said Andy Lipow of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston.
Citgo and  Valero Energy  Corp (NYSE:VLO) were among the refiners to receive Jones Act waivers to ship fuel on waterborne vessels from the U.S. Gulf Coast to help ease the fuel crunch. 
Operators of the Colonial system, which transports 100 million gallons of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel daily to East Coast markets from Texas refineries, began resuming operations on Wednesday following the six-day outage. 
Alpharetta, Georgia-based Colonial said it would resume its regular nomination process on Monday to allocate capacity to companies that use the line.
DarkSide, the group blamed for attacking Colonial Pipeline systems, has said it recently hacked four other companies. A website it used to communicate went dark last week. 
Websites tied to two other ransomware groups not connected to the Colonial hack also were unreachable in a likely retreat amid the hunt for perpetrators, Allan Liska, a researcher with cybersecurity firm Recorded Future, said on Sunday.

""This is a disruption,"" he said of the groups' lower profile, adding: ""I don’t think it’s going to be a permanent disruption.""
Bloomberg News and the New York Times said Colonial paid nearly $5 million to DarkSide hackers, but the company has not confirmed the ransom demand or the payment.

348,By Reuters,"<span>May 16, 2021 07:26PM ET</span>",AT&T close to deal to combine media empire with Discovery: reports,"(Reuters) - U.S. telecoms giant AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) is nearing a deal to combine its media assets, including CNN and HBO, with Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Inc, the owner of lifestyle TV networks such as HGTV and TLC, according to news reports citing unnamed sources.
The deal would mark the unwinding of AT&T's $108.7 billion acquisition of U.S. media conglomerate Time Warner in 2018, and it would underscore its recognition that TV viewership has moved to streaming, where scale is required to take on the likes of Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co.
The combination would create a new company separate from AT&T that could be valued at $150 billion, including debt, the Financial Times reported. Discovery currently has a market value including debt of about $30 billion. 
A deal could be announced later this week, according to Bloomberg News, which first reported the news.
Spokespeople for AT&T and Discovery declined to comment. 
The proposed deal would put together one of Hollywood's most powerful studios, home to the Harry Potter and Batman franchises, with Discovery's stable of unscripted home, cooking and nature and science shows.
With the acquisition of Time Warner, AT&T sought to create a media and telecoms powerhouse combining content and distribution. Yet this proved a costly strategy as it simultaneously sought to expand next generation wireless services, most recently borrowing $14 billion to buy more wireless spectrum.
AT&T has been seeking to unwind its debt-laden acquisitions and lighten its balance sheet. In February, it agreed to sell a third of satellite TV service DirecTV, which it purchased in 2015 for about $68 billion, to TPG Capital in a deal valuing the business at $16.25 billion.

HBO and HBO Max now have 63.9 million global subscribers, compared with more than 100 million for Walt Disney Co's Disney+ and 207.6 million for Netflix. 
Discovery, whose portfolio includes Animal Planet and the Discovery Channel, reaches 88.3 million homes in the United States. Its streaming service Discovery+ which launched in January has 15 million subscribers.

350,By Reuters,"<span>May 16, 2021 08:00AM ET</span>",Swiss parliament to look into Credit Suisse fiasco - paper,"ZURICH (Reuters) - A Swiss parliamentary committee will discuss the fallout from billions of dollars worth of losses at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) amid risk-management failures, bringing political scrutiny to bear on the financial sector, a Sunday paper reported.
""It's the politicians' turn on the Credit Suisse issue,"" the SonntagsZeitung quoted Prisca Birrer-Heimo, a Social Democrat member of the lower house's economic affairs committee, as saying ahead of committee hearings set for Monday and Tuesday.
Credit Suisse declined to comment on the report.
Political intervention in the private sector is unusual in Switzerland and the prospect for concrete action remains unclear despite the crisis at the country's second-biggest bank.
Credit Suisse is raising capital and has halted share buybacks, cut its dividend and revamped management after losing more than $5 billion from the collapse of investment fund Archegos and having to suspend asset management funds linked to insolvent British supply chain finance firm Greensill.
New Chairman Antonio Horta-Osorio has said the scale of the bank's problems is his biggest challenge yet, and promised a thorough review of what went so badly wrong.
Birrer-Heimo said the question was ""whether and how the regulation of the big banks needs to be tightened"", citing risk-management shortcomings, a bonus-driven incentive system, and the size of capital buffers banks must hold to ride out crises.
Even business-friendly politicians think it might be time for the public sector to weigh in, the paper said.
""We don't have an existential crisis today,"" former MP and Liberals party leader Philipp Mueller was quoted as saying, ""but I was still surprised that there have been no political reactions so far.""

FINMA has already opened proceedings against Credit Suisse in connection with Archegos and Greensill case and imposed extra capital requirements on the bank. 
Credit Suisse said this month it will keep limits on its risk-weighted assets and leverage while it remains under regulatory scrutiny.

On May 5, a Tesla Model 3 crashed into an overturned truck on a highway in Fontana, killing the Tesla driver and injuring the truck driver and a motorist who had stopped to help him.
The Associated Press news agency cited police as saying a preliminary investigation had determined the Tesla's driver assistant system Autopilot was engaged prior to the crash.
But in a correction issued late on Friday, police said, ""There has not been a final determination made as to what driving mode the Tesla was in."" 
Two videos of a man driving with his hands off the wheel were posted on the alleged Tiktok account of the victim, 35-year-old Steven Hendrickson of Running Springs in California. 
""What would do I do without my full self-driving Tesla after a long day at work,"" said a message on one. ""Coming home from LA after work, thank god, self-drive,"" said a comment on another video, adding, ""Best car ever!"" 
Tesla dubbed its driver assistant features ""Autopilot"" or ""Full Self-driving,"" which experts say could mislead consumers into believing the car can drive by itself.
On its website, Tesla said its Autopilot feature does not make the vehicle autonomous, however.
On his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) account, Hendrickson was shooting a video while driving on autopilot, saying, ""Don't worry. I am on autopilot."" 
Family members were not available for comment and Tesla, which has disbanded its public relations teams, was not immediately available for comment.
Tesla Club-SoCal, a group of Tesla owners in Southern California, said on social media that he was an active member who ""loved his Tesla."" He is survived by his wife and two children, it added. 
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has been investigating more than two dozen crashes of Tesla vehicles, including the Fontana crash and a high-profile one in Texas last month that killed two men. 

Since 2016 at least three Tesla vehicles operating on Autopilot have been in fatal crashes, two involving a Tesla car driving beneath a semi-truck in Florida. 
The U.S. transport safety board said Tesla's autopilot system failed to properly detect a truck as it crossed the car's path, contributing to the accidents also caused by a lack of driver attention and an adequate driver monitoring system.

352,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2021 10:21PM ET</span>",U.S. fuel crisis eases as pipeline returns to normal after hack,"By Jennifer Hiller and Stephanie Kelly
(Reuters) -Widespread gasoline shortages along the U.S. East Coast began to ease slightly on Saturday as the operator of the nation's biggest fuel pipeline said it was back to delivering ""millions of gallons per hour"" following last week's cyberattack.
Ships and trucks were deployed to fill up storage tanks after the six-day Colonial Pipeline shutdown, the most disruptive cyberattack on record, triggered widespread panic buying that left filling stations across the U.S. Southeast dry.
""We have returned the system to normal operations, delivering millions of gallons per hour to the markets we serve,"" said the company, which had begun gradual restart of the pipeline on Wednesday.
More than 13,400 gas stations surveyed in the east and south by fuel tracking app GasBuddy were experiencing outages on Saturday, down from 16,200 early the previous day.
On Saturday evening, about 75% of gas stations in Washington, D.C. were still without fuel, an improvement from Friday's figure of 88%, the app showed. Shortages also eased in North Carolina and Virginia, but were about the same in Georgia.
U.S. gasoline demand dropped 12.6% from the previous week, probably due to an easing of ""crazed"" panic buying just after the pipeline shut, said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy.
The nationwide average for a gallon of regular unleaded was $3.04 on Saturday, from $2.96 a week ago, according to AAA.
The pipeline outage accelerated increases in gasoline prices that were ""already rising due to higher crude prices and demand ahead of Memorial Day,"" said AAA spokeswoman Ellen Edmonds.
She was referring to the May 31 holiday that traditionally kicks off the U.S. summer driving season.
Places served by the pipeline saw the biggest price jumps this week - with Georgia and the Carolinas up 20 cents per gallon or more - but they should also see prices decline again as supplies improve, Edmonds said.
Florence, South Carolina had the nation's biggest price increase at 30 cents, while prices rose 9 cents in D.C.
Ships deployed under emergency waivers were also moving fuel from U.S. Gulf Coast refiners to the northeast, while 18-wheel tanker trunks were ferrying gasoline from Alabama to Virginia, helping to stem the shortages.
U.S. crude prices could edge higher as refiners process more oil to catch up from the gasoline storage that was drawn down while the pipeline was shuttered, said Robert Yawger, analyst at Mizuho Securities.
The approach of Memorial Day helps make ""the sense of urgency supersized"" for refiners, Yawger added.
In Washington, D.C., Dennis Li was stuck on Friday at a Sunoco gas station that was out of fuel. He had tried to find gas at four stations during the day, with no luck. 
""I'm running on empty to the point where I don't want to drive anymore,"" said Li, who is from Annapolis, Maryland. 
INITIAL BREACH UNKNOWN
The hacking group blamed for the attack, DarkSide, said it had hacked four other companies including a Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) subsidiary in Germany. 
Colonial Pipeline has not determined how the initial breach occurred, a spokeswoman said this week. The 5,500-mile (8,900-km) pipeline carries 100 million gallons of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel each day to East Coast markets from Texas refineries.
Colonial has not revealed how much money the hackers were seeking or whether it paid. Bloomberg News and the New York Times said it paid nearly $5 million.
Colonial said it would resume on Monday its regular nomination process, in which shippers seek space on the line.
It released a revised schedule to shippers, with estimated delivery dates. The schedule suggested that diesel loaded in Atlanta on Friday would arrive at the northernmost point in Linden, New Jersey, 10 days later, as would gasoline. 
Steve Boyd, a senior managing director at fuel delivery firm Sun Coast Resources, estimated that with gasoline moving on the pipeline at half Colonial's normal speed, it could take 12 to 20 days for new deliveries from Gulf Coast refineries to reach Linden. 

Sun Coast has 75 trucks taking supplies from terminals in Alabama and Georgia to retailers as far away as Virginia. 
""If customers need us for another week or three weeks, we'll be there,"" said Boyd.

ISS urged votes for Wirth but said Chevron could take additional steps to better manage climate-related risks, according to its report. While Chevron has pledged to limit the pace of growth of its carbon emissions that contribute to climate change, it has not set longer-term targets to achieve net zero as many European rivals have done.
The recommendations come ahead of the company's shareholder meeting on May 26. 
ISS also recommended backing other Chevron directors and is also in favor of shareholder proposals for reducing the emissions from customer use of the company's products, and developing a report on impacts of achieving net zero emissions by 2050.
The ISS recommendations carry weight among institutional investors and often guide how they vote at corporate meetings. 
London-based governance advisor Pensions & Investment Research Consultants (PIRC) has urged opposition to Wirth because of the company's combined board chairman and CEO roles, and support of several climate and governance proposals.

Chevron also faces shareholder proposals asking it to report more information on lobbying, become a public benefit corporation and split the board chairman and CEO roles after the next chief executive transition.
The company is recommending that its investors vote against the shareholder proposals, including the one for an independent board chair after the next chief executive transition.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan raised its coronavirus alert level on Saturday in the capital, Taipei, and the surrounding city, bringing curbs for a period of two weeks that will shut many venues and restrict gatherings in the wake of 180 new domestic infections.
Masks are to be worn outdoors for the first time, as the government encourages work and study from home, shutting cinemas and entertainment spots, while limiting gatherings of families and friends to five indoors and 10 outdoors.
Taipei's government has already ordered bars, nightclubs and similar venues to shut.
Health Minister Chen Shih-chung said a ""level of risk"" in certain hot spots, such as Taipei's gritty Wanhua district, had spurred the decision to raise the alert level.
""Only by doing this can infections be dealt with and controlled,"" he told reporters.
Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je urged people to stay home as much as possible, adding that schools teaching should move online.
""During this time, if you have nothing on, then stay at home and don't go out, and if you do, wear a mask to reduce infection from droplets,"" said Ko, a doctor by training.
President Tsai Ing-wen's spokesman said she would reduce the number of ""unnecessary meetings"" or public events. The presidential office is close to Wanhua.
Amid pictures on social media showed people flocking to supermarkets to stock up on toilet paper and instant noodles, the economy ministry took to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to assure people that supplies were ample and there was no need to hoard.
The rising community infections unnerved the stock market this week, though the government says the island's economic fundamentals remain good.
Deputy Finance Minister Frank Juan told Reuters authorities would watch market reaction on Monday, adding that he did not rule out calling a meeting of the National Stabilisation Fund, which the government can use to smooth large fluctuations.
Investors should act rationally, he said, pointing out that only a few sectors would be affected by the curbs, such as tourism, rather than the island's crucial foreign trade.
The new restrictions do not apply to the chip-manufacturing hub of Hsinchu, and are unlikely to affect exports of semiconductors, a global shortage of which has shut some car factories.
Chipmaking giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd said it was closely monitoring the situation, cutting non-essential gatherings and activities and reducing the movement of people across different chip fabs. 
Taiwan has millions of vaccine doses on order from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc, though only a small number have arrived from the latter due to global shortages and vaccination rates remain low.
More vaccines will start arriving next month, Tsai has said. 

Since the pandemic began, Taiwan has reported fewer than 1,500 cases among a population of about 24 million, most of them imported from abroad, but a recent rise in community transmissions has spooked residents.
The island has never gone into a full lockdown and its people are used to life carrying on near normal, despite the pandemic ranging in many other parts of the world.

The company has already started the search for a successor just as the airline industry battles to recover from the devastating impact on travel of the coronavirus pandemic.
EasyJet is desperate to start flying at scale again this summer, but COVID-19 restrictions remain in place and worries over the spread of the Indian variant in Britain are threatening to hamper the hoped-for travel bounce back. 
Barton's plan to step down was first reported by Sky News. The airline, which noted a nine-year term is the recommended maximum for best practice in corporate governance, said in an emailed statement Barton remained fully committed to his role.
It said it had hired an executive search agency to help find a successor and ensure an orderly transition.
EasyJet will report results for the six months to the end of March on Thursday. It has guided investors to expect pandemic restrictions on flying will push it to a loss of between 690 million pounds ($973 million) and 730 million.

From Monday, the airline will be able to fly Britons on holiday again after a 4-1/2 month ban on most travel, but the list of permitted destinations is limited to a handful of places and Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned restrictions will not change any time soon.

360,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2021 07:00AM ET</span>",Cairn Energy sues Air India to enforce $1.2 billion arbitration award - court filing,"By Euan Rocha and Jonathan Stempel
MUMBAI/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cairn Energy (OTC:CRNCY) has sued India's flagship carrier Air India to enforce a $1.2 billion arbitration award that it won in a tax dispute against India, according to a U.S. District Court filing reviewed by Reuters.
The move ratchets up pressure on India's government to pay the sum of $1.2 billion plus interest and costs that the British firm Cairn was awarded by an arbitration tribunal in December. The body ruled India breached an investment treaty with Britain and said New Delhi was liable to pay.
Cairn filed the lawsuit on Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, seeking to make Air India liable for the judgment that was awarded to Cairn. The lawsuit argued that the carrier as a state-owned company, is ""legally indistinct from the state itself"". 
""The nominal distinction between India and Air India is illusory and serves only to aid India in improperly shielding its assets from creditors like (Cairn),"" the filing said.
Air India did not immediately respond to requests seeking comment.
However, a senior government official, who asked not to be named, said the government and Air India had not received any formal notice of such a suit.
""As and when any such notice is received. The government or concerned organisation shall take all necessary steps to defend against any such illegal enforcement action,"" the official said, adding that New Delhi has engaged a team ready to defend against any enforcement action initiated by Cairn anywhere in the world. 
Cairn's move could potentially jeopardise India's attempts to divest the state-owned carrier this year. New Delhi said in December that it had received multiple expressions of interest after it moved to privatise the loss-making entity.
The senior government official noted New Delhi has filed an appeal against the arbitration award, and added ""the government is confident that the award will be set aside"".
Cairn had since January, however, begun taking steps to identify Indian assets overseas against which it could enforce the award including bank accounts, aircraft and even ships. It had also started registering its claim against India in courts in the United States, Great Britain, Netherlands and Canada.
Reuters last week reported that India had asked state-run banks to withdraw funds from their foreign currency accounts abroad, fearing Cairn might sue to seize the funds.
'LITTLE PROGRESS' 
Cairn had said previously it was pursuing a settlement with India, but in the interim it has also been laying the grounds to seize Indian assets should talks fail.
Commenting on the suit, a company spokesman on Saturday said that Cairn was taking the necessary legal steps to protect shareholder interests in the absence of a resolution.
He said that ""Cairn remains open to continuing constructive dialogue with the Government of India"" to reach a settlement. 
An Indian official told Reuters last week, talks between New Delhi and the company were making ""little progress"" and noted that India's directive to state-run banks to withdraw foreign currency funds sitting overseas showed the government is worried that Cairn may move quickly to seize assets.
It is unclear whether the suit against Air India could serve as a means for Cairn to seize Air India aircraft that land on U.S. soil.

Earlier this year, a Malaysian court allowed the seizure of a Pakistan International Airlines Boeing (NYSE:BA) 777 aircraft that landed in Kuala Lumpur, after Dublin-based AerCap had filed suit in a British court over unpaid dues. The jet was released nearly two weeks later after the two sides reached an amicable settlement. 
Air India is the only Indian carrier that flies long-haul flights to destinations in the United States and Canada. The frequency of its overseas flights has recently been impacted as the second wave of the pandemic that has hit India, has prompted nations to restrict, or ban travel from the South Asian nation.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Washington was running out of gasoline on Friday, even as the country's largest fuel pipeline network ramped up deliveries following a cyberattack and U.S. officials assured motorists that supplies would return to normal soon. 
The six-day Colonial Pipeline shutdown was the most disruptive cyberattack on record. Widespread panic buying continued two days after the pipeline network restarted, leaving filling stations across the U.S. Southeast out of gas.
With more Americans taking road trips as pandemic restrictions ease, pump prices are at their highest in years. The average national gasoline price has climbed to almost $3.04, the most expensive since October 2014, the American Automobile Association said. 
As politicians discussed legislation to improve cyber defenses, more gasoline stations shut down in the capital city of the world's largest oil-consuming nation.
On Friday gas station outages in Washington climbed to 88% from 79% the day before, tracking firm GasBuddy said. President Joe Biden assured motorists supplies should start returning to normal by this weekend.
""Most of these states/areas with outages have continued to see panicked buying, which is likely a contributing factor to the slow-ish recovery thus far,"" said GasBuddy's Patrick De Haan. ""It will take a few weeks.""
Colonial Pipeline announced late Thursday it had restarted its entire pipeline system linking refineries on the Gulf Coast to markets along the eastern seaboard.
On Friday evening, the pipeline was shipping at normal rates based on shipper nominations, a spokeswoman for Colonial said. 
Some states experienced modest improvements but still had a lot of gasoline outages. Some 65% of gas stations in North Carolina were without fuel, while in Virginia, South Carolina and Georgia just under 50% were empty, GasBuddy said.
Overall, some 14,144 gas stations were experiencing outages, down from a peak of 16,200, GasBuddy said on Friday afternoon. 
In Washington, D.C., Dennis Li was stuck on Friday at a Sunoco gas station that was out of fuel. He had tried to find gas at four stations during the day, with no luck. 
""I'm running on empty to the point where I don't want to drive anymore,"" said Li, who is from Annapolis, Maryland. 
Minutes before the last of four stations ran out of gas on River Road in the Washington suburb of Bethesda, Maryland, drivers were mostly calm. Still, some were shocked to hear about the shortage. 
Nicholas Swann had driven from his home in the Adams Morgan neighborhood of Washington to Bethesda to get gasoline, where the wait at the Shell (LON:RDSa) station was 15 minutes. 
""We were originally going to drive out to the beach this weekend but we don't know if we will, because I can't make it there and back on one tank of gas,"" Swann said. 
REGULATORS, REFINERS REACT TO OUTAGE
The hacking group blamed for the attack, DarkSide, said it had hacked four other companies including a Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) subsidiary in Germany. 
Colonial Pipeline has not determined how the initial breach occurred, a spokeswoman said. The privately held company has focused on cleaning its networks, restoring data and reopening the pipeline.
Colonial has not disclosed how much money the hackers were seeking or whether it paid. Bloomberg News reported that it paid nearly $5 million to hackers.
U.S. lawmakers reintroduced legislation to support efforts by the Department of Homeland Security to secure pipelines and pipeline facilities from cyberattacks. 
Washington issued shipping waivers allowing U.S. refiners  Valero Energy  Corp (NYSE:VLO) and Citgo Petroleum to use foreign-flagged vessels to move gasoline and diesel from the U.S. Gulf Coast to East Coast ports.
Gulf Coast refiners that send fuel to market through the Colonial Pipeline have cut production because they have been unable to move gasoline, diesel and jet fuel through the line.
To speed delivery of fuel supplies, four states and federal regulators relaxed restrictions on fuel truck drivers.
In Georgia, one of the states worst hit by the outages, fuel delivery companies struggled to get supplies to gasoline stations.

The asset freeze, announced on Friday, includes all shares in his company, Next Digital - the first time a listed firm has been target by national security laws in the financial hub.
Shortly before the announcement, the Taiwan arm of Lai's popular Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily said it would stop publishing its print version, blaming declining advertising revenue and more difficult business conditions in Hong Kong linked to politics.
In a statement sent to Reuters, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council said the asset seizure highlighted the threat Hong Kong's national security law posed to the property of the city's people. 
""It is equivalent to announcing to the international community that Hong Kong's business risks are increasing,"" the council added.
""We also once again call on relevant parties to stop suppressing Hong Kong democrats, otherwise they will drift away from popular sentiment.""
The former British colony of Hong Kong has been rocked by protests against its Beijing-backed government in recent years and last year China imposed a tough new national security law on the city.
China denies it is aimed at taking away people's freedoms and is needed to return law and order to Hong Kong.

Chinese-claimed Taiwan has a rambunctious democracy and a free media and its government has been strongly critical of the crackdown in Hong Kong, to Beijing's anger.
Lai was sentenced to 14 months in prison for taking part in unauthorised assemblies during pro-democracy protests in 2019.

By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Friday it was requiring U.S. operators of 143 Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737 Classic series airplanes to check for possible wire failures stemming from an investigation into an Indonesia crash in January.
The 737 Classic is an older generation of planes more than two decades old. The FAA said the issue affected 1,041 737-300, -400 and -500 Classic series airplanes worldwide, but many are currently out of service, because of COVID-19 or other issues.
The FAA is issuing an airworthiness directive for operators to verify that the flap synchro wire, which plays a role in the operation of the aircraft’s auto-throttle system, is securely connected to a safety sensor.
The wire failure could go undetected by the auto-throttle computer on affected airplanes and pose a safety risk.
The FAA is requiring some speedier checks than had been suggested by Boeing, which said late on Friday that it was ""engaged in ongoing efforts to introduce safety and performance improvements across the fleet.""
The newer 737 MAX and 737 NG are unaffected by the directive.
The FAA and Boeing identified the potential problem during the investigation of the Jan. 9 crash of Sriwijaya Air Flight 182 in the Indonesian capital.
Indonesia’s third major airline crash in just over six years shone a spotlight on the southeast Asian nation’s poor air safety record.
All 62 aboard were killed after the 26-year-old  Boeing Co  737-500 crashed into the Java Sea soon after takeoff from Jakarta.
The FAA said there was no evidence the flap synchro wire issue had a role in the accident though the possibility of a failed connection presented a safety concern warranting prompt attention. 
In February, Indonesia’s National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT) said the plane had an imbalance in engine thrust that eventually led it into a sharp roll before a final dive into the sea. 
There had been two prior problems reported with the autothrottle system that automatically controls engine power based on maintenance logs, but the issue was rectified four days before the crash, the agency said.
Boeing issued a March 30 message to operators directing them to perform electronic checks of the auto-throttle computer to confirm the wire is connected within 250 flight hours.
The FAA is requiring the initial test within 250 flight hours or two months from now, whichever occurs first, ""to ensure that airplanes with low utilization rates are addressed in a timely manner."" Operators must then make repairs, if needed.
The FAA said a faulty connection could result in the failure of the auto-throttle system to detect the position of the aircraft’s flaps if the plane’s engines were operating at different thrust settings due to another malfunction.

The FAA is requiring follow-on inspections every 2,000 flight hours after the first.
Affected U.S. operators are Aloha Air Cargo, DHL, iAero Airways, Kalitta Charters and Northern Air Cargo, the FAA said.

Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) Co, which owned the Speedway chain, and 7-Eleven, owned by Japan's Seven & I Holdings Co Ltd, announced Friday they had closed the $21 billion deal involving some 3,800 stores in 36 states. 
""The parties have closed their transaction at their own risk. The Commission will continue to investigate to determine an appropriate path forward,"" said FTC acting Chairwoman Rebecca Slaughter and Rohit Chopra, a commissioner. Both are Democrats.
The two officials said they believed ""this transaction is illegal,"" and said the commission had failed to reach an agreement with the companies to resolve antitrust concerns.
7-Eleven said in a statement that it was legally allowed to close the transaction. ""Statements or implications to the contrary are false,"" the company said.
The company said it had reached an agreement with FTC staff in late April to sell 293 fuel outlets with a plan to close on May 14.
But on May 11, Slaughter and Chopra said they wanted more time, the company said. ""7-Eleven took the request very seriously,"" it said. ""Given that 7-Eleven was abiding by the negotiated settlement agreement, we closed today on schedule,"" it added.
In a separate statement, Marathon Petroleum said that it and ""7-Eleven worked very cooperatively over many months with the FTC and will continue to do so going forward.""

The two Republican FTC commissioners, Noah Phillips and Christine Wilson, said in a statement that they also believed the deal violated antitrust law.
""Rather than resolve the issues and order divestitures (or sue to block the transaction), the acting chairwoman and Commissioner Chopra have issued a strongly worded statement. Their words do not bind the merging parties, leaving consumers completely unprotected,"" Phillips and Wilson said.

(Reuters) - An Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) engineer who left the company this week after thousands of coworkers signed a petition calling for him to be sacked said on Twitter he was fired ""in a snap decision"" and that Apple made defamatory statements about him. 
Apple said on Wednesday that Antonio García Martínez, a former  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) product manager who joined its advertising business in April, was no longer with the company. The iPhone maker made the move after more than 2,000 Apple employees signed an internal petition objecting to what they denounced as sexist and racist views in his 2016 book ""Chaos Monkeys"" about working in Silicon Valley. 
Announcing his departure, Apple said it strived to create an inclusive, welcoming workplace and that ""behavior that demeans or discriminates against people for who they are has no place here.""
On Twitter on Friday, García Martínez said Apple had been well aware of his writing and had interviewed references he provided to the company about the differences between his professional and literary personas.

""I did not 'part ways' with Apple. I was fired by Apple in a snap decision,"" García Martínez said on Twitter. ""Apple has issued a statement that clearly implies there was some negative behavior by me during my time at Apple. That is defamatory and categorically false.""
Apple did not immediately return a request for comment on García Martínez's posts.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street closed higher in a broad rally, an upbeat conclusion to whipsaw week of buying and selling as signs of a rebounding economy squared off against mounting inflation jitters.
All three major U.S. indexes extended Thursday's gains, which saw S&P 500 notch its biggest one-day percentage bump in over a month.
""Today 'everything is going up day' because everyone is buying,"" said Chuck Carlson, senior vice president at Wealthspire Advisors, in New York. ""It's a 'buy everything' day.""
Still, the indexes suffered their biggest weekly declines since late February.
""This week, given the big swings, is more evident of a trader's environment than a long-term investor's environment,"" Carlson added. ""It's a market looking for its next sustained impulse to the upside.""
Those big swings were stoked by economic data, which fanned concerns that near-term price spikes could translate into long-term inflation, despite assurances to the contrary from the U.S. Federal Reserve.
""Inflation continues to be the biggest concern,"" Carlson added. ""And when interest rates didn't go to new highs the bulls take over and investors are willing to step in and buy some of the stocks that had been beaten up this week.""
Economic data showed retail sales growth stalling and consumer sentiment dipping as prices remain on an upward trajectory, suggesting that while the demand boom might be taking a breather, inflation has not.
But in an indication that economic activity could return to normal, revised guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said fully vaccinated people no longer need to wear masks outdoors and can avoid wearing them indoors in most places.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -Walmart said on Friday that fully vaccinated employees will not need to wear a mask at work starting Tuesday, following the latest guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The world's largest retailer said in an internal memo to U.S. stores, Sam’s Clubs and supply chain facilities that unvaccinated workers must still wear face coverings. Vaccinated customers and Sam's Club members will be allowed to shop without a mask starting Friday.
The move makes Walmart (NYSE:WMT) the first major retailer to walk back its mandatory mask policy after the CDC on Thursday advised that fully vaccinated people do not need to wear masks outdoors and can avoid wearing them indoors in most places.
""We are also reviewing whether masks may still be required for certain job codes for health and sanitation purposes and will share additional guidance soon,"" the memo seen by Reuters said.
Walmart was one of several retailers that in July began requiring that staff and customers wear masks to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Several grocers at the time were hesitant to make it a requirement, for fear of antagonizing shoppers, with numerous videos posted online on confrontations between customers and employees.
Masks will continue to be required by some city and state ordinances, and we will follow those requirements, Walmart said, adding that it would communicate with local stores, clubs or facility management teams as regulations change.
Walmart, which plans to update signage in its stores and facilities, said it will respect the choice of employees and shoppers who wish to continue wearing masks.

The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer also said it would give $75 to U.S. field associates who have been vaccinated, or as an incentive for them to get their shots.
""We're encouraging all associates to get vaccinated and help end this pandemic,"" the memo said.

Tanden, a former adviser to President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, has been serving as president of the Center for American Progress (CAP), a left-leaning think tank.
Tanden will focus on healthcare issues, preparing for ""different contingencies that could arise from the Supreme Court’s consideration of Republican lawsuits seeking to undo the Affordable Care Act,"" the White House said in a statement.
She will also review the U.S. Digital Service, in charge of making the U.S. government accessible to Americans online, it said.

And even with the ongoing vaccination drive, increasing at-home consumption of packaged products and a surge in sales of hygiene products are likely to continue this year. Hence, analysts recommend buying fundamentally stable consumer goods company The Procter & Gamble (PG). However, the unimpressive recent financials of Unilever (NYSE:UL) are a concern and analysts recommend avoiding it now. Let’s discuss.The consumer goods industry experienced an unprecedented demand amid the COVID-19 pandemic, bolstered by a spike in e-commerce buying. Furthermore, the lingering fear of shortages led to the stocking up (hoarding) of essential items. And even as the vaccinated percentage of the population rises each day, this trend is likely to continue given accelerating digital dependency and shifting consumer preferences.
The increasing demand for personal care items, such as hand sanitizers and disinfectants, coupled with significant at-home consumption of packaged products, should keep driving the industry’s growth. The industry has been enjoying favorable investor sentiment, which is evident in the iShares U.S. Consumer Goods ETF (IYK) 51.9% returns over the past year, compared to SPDR S&P 500’s (SPY) 45.7% gains over this period.

(Reuters) -Shares in heavily shorted AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings closed up 1.6% in busy trading on Friday as one analyst raised their price target for the cinema operator's stock, a focus in social media forums popular among retail investors. 
AMC's gain was forcing bearish investors out of their positions, according to one analyst who watches short-sellers. 
AMC last traded at $12.98 after rising as high as $14.34 during the session, with volume 3.2 times the 10-day moving average and the stock the most-heavily traded on all exchanges.
The stock has gained 44% in six sessions. It rallied 23.7% on Thursday after raising about $428 million from a share sale.
B. Riley Securities analyst Eric Wold raised his AMC price target on Friday to $16 from $13, saying the capital raise bolsters its balance sheet. Wold is the only analyst of nine with a 'buy' rating on AMC according to Refinitiv. 
But another analyst, Eric Handler at MKM Partners called the move a ""double-edged sword"" as new share issues dilute equity value.
""Retail investors have got behind this stock and have created a huge frenzy,"" said Handler. ""This is not growth capital; this is survival capital."" 
Handler has a ""sell"" rating on the stock and a $1 price target compared with the $2 median target. 
AMC shares have been extremely volatile this year, trading in a range of $1.91 to $20.36. After rising as much as 920% by late January, they ended Friday up 512% year-to-date. 
Along with video game retailer  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME), AMC was caught up in a surge of retail investor buying in January that left hedge funds shorting the stock with losses. 
According to Swaggysstocks.com sentiment tracker, AMC was the top trending stock on Reddit's WallStreetBets, which is frequented by retail investors. 
About 22% of AMC's float, or 92 million shares, were still sold short, according to data from Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners.

""We’re seeing continued short-covering in AMC, with 3.4 million shares, worth $44 million, covered over the last week,"" he said. Dusaniwsky expects Friday's price gain to exacerbate the trend ""as more short sellers get squeezed out of their positions.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. stocks rallied in a sharp rebound on Friday as investors set aside inflation worries and bought shares hammered by the week's volatility, with the shift back into riskier assets dragging on the dollar.
The jump in shares was in step with buoyant global stocks as investors put on the back burner concerns that rising prices could lead the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than expected and reduce the gush of cash that has propelled financial markets.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1%, the S&P 500 jumped 1.5%, the most on any day since March 26, and the Nasdaq Composite leaped 2.3%, its biggest one-day rise in about two months.
The MSCI World Index, which tracks 50 markets, jumped 1.5%.
But some warned that investors may be too complacent if they ignore the dangers of accelerating price pressures.
""I don't see us off to the races,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel, which manages about $4 billion in assets. He said inflation risks are ""real"" and financial markets will likely be choppy for some time. 
""You could buy (stocks) if you could sleep at night with the volatility, but I might have a slug of cash, too.""
Indeed, even with Friday's strong recovery, U.S. stocks still notched their worst performances in nearly three months for the week. The S&P 500 lost 1.4% this week, while the Nasdaq shed 2.3%, declines not seen since Feb. 26.
Still, mega-cap growth stocks, which have been beaten down this week on concerns over their lofty valuations, surged, with shares in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) ending up at least 1.9% each and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc leaping 3.2%. (N)
Fears of rising prices burst into the fore this week and spooked markets, and despite assurances from the Fed it does not expect to tighten policy anytime soon, some investors worry policymakers may be misjudging inflation risks.
That said, data released on Friday showed U.S. retail sales unexpectedly stalled in April as the boost from stimulus checks wore off, further bolstering arguments that the economic recovery was far from roaring, and that interest rate hikes are not imminent.
That appeared to calm markets, for now.
The U.S. dollar dropped as risk appetite recovered and the prospect of rate hikes occurring sooner faded (higher rates burnish the currency's appeal). Against a basket of six major currencies, the U.S. dollar index shed 0.5% to 90.312. [USD/]
A softer dollar lifted the euro, which jumped 0.6% to $1.21445. 
The surprisingly muted retail sales report weighed on benchmark 10-year Treasury yields, which fell to 1.6335%. Two-year Treasury yields dipped to 0.1510%. [US/]
The drop in yields flattened the yield curve, an indicator of economic growth expectations, by a touch. The spread between two- and 10-year Treasury yields, which had widened earlier this week when investors were focused on inflation, narrowed to 148.3 basis points.
Pullbacks in the dollar and Treasury yields added to the appeal of non-yielding bullion, with spot gold up 0.9% at $1,843.11 an ounce. [GOL/]
Oil prices also rebounded on Friday to claw back some of the losses seen the previous day as a weaker dollar increased the appeal of the commodity for holders of other currencies. [O/R]
Brent crude jumped 2.5% to $68.70 a barrel, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude climbed 2.4% to $65.36 a barrel.

In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin recovered some ground after skidding 13% this week on reports of a regulatory probe into crypto exchange Binance, and after Tesla's chief executive, Elon Musk, said the carmaker would stop accepting the token as payment due to environmental concerns.

So, we think it could be wise to bet now on established computer hardware companies Dell (DELL), HP (HPQ), Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS), and Canon (CAJ). They are expected to generate significant returns this month and beyond. Read on.The broader tech market staged a comeback yesterday after falling for three consecutive sessions because investors were reassured after United States’ jobless claims hit a fresh pandemic low. Tech stocks are also expected to continue dominating the market in the foreseeable future given that several companies are expected to continue with remote working structures even in the post-pandemic environment due to its benefits and convenience.
The use of internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and cloud-based products and services is expected to continue increasing, which will drive a growing need for computer hardware. According to Globe Newswire, the global computer hardware market is expected to hit $1,117.8 billion in 2025, growing at a 6% CAGR.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 ended the week in the red Friday despite a rebound in tech and a rally in economically-sensitive value stocks amid optimism the consumer remains in good shape to support the recovery.
The S&P 500 rose 1.49%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.06% to 360 points, and Nasdaq Composite gained 2.3%. The weekly loss for the broader market followed a wobble early this week, when fears of runaway inflation prompted investors to hit pause on the stocks.
Retail sales were flat in April, after an upwardly revised 10.7% jump in the prior month as spending fueled by stimulus checks dried up. But with consumers hoarding record amounts of cash, further progress on the reopening of the economy will see spending return in the spring and summer.
""Stimulus checks were mostly used up in March spending, but households now hold larger savings than they did pre-pandemic,"" Yelena Maleyev, an economist at Grant Thornton said in a note.
""New CDC guidance saying that vaccinated people no longer need to wear masks, added to more states reopening in May, will lead to more consumer activity during the spring and summer months,"" Maleyev added.
Consumer spending, which makes up two-thirds of the economy, has been earmarked by some as the key to sustain the broader market rally, particularly in cyclicals corners of the market, as the support from monetary and fiscal stimulus will eventually be reined in.
""Going forward, as federal stimulus runs dry, consumer spending will be reliant on more organic means such as job and income growth,"" Stifel said.
Cyclicals including financials, consumer discretionary and energy were in the green, with energy leading the pack, up more about 3% amid rising oil prices.
 Marathon Oil  (NYSE:MRO), Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) and HollyFrontier (NYSE:HFC) were among the biggest gainers, up more than 6% on the day.
The reopening trade was also in vogue, supported by airlines and cruise lines up strongly.  
Tech stocks, meanwhile, continued to make gains as their recent rout appears to have made their valuations, which are sensitive to a faster pace of inflation, more palatable.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) was up 3%, Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) gained more than 2%, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ended up about 2% higher.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), the sixth biggest weighting on the S&P 500, was up 3%.
On the earnings front, meanwhile, high-flying tech names including Airbnb and DoorDash that had been battered recently returned to investors' shopping lists.
DoorDash (NYSE:DASH) raised its outlook on order value for the rest of the year after reporting earnings that missed, but revenue that topped analysts' estimates. Its share price rose more than 22%.
Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue, and said bookings were gaining momentum as the global travel restrictions ease, sending its shares 4% higher.
Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) slipped 2.6% after its subscriber numbers and revenue during the first quarter fell short of analysts' estimates, casting some doubt among investors whether there is too much optimism baked into the expected growth of its streaming service, Disney+.

(Reuters) -Bank of America Corp agreed to pay $75 million to settle a lawsuit accusing the second-largest U.S. bank of extracting overdraft fees it didn't earn from customers with savings and checking accounts, court papers showed.
A preliminary settlement of the proposed class action was filed on Wednesday with the federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, where the bank is based, and requires a judge's approval.
Customers said Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) often charged multiple $35 fees for insufficient funds or overdrafts on a single transaction, sometimes reflecting the bank's repeated attempts to process it at a merchant's request.
One woman said the bank charged her $105 after rejecting her $20 credit card payment and then attempting without her knowledge to ""retry"" processing the same payment five and nine days after the initial rejection, resulting in three $35 fees.
One woman said the bank imposed $105 in fees after rejecting her $20 credit card payment, attempting without her knowledge to ""retry"" processing the same payment five and nine days after the initial rejection, resulting in three $35 fees.
The plaintiffs' lawyers said that as part of the settlement, Bank of America will stop imposing multiple fees on ""retry"" payments for at least five years, saving customers an estimated $5.3 million a month and $318 million overall.
Bank of America denied wrongdoing in agreeing to settle. A spokesman declined to comment on Friday.
The plaintiffs' lawyers intend to seek up to $25 million from the settlement fund in attorney's fees.
Repeated overdrafts can result in account closures and leave some lower-income customers without access to banking services.
Banks have faced many lawsuits over the years claiming they sought to illegally maximize overdraft fees.

U.S. banks took in $11.68 billion of overdraft fees in 2019, according to the Center for Responsible Lending, even before the COVID-19 pandemic left millions in financial distress. Just 9% of account holders paid 84% of the fees, the nonprofit said.
The case is Morris et al v. Bank of America NA, U.S. District Court, Western District of North Carolina, No. 18-00157.

MILAN (Reuters) -A Milan arbitral tribunal ruled in favour of Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) in a disputed sale of the headquarters of RCS, rejecting all claims advanced by the Italian publisher, a court document seen by Reuters showed, confirming what sources had said earlier on Friday.
RCS Mediagroup, which publishes the influential daily Corriere della Sera, launched arbitration proceedings in late 2018 to nullify the 2013 sale of its historic headquarters in central Milan to Blackstone, saying the U.S. investment firm had paid too low a price at a time when RCS faced financial difficulties.
Blackstone, which paid 120 million euros ($145 million) for the offices, had in turn accused RCS of falsely claiming it still owns the building and of improperly blocking its sale to Germany's Allianz (DE:ALVG).
The sale of the property ""was nothing more than a commercial negotiation"" in which the buyer ""legitimately"" tried to achieve the ""most advantageous terms of sale"" without evidence of ""any undue pressure on the other party,"" the arbitration award said.
""The panel of judges fully recognised the validity of the contract and the fairness of Blackstone's behaviour during all the sale process,"" a source close to the U.S. fund said. 
RCS said in a statement it disagreed with the decision and that it would consider any possible legal action against it. 
Friday's final decision by the tribunal follows a partial ruling published in May last year that the sale was valid. 
The ruling had requested two expert surveys on RCS's financial situation in 2013 and on the property's market value at the time, to assess whether there had been any damages for RCS and to what degree.
The U.S. investment firm filed two lawsuits in New York which were put on hold pending the outcome of the arbitration in Italy. 
It is seeking up to $600 million in damages from RCS and from its chairman and main shareholder Urbano Cairo, who took control of the company in 2016, a source close to the fund said at the time.

RCS noted on Friday that there was no finding of impropriety or bad faith against the Italian company, which ""on the contrary acted to duly protect the company's assets"". 
RCS's financial report, published on the company's website, shows it has not set aside risk provisions for the legal dispute.

BOSTON (Reuters) -A former Massachusetts mayor first elected at the age of 23 was convicted on Friday of defrauding investors in a smartphone app company and extorting money from local marijuana businesses.
Jurors found former Fall River mayor Jasiel Correia guilty on most counts he faced including wire fraud, filing false tax returns and extortion, in what was the first high-profile federal trial in Boston since the COVID-19 pandemic began.
He faces sentencing on Sept. 20. 
His lawyer, Kevin Reddington, told reporters that he was ""disappointed in the verdict, and we do plan to file a vigorous appeal."" He had argued at the trial that his client had ""no intent to defraud.""
Prosecutors said that before being elected, Correia betrayed investors who sank $363,690 into SnoOwl, a company developing an app to connect local businesses with consumers.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Zach Hafer told jurors that SnoOwl was a ""con,"" and Correia was accused of stealing more than $231,000 to fund his campaign and a lavish lifestyle that included a Mercedes, jewelry, casino trips and adult entertainment.
Prosecutors also said that after Correia was elected mayor in 2015, he extorted hundreds of thousands of dollars from marijuana companies seeking licenses to open in Fall River.
Jurors acquitted him on a charge of making his own chief of staff kick back half her salary to him in return for keeping her job. 
Correia's case was featured in ""Run This City"", a documentary series produced by Mark Wahlberg on the now-defunct streaming site Quibi.

386,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2021 02:46PM ET</span>","Big promises, few doses: why Russia's struggling to make Sputnik V doses","By Polina Nikolskaya and Polina Ivanova
MOSCOW (Reuters) -Transforming the site of what once was a Soviet-era car factory into a state-of-the-art facility churning out Russia's COVID-19 vaccine Sputnik V was the easy bit.
Making doses in bulk, finding qualified staff and getting equipment have been much bigger headaches for Moscow-based biotech firm R-Pharm and other private Russian companies picked to make the country's flagship shot to fight the pandemic.
President Vladimir Putin has trumpeted the vaccine around the world, and said in March that Russia had signed agreements for the production of 700 million doses abroad.
But Russia had produced just 33 million vaccines as of May 12 and exported fewer than 15 million, according to a Reuters tally that counted each vaccine as consisting of two doses. 
Russia's output is much lower than the hundreds of millions being made each month by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN).
Interviews with four manufacturers and two people involved in the production process and Russia's supply chain highlight how difficult it is to make Sputnik V and ramp up production.
The problems are a warning to foreign partners - including in India - that are planning to mass produce the vaccine and those countries relying on Moscow to supply their inoculation programmes.
With the United States and European countries focused on vaccinating domestic populations, Russia has stepped in the breach, offering shots to more than 50 countries, from Latin America to Asia.
But delays in getting shots to those countries gives China and the United States time to fill the gap.
In another blow, Brazil's regulator has denied approval to import Sputnik V, citing incomplete data on its safety and efficacy.
The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which is responsible for marketing the vaccine abroad, said the manufacturing capacity for Sputnik V was increasing globally as new manufacturers come on board.
RDIF told Reuters it planned to produce enough doses to vaccinate 800 million people in 2021 and that it had ""demonstrated its strong commitment to honouring supply contracts"". 
It said it stood by an offer to provide doses for 50 million people in the European Union. Russia is hoping the vaccine will be approved by the European Medicines Agency.
Russia's health ministry did not respond to a request for comment on production and other problems outlined by manufacturers. 
The industry ministry said Sputnik V production was more than meeting the needs of Russia's mass inoculation campaign, and that manufacturers in several other countries, including India and China, were also making the shot. 
""Any local issues related to vaccine production are dealt with promptly,"" it said, adding that the ministry ""does its best to ensure that the health system's needs continue to be met in full, and that there is enough vaccine for everyone.""
""BLINDFOLDED"" 
R-Pharm's new 27,000 square-metre (290,000 square-foot) factory on the outskirts of Moscow has more than 200 bioreactors that grow the cells that will form the shots.
R-Pharm was initially learning the process from scratch and operating the bioreactors was like working ""blindfolded"", chief executive Alexei Repik told Reuters.
""Vaccine production takes around 1-1/2 months or more, for each series,"" he said. ""Then afterwards, you compare the output to the reference sample. If it matches, you're lucky. If it doesn't, you pour out the product you made.""
The company has also struggled with global shortages of equipment and raw materials.
R-Pharm was initially gearing up to make 10 million doses a month but by late March had still not produced 1 million doses. It began the process of cell growing in November but its new factory has yet to open officially. 
Manufacturers contacted by Reuters said the vaccine was particularly difficult to make because of its design as an adenovirus vector vaccine.
The vectors are modified human common cold viruses, used to carry the genetic information into the body that triggers immunity-building.
Unlike other adenovirus vaccines, the first and booster shots of Sputnik V, taken 21 days apart, are made up of two different vectors and the first shot is easier to produce than the second, manufacturers said. 
""The product is difficult enough and you actually have to make two different drugs,"" said Biocad chief executive Dmitry Morozov, whose company is also making Sputnik V.
In a later comment to Reuters, Morozov said that production had increased sharply in the past month or so, with technical questions resolved and output in the tens of millions of doses.
To deal with the problems, Russia has teamed up with AstraZeneca, whose vaccine uses a different adenovirus shot, two sources familiar with vaccine strategy said. Human trials of a mix-and-match vaccine are under way in several countries.
Another option is ""Sputnik Light"", a single-dose version of the shot using only the first component.
One private producer, Pharmasyntez, plans to seek permission to produce only the one-dose vaccine, its chief executive, Vikram Punia, said. It sent a first batch for quality controls on May 3.
In response to questions, RDIF said both components of the Russian vaccine were being produced and delivered on time.
LAND AND PEOPLE 
A global rush for equipment has increased Russian producers' problems, and pharmaceutical plants are in limited supply in Russia. 
Generium, the biggest producer of Sputnik V doses, re-purposed existing plants to work on the vaccine, as did Biocad, the only other major producer.
To expand output, new plants will be needed. Generium is building one to make 200-300 million doses per year, its owner said in March.

The biggest problem for Pharmasyntez's Punia was a lack of experienced staff - producing two doses increases strain on staffing because separate manufacturing spaces and teams are needed.
""We can buy equipment, we can build plants. But in biotechnology, competent people is the most important thing. And there are not very many of them,"" Punia said.

Analyst Adam Jonas also reiterated his $900 target for the stock, a level last seen in January. The stock is since down by more than one-third, an opportunity Jonas believes should be grabbed.
The analyst thinks much of the concern around the electric vehicle maker, particularly its reported troubles in China, are overblown.
A Reuters report Tuesday said the company has halted plans to buy land to expand its Shanghai plant and make it a global export hub. Tesla had earlier considered expanding exports of its China-made entry-level Model 3 to more markets, including the U.S.
Neither of the stakeholders, Tesla or the Shanghai government, has commented on the matter.

(Reuters) -Slow subscriber growth at Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's streaming service in the last quarter was a speed bump as a slate of Marvel superhero films and sci-fi thrillers from the Hollywood powerhouse will attract new fans, analysts said.
The positive comments come a day after Disney+, the streaming service the company launched in late 2019, failed to reach as many subscribers by early April as Wall Street had estimated.
Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), AT&T (NYSE:T)'s HBO Max and Disney+ have added millions of new subscribers during the pandemic as people stayed indoors.
However, growth is expected to slow as production delays hurt film and TV shows, with the meteoric rise in subscriber numbers last year making comparisons difficult in 2021.
But analysts were largely optimistic over Disney's position in the market. Disney+ launched 12 years after Netflix started a streaming video service, and has already reached about half of Netflix's size in less than 18 months.
A steady stream of the hottest franchises is seen sustaining the lead for Disney+ among traditional media companies for years to come.
""The benefit where Disney+ is concerned is its content already exists, and doesn't age in the same way many of today's films do,"" said Sophie Lund-Yates, analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV). ""In the world of streaming, that is a godsend.""
Upcoming Disney+ shows include Marvel's ""Loki"", Star Wars series ""The Book of Boba Fett"", and ""Black Widow"" starring Scarlett Johansson.
The company is also investing heavily to make inroads in international markets, with plans to launch Disney+ in Malaysia and Thailand next month.
Disney said it was on track to meet its target for 230 million to 260 million Disney+ subscribers by the end of fiscal 2024.

The company's shares fell 3% on Friday, but for now, analysts are upbeat on Disney.
""We'd call the current slowdown but a speed bump given the assets Disney will bring to bear on streaming,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) said in a note. ""The content pipeline is when, not if.""

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Biden administration granted oil refiner Citgo Petroleum a maritime shipping waiver allowing it to move fuel between U.S. ports on a foreign flagged vessel, two sources told Reuters on Friday, making it the second company to secure one this week.
The waivers are intended to help ease distribution of fuel after a major pipeline serving the U.S. East Coast was forced shut by a cyberattack last week, triggering widespread shortages of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel.
The Department of Homeland Security had announced the second waiver on Friday, but did not name the recipient. 
Citgo is planing to use Jones Act waiver to ship approximately 200,000 barrels of jet fuel, gasoline and ultra low sulfur diesel from Lake Charles, Louisiana, to Linden, New Jersey, on a foreign flagged vessel, the two sources said. 
Citgo declined to comment. 
 Valero Energy  (NYSE:VLO) had received the initial waiver, Reuters reported yesterday, and also was moving fuel from Lake Charles to the East Coast. 
The Jones Act requires goods moved between U.S. ports to be carried by ships built domestically and staffed by U.S. crews, a law intended to protect the U.S. shipping industry.
Giving waivers to the Jones Act is one way the government can help fuel supplies reach some areas hardest hit by the pipeline outage, as pump prices continue to surge.

Privately owned Colonial Pipeline Co began to slowly restart the nation's largest fuel pipeline network on Wednesday after a ransomware attack shut the line May 7.

(Reuters) - NerdWallet Inc, the owner of the eponymous consumer financial advice website, has confidentially submitted paperwork to U.S. regulators for an initial public offering (IPO), people familiar with the matter said on Friday. 
NerdWallet has hired a group of investment banks, led by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), to arrange the IPO and is aiming to go public before the end of the year, the sources said. The San Francisco-based company could seek a valuation of as much as $5 billion, two of the sources added. 
The sources cautioned that the timing of the IPO and the valuation are subject to market conditions and asked not to be identified because the preparations are confidential.
NerdWallet and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.
A number of high-profile financial technology companies, such as Affirm Holdings Inc have gone public in the last six months, while others such as online brokerage Robinhood Markets Inc, Brazil's Nubank and financial services startup Chime are preparing to do so later this year.
Founded in 2009 by former hedge fund executive Tim Chen and Jake Gibson, a former trader at JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), NerdWallet provides financial guidance to users on credit cards, loans, mortgages and other financial products. It boasts more than 100 million users every year of its personal finance website and mobile phone app and counts venture capital firm IVF and SVB Financial Group among its investors.

Investing.com –  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) shares were up 1.5% Friday as Citi (NYSE:C) upgraded the stock to buy, saying  it sees the once-iconic company is on track for a turnaround.
The brokerage has pegged $17 as the target for the stock, a Street-high and a near 30% rise from the current level of $13.16.
Citi analyst Andrew Kaplowitz based his faith on all-round improvement in execution for his optimism on the stock price, according to StreetInsider.
The analyst believes that while clean energy may not be a driver of the stock as yet, it could bring big upside if GE manages to grow its market share in wind turbines.
Kaplowitz noted that despite an almost 30% year-on-year fall in revenues of its aviation business, the segment witnessed a less than 200-basis-point reduction in operating margin. This, the analyst believes, reflects good traction with the company’s efforts at cost-cutting and one that will support profitability once demand returns.
GE is currently in the process of selling its aircraft leasing unit, GE Capital Aviation Services, to Ireland’s AerCap in a deal worth $30 billion.
The analyst believes the sale will streamline GE’s business model and further de-risk it.

400,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2021 01:01PM ET</span>",Facebook faces prospect of 'devastating' data transfer ban after Irish ruling,"By Conor Humphries and Douglas Busvine
DUBLIN (Reuters) -Ireland's data regulator can resume a probe that may trigger a ban on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)'s transatlantic data transfers, the High Court ruled on Friday, raising the prospect of a stoppage that the company warns would have a devastating impact on its business.
The case stems from EU concerns that U.S. government surveillance may not respect the privacy rights of EU citizens when their personal data is sent to the United States for commercial use.
Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner (DPC), Facebook's lead regulator in the European Union, launched an inquiry in August and issued a provisional order that the main mechanism Facebook uses to transfer EU user data to the United States ""cannot in practice be used"". 
Facebook had challenged both the inquiry and the Preliminary Draft Decision (PDD), saying they threatened ""devastating"" and ""irreversible"" consequences for its business, which relies on processing user data to serve targeted online ads. 
The High Court rejected the challenge on Friday. 
""I refuse all of the reliefs sought by FBI (Facebook Ireland) and dismiss the claims made by it in the proceedings,"" Justice David Barniville said in a judgment that ran to nearly 200 pages.
""FBI has not established any basis for impugning the DPC decision or the PDD or the procedures for the inquiry adopted by the DPC,"" the judgment said.
While the decision does not trigger an immediate halt to data flows, Austrian privacy activist Max Schrems, who forced the Irish data regulator to act in a series of legal actions over the past eight years, said he believed the decision made it inevitable. 
""After eight years, the DPC is now required to stop Facebook's EU-U.S. data transfers, likely before summer,"" he said.
A Facebook spokesman said the company looked forward to defending its compliance with EU data rules as the Irish regulator's provisional order ""could be damaging not only to Facebook, but also to users and other businesses"".
PRIVILEGED ACCESS
If the Irish data regulator enforces the provisional order, it would effectively end the privileged access companies in the United States have to personal data from Europe and put them on the same footing as companies in other nations outside the bloc.
The mechanism being questioned by the Irish regulator, the Standard Contractual Clause (SCC), was deemed valid by the European Court of Justice in a July decision.
But the Court of Justice also ruled that, under SCCs, privacy watchdogs must suspend or prohibit transfers outside the EU if data protection in other countries cannot be assured.
A lawyer for Facebook in December told the High Court that the Irish regulator's draft decision, if implemented, ""would have devastating consequences"" for Facebook's business, impacting Facebook's 410 million active users in Europe, hit political groups and undermine freedom of speech. 

Irish Data Protection Commissioner Helen Dixon in February said companies more broadly may face massive disruption to transatlantic data flows as a result of the European Court of Justice decision. 
Dixon's office welcomed the decision on Friday, but declined further comment.

The worldwide shift to remote work and learning during the pandemic had boosted demand for laptops and other gadgets, exacerbating a global chip shortage.

MADRID (Reuters) -Hundreds of Caixabank employees gathered outside the Spanish lender's shareholder meeting in Valencia on Friday to protest its plans to cut nearly a fifth of its staff in Spain, while some retail investors complained about executives' pay.
Video released on social media by the Comisiones Obreras (CCOO) union showed people, some wearing masks with faces of Caixabank executives, protesting outside Valencia's Palacio de Congresos, where the meeting was taking place.
Some were shouting: ""They triple it (their salaries) and take it away from us.""
A spokesman for the union said earlier this morning that hundreds had turned up to protest against the bank's layoff plans.
Shareholders nevertheless backed a hefty salary proposal for new Caixabank Chairman Jose Ignacio Goirigolzarri, while the Spanish state, which holds a 16% stake in the lender, voted against it, a source with knowledge of the matter said.
Caixabank did not provide details on how shareholders voted.
There have been other protests in Spain against plans by five Spanish banks to cut 18,000 jobs, which have coincided with government calls to rein in top bankers' pay. 
Labour Minister Yolanda Diaz said on Friday it ""was not the moment for layoffs."" 
""We have to overcome this crisis together and undertake common efforts"", she told reporters in the northwestern region of Galicia.
Caixabank, Spain's biggest domestic lender by assets after its purchase of rival Bankia, last month announced plans to cut around 8,000 jobs, one of the biggest staff reductions in Spanish history.
At Friday's annual meeting, shareholders gave their blessing to a fixed salary of 1.65 million euros ($2.00 million), plus a bonus of up to 200,000 euros, in 2021 for Goirigolzarri, who was Bankia's former chairman.
Before the merger, the fixed part of Goirigolzarri's salary was capped at 500,000 euros, while the bonus or variable remuneration could rise to a maximum of 300,000 euros. This was a precondition for the 22.4 billion euros in state-aid Bankia received at the height of a European debt crisis in 2012.
But now that Bankia has disappeared, the remuneration cap on Goirigolzarri has been removed.
Though the government and the Bank of Spain have no power to enforce cuts on fixed salaries of banks' executives, the matter has become sensitive for Caixabank.
On Thursday, the Bank of Spain called on banks to be ""extremely prudent"" regarding bankers' bonuses, while the Labour Ministry has called on Caixabank and BBVA (MC:BBVA), which also plans layoffs, to reduce the number of staff cuts, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.

On Friday, Goirigolzarri said in a speech to shareholders at the meeting that ""short-term workforce adjustments"" were needed to preserve the ""maximum number of sustainable jobs for the future"".

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of U.S. senators are close to unveiling a $52-billion proposal Friday that would significantly boost U.S. semiconductor chip production and research over five years sources briefed on the matter said.
Senators Mark Kelly, John Cornyn, Mark Warner and Tom Cotton have been negotiating a compromise measure to address the issue in the face of rising Chinese semiconductor production and shortages impacting automakers and other U.S. industries.
A spokesman for Cornyn said the senator has ""not signed on to a semiconductor amendment."" 
Sources said there remains at least one sticking point over whether to include a provision on labor rates.
The chips funding is expected to be included in a bill the Senate will take up next week to spend more than $110 billion on basic U.S. and advanced technology research to better compete with China.
The proposal includes $49.5 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations to fund the chip provisions that were included in this year's National Defense Authorization Act, but which require a separate process to garner funding, according to a draft summary seen by Reuters.
Democratic Leader Senator Chuck Schumer, also involved in the talks, said Thursday the Senate will take up the technology bill known as the Endless Frontier Act next week in a package of legislation that would include efforts to ""invest in the American semiconductor industry, ensure that China pays a price for its predatory actions, and boost advanced manufacturing, innovation, and critical supply chains.""
President Joe Biden has also called for $50 billion to boost semiconductor production and research.
Supporters of funding note the U.S. had a 37% share of semiconductors and microelectronics production in 1990; today just 12% of semiconductors are manufactured in the United States.
""There is an urgent need for our economic and national security to provide funding to swiftly implement these critical programs. The Chinese Communist Party is aggressively investing over $150 billion in semiconductor manufacturing so they can control this key technology,"" the summary says.

The measure would ""support the rapid implementation of the semiconductor provisions"" in the defense bill.
The draft summary says it would include $39 billion in production and R&D incentives and $10.5 billion to implement programs including the National Semiconductor Technology Center, National Advanced Packaging (NYSE:PKG) Manufacturing Program, and other R&D programs.

408,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2021 11:56AM ET</span>",Exclusive-Tesla in talks with China's EVE for low-cost battery supply deal - sources,"SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc is in talks with Chinese battery maker EVE Energy Co to add the firm to its Shanghai factory supply chain, four people familiar with the matter said, as it seeks to boost procurement of lower cost batteries.
EVE makes lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries, which are cheaper to produce because they use iron instead of more expensive nickel and cobalt. 
But LFP batteries generally offer a shorter range on a single charge than the more popular nickel/cobalt alternative.
EVE would become the second supplier of LFP batteries to Tesla after China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Co (CATL).
The talks are advanced and the Palo Alto, California-based company is seeking to finalise the partnership in the third quarter, said two of the people. 
Shenzhen-listed EVE is running some final-stage tests of its products for Tesla, said one person. 
Shares of the Chinese battery firm jumped more than 10% in afternoon trade on Friday following the Reuters report about the talks. 
All sources declined to be identified as the discussions are private. Tesla and EVE did not reply to Reuters requests for comment. 
Tesla CEO Elon Musk said this year the company was shifting standard range cars to an iron cathode due to concerns about the supply of nickel for scaling up battery production. 
The talks come as Tesla faces growing competition from Chinese rivals such as Nio (NYSE:NIO) and Li Auto, as well as mounting cost pressure.
Tesla raised the starting price of a standard range Model 3 sedan in China by 1,000 yuan ($155) on Saturday to 250,900 yuan, citing cost fluctuations.
Data showed this week that China's factory gate prices rose at their fastest in three and a half years in April as the world's second-largest economy gathers momentum.
Tesla also faces mounting regulatory pressure in China after consumer disputes over product safety and scrutiny over how it handles data.
The company is using batteries from China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Co (CATL) and South Korea's LG Chem for its China-made Model 3 and Model Y cars.
CATL has been the sole supplier of the LFP batteries for China-made Model 3 cars with standard driving ranges since late last year.

One of the sources said Tesla could start using EVE's LFP batteries in the China-made Model 3 and Model Y vehicles within the next six months and EVE had ramped up production in order to be prepared for the possible partnership.

(Reuters) - Self-driving tech company Pony.ai, backed by  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, said on Monday its next-generation technology for robotaxis will be using lidars made by Luminar Technologies, Inc.
Lidars are laser-based sensors that are a key component to many autonomous vehicle technologies and help them perceive the environment around the cars.
James Peng, Pony.ai CEO said the startup chose Luminar's Iris lidar for its performance but also as it can be integrated into the car better than traditional lidars.
""It's actually starting to blur the line between what you see as a very well designed passenger vehicle and the monstrosities that have been on top of some of the AV test vehicles,"" said Austin Russell, founder and CEO of Luminar.
Luminar's Iris lidar is about 10 centimeters high and Peng said four of them will be mounted on top of the car for 360 degree views. He said Pony.ai is aiming for automotive-grade production of autonomous fleets in 2023 globally. 
Pony.ai has Robotaxi services in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Beijing, and Irvine and Fremont in California with a fleet of about 200 autonomous vehicles. Late last year, the startup raised $267 million at a valuation of $5.3 billion.

In addition to Pony.ai, Luminar earlier this year announced a partnership with SAIC Motor Corp, China's largest automaker and a deal with the self-driving software subsidiary of Volvo Cars, owned by China's Geely Automobile Holdings (OTC:GELYF).
Luminar, founded in 2012, is one of several U.S. lidar manufacturers in the past year to go public via reverse mergers with blank-check companies.

Investing.com – Plantronics (NYSE:PLT) shares plunged 24% as a weak guidance and supply chain bottlenecks spooked traders.
Absent supply shortages, the company said it believes demand would support sequential revenue growth after the March quarter. But the lack of available components like chips that go into its products could play spoilsport. It thus forecast numbers that are sequentially lower.
The company forecast GAAP net revenues in the June quarter to come between $410 million and $430 million, down almost 10% to nearly 14% from the $476 million it clocked in the March quarter.
Quarterly non-GAAP diluted EPS is seen coming anywhere between 35 cents and 55 cents, down from the March quarter’s $1.23.  
The outfitter of professional-grade audio and video technology said it expected tightness to continue in its supply chain, cautioning stakeholders that even as end market demand remains strong for video and headsets, servicing it will be subject to the availability of components.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Swiss Life Holding AG agreed to pay $77.4 million and enter a deferred prosecution agreement to resolve a U.S. criminal case in which Switzerland's largest insurer was accused of helping wealthy American clients evade taxes.
The three-year agreement announced on Friday resolves a charge that Swiss Life conspired to defraud the U.S. Internal Revenue Service by concealing more than $1.45 billion in offshore insurance policies.
These included more than 1,600 ""wrapper"" insurance policies into which taxpayers can place stocks, private equity holdings and other assets.
U.S. prosecutors began cracking down more than a decade ago on the use of Swiss banks to avoid federal taxes.
Swiss Life and its affiliates viewed this ""stepped-up offshore tax enforcement as an opportunity to pitch themselves to tax-evading U.S. customers as an alternative to Swiss banks,"" U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss in Manhattan said in a statement.
The Zurich-based insurer will pay a $25.3 million fine plus $52.1 million in restitution and forfeiture, and hand over information about accounts it closed between 2008 and 2019.
Swiss Life has said it set aside sufficient funds in 2020 to cover the payment.
Its general counsel accepted the deferred prosecution agreement at a hearing before U.S. District Judge Gregory Woods in Manhattan.

An agreement by Swiss bank UBS in 2009 to pay a $780 million penalty and hand over names and data on thousands of client accounts helped kick off numerous settlements with other Swiss financial companies.
Rahn+Bodmer, Zurich's oldest private bank, agreed in March to pay $22 million to settle U.S. charges it helped taxpayers who fled UBS and other Swiss banks hide money in offshore accounts.

LONDON (Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) has tapped a former  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) banker to shake up the leadership of its alternative assets franchise in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in a bid to win more business from clients spanning pension funds and sovereign investors.
Didier Denat, who spent 21 years at Credit Suisse and was a member of the Swiss bank's executive board, will chair Citi's alternative assets group (AAG) in EMEA while Theo Giatrakos has been promoted to AAG head, according to a memo seen by Reuters.
Giatrakos replaces Alexis Maskell who quit in March to join private equity firm BC Partners.
Denat left Credit Suisse in December, just before Switzerland's second-largest bank got hit by a run of costly scandals which caused it to lose more than $5 billion from the collapse of family office Archegos and the suspension of funds linked to Greensill.
Denat started his career at Citi in Zurich in 1990 and joined Credit Suisse in 1999, when he took the helm of the bank's leveraged finance and sponsors business for the EMEA region - a unit he ran for 16 years before being elevated to the top ranks and heading the corporate banking business for four years.
In his new mandate he will work closely with Giatrakos, who has been at Citi for a decade and was recently leading its investment banking franchise in Central and Southeast Europe.
""The $20 billion global wallet in alternative assets represents a large and high-growth opportunity for Citi to capture significant market share across advisory and financing products and corporate services,"" said the memo, which was signed by Anthony Diamandakis, another former Credit Suisse banker, who now co-heads Citi's global asset managers.
The U.S. bank has also hired David Ibáñez from  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) to expand its newly launched technology and communications franchise under the leadership of Philip Drury.
Ibáñez, who has also worked at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), joins as a managing director and will focus mainly on enterprise software.

Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) are two leaders in semiconductor production space that we think deserve a second look by investors amid the supply/demand imbalance. But let’s find out which of these stocks is a better buy now.Semiconductor chip stocks are the talk of Wall Street due to a current chip shortage. All indications now are that with the mass COVID-19 vaccination drive beginning to beat back the pandemic, and with federal relief dollars contributing to a resumption in consumer spending, pent up demand for 5G smartphones among other electronic devices, such as video game consoles and computers that require chips for functionality, bodes well for the semiconductor sector because these chips are integral to the production of the aforementioned goods.
So, we think beaten down chip stocks are worth a look now because it is only a matter of time until the economy fully reopens and demand for semiconductors climbs to a new level.
The challenge, of course, lies in pinpointing the best semiconductor stocks to buy and hold for the months ahead or even the long-term. We think investors should take a close close look at industry leaders, such as Broadcom (AVGO) and Micron Technology (MU). We think that are both attractive plays currently.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's financial watchdog on Friday proposed new ""consumer duty"" rules for financial services to protect people from scams and mis-selling, which have tarnished the industry for decades.
Retail investors in Britain have suffered from mis-sold financial products, including endowment mortgages, pensions and payment protection insurance. Taxpayers are also having to help investors who suffered losses after the collapse of London Capital & Finance (LCF) investment firm. 
The Financial Conduct Authority is proposing that financial services firms, which currently have an obligation to treat customers ""fairly"", would in future explicitly have to act in the best interest of retail customers when selling products or services, or act to deliver good outcomes. The wording will be finalised after a public consultation that closes in July.
This would require a significant shift in culture and behaviour for many firms who would have to demonstrate they took ""all reasonable steps"" to avoid foreseeable harm to their customers, the FCA said.
However, it stops short of the stronger statutory duty of care called for by some stakeholders to allow consumers to sue financial firms for redress.
Consumers currently must rely on the Financial Services Ombudsman, which was unable to compensate many LCF investors. 
Under the proposed rules, firms that do no comply could face enforcement action.
Firms involved in making and supplying financial products and services would also be covered by the new rules, even if they are not in direct contact with the end customer, the FCA said.
Simon Morris, partner at CMS law firm, said the proposals mostly repackage current rules and policies for greater impact after the FCA was stung by LCF and other high-profile failures of supervision.
But if the option of forcing firms to deliver good outcomes was selected it would be a ""toxic formula for creating undeliverable expectations"", Morris said.
Sheldon Mills, the FCA's executive director for consumers and competition, said the measures were significant, though he recognised there was a debate to be had over whether it would be enough.

The watchdog is also consulting on the potential benefits of attaching a ""private right of action"" to the new duty to allow consumers to sue in court.
Any new rules would be drawn up by July 2022.

418,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2021 10:45AM ET</span>",Exclusive: TSMC looks to double down on U.S. chip factories as talks in Europe falter,"By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co is weighing plans to pump tens of billions of dollars more into cutting-edge chip factories in the U.S. state of Arizona than it had previously disclosed, but is cool on prospects for an advanced European plant, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
TSMC is the world's most advanced chip-maker, and its investment plans are being closely watched amid a global chip shortage and new initiatives in the U.S. and Europe to subsidize semiconductor production. TSMC announced last year that it would invest $10 billion to $12 billion to build a chip factory in Phoenix.
Reuters this month reported that the previously disclosed factory could be the first of up to six planned plants at the site. Now, company officials are debating whether the next plant should be a more advanced facility that can make chips with so-called 3-nanometer chipmaking technology compared to the slower, less-efficient 5-nanometer technology used for the first factory.
The more advanced 3-nanometer plant could cost $23 billion to $25 billion, one person familiar with the matter told Reuters. Details of TSMC's plans for the additional factories at the Arizona site have not been previously reported.
Officials have also sketched out plans for TSMC to make next-generation 2-nanometer and smaller chips as the Phoenix campus is built out over the next 10 to 15 years, the person said.
In building the plants, TSMC is likely to compete against  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) and Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd for subsidies from the U.S. government. President Joe Biden has called for $50 billion in funding to support domestic chip manufacturing, and the U.S. Senate could take action on that as early as this week.
Some government officials worry that subsidies for TSMC could help Taiwan, where the company would likely continue to conduct research and development, more than the U.S. But the U.S. subsidy plan does not exclude foreign firms.
Government and industry officials say a strong domestic chip-making sector is critical for the economy and national security. Although U.S. chip firms such as Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp dominate their markets globally, most of their chips are manufactured in Asia.
Intel has also committed to two more new fabrication plants, or fabs, in Arizona, while Samsung (KS:005930) is planning a $17 billion factory adjacent to an existing facility in Austin, Texas. 
A debate over how to boost chip-making is also playing out in the European Union. Intel has shown serious interest in those efforts, with chief executive Pat Gelsinger pitching a subsidy that could amount to $9 billion for a proposed ""Eurofab"" during a trip to Brussels last month.
EU industry commissioner Thierry Breton, who has championed the Eurofab idea, also spoke with TSMC's Europe president, Maria Marced, last month. Although Breton publicly called the TSMC talk a ""good exchange,"" a second person familiar with the matter said the TSMC talks in Europe have gone ""very poorly.""
A TSMC spokeswoman said that the company has not ruled out any possibilities, but that there are no plans for a plant in Europe.
European chip and auto companies, for their part, are mostly lined up against the idea. They would prefer subsidies for the older-generation chips that are heavily used by car manufacturers and are in short supply.
Many of TSMC's most lucrative customers, such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), are U.S.-based, while its European customer base is made up of mostly of automakers buying less-advanced chips. In the first quarter, clients based in Europe and the Middle East only accounted for 6% of TSMC's revenue, far outpaced by the by 67% of sales from North America and 17% from Asia Pacific.
Sources said TSMC has not ruled out building an older-generation chip plant in Europe to serve auto customers.
POACHING FROM INTEL
TSMC this year hired Benjamin Miller, a 25-year Intel veteran, as its head of human resources in Arizona. The company says that it has hired 250 engineers there and that about 100 of them, along with their families, have been sent to Tainan, Taiwan, where they will complete a 12- to 18-month training program before returning to Arizona.
TSMC declined to comment on specific details of its Arizona plans, but its Chief Executive CC Wei last month said that ""further expansion is possible"" after an initial phase. He said the company would gauge efficiency at the site and customer demand and decide on the next steps.
TSMC chairman and founder Morris Chang warned last month of higher operating costs and a thin talent pool for the U.S. plans in a rare public speech attended by Wei and chairman Mark Liu. 
""In the United States, the level of professional dedication is no match to that in Taiwan, at least for engineers,"" Chang said. He warned that ""short-term subsidy can't make up for long-term operational disadvantage.""
TSMC's first Arizona factory will be relatively small, with a projected output of 20,000 wafers - 12-inch silicon discs that can each contain thousands of chips - per month. By contrast, TSMC's ""gigafabs"" in Taiwan can produce 100,000 wafers per month.

But TSMC leaders are taking a long view, starting with mature technology and ramping up volume while gradually introducing the most advanced processes, a third person familiar with the matter said. Like the others, the person declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.
“You just don’t go into Phoenix, 10,000 miles away, and start fabricating on the leading edge,” the person said.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Hong Kong authorities on Friday froze assets belonging to jailed media tycoon Jimmy Lai, including all shares in his company, Next Digital - the first time a listed firm has been targeted by national security laws in the financial hub.
Also among assets targeted were the local bank accounts of three companies owned by him, Hong Kong's Secretary for Security John Lee said in a government statement.
The statement, issued after the market close, said Lee had issued notices ""in writing to freeze all the shares of Next Digital Limited held by (Jimmy) Lai Chee-ying, and the property in the local bank accounts of three companies owned by him"".
Lai was sentenced to 14 months in prison for taking part in unauthorised assemblies during pro-democracy protests in 2019. 
He faces three alleged charges under a sweeping new national security law imposed by Beijing, including collusion with a foreign country.
The move against his assets was also made under the security law, which criminalises acts including subversion, sedition, collusion with foreign forces and secession with possible life imprisonment.
The decision by authorities to use the law's powers for the first time to target a Hong Kong listed company could have repercussions for investor sentiment.
There have been signs of capital flight since the law was imposed last June, to foreign countries including Canada, according to government agencies, bankers and lawyers.
CLAMPDOWN
Beijing said it imposed the law on the former British colony to restore order after months of pro-democracy, anti-China protests in 2019. 
However, critics say the law has been used by China's Communist leaders to suppress freedoms and pro-democracy campaigners - scores of whom have been arrested and jailed, or have fled into exile. 
The chief executive officer of Next Digital, Cheung Kim-hung, told the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily that Lai's frozen assets had nothing to do with the bank accounts of Next Digital, and that their operations and finances would not be affected.
The firm's employees pledged to continue to ""uphold their duty and keep reporting"", in a statement posted on the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page of Next Digital's trade union.
Under Hong Kong stock exchange filings, Lai is Next Digital's major shareholder and holds 71.26 percent of shares that were worth around HK$350 million ($45 million) based on Friday's closing share price. 
The value of the other ""property"" assets frozen by the authorities was not immediately clear. 
Next Digital runs the Apple Daily, Hong Kong's most influential pro-democracy newspaper that has long been a thorn in the side of Hong Kong and Chinese authorities.
Senior Hong Kong officials have recently warned Apple Daily about its coverage and have spoken of the possible introduction of a ""fake news"" law. Critics say this is all part of an ongoing crackdown on the city's media.

The Taiwan arm of Apple Daily said on Friday it would stop publishing its print version, blaming declining advertising revenue and more difficult business conditions in Hong Kong linked to politics.

(Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) will require all new hires in the United States to be vaccinated against COVID-19, one of the first major companies to issue such a mandate.
""Any person joining Delta in the future, future employees, we're going to mandate they be vaccinated before they can sign up with the company,"" Chief Executive Ed Bastian told CNN in an interview late Thursday.
Delta is not making the requirement for current employees, he said. More than 60% of Delta's employees are already vaccinated, according to the company.
While private U.S. companies can require employees to get vaccinated against COVID-19, experts have said they could put themselves at risk of legal and cultural backlash if they do so.
Delta's Bastian noted, however, that employees who are not vaccinated may not be able to work on international flights given possible entry requirements by other countries. 
""We know that vaccines are the best tool we have to protect one another and bring an end to the pandemic,"" Delta said in a statement on Friday. It called the move to require vaccines for new hires important as ""our business recovers and demand for air travel continues to rise.""
Delta is among U.S. airlines that plan to resume pilot hiring this year after a freeze on hires during the pandemic.

Among its large peers, United Airlines' CEO Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) said in January that he may mandate vaccinations for employees and called on other companies to do the same but has yet to make a move in that direction. 
A United spokeswoman on Friday said there was no change to the company's policy.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) said it does not plan to require the vaccine unless it is mandatory for entry into certain destinations. To encourage inoculation, it has offered employees who get the vaccine an additional vacation day in 2022 and a $50 gift card."

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets surged at the opening on Friday, as a fresh wave of optimism over economic reopening overcame fears of inflation and consequently a withdrawal of monetary stimulus.
Fears of the economy overheating against a backdrop of production bottlenecks and labor shortages appeared to recede after a series of Federal Reserve speakers in the course of the week reiterated that the rise in inflationary pressures - visible in surging commodity prices and April's consumer inflation report - will not last beyond the end of the year. April's retail sales data, which showed a clear cooling off of consumer spending on stuff (as opposed to services), bolstered confidence that recent developments are only quirks in a gradual return to normal consumer spending patterns.
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 217 points, or 0.6%, at 34,239 points. while the S&P 500 was up 0.8% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.0%.
Earlier. the Census Bureau had said that retail sales had stagnated in April, albeit the shortfall relative to expectations was offset by an upward revision to March data that had shown a splurge in spending as stimulus checks of up to $1,400 were distributed across the country. Economists said the slowdown was due largely to more spending being diverted to services and experiences, which are not covered by the retail sales statistics. 
The CPI report and awareness of the rally in commodities has nonetheless had an impact on consumers already. the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey for May showed a rise in five-year inflation expectations to over 3% for the first time in over seven years.
One of the biggest gainers in early trade was a beneficiary of such spending, with DoorDash stock rising over 11.5% after the food delivery company reported a tripling of revenue in the quarter through March. The company also raised its guidance for the year. 
However, two more heavily-weighted movers were heading in the other direction: Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) stock fell 4.6% to its lowest in over three months after the entertainment giant said it added fewer new subscribers to its streaming service Disney+ than expected. Disney is set to be a beneficiary of reopening, which will allow movie theater tickets to rebound and its theme parks and cruise division to resume operations. However, such benefits are still largely in the future.
Additionally, Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) stock fell, but then recovered to be up 1.0% after reporting a wider net loss and indicating that it may struggle to capitalize on the expected resurgence in tourism-related bookings this year due to a shortage of hosts. 
Reopening sentiment has been boosted by the Centers for Disease Control recommending that vaccinated people need not wear masks in a variety of indoor environments from now on. Airline stocks reacted particularly strongly to that move, with American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and United Airlines  (NASDAQ:UAL) stock all gaining between 3% and 4%."

The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) on Thursday proposed a new rule that signals steady implementation of steps to delist U.S.-listed Chinese companies whose audit work paper cannot be accessed by the PCAOB. 
Morgan Stanley said in a research report that the move is negative to Chinese American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) that are already suffering from Beijing's tighter internet regulations, and simmering concerns of rising inflation, which bodes ill for growth stocks.
""We believe this is negative for those stocks affected and would recommend hedging strategy,"" Morgan Stanley wrote.
The PCAOB proposal signals the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (HFCAA), aimed at delisting non-compliant foreign companies listed in the U.S., ""is being implemented steadily and is now closer to being fully executed,"" the bank said.
The HFCAA was signed by former U.S. President Donald Trump and has gained bipartisan support.
The S&P/BNY Mellon's China ADR Index, which tracks U.S.-listed Chinese firms including  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding, JD (NASDAQ:JD).com and Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU), is down roughly 10% so far this week, having tumbled nearly 40% since mid-February. 
The sharp fall had been partly driven by China's deepening anti-monopoly campaign, and uncertainly around rising yields amid heightened inflation expectations.
The PCAOB said its proposed rule https://pcaobus.org/news-events/news-releases/news-release-detail/pcaob-proposes-rule-to-create-framework-for-hfcaa-determinations provides a framework to use when determining whether it is unable to inspect or investigate completely accounting firms located in a foreign jurisdiction due to local rules. 

China has barred foreign access to audit works of certain overseas-listed companies, citing national security concerns. China's securities watchdog has repeatedly said it is open to discussing the issue with the PCAOB but that its proposed solution got no response from the U.S. side.

The chip crunch has driven home the need for automakers to be ""proactive"" right now, and create ""supply-chain resiliency"" longer term to avoid disruptions in the future, the firm said on Friday.
Automakers have in the past had direct supply agreements with producers of certain raw materials, including precious metals such as palladium and platinum, used in exhaust scrubbing systems. 
The more direct approach to securing precious metal supplies was launched after a supply and price disruption in that market.
Automakers are now looking at developing direct relationships with semiconductor makers, said Mark Wakefield, co-leader of AlixPartners' global automotive practice.
""These things are shocked into existence,"" he said.
Automakers have been reluctant in the past to make long term commitments to buy semiconductors or other raw materials and take on the financial liabilities for such agreements, Wakefield said. 

Now, ""the risk is real. It's not a potential"" risk of losing production to semiconductor shortages, he added. 
Separately, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said on Thursday it is redesigning automotive parts to use more accessible chips, in response to the global semiconductor shortage.

427,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2021 09:10AM ET</span>",How murky legal rules allow Tesla's Musk to keep moving markets,"By Katanga Johnson and Chris Prentice
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With his cult following, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) boss Elon Musk has amassed considerable power to move markets with his musings, but murky rules make it difficult for regulators to rein him in. 
The celebrity CEO, who boasts more than 54 million Twitter followers and has a devoted constituency on Reddit, has whipsawed the cryptocurrency market and sent some stocks soaring this year with a series of tweets and business announcements.
That power was in evidence this week. A Musk tweet on Wednesday that Tesla would no longer accept payments in bitcoin sent the cryptocurrency tumbling 17%, roiling bitcoin futures and dragging down the broader cryptocurrency market. 
Dogecoin had an even wilder ride this week, first spiralling downward after Musk called it ""a hustle"" during the U.S. ""Saturday Night Live"" TV show. Hours later, it jumped when Musk announced his commercial rocket company SpaceX would accept it for payment. The upstart cryptocurrency received a further bump on Thursday when Musk said he was involved in work to improve its transaction efficiency.
While consumer advocates said Musk was hurting investors and making a mockery of the public markets, it was unclear that he was breaking any rules simply by wielding his influence. 
""The problem here is that a loose cannon CEO continues to shoot his mouth off about any number of potential market moving events,"" said Dennis Kelleher, CEO of think tank Better Markets. ""It's clearly grossly irresponsible but it may not be illegal.""
A spokesman for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. 
Musk's tweets about dogecoin in recent months triggered a rally in the digital currency, which started as a social media parody. Near worthless in late 2020, dogecoin has surged to become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, according to CoinMarketCap.com.
Other tweets this year about retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME) and online marketplace Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) also appeared to boost their shares, while investors mistakenly snapped up shares in device maker Signal Advance believing it was the trading ticker for chat app Signal, which Musk had endorsed. 
However, lawyers said Musk would need to move an asset price with the aim of enriching himself or people close to him, or operate with inside information, to fall foul of the law. Reuters could not ascertain Musk's asset holdings.
For some, the multi-billionaire is no different from top investors like Warren Buffett or Ray Dalio, who were influencing markets long before Musk. And Musk's use of social media to reach people directly may have muddied the legal waters in his favor.
""In the past, access to these leaders were filtered through staff and press releases. Now, the general public must evaluate this information directly,"" said Timothy Shields, a partner at law firm Kelley Kronenberg who focuses on technology. 
""Where Musk's speech reflects himself personally versus Tesla is very difficult for regulators to separate and therefore regulate."" 
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates bitcoin derivatives, did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said that as a matter of course, the SEC and U.S. exchanges ""monitor for suspicious activities across regulated markets.""
SEC SETTLEMENT
Musk has crossed the line before. In August 2018, he sent Tesla's shares soaring with a tweet that he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private, when he was not even close. 
The SEC subsequently fined Musk $20 million for securities fraud and Tesla $20 million for inadequate disclosures and controls over Musk's Twitter account. The SEC also ordered Tesla to vet any material public communications Musk made regarding Tesla. 
But just months later, the SEC said that Musk violated that settlement with a tweet about Tesla's production outlook that had not been vetted. Musk's attorneys contested https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-musk-sec/musks-lawyers-call-tweet-in-secs-contempt-bid-not-material-idUSKCN1R32SF the allegation, saying the Tweet was old news and not material. 
The SEC subsequently tightened Tesla's settlement by detailing a raft of issues Musk was barred from riffing about without approval.

Lawyers said Musk's Wednesday tweet on Tesla's bitcoin about-face was carefully crafted and, as such, did not appear to breach that settlement. 
Philip Moustakis of law firm Seward & Kissel said Musk and Tesla could in theory get into hot water if the statement was false or misleading, for example, if Tesla had sold bitcoin before the announcement. But, he added, ""I would be surprised."" (This story corrects spelling of Tesla in first paragraph)

The division, started in 2011, tallied more than $240 million in revenue over the past 12 months through April 3, Tyson said Friday in a statement. That represented less than 1% of Tyson’s $43.2 billion in annual sales. The deal is expected to be completed by the end of its fiscal year in September.
For General Mills, the maker of Cheerios cereal and Progresso soup, the acquisition comes after an $8 billion purchase of Blue Buffalo pet food brand in 2018 that got it started in the category. Its pet food division grew 12% last quarter to $436 million, topping overall growth. The unit accounts for about 10% of total revenue.
“Pet food is a high-growth category, fueled by the humanization of pets, a trend that has only increased during the pandemic,” Bethany Quam, president of the General Mills pet segment, said in a separate statement.
The acquisition will be funded by cash and includes an estimated tax benefit of $225 million, General Mills said.
Shares of both companies were little changed in early trading in New York.

Investing.com – Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) shares were down 1% in Friday’s premarket as its March quarter performance showed that recovery in two key segments of the company’s business, urban travel and cross-border travel, is still elusive.
Also weighing was the fact that the company’s net loss more than tripled to $1.17 billion from $341 million in March quarter of 2020. 
The two are the strongest segments for the company historically and, a blow-out quarter notwithstanding, their slow recovery weighed on the sentiment. It prompted a few brokerages to lower their targets for the stock - although some raised theirs, too.
The company said it expects its June quarter revenue to be significantly higher than that of the same quarter last year but at a level similar to that of 2019 for the three-month period. It said its ‘nights and experiences’ segment continues to face volatility. 
Barclays (NYSE:BCS) analyst Ross Sandler lowered the price target on Airbnb to $140 from $180 while maintaining an ‘equalweight’. The stock closed at $135.75 Thursday.
 Mizuho  (NYSE:MFG) Securities analyst James Lee lowered the target to $165 from $176 while maintaining a ‘neutral’.
Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS) raised it by $2 to $164. Stifel raised its target to $145 from $140.
Airbnb’s March quarter revenue increased by 5% year-over-year to $887 million, exceeding levels seen in the same quarter of 2019, the time when the world didn’t know about Covid-19. However, analysts worry that the company is less well placed to respond to the rebound in tourism travel this year than many of its rivals. While there are thousands of hotel rooms ready to receive guests as they start to book vacations again, Airbnb's supply depends on the behavior of hosts, who have been reluctant to relist their properties after expensive cancellations due to lockdowns last year.

MILAN (Reuters) - UniCredit's largest investor BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) voted against the remuneration package that last month turned the Italian bank's new boss Andrea Orcel into one of Europe's highest paid bank chiefs, a document showed.
Orcel narrowly avoided a shareholder revolt against his pay package worth up to 7.5 million euros ($9 million) a year, securing only 54% of votes at a general meeting on April 15.
Minutes from the meeting published on UniCredit's website late on Thursday showed BlackRock was among investors that voted against the pay policy, which got rejected by shareholders accounting for almost 43% of capital present at the AGM. 
New York-based BlackRock, the world's largest money manager with $9 trillion in assets, is the top investor in UniCredit with a stake of 5.1%. A spokeswoman for BlackRock in Italy declined to comment. 
Earlier this month BlackRock was among investors that rejected the pay of executives at GE Corp. 
Also Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors, the asset manager part of German group Allianz SE, rejected Orcel's pay package, according to the minutes. A spokesman for AllianzGI confirmed all of their funds and mandates voted against.
Allianz Group is the third-largest investor in UniCredit with a 3.1% stake behind Capital Research and Management which owns 5.0%.
Orcel's package, which doubled the pay of previous Chief Executive Jean Pierre Mustier, had drawn criticism from leading shareholder advisory firms and came amid regulatory calls for restraint over pay in the face of the pandemic.
Both International Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis had recommended investors reject it, taking aim in particular with a fully guaranteed bonus for 2021.
When considering attendance of 60.5% at the general meeting, the remuneration policy received backing from only a third of UniCredit's capital.
That includes Italian shareholders Leonardo Del Vecchio, the eyewear billionaire, as well as Fondazione Cariverona and Fondazione CRT. The two charitable foundations that are historic investors in UniCredit had openly backed Orcel's pay package saying the bank faces tough choices.

UniCredit hired Orcel after falling behind rival heavyweight Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY), which last year acquired UBI and secured over a fifth of the domestic market.
In joining Italy's No. 2 bank, Orcel is relinquishing more than 25 million euros in deferred pay from former employer UBS, which he left to become CEO at Santander (MC:SAN) in 2018 before falling out with the Spanish bank over pay. ($1 = 0.8285 euros)

431,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2021 08:16AM ET</span>","Toshiba unit hacked by DarkSide, conglomerate to undergo strategic review","By Makiko Yamazaki and Benoit Van Overstraeten
TOKYO/PARIS (Reuters) -A Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp unit said it was hacked by the DarkSide ransomware group, overshadowing an announcement of a strategic review for the Japanese conglomerate under pressure from activist shareholders to seek out suitors.
Toshiba Tec Corp, which makes products such as bar code printers and is valued at $2.3 billion, was hacked by DarkSide - the group widely believed to be behind the recent Colonial Pipeline attack, its French subsidiary said.
It added, however, that only a minimal amount of work data had been lost.
""There are around 30 groups within DarkSide that are attempting to hack companies all the time, and they succeeded this time with Toshiba,"" said Takashi Yoshikawa, a senior malware analyst at Mitsui Bussan Secure Directions.
Employees accessing company computer systems from home during pandemic lockdowns have made firms more vulnerable to cyber attacks, he added.
Screenshots of DarkSide's post provided by the cybersecurity firm said more than 740 gigabytes of information was compromised and included passports and other personal information.
Reuters could not access DarkSide's public-facing website on Friday. Security researchers said DarkSide's multiple websites had stopped being accessible.
Ransomware attacks have increased in number and amount of demands, with hackers encrypting data and seeking payment in cryptocurrency to unlock it. They increasingly release stolen data as well, or threaten to unless they are paid more.
Ireland's health service said on Friday it had shut down its IT systems after what it described as a ""significant"" ransomware attack.
Investigators in the U.S's Colonial case say the attack software was distributed by DarkSide, which includes Russian speakers and avoids hacking targets in the former Soviet Union. DarkSide lets ""affiliates"" hack into targets elsewhere, then handles the ransom negotiation and data release.
STRATEGIC REVIEW 
Amid calls from shareholders to explicitly seek offers from potential suitors after dismissing a $20 billion take-private bid from CVC Capital this year, Toshiba said it was setting up a strategic review committee and had appointed UBS as financial adviser.
The review will be conducted by independent directors and is designed to help the board consider a new business plan to be put forward by management by October.
The CVC offer faced strong opposition within the company. Its plan to retain management was perceived by some as aimed at shielding former CEO Nobuaki Kurumatani from activist shareholders.
At a briefing by the company on Friday, 3D Investment Partners and Farallon Capital Management, its No. 2 and No. 3 shareholders respectively, both criticised Toshiba for appearing reluctant to consider offers to go private.
Chief Executive Satoshi Tsunakawa responded that the company has ""no reluctance to consider various proposals to increase corporate value, including going private.""
Sources have said other private equity investors such as KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc and Bain Capital are interested in Toshiba.
However, the Asahi newspaper reported on Friday that Bain Capital is not considering buying Toshiba, citing an interview with Yuji Sugimoto, the head of Bain Capital's Japan operations.
Battered by accounting scandals, massive writedowns for its U.S. nuclear business as well as the sale of its chip unit, Toshiba is a shadow of its former self.
But it remains one of Japan's few manufacturers of nuclear power reactors and makes defence equipment, meaning any sale of would require government approval.
Toshiba on Friday forecast a 63% rise in annual operating profit to 170 billion yen ($1.6 billion), rebounding from pandemic-induced pain in the last year and as restructuring measures bear fruit. That follows a 20% slide in profit last year.
Toshiba also nominated four new board members after Kurumatani resigned last month. Kurumatani had been under fire due to allegations that investors were pressured before a shareholder meeting last year to support desired board nominations.

Shareholders in March successfully voted for an independent investigation into those allegations, marking a watershed victory for corporate governance in Japan. The probe is due to conclude before this year's annual general meeting on June 25.
The board nominations announced on Friday included George Olcott, a former UBS banker who is also an independent board member at Japanese beer maker Kirin Holdings.

The deal would add Nudges, Top Chews and True Chews brands to  General Mills  (NYSE:GIS)' portfolio that already includes Blue Buffalo pet foods label. The Cheerios maker bought Blue Buffalo for $8 billion in 2018, betting on the fast-growing pet foods segment.
The bet has paid off for the company as consumers staying at home have adopted more pets over the past year to help relieve stress during the COVID-19 pandemic, and are buying premium foods for their pets.
Adoption rates at U.S. animal shelters jumped as much as 40% in 2020 over the previous year.
""Pet food is a high-growth category, fueled by the humanization of pets, a trend that has only increased during the pandemic,"" said Bethany Quam, General Mills' pet food segment president.
General Mills' sales of pet foods rose 13% for nine months ended Feb. 28, while Tyson Foods' pet treats portfolio recorded more than $240 million in net sales in the 12 months ended April 3.
General Mills expects the acquisition to modestly add to its earnings in the first 12 months after the deal, which is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.

As part of the deal, which would be funded with cash on hand and short-term borrowing, General Mills would also acquire a manufacturing facility in Independence, Iowa.
Tyson Foods, whose shares rose marginally in premarket trading, said it would provide meat ingredients for the pet treats business even after General Mills assumes ownership.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Friday, continuing to rebound after a difficult start to the week ahead of the release of key retail sales data.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 145 points, or 0.4%, S&P 500 Futures traded 25 points, or 0.6%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 135 points, or 1%.
All three major U.S. stock indexes notched solid gains on Thursday, bouncing back from three straight days of selling, The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 1.3%, or over 400 points, higher, the S&P 500 gained 1.2%, its biggest percentage gain in over a month, while the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.7%.
However, despite that strong session, the major averages are on track for losses for the week as inflation fears hit sentiment, with the Dow and S&P both over 2% lower and the tech-heavy Nasdaq down around 4.5%.
This week’s volatility has largely been as a result of a surge in inflation, with consumer prices rising at the fastest rate since 2008 and producer prices posting the biggest gain in over a decade. 
However, Federal Reserve officials have been at pains to state that the central bank’s accommodative monetary policies will not be changing any time soon. At the same time, the economic outlook is improving and the earnings season has been stronger than expected, suggesting more equity gains are possible.
Ahead of the open, April retail sales are due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), and the lingering effect of $1,400 stimulus checks will likely still be felt. While March's 9.7% gain won't be matched, economists are expecting another 1% bump. 
Industrial production data and the University of Michigan consumer sentiment numbers are also on tap. 
In the corporate sector, Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) stock was substantially lower premarket after the entertainment giant’s popular streaming service, Disney+, failed to reach as many subscribers by early April as Wall Street had estimated.
Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) stock edged lower premarket after the online lodging service’s net loss tripled due to debt repayments and restructuring costs even as its gross bookings and revenue recovered in the first quarter.
Oil prices rebounded Friday along with other risk assets as traders digested the return to operations of the largest fuel pipeline in the United States, the ongoing Covid-19 crisis in India, the third largest oil consumer in the world, and a broadly positive assessment of the outlook for demand growth from the International Energy Agency earlier in the week.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.1% higher at $64.54 a barrel, having fallen 3.4% on Thursday, the biggest drop in more than a month. The Brent contract rose 1.2% to $67.86. Both contracts have fallen around 2% this week.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.7% to $1,836.15/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% higher at 1.2115.

435,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2021 07:01AM ET</span>",Chinese firm's COVID-19 drug claims draw skepticism,"By Gabriel Stargardter
(Reuters) -Chinese biotech firm Kintor Pharmaceutical Limited saw its stock price jump by more than 20% the day after it announced on April 25 that it had ""completed the first patient enrollment and dosing"" in a late-stage U.S. clinical trial of its experimental COVID-19 treatment.
It was the company's latest announcement about the progress of the drug, Proxalutamide. The Hong Kong-listed company's stock price has nearly quadrupled since March 1 as some analysts wrote about the big sales potential for a COVID-19 treatment. Kintor has seen its market capitalization soar to HK$23.4 billion ($3 billion) from HK$6.6 billion on March 1.
But the company had not dosed any patients as of early May, according to the doctor Kintor identified as its principal clinical trial investigator in documents it posted on a U.S. trials website. The doctor - California-based gastroenterologist Zeid Kayali - also told Reuters he was ""not in charge"" of the trial, contradicting what the company had said in the documents describing the study. Kayali declined further comment, referring questions to Kintor.
Told of Kayali's comments, Kintor Chief Financial Officer Lucy Lu said Kayali was merely one of its trial investigators. She declined further comment on the firm's announcement on patient dosing. Lu declined as well to name a different principal investigator, or the institution overseeing the trial, calling that information ""confidential.""
Companies are not obliged to release such information. But many pharmaceutical firms routinely provide details about who is leading their clinical trial and which research organization or medical institution is responsible for ensuring patient safety and scientific validity.
Kintor's lack of transparency, along with inconsistencies in the company's statements, raise a ""red flag"" about the company's claims, said Stephen Ostroff, a former U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) chief scientist and two-time acting FDA commissioner.
Another red flag: Kintor has repeatedly touted a Brazilian study of Proxalutamide that claimed an effectiveness rate so high that Ostroff and other pharmaceutical specialists say it is hard to believe.
The Brazil study said Proxalutamide showed a 92% reduction in mortality risk among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, which Ostroff said would be ""breathtakingly extraordinary"" if true.
Alexandre Cavalcanti, director of Sao Paulo's HCor Research Institute, called a presentation of the study's findings by its authors ""amateur"" and said its claimed reduction of mortality risk is too high to be credible in light of a global struggle to find effective COVID-19 treatments.
Kintor stock turned briefly negative in morning trade in Hong Kong, but was trading up more than 4% at 0303 GMT, putting it on course to its third straight session of gains.
STOCK GETS A BOOST
Proxalutamide does not have regulatory approvals and is not available for sale. The Brazil study of the drug has not been peer-reviewed or published, but the authors released a short presentation of its results during a March news conference. Kintor promoted their findings.
""Based on the positive results ... we expect Proxalutamide could become an important tool in the global fight against COVID-19,"" Kintor's Chief Executive Tong Youzhi said in a statement announcing the Brazilian results on March 11.
That same day, Kintor's stock price jumped by nearly 9%.
Lu, Kintor's CFO, did not answer detailed questions from Reuters about the criticisms of the Brazil study and Kintor's claims about its U.S. trial.
One of the study's authors, Brown University dermatology professor Carlos Wambier, dismissed its critics and called its results ""very encouraging.""
In an April 2 client note, analysts from Beijing-based brokerage China Renaissance cited Kintor's progress reports as evidence of the ""potentially wider application of Proxalutamide."" They gave the stock a ""buy"" recommendation and set a target price of HK$50.75. Kintor's stock now trades at about HK$66, having reached a record high HK$82 in late April.
""The stock price is majorly driven by the COVID-19-related clinical progress,"" said Sam Hu, analyst at CMB International in Hong Kong.
One of the study's authors is a consultant hired by a Brazilian Health Ministry official who is an ally of the country's President Jair Bolsonaro. The president is a vaccine skeptic and a critic of masks and lockdowns who has promoted discredited COVID-19 remedies such hydroxychloroquine. The health official, Helio Angotti, assigned a team of consultants to find evidence to support Bolsonaro's unfounded medical claims, Reuters reported in a related story https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/man-behind-brazils-search-miracle-covid-19-cures-2021-05-14 today.
Angotti declined to comment. Bolsonaro's office did not respond to written questions from Reuters. The consultant who co-authored the Proxalutamide study, Ricardo Zimerman, did not respond to requests for comment.
RESEARCH AND POLITICS
Lu said Kintor is in talks with Brazilian federal health regulator Anvisa about conducting its own clinical trial. Anvisa said in a statement that Kintor had not filed any formal request to conduct a trial, but did not comment on any talks between the regulator and the company.
Two Anvisa staffers, speaking on condition of anonymity, questioned the results of the Brazilian Proxalutamide study, saying the authors' results presentation contained no detailed data or evidence. One of the Anvisa staffers characterized the presentation as more marketing than science. Brazil's Health Ministry, in a March technical note, concluded that ""the available evidence for the drug is still incipient,"" with limited information on safety and outcomes.
Kintor originally conceived of Proxalutamide as a cancer treatment, before pivoting to COVID-19. Lu told Reuters that the FDA had allowed the firm to progress to a Phase III trial, skipping Phases I and II, after evaluating its previous oncology studies and the Brazil research. She declined to share any documentation from the FDA outlining that permission.

The FDA declined to comment on Kintor or its COVID-19 drug.Ostroff said it was concerning and atypical that Kintor used earlier-stage oncology trials, along with the questionable Brazil study, as shortcuts to a Phase III COVID-19 trial. The company's answers to basic questions about its clinical trial, he added, were evasive.
""Most pharmaceutical companies, especially related to COVID-19, will be quite open about what sorts of trials they're doing,"" he said.

The consortium of Mohegan and Greek construction group GEK Terna last year won a Greek tender for the construction and 30-year operation of the casino resort on the site of the former Hellenikon airport on the Athens seafront.
The next steps in the process include signing the contract and clearing it with Greek auditors and parliament.
""Right now, we anticipate that upon conclusion of the contractual negotiation process, permitting and design will take approximately 12 to 18 months"", Ray Pineault, Mohegan's interim CEO told the Delphi Economic Forum in Athens.
He said that the resort was expected to open in 2025 or 2026.
The resort is part of an 8 billion euro ($9.68 billion)redevelopment plan for the former airport site by Greek developer Lamda that will eventually house shopping malls, hotels and residences.
Lamda won a government tender for the redevelopment of the site in 2014 but after years of delays due to red tape, political resistance and local opposition, has yet to be handed control. Greece's conservative government that took power in 2019 has vowed to speed up the project.
The Greek economy relies heavily on tourism, which generates a fifth of the country's economic output and employs one in five workers.
The casino resort will include a hotel, entertainment venues, convention centres and shopping and dining amenities.
""We anticipate the IRC (resort) will grow international tourism in the Attica region by at least 10%,"" Pineault said. ""It will be a facility that's unforeseen anywhere else in all of Europe.""
Lamda Development said this week it was hopeful that it can start construction work in Hellenikon, Greece's biggest urban redevelopment plan, in the autumn if it secures the property from the state next month.

“I was on the worried side about inflation and it’s all moved much faster, much sooner than I had predicted,” Summers said in an interview with David Westin on Bloomberg Television’s “Wall Street Week.” “That has to make us nervous going forward.”
U.S. consumer prices rose in April by the most since 2009, a jump that was the biggest upside forecasting miss in records dating back to 1996. Summers, a paid contributor to Bloomberg, has repeatedly warned that inflation would prove stronger than many anticipated.
He noted that the gauge excluding food and energy prices, the so-called core rate, was running faster than the headline measure, and that rising costs for housing, medical services and labor would also add to the pressures building in the economy.
Fed and Biden administration officials have argued the faster inflation will prove transitory and so is no obstacle to the easy monetary and fiscal policies they are pursuing.
But Summers said the 0.9% jump in the core measure in April left room for temporary price increases and “for us still to have an extremely serious problem of inflation rising to the 4% range. I don’t think you can dismiss these figures.”
“The Fed seems to be planning for a very benign scenario that we certainly can’t count on,” he said.
For the Democratic Biden administration, Summers cited the elections of Republicans Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan as reasons to be concerned that voters don’t ultimately like rising inflation eating into their pay packets.
“The better part of wisdom is that there are slippery slopes, and once you start a process of accelerating inflation there are precious few examples of where inflation has been brought back down without very substantial economic disruption and without enormous disruption to financial markets,” he said.

Its forecast for operating profit of 660 billion yen ($6.04 billion) in the year that began on April 1 was short of a 791.7 billion estimate by analysts, SmartEstimate data showed.
Seiji Kuraishi, Honda's executive vice president, said 100,000 vehicles were affected last year by the chip shortage, and its impact will continue in the first half of the year.
""We currently expect all those loss effects on production will be traded off in the end of the year,"" he said at an online earnings briefing.
Honda, like its global peers, has been struggling to ramp up car production due to the chip shortage, exacerbated by a fire at Renesas Electronic Corp's chip plant in Japan and blackouts in Texas where a number of chipmakers have factories.
Competitor Toyota gave a more upbeat forecast for the full fiscal year, confident it can tackle the chip shortage that has stung its rivals. Nissan (OTC:NSANY) predicted it will break even, defying expectations for a return to profitability.
Honda plans to sell 5 million vehicles this business year, up from 4.5 million in the previous 12 months.
The carmaker, which is aiming for 100% of its sales to be of electric vehicles by 2040, said it forecast expenditure of a record 840 billion yen on research and development for the year.
Its electrification strategy is supported by its alliance with General Motors (NYSE:GM), Kuraishi said.
In the three months to March 31, Japan's No.2 automaker by sales posted an operating profit of 213.2 billion yen ($1.95 billion) following a 5.6 billion yen loss a year earlier. 

That beat a consensus estimate of 107.4 billion yen profit compiled by SmartEstimate.

439,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2021 06:47AM ET</span>",The man behind Brazil's search for miracle COVID-19 cures,"By Gabriel Stargardter
RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) -Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, addressing the nation last month in a social media video, touted the latest in a string of unconventional drugs he says can ease the country's COVID-19 crisis.
Bolsonaro - a vaccine skeptic and promoter of discredited treatments such as hydroxychloroquine - said this new drug, Proxalutamide, would ""soon be available to all Brazil."" He invited a little-known Health Ministry official, Helio Angotti, to expand on its promise.
Angotti, an eye doctor with no epidemiological experience, cited a domestic Proxalutamide study showing a 92% decrease in mortality risk among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. It was a dramatic claim amid a global struggle to find effective treatments. He said he aimed to ""get it to the Brazilian population as soon as possible.""
But the study - co-authored by a consultant Angotti hired - hasn't been peer-reviewed or published, beyond a cursory results presentation the authors released in a March news conference. The drug does not have regulatory approval and isn't available for sale.
Alexandre Cavalcanti, director of Sao Paulo's HCor Research Institute, said the claimed effectiveness in the study Angotti cited far exceeds any vetted COVID-19 treatment. 
""I don't believe it,"" said Cavalcanti, who co-authored a major study, published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine, that found hydroxychloroquine essentially useless for COVID-19.
As a comparison, Cavalcanti cited the commonly used steroid, Dexamethasone, has been shown to reduce deaths by up to one-third in patients with severe COVID-19. The Chinese biotech firm that makes Proxalutamide, Kintor Pharmaceutical Limited (9939.HK), has seen its stock soar as it touted the Brazilian study and reported other progress, Reuters reported in a related story https://reut.rs/3uPlT8p today.
The appearance with Bolsonaro was the latest sign of Angotti's rising influence amid a pandemic that has killed about 430,000 Brazilians. Current and former Health Ministry employees say the mid-level official has quietly amassed power by elevating what they say is questionable science to support Bolsonaro's convictions: that masks are useless, lockdowns are dangerous, vaccines are no silver bullet, and other miracle cures are available or soon will be.
Angotti declined to comment for this story. Bolsonaro's office and the Health Ministry did not respond to requests for comment.
Carlos Wambier, one of the co-authors of the Brazilian Proxalutamide study, acknowledged it lacked peer-review but said its findings were ""really very encouraging."" He dismissed its critics as ""more concerned with politics than with scientific results."" 
""If the article is published, I believe any government in the world will pay attention,"" said Wambier, a dermatology professor at Brown University who specializes in cosmetic procedures such as Botox injections and tattoo removal.
Reuters reviewed internal ministry documents and interviewed over two dozen current and former officials, scientists and politicians to chart Angotti's rise in Bolsonaro's administration. Angotti last year became chief of the Health Ministry's Science, Technology, Innovation and Strategic Inputs (SCTIE) department. Among other duties, the SCTIE decides which drugs - not including vaccines - Brazil's vast public health system purchases. 
The sources said his department's focus on unproven coronavirus remedies such as hydroxychloroquine, along with its opposition to masks and lockdowns, contributed to the explosive spread of the infectious P1 variant, which originated last year in Manaus, the capital of Amazonas state, and made Brazil one of the world's worst hotspots.
Federal prosecutors in Amazonas have accused Angotti of administrative misconduct, in a civil proceeding that can result in fines or job loss, for pushing health workers there to prescribe hydroxychloroquine. Angotti declined to comment on that accusation.
Angotti is also under scrutiny in a high-profile congressional probe into Bolsonaro's pandemic response. The Senate has been grilling administration officials in public hearings for about two weeks, and three senators have formally called for Angotti to testify before the investigative committee, which has not yet considered their requests. The committee will produce written findings but has no power to punish administration officials.
Angotti's ascent reveals the central role that unproven treatments continue to play in Brazil. It also exemplifies the unconventional makeup of Bolsonaro's government, a coalition of soldiers, free marketeers and social conservatives.
""Helio is the face of that anti-science group that seized control of the ministry,"" said Adriano Massuda, who led the SCTIE department in 2015. ""It's the ideological wing of the Bolsonaro government that now gives orders at the Health Ministry.""
Angotti's efforts to support Bolsonaro's pandemic strategy came as the administration - now on its fourth health minister of the pandemic - was widely criticized for Brazil's delayed vaccine rollout. https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-brazil-vaccines-idCNL1N2JW1R3 As other nations scrambled to cut deals with pharmaceutical firms, Bolsonaro's administration was slow to secure vaccines for Brazil's 210 million people. About 15% of Brazilians have now received at least one dose, compared with 36% in neighboring Uruguay, 46% in the United States and between 20% and 35% in many European nations, according to Our World in Data, a nonprofit public-service research organization.
THREE CONSULTANTS AND A RESEARCH MEMO
Angotti taught at a university in southeastern Brazil before he joined the Health Ministry in 2019, when Bolsonaro took office. He served as a health education manager before being promoted last June. Like Bolsonaro, Angotti is an avowed follower of the esoteric Brazilian philosopher Olavo de Carvalho, who promotes false conspiracy theories including a claim that Pepsi used the cells of aborted fetuses as sweetener.
Bolsonaro, who took hydroxychloroquine when he contracted the virus last July, has questioned the safety and effectiveness of vaccines and declined to take a shot himself. Angotti declined to comment to Reuters on whether he considers vaccines effective.
By November of last year, Angotti had hired and assigned three consultants to find evidence to support Bolsonaro's medical claims, according to a Nov. 19 memo Angotti wrote. The memo, reviewed by Reuters, hasn't been previously reported.
Among the consultants were Ricardo Zimerman, an infectologist with some 60,000 followers on Instagram, where he regularly posts news about experimental COVID-19 treatments and photos of himself pumping iron. The two others were Bruno De Souza, a management professor at the Federal University of Pernambuco who also has a doctorate in psychology; and Rute Costa, a medical researcher.
The consultants did not respond to requests for comment.
Angotti's Nov. 19 memo instructed the consultants to ""list and criticize the protocols and articles related to the different immunization proposals."" The consultants were also to update the ministry protocol for treating COVID-19 with a cocktail of anti-malarials, such as hydroxychloroquine, along with other drugs. Angotti told them to add ""the newest proposed therapies,"" showing how they can ""save many lives.""
The memo also directed the consultants to produce a ""comprehensive assessment"" of lockdowns, focusing on the ""social and economic impacts of social isolation."" In March, the consultants co-authored a study that went beyond examining social-isolation impacts and concluded that lockdowns were ""associated"" with the emergence of the P1 variant in Manaus, asserting that the virus had mutated in cooped-up households.
In early December, the consultants shocked some staffers on the ministry's coronavirus operations desk with a presentation on why masks don't work to control virus spread, according to two people present. Others were less surprised: When Bolsonaro visited the desk in October, officials were told not to wear masks, according to a person in attendance.
HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE TO THE RESCUE
As Angotti's team chased evidence for unproven treatments, the P1 variant exploded in Manaus, accounting for three-quarters of the city's cases by the end of January, according to a study by Fiocruz, a federally funded biomedical institute. The city's hospitals quickly ran out of oxygen; the variant soon spread across Brazil.
The Health Ministry sent at least 120,000 hydroxychloroquine pills to Amazonas state and flew 12 medical professionals to the city of Manaus to push healthcare workers to use anti-malarials. Zimerman, De Souza and Costa were in the group, according to a Feb. 23 statement sent by one of Angotti's colleagues to federal prosecutors in Amazonas, responding to their inquiries about the ministry's handling of the Manaus crisis. Angotti's SCTIE financed their trips, the statement says.
The ministry also deployed a short-lived phone app that purported to help medical professionals diagnose COVID-19 with a symptoms questionnaire - then instructed them to prescribe anti-malarials like hydroxychloroquine. The app was based on a diagnostic tool that Angotti's consultants helped to develop.
Less than two weeks after its January launch, Brazil's Federal Council of Medicine (CFM), which licenses and regulates medical professionals, asked the Health Ministry to deactivate the app because it claimed ""scientific validation for drugs without international recognition."" The council said the app had been available to people who were not doctors and that it encouraged them to self-medicate. The ministry shut the app down.
The focus on hydroxychloroquine in the Manaus crisis was emblematic of the Bolsonaro administration's failed pandemic response, said Felipe Naveca, one of the first scientists to study the P1 variant and the deputy research director at the Fiocruz Amazônia biomedical institute, the organization's outpost in Manaus.
""The scale of the problem was never taken seriously,"" he said. ""So they focused on a miraculous solution that doesn't exist."" 
Amid the chaos in Manaus, one of Angotti's consultants, Zimerman, joined with other researchers to launch the study of Proxalutamide, the drug Bolsonaro and Angotti would later tout on the social media video. On March 10, just weeks after starting the study, the authors called a news conference in Manaus to announce their results.
""As a researcher, I can confirm that I've never seen anything like this - and I conduct a lot of trials,"" said Cadegiani, one of the study's co-authors. ""We're not kidding around."" 
Cadegiani declined to comment on the criticisms of the study.

Cavalcanti, the Sao Paulo scientist, said the presentation of findings for the still-unpublished study didn't meet the standards for such research.
""That study is amateur,"" he said. ""The way it was announced, how the data were presented, those guys are amateurs.""

441,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2021 06:16AM ET</span>",Google leads U.S. business push to preserve work permits for H-1B spouses,"By Paresh Dave
(Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google said on Friday it was leading about 30 companies and trade groups in opposing a lawsuit that seeks to stop over 90,000 spouses of highly skilled U.S. visa workers from having jobs in the country.
The organizations contend undoing employment authorization for spouses would cause financial havoc for families, because most made life choices such as having children or buying homes based on the expectation of two incomes.
A federal judge in Washington is expected to decide in the coming months on the lawsuit challenging the work permits tied to H-4 visas, which are issued to spouses of H-1B visa holders in high-skills roles in tech and other industries.
Google vice president of legal Catherine Lacavera said in a blog post that the company had spearheaded an amicus brief in the case. 
Save Jobs USA, a group of IT workers who say they lost jobs to visa workers, filed the lawsuit in 2015. It was delayed as President Donald Trump's administration considered rescinding the H-4 work rule. But the axe never came, and both the plaintiffs and President Joe Biden's administration now are seeking summary judgment.
After hearing employees' concerns about the uncertainty of the work program, attorneys for Google contacted trade bodies including the Information Technology Industry Council and together recruited Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) Inc, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other organizations to sign onto the filing, two sources familiar with the discussions said. 

A smaller group of businesses including Google last month filed an amicus brief supporting a separate case that seeks an order pushing the government to speed its processing of the work permits.
Businesses in ongoing litigation also are fighting rules Trump imposed requiring higher wages for H-1B holders and prioritizing workers with higher pay for the visas.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Two of Japan's megabanks, Mizuho Financial Group Inc and Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Financial Group Inc (SMFG), on Friday forecast a drop in credit-related costs this year on expectations the economy will recover as vaccination proceeds.
Mizuho is predicting credit-related costs of 100 billion yen ($914.6 million) this year, while SMFG's sees costs at 300 billion yen. Both figures were smaller than those of the last financial year.
Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga promised last week to fast-track the government's inoculation efforts and said it aimed to administer 1 million shots a day.
While Japanese banks have been struggling with low interest rates and a shrinking population, they have seen an increase in lending since last year as companies rushed to borrow due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Bank lending in Japan rose 4.8% in April from a year earlier, according to data compiled by the Bank of Japan.
Japanese bank shares have outperformed the 2.3% rise in the benchmark Nikkei index in the year to date, with Mizuho's shares up 23.7% and SMFG 25.5% higher.
""While Japan's economy is expected to recover gradually as vaccination proceeds, it's still unclear how COVID-19 would impact specific industries,"" SMFG's chief executive Jun Ohta told an earnings briefing.
Japan has not suffered as badly as other countries from the pandemic but its vaccination campaign has been slow. So far only around 3% of the population of about 126 million has received at least one vaccine dose, Reuters data showed.
Even though the banks expect smaller credit-related costs in this fiscal year, they need to closely monitor the costs longer term, said S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings senior director Ryoji Yoshizawa.

""The repayment ability of some sectors such as aviation and retail is deteriorating... It's unclear whether they can bear swelling debt in the post COVID-19 era,"" he said

Flights to Tel Aviv from Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, Larnaca in Cyprus and Varna in Bulgaria were cancelled on Friday, Wizz Air's website showed.
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has warned airlines to monitor heightened tensions in Israel, including exchanges of rocket fire and air strikes.

By Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plans to propose a rule requiring that public companies disclose a range of workforce data as the agency steps up environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosures, its new chair, Gary Gensler, said on Thursday.
Gary Gensler told an audience of agency and academic researchers that ""investors increasingly want to understand information about...one of the most critical components of companies, their workforce.""
He said staff would propose a new rule on disclosing the workforce or ""human capital"" metrics. Those disclosures could include data on issues such as workforce diversity, part-time versus full-time workers, and employee turnover, according to advocacy groups that have been pushing for the new rules. 
""This is one of my top priorities and will be an early focus during my tenure at the SEC,"" Gensler told the gathering.
The SEC is ramping up its ESG agenda to execute on Democrats' priorities to address issues such as climate change and social injustice. Gensler has previously said the agency was also planning a new climate change disclosure rule. 
Earlier this year, former acting SEC chair Allison Lee launched https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-climate-sec/u-s-regulator-launches-review-of-companies-climate-risk-disclosures-idUSKBN2AO2LZ a review of public companies' climate risk disclosures to help SEC staff modernize the agency's decade-old climate guidance.
Advocacy groups had been pushing the SEC to provide more useful ESG disclosures after former Republican President Donald Trump's regulators eroded investors' access to material disclosures and their ability to push for ESG measures.

Gregg Gelzinis, a senior analyst at Washington-based Center for American Progress, said that while climate risk should be a priority, the SEC shouldn't forget about social issues and governance.
""Investors need reliable, consistent, and comparable information on a range of other issues, including political spending, human rights, human capital management, diversity and inclusion, international taxes, gender and executive pay ratios, and more.""

By Andrew Galbraith and Samuel Shen
SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Alibaba affiliate Ant Group became China's largest seller of non-money-market mutual funds in the first quarter, industry data showed, disrupting a market dominated by banks despite a regulatory crackdown.
Ant and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) are being targeted by Beijing's anti-monopoly campaign. Regulators have urged Ant to reduce the size of Yu'ebao, China's biggest money market fund managed by Ant-controlled mutual fund house Tianhong. 
Outstanding non-money-market mutual funds sold by Ant's fund sales arm were worth 890.1 billion yuan ($138.23 billion) at the end of the first quarter of 2021, according to data released late Thursday by the Asset Management Association of China (AMAC).
China Merchants Bank took the second spot at 707.9 billion yuan, followed by Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the country's biggest lender. 
It was the first such ranking released by AMAC, highlighting the rapidly growing clout of independent fund advisers that sell funds via mobile apps and the internet, by-passing bank outlets. 
""It's.. about the strength of big-tech-company-backed IFAs (independent fund advisers), how far they have reached, how deep their client base is and how adaptive they are to the market trends,"" said Ivan Shi, director at Z-Ben Advisors, a consultancy. 
""It also speaks to how much service and tool development different tech companies have put into their IFA platforms.""
Ant (Hangzhou) Funds Sales Co's main distribution channel is Ant's ubiquitous payment platform Alipay. 
Shi said Ant's top rankings could also reflect lower risk appetite as investors shift away from equities funds to fixed-income products, which are popular on Alipay. 
""If you log into the Alipay app, a lot of the products they are promoting are short-term bond funds, fixed income products. That's a very quick response to market trends, so that's going to catch a lot of outflows from equity products.""
According to AMAC's ranking, Shanghai Tiantian Fund Distribution ranked fifth during the first quarter, while other tech-driven sales platforms, including Tencent's fund sales unit and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU)'s Du Xiaoman Fund Sales, far lagged Ant. 

Revenues at Ant's fund sales company more than tripled to 6.01 billion yuan in 2020 from a year earlier, public disclosures showed.

448,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2021 05:06AM ET</span>","Hyundai to invest $7.4 billion in U.S. by 2025, with electric cars in focus","(Reuters) -South Korea's Hyundai Motor Group said on Thursday it planned to invest $7.4 billion in the United States by 2025 to produce electric vehicles, upgrade production facilities and further its investment in smart mobility solutions. 
Hyundai's announcement comes as U.S. President Joe Biden's administration prioritized a push toward electric cars, aiming to replace the 650,000 vehicles in federal fleets with U.S.-made electric vehicles.
In January, Biden also signed an executive order aimed at imposing tougher rules on government procurement practices to increase purchases of American-made products, strengthening domestic manufacturing and create markets for new technologies. 
Analysts said Hyundai's U.S. investment was essential to take advantage of the Biden administration's EV policies and to receive subsidies and tax incentives. 
""If Hyundai seeks to fully leverage U.S. EV policies, they need to pursue not only EV production but also sourcing major auto parts in the United States,"" said Kevin Yoo, an analyst at eBEST Investment & Securities.
Lee added that it is up to how the South Korean carmaker sources U.S.-made batteries for its U.S. EV production, raising potential further investment in the United States by top battery makers. 
Hyundai's announcement came before U.S. President Joe Biden meets with South Korean President Moon Jae-in in Washington next week in talks that are expected cover North Korea, COVID-19 vaccines and other topics.
Biden has called for $174 billion in new spending to boost electric vehicles and charging. 
The group's Hyundai Motor Co will begin electric vehicle production at a U.S. facility in 2022, while affiliate Kia Corp also plans to build electric vehicles in the United States. Hyundai has a factory in Alabama, while Kia produces cars at a plant in Georgia.
""We are reviewing options including expanding on our production facility after we’ve taken a closer look at U.S. market conditions and U.S. government’s new EV policy,"" Hyundai said in a statement to Reuters. 
The move comes as Hyundai's major electric battery supplier, SK Innovation, proceeds with construction of new U.S. factories for Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Ford and plans to expand capacity in the United States. 
SK Group chairman Chey Tae-won has said SK could invest up to $5 billion for battery business in the United States, meaning it appears there is room for SK to invest further in the U.S., a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday. 
Since 2018, SK Innovation has so far invested about 3 trillion won ($2.6 billion) to build two EV battery factories in Georgia. 
Hyundai Motor Group, South Korea's No. 2 conglomerate, did not provide the investment breakdown but said the spending would be primarily for Hyundai and Kia. Analysts said that Hyundai is likely to allocate the biggest amount to its EV capex, and that spending for cooperation with other U.S. companies could be more flexible depending on how the U.S. EV market changes. 

Hyundai said it will work with the U.S. government and business partners to install hydrogen refueling stations and offer its NEXO hydrogen SUVs.
Hyundai is also investing in robotics, urban air mobility and autonomous driving technology, the company said.

The upbeat forecast by the world's biggest contract electronics manufacturer reinforces strong growth momentum that saw its first-quarter profit rocket with revenue rising by 45%, even as it is forced to sharply reduce iPhone production in India due to surging coronavirus cases there. [nL1N2MY0BX
It also echoes Apple's own positive outlook. In April the tech giant said it expected revenue for the June quarter to grow by ""strong double digits"".
""Smartphone demand remains strong ... we will see relatively strong growth (on the year) in the second quarter,"" Chairman Liu Young-way told an online investors conference. 
Officially known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, Foxconn said January-March net profit surged to T$28.2 billion ($1 billion) from T$2.1 billion a year earlier, when business was badly hit by factory disruptions early in the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The result was well above an average forecast of T$24.41 billion compiled from 11 analysts' estimates by Refinitiv, and up 42% up from first-quarter 2019 net profit.
Foxconn said sales from its major revenue contributor - consumer electronics including smartphones and wearable devices - climbed more than 15% in the first quarter from a year earlier, while computing products such as laptops also rose more than 15%.
First-quarter revenue rose 45% from a year earlier to T$1.34 trillion. That was Foxconn's highest ever first-quarter revenue, marking a 28% jump from the same period in 2019.

The company had previously expected first-quarter revenue to be ""better than normal"" for the season thanks to strong sales of smartphones and telecommuting devices. Foxconn said it was closely monitoring ""materials shortages"" in the consumer electronics supply chain, amid a crunch in semiconductor supplies that has hit the auto industry, though described the impact as ""limited"". It assembles iPhones at plants in China and India, the latter now ravaged by the spread of the coronavirus. Foxconn's shares have risen 14% this year. They ended up 1.5% on Friday, compared with a 1% rise for the broader market.

At 3:55 AM ET (0855 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.3%, and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.6%.
Markets in Europe have benefited from a strong handover from Wall Street, with the broad-based S&P 500 recording its biggest percentage gain in over a month, and then Asia, as global stocks bounced after three straight days of selling.
Federal Reserve officials have been out in force reiterating that price pressures from the reopening of the economy would prove transitory, and the central bank wouldn’t be changing its ultra easy monetary policies anytime soon.
Back in Europe, Spanish CPI rose 2.2% on the year in April, suggesting inflation pressures on the continent are nowhere near the levels seen in the U.S.
Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) could be in the spotlight Friday after Reuters reported that the Japanese firm’s European business has been hit by a cyberattack, while Ireland's health service operator shut down all its IT systems to protect it from what it described as a significant ransomware attack.
 Reckitt Benckiser  (LON:RKT) stock edged 0.2% higher after Reuters reported the British consumer goods company has shortlisted a number of bidders to submit binding offers for its infant formula business in China.

 Danone  (PA:DANO) stock slipped 1.8% after influential investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) downgraded its stance on the French food group to ‘sell’ from ‘neutral’, citing weaker demographic trends, particularly in China.
Oil prices stabilized Friday as traders digested the return to operations of the largest fuel pipeline in the United States, the ongoing Covid-19 crisis in India, the third largest oil consumer in the world, and a broadly positive assessment of the outlook for demand growth from the International Energy Agency earlier in the week.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% lower at $63.76 a barrel, having fallen 3.4% on Thursday, the biggest drop in more than a month. The Brent contract fell 0.2% to $66.92. Both contracts have fallen around 2% this week.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - British consumer goods company Reckitt Benckiser Group has shortlisted bidders including Bain Capital,  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) and dairy producer Yili to submit binding offers for its Greater China infant formula business, sources said.
The group has hired  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) to run an auction of infant formula unit Mead Johnson in Greater China, in a deal that could fetch over $2 billion. Morgan Stanley declined to comment. 
Also on the shortlist are Sequoia Capital China teaming up with its portfolio company Shijiazhuang Junlebao Dairy Co, and private equity firm KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR), said the sources, who declined to be named as the information is confidential. 
Carlyle is bidding jointly with CITIC Capital, said two of the people.
Shortlisted bidders are to submit binding bids by June 11, said another two of the sources.
Bain, Carlyle, KKR and Sequoia China declined to comment. Reckitt, CITIC Capital, Junlebao and Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Reckitt's sale of Mead Johnson China comes as the world's second largest economy this week reported its slowest population increase since the first modern population survey in the 1950s, with birth rates declining to the levels seen in ageing societies like Japan and Italy.
The exit also follows French dairy giant Danone which sold its 9.8% stake in China Mengniu Diary this week for about $1.6 billion euros.
Some investors are wary of how China's demographic shift is going to impact the infant formula industry, said the sources.
Hong Kong border closures during the pandemic has also weighed in on Reckitt's infant formula business, its executives have said. 
Reckitt's Greater China infant formula business represents 6% of group sales, which were almost 14 billion pounds ($19.8 billion) in 2020, up 11.8% year-on-year, it said in February.
U.S.-headquartered Mead Johnson, which Reckitt bought for $16.6 billion in 2017, runs a range of infant formula brands including Enfamil, Enfapro and Lactum.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening higher Friday, helped by the rebound on Wall Street as Federal Reserve officials managed to ease investor jitters over growing inflationary pressures.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.6% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.4%. 
All three major U.S. stock indexes notched solid gains on Thursday, bouncing back from three straight days of selling on worries that rising inflation will push the Federal Reserve into tapering its ultra easy monetary policies earlier than it is currently guiding. 
The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 1.3%, or over 400 points, higher, the S&P 500 gained 1.2%, its biggest percentage gain in over a month, while the Nasdaq Composite picked up the rear, rising 0.7%.
This positive tone has continued in Asia, with Japan’s Nikkei leading the rebound, gaining over 2%, and Europe is expected to follow suit.
Federal Reserve officials have been out in force reiterating that price pressures from the reopening of the economy would prove transitory. Overnight, Governor Christopher Waller signaled that rates won't rise for quite some time, echoing comments from Lael Brainard and Richard Clarida earlier in the week.
Back in Europe, evidence of inflationary pressures on this side of the pond will come from Spanish April CPI data, although the expected annual gain of 2.2% is nowhere near the levels seen in the U.S..
In corporate news, Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) could be in the spotlight after Reuters reported that the Japanese firm’s European business has been hit by a cyberattack, just days after Colonial Pipeline suffered a similar fate in America.

Oil prices edged lower Friday, continuing the previous session’s selloff amid a broad retreat in commodities that followed a sharp pick-up in consumer prices. Additionally, Colonial Pipeline, the largest fuel pipeline in the United States, resumed operations after an almost weeklong closure.
That said, losses are small as traders digest a broadly positive assessment of the outlook for demand growth from the International Energy Agency earlier in the week.

The U.S. online retail and tech giant is seeking ways to procure electricity over the long term from exclusive renewable energy power stations, the Nikkei said.
A Japanese trading house is considering supplying electricity to Amazon from an off-shore wind farm to be built in Japan if it wins in the government auction that began last year, the Nikkei said.
The Japanese government brought in a law in 2019 to enhance development of offshore wind farms, allowing operators to use designated sea zones for 30 years. The auction under the new law started last year.
Amazon is also in talks with power companies to build a new solar power plant, the Nikkei said.
The tech behemoth, which has seven data centres in Japan, aims to make all the power consumed globally by its data centres renewable by 2025, according to the Nikkei.
Amazon was not immediately available for comment.

The U.S. company has pledged to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2040 and to power all its operations with renewable energy by 2030. 
The company issued its first sustainability bond on Monday, raising $1 billion to invest in renewable energy, clean transport, greener buildings and affordable housing.

458,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2021 11:05PM ET</span>","Disney's streaming growth slows as pandemic lift fades, shares fall","By Lisa Richwine and Tiyashi Datta
(Reuters) -Disappointing growth of Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's namesake streaming service on Thursday overshadowed better-than-expected overall profits, driving down shares of the entertainment company. 
Shares of Disney fell 3.7% in after-hours trading.
CEO Robert Chapek said that movie and television shows were resuming normal production and new offerings would help bring in new customers to Disney+, ESPN+, Hulu and Hotstar.
Adjusted earnings-per-share for the fiscal second quarter came in at 79 cents for January through April 3, Disney said. Analysts had expected 27 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Disney is focusing on quickly building its streaming service to challenge Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) as audiences move away from cable TV. The company's popular theme parks remain in recovery mode with attendance limits due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
""(Disney+) growth is significantly decelerating as the initial pandemic boost has waned,"" eMarketer analyst Eric Haggstrom said. ""Given Disney's content investments, subscriber growth should return strongly once this short-term turbulence ends."" 
Upcoming Disney+ series include ""Loki"" about the Marvel villain and Star Wars series ""The Book of Boba Fett."" 
A total of 103.6 million customers subscribed to Disney+ as of early April, the company said. Two Marvel superhero series, ""WandaVision"" and ""The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,"" debuted during the quarter. Analysts had projected 109.3 million, according to FactSet.
The average monthly revenue per paid subscriber for Disney+ decreased from $5.63 to $3.99, the company said, due to the launch of the lower-priced Disney+ Hotstar in overseas markets. Factset estimates showed Wall Street was expecting average revenue of $4.10 per user. 
Disney plans to launch Disney+ in Malaysia on June 1 and in Thailand on June 30, executives said on a call with analysts. 
Overall revenue fell 13% to $15.61 billion in the second quarter ended April 3, a touch below what analysts estimated, according Refinitiv.
Net income from continuing operations rose to $912 million in the second quarter from $468 million a year earlier. 
Operating income at Disney's media division rose 74% from a year earlier to $2.9 billion as profit rose at domestic and international TV networks. The streaming media unit lost $290 million, less than half of what Wall Street expected, thanks in part to higher advertising revenue at Hulu and ESPN+ income from Ultimate Fighting Championship pay-per-view events.
The theme parks division posted an operating loss of $406 million. The Disneylands in California and Paris were closed for the full quarter. Disneyland in California reopened April 30.
Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy said reservations at Disney's U.S. parks were strong, ""demonstrating the strength of our brands as well as growing travel optimism."" 

Chapek said Disney will continue to experiment with movie distribution while theaters try to lure audiences back. The company will offer late summer releases ""Free Guy"" and ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the 10 Rings"" exclusively in theaters for 45 days, a shortened period that has been embraced by other studios to allow for home viewing sooner. 
Disney renewed a deal with Major League Baseball with 30 exclusive regular season games through 2028. The deal includes an option to simulcast all live MLB coverage for ESPN networks on ESPN+.

459,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2021 10:30PM ET</span>",Analysis: Japan Inc squeezed by surging costs and frugal consumer fears,"By Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) - At his factory in Tokyo, Shigeki Kato has a grim strategy to deal with rising costs that threaten profit margins: grin and bear it.
Kato's Orion Industry Corp supplies precision steel sheets to semiconductor makers. It has been squeezed by the soaring cost of nickel, which has increased stainless steel prices by as much as 30% since October.
But like many Japanese manufacturers, Kato's fear of losing market share is stopping him passing on higher costs to customers.
The global surge in commodities prices has now made Japan's decades-old fight against its ""deflationary mindset"" even more critical as businesses in the world's third-largest economy's struggle to break even.
""Raw materials are getting more expensive. They're soaring, it's trouble,"" Kato told Reuters in an interview.
""We just have to put up with it.""
Japanese firms' aversion to passing on higher prices has made it hard to raise wages for fear of being saddled with high fixed costs, which in turn feeds deflationary pressures.
The gap between the pace of input price gains, which include intermediate goods used to make finished items such as cars and computers, and output price rises in April was the widest since 2014, factory surveys showed, underscoring the pressures manufacturers face.
While competitors in other countries face similar pressures, the stakes are higher for Japan as a resurgence of coronavirus cases cools consumption, leaving the economy vulnerable to a downturn in exports.
The input price jump is largely due to strong global demand for goods, due to a rebound in economic activity in the United States and elsewhere as countries ease pandemic lockdown measures.
""Many factories want to use steel and other intermediate materials,"" said Naoyuki Yoshino, an adjunct professor at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies.
""The production of those intermediate materials has been drastically diminished.""
Supply chain disruptions from a global semiconductor chip shortage and a weakening yen were also driving up costs.
HIT TO HIP POCKET
Japanese wholesale prices posted their first annual increase in more than a year in March, while core consumer prices slid for the eighth straight month, in a sign rising commodity costs are pinching corporate margins.
The Bank of Japan (BOJ) recently blamed weak inflation for the strong belief among households and companies that prices won't rise much, which became entrenched after two decades of deflation through the late 1990s.
The BOJ's most recent quarterly survey of companies, known as the tankan, found firms still saw sales prices falling and input prices rising more rapidly.
Outside of Japan, the debate about inflation has mostly centred on how long commodities price pressures will persist and whether they would lead to destabilising consumer inflation.
U.S. consumer inflation hit a near 12-year high in April, heightening investor concerns the Federal Reserve may have to raise interest rates soon.
In China, where factory gate inflation hit a 3-1/2 year high, a prominent economist has warned of stagflation, a mix of slow growth and high prices that hit the United States in the 1970s.
Even within Japan, there are emerging views that consumers may be more willing to take a hit to the wallet than companies think, especially for established brands, including Japanese cars.
""It would make me think if prices went up a lot, but I would still pay it,"" said Susumu Sakurai, 60, who has driven Toyota for decades, and owns a Prius hybrid model.
While that suggests upside potential for consumer prices, for now, carmaker suppliers are shielding themselves from rising material costs, industry sources told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
A manager working for a parts supplier to Toyota and rivals such as Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co and Honda Motor Co, said his company aimed to keep cost down by streamlining parts usage across firms and car models, which would mean less wholesale demand.
""Carmakers want to avoid raising sales prices as much as they can, so they're trying to do whatever is in their might to reduce costs at the stage before cars are finished,"" the manager said.

A manager at a piston ring maker said his firm plans to partly pass on costs it faced from rising cobalt prices, but the extent to which it can do so depended on whether prices stayed high.
Cobalt, a material used in lithium-ion rechargeable batteries, has been in scarce supply due to COVID-19 logistical issues in South Africa and after top consumer China stockpiled the metal.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up Friday morning, with investors shifting their focus to value from growth companies as signs of a strengthening U.S. labor market calmed inflation worries.

South Korea’s KOSPI was up 0.51% and in Australia, the ASX 200 gained 0.64%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index edged up 0.18%.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched down 0.04% while the Shenzhen Component was up 0.31%, with the MSCI Inc. Index covering the country’s stocks entering bear territory.
U.S. shares ended higher fall during the previous session, thus ending a three-day fall. The Korean, Australian and Japanese indexes also posted their first gains in four sessions.
Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares fell as Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk’s tweet announcing the suspension of payments using bitcoin due to environmental concerns continued to have reverberations. Bitcoin was trading around the $50,000 mark during the Asian session, clawing back some gains after Musk’s tweet.
Investors seemed to be recovering from unexpectedly high U.S. inflation data, including the Core Consumer Price Index. U.S. producer prices released on Wednesday were also higher than expected. The Producer Price Index grew 0.6% month-on-month and 6.2% year-on-year in April.
Investors now await retail sales data, due later in the day.
However, initial jobless claims for the week fell to a 14-month low of 473,000, boosting investor sentiment.
Treasuries were also on the rise, with the benchmark 10-year yield easing to 1.66% even as an auction for 30-year bonds disappointed.
The U.S. Federal Reserve made some slight changes to its purchasing plan to focus more on longer-dated Treasuries but made no changes to the $80 billion monthly total.
“We see 10-year yields move up, we see inflation expectations move up, but as long as the underlying economic backdrop is still doing just fine it should power that value trade generally... we’re going to have some interesting days but the runway is there from an economic perspective for this rotation to keep going,” RBC Capital Markets head of equity strategy Lori Calvasina told Bloomberg.
On the commodities front, persistent concerns about a possible pullback in Fed support saw a recent rally hit the pause button. Oil fell to its lowest levels in over a month as concerns about runaway inflation raise the possibility of the Fed turning away from its current dovish policy.
However, a string of officials from the central bank reiterated that it will maintain its stance for the foreseeable future. Fed Governor Christopher Waller, the latest official to add his two cents, said the economic reopening is driving a temporary surge in price pressures which could last through 2022."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street ended sharply higher at the close of a broad rally on Thursday, bouncing back from three straight days of selling on upbeat labor market data.
All three major U.S. stock indexes notched solid gains, with the S&P 500 enjoying its biggest percentage gain in over a month. The Nasdaq, weighed by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, picked up the rear.
Meanwhile, cyclical shares, which stand to benefit most from economic revival, enjoyed the biggest gains.
Recent economic data has prompted inflation fears as scarcity of both materials and workers threatens to send prices surging in the face of a demand boom.
""If this is a footrace, supply chains are still tying their shoes,"" said David Carter, chief investment officer at Lenox Wealth Advisors in New York. ""But they will catch up with demand fairly quickly.""
But on Thursday, investors appeared to be focusing on the glass-half-full side of the demand/supply equation. 
This was evidenced by the outperformance of small caps, chips and transports, economically sensitive stocks that stand to gain as the United States emerges from the pandemic recession.
""Sectors and stocks that were hurt most significantly by yesterday's sell-off rebounded strongly today given that economic growth is expected to remain strong throughout the year and any inflation is likely to be temporary,"" Carter added.
New applications for unemployment insurance continue to fall, according to jobless claims data from the Labor Department that hit a 14-month low.
Labor Department data also showed producer prices surged last month, building on the inflation surge narrative of Wednesday's consumer prices report.
""The inflation boogeyman is back right on cue,"" Carter said. ""And will continue to spook markets for the coming months.""
But rising prices were widely anticipated, and the U.S. Federal Reserve has provided repeated assurances that it does not foresee those spikes morphing into sustained, long-term inflation.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 433.79 points, or 1.29%, to 34,021.45, the S&P 500 gained 49.46 points, or 1.22%, to 4,112.5 and the Nasdaq Composite added 93.31 points, or 0.72%, to 13,124.99.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, 10 ended green, with industrials enjoying the largest percentage gain.
Energy, weighed by a drop in crude prices, was the sole loser, shedding 1.4%. [O/R]
Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co shares were down nearly 5% in after-hours trading after posting quarterly results. 
Dating app owner Bumble Inc tumbled 14.3%, falling below its initial public offering price, as investors remained cautious about how quickly users will return to in-person meetings.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co rose 0.8% after gaining approval from U.S. regulators for a fix of an electrical grounding issue.
Tesla continued its slide, dropping 3.1%, the heaviest drag on the Nasdaq, after boss Elon Musk doubled down on his sudden rejection of cryptocurrency bitcoin.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.91-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.06-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

(Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Thursday dismissed antitrust claims against Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google brought by a group of advertisers, but offered them a chance to try again after addressing what she called ""serious concerns."" 
The ruling by District Judge Beth Labson Freeman in San Jose, California, marks one of the first major decisions in a spate of antitrust cases filed against Google over the last two years by users and rivals as well as the U.S. Department of Justice and state attorneys general.
Labson Freeman said plaintiffs, including Hanson Law Firm and Prana Pets, that alleged Google abuses its dominance in digital advertising need to clarify which market they think it monopolizes. 
""The Court is particularly concerned that Plaintiffs’ market excludes social media display advertising and direct negotiations,"" she wrote. 
The plaintiffs also need to better explain why Google's refusal to support rival systems that the advertisers rely upon is anticompetitive, because antitrust law does not require monopolists to help competitors survive, Labson Freeman said. 
""The Court has serious concerns that some of Plaintiffs’ allegations rely on a 'duty to deal' theory of antitrust,"" she wrote.
Plaintiffs have until June 14 to amend their lawsuit, according to the decision.

Google in other cases faces claims about its dominance of search and mobile software businesses. InItial decisions in those cases could be years away. For instance, a federal judge in Texas this month heard arguments on whether to schedule a trial for the spring of 2022, as states that brought the lawsuit prefer, or fall of 2023, as Google seeks.

463,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2021 08:36PM ET</span>","U.S. will not immediately lift mask rules in air, public transit","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Biden administration's requirements that people wear masks on U.S. airplanes, public transport, airports and ride-hailing vehicles are not expected to be lifted anytime soon, despite an easing in the rules for mask-wearing elsewhere.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced on Thursday that it was easing its guidance for fully vaccinated people, saying they do not need to wear masks outdoors and can avoid wearing them indoors in most places.
But it said workers and travelers should still follow federal requirements to wear masks in transit and in airports and train stations.
There are no requirements that passengers get vaccinated to use transit systems and the Biden administration has opposed the idea of making vaccine passports mandatory.
The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) on April 30 extended face mask requirements across U.S. transportation networks through Sept. 13 to address the spread of COVID-19. TSA says transportation system operators have reported almost 2,000 passengers for refusing to wear a face mask since requirements took effect Feb 1.
A TSA spokeswoman said Thursday ""we will continue to work closely with the CDC to evaluate the need for these directives.""
Airlines for America, a trade group, said U.S. airlines ""will enforce the requirement on flights as long as the federal mandate is in place.""
Earlier this month, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said airlines have referred 1,300 unruly-passenger reports since February, with most related to not wearing masks, as the agency takes a tough enforcement line and issues hefty fines for noncompliance.
The FAA said Thursday its ""zero-tolerance policy toward unruly passengers will remain in effect at least as long as the TSA/CDC face mask mandate is in effect.""

Association of Flight Attendants-CWA International President Sara Nelson, representing nearly 50,000 flight attendants at 17 airlines, noted aircraft cabins are ""an enclosed, pressurized, and increasingly crowded space as people return to the sky in fewer and smaller airplanes.""
She added that ""rules for aviation safety are harmonized around the world, and we must have credibility in the safety of flight if the U.S. aviation industry is to regain access to the rest of the world and fully recover.""

(Reuters) -U.S. railway operator Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) said on Thursday that it had accepted Canadian National Railway Co's $33.6 billion acquisition offer, upending a $29 billion deal with its competitor  Canadian Pacific  (NYSE:CP) Railway Ltd.
The development, first reported by Reuters, gives Canadian Pacific five business days to make a new offer for Kansas City Southern. Were Canadian Pacific to table a new offer, a bidding war could ensue.
Canadian Pacific had previously announced a deal to buy Kansas City Southern on March 21, before Canadian National said it had submitted a higher bid on April 20. The headline price in Canadian National's cash-and-stock bid remains $325 per share as originally announced, though the company offered more of its shares to compensate for a decline in its stock price.
Canadian National has offered to cover the $700 million break-up fee Kansas City Southern will owe Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. It will also pay Kansas City Southern $1 billion if the U.S. Surface Transportation Board (STB) rejects a voting trust structure it has put forward to complete the deal.
""We believe that Canadian Pacific's negotiated agreement with Kansas City is the only true end-to-end Class I combination that is in the best interests of North American shippers and communities,"" a Canadian Pacific spokeswoman said.
Canadian Pacific and larger rival Canadian National are in a race to take over the U.S. railroad operator, which would create the first direct railway linking Canada, the United States, and Mexico.
Either of them acquiring Kansas City Southern would create a North American railway spanning the United States, Mexico and Canada, as supply chains recover from COVID-19 pandemic-led disruptions.

The acquisition interest in Kansas City Southern also follows the ratification of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement last year that removed the threat of trade tensions, which had escalated under former U.S. President Donald Trump.
The STB last week approved the voting trust for Canadian Pacific's proposed acquisition. Canadian National has offered an identical arrangement.

(Reuters) - Aeva Technologies Inc said on Thursday it signed a deal to develop a sensor for a self-driving car to be made by an ""undisclosed large company,"" and its shares rose 13% even as it reported that its loss ballooned and sales came in far below forecasts.
Aeva reported first-quarter revenue of $300,000, down from $500,000 a year earlier and far below analysts' estimate of $1.38 million, according to Refinitiv estimates. Its adjusted operating loss more than doubled to $15.6 million from $6.1 million a year ago.
Founded by two ex-Apple Inc engineers, Aeva makes a sensor that helps self-driving cars navigate through the use lidar technology that uses lasers, much like radar uses radio waves. The company became publicly traded through a reverse merger earlier this year and was one of several lidar firms to do so.
Aeva said on Thursday it had signed a ""foundational agreement with an undisclosed large company to develop best-in-class lidar"" for the customer's autonomous driving program. 
Aeva's shares were up 13% at $8 in after-hours trading after the results and customer announcement.
In an interview, Aeva Chief Executive Soroush Salehian said the company could not disclose when it would go into mass production with the undisclosed customer but that ""there's going to be increased activity as we work toward production.
""This has a huge potential,"" he said, ""and based on what we know, it could be one of the largest programs in the industry.""

Aeva has deals with automotive suppliers Denso Corp and ZF Friedrichshafen AG to mass-manufacture its sensors. 
Earlier this week, the company said it added to its advisory board Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) senior executive Steve Zadesky and Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) Senior Vice President Alex Hitzinger, who was also once part of Apple's self-driving car Project Titan. Porsche Automobil Holding SE, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s majority voting shareholder, is also an investor in Aeva.

(Reuters) -State Street Corp agreed to pay a $115 million criminal penalty and enter a deferred prosecution agreement to resolve charges the bank defrauded customers by secretly overcharging them for back-office expenses, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Thursday.
According to settlement papers,  State Street  (NYSE:STT) admitted that from 1998 to 2015 its executives defrauded customers out of more than $290 million through hidden markups.
The Boston-based company also admitted that its executives tried to conceal the markups by leaving the details off invoices and ""actively"" misleading customers who questioned them.
State Street defrauded customers ""in a most pedestrian way: They tacked on hidden markups to routine charges for out-of-pocket expenses,"" Acting U.S. Attorney Nathaniel Mendell said in a statement.
The two-year deferred prosecution agreement resolves a wire fraud conspiracy charge, and requires State Street to retain an independent compliance monitor. It also took into account the company's cooperation and agreement to reimburse victims fully.
""We regret these overcharges,"" State Street said in a statement. ""We have also invested, and continue to invest, significant resources to improve and strengthen our invoicing processes, controls and governance.""
The bank said it previously set aside funds to cover the settlement.
State Street is one of the world's largest custodial banks, which provide services such as accounting, asset valuations, currency trading, portfolio servicing and stock lending.
It had $40.3 trillion of assets under custody and administration as of March 31, as well as $3.59 trillion of assets under management.
Thursday's accord followed $94.3 million of related civil settlements in June 2019 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey.

State Street agreed separately in January 2017 to enter a deferred prosecution agreement and pay $64.6 million to resolve criminal and civil charges it imposed secret commissions on securities trades.
And in July 2016 it agreed to pay $530 million to settle regulatory probes and private lawsuits concerning overcharges on foreign currency transactions.

(Reuters) - Airbnb Inc beat Wall Street expectations for first-quarter gross bookings and revenue on Thursday, as speedy COVID-19 vaccinations and easing restrictions encouraged more people to check into its vacation rentals.
Gross bookings jumped 52% to $10.29 billion in the quarter, easily beating analysts' estimates of $6.93 billion.
""For guests aged 60 and above in the U.S., who were amongst the first groups to benefit from vaccine rollouts, searches on our platform for summer travel increased by more than 60% between February and March 2021,"" Airbnb said.
The San Francisco-based company expects second-quarter revenue to be similar to 2019 levels, adding that the return of urban and cross-border travel is likely to underpin growth over the coming quarters.
Airbnb is also set to benefit from demand for longer stays and a shift to traveling in groups by business travelers, Chief Executive Officer Brian Chesky said on a post-earnings call.
The company has weathered the pandemic better than rivals as people turned to its offering of larger spaces and locations away from major cities in the era of social distancing.
It recorded a surge in bookings in Britain after the government laid down plans in February to exit lockdown, while the easing of travel restrictions in France earlier this month also lifted demand.
Airbnb, however, said it was too early to predict if the recovery momentum would continue at the same pace in the second half of 2021.

Its revenue rose 5.4% to $886.9 million in the first quarter ended March 31, exceeding estimates of $714.4 million, according to Refinitiv IBES data. 
Adjusted loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization narrowed to $59 million, from $334 million a year earlier, largely due to cost cuts.

The move is a blow to Canada's rural communities, which have relied on buses to connect them to larger towns. The company ended all services in western Canada in 2018 due to falling ridership in rural areas and increased competition.
""A full year without revenue has unfortunately made it impossible to continue operations,"" Stuart Kendrick, senior vice president of the firm, which is owned by British transport operator FirstGroup, said in a statement.
The move has no impact on Greyhound Lines Inc (USA), which is a separate entity from Greyhound Canada, and will continue to operate cross-border express services when the border reopens.
Greyhound, which started operations in Canada in 1929, said the federal and provincial governments had not extended needed investment in inter-city bus services. ""Operations are not feasible absent of financial support,"" the statement added.
The federal government has been under pressure in recent years to better link rural towns to larger urban hubs as Greyhound cut back routes and airlines such as Air Canada and Onex Corp-owned Westjet canceled or paused service to remote areas.

Omar Alghabra, the federal transport minister, said he was disappointed by Greyhound Canada's closure.
""We know that many Canadians depend on this service,"" Alghabra said in a statement on Twitter, adding that the government will work with the provinces to address the gap in transportation left by the bus company.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -General Motors Co workers in Mexico were on track to scrap the contract negotiated by one of the country's biggest unions, according to a Mexican government report on a vote last month that led to a U.S. complaint under a new North American free trade deal.
On Wednesday, the Biden administration called for a probe into allegations that worker rights were denied at GM's Silao pickup truck plant during the vote to ratify workers' collective contract with the Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM). 
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Thursday said he accepted the U.S. recommendation to make sure there would be no fraud in union votes, noting that many ""irregularities"" had been detected in the union-led vote at GM.
The CTM, which represents 4.5 million workers, is one of several traditional unions accused by workers and activists of putting business interests over workers' rights.
A ministry report into the vote, reviewed by Reuters, shows that 1,784 workers cast ballots against keeping the CTM contract, while 1,628 workers voted to maintain it.
Allegations of interference - including the ministry's findings that some blank ballots in union possession were cut in half - have raised suspicions among some activists and experts that the CTM may have been headed for a deeper defeat.
A follow-up vote, which the Labor Ministry ordered to take place within 30 days, could result in a wider margin against keeping the current contract, especially if more workers who were apathetic or scared of voting turned out the second time, said Alfonso Bouzas, a labor scholar at Mexico's National Autonomous University. 
""This whole new opportunity is going to awaken conscience and interest,"" Bouzas said.
CTM's national spokesman, Patricio Flores, said the union supported the regional trade deal and would comply with the law and whatever ""would not harm investment in Mexico."" 
He did not dispute the vote tally in the labor ministry report, but called for an investigation into the disputed proceeding before a second vote.
""We should listen to the voice of these workers and not let pressure from unions in the United States and Canada have influence right now,"" CTM said in a statement.
'DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT'
The ministry document showed that just over half of the 6,494 workers eligible to vote did so in the first of two days of voting, before labor inspectors halted the process. 
If GM workers scrap their contract, either the CTM or a new union could negotiate new collective terms. 
Many collective bargaining contracts in Mexico consist of deals between unions and companies without workers' approval, which has helped keep Mexican hourly wages at a fraction of those in the United States.
The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which took effect last year and replaced the 1994 NAFTA, sought to strengthen worker rights in Mexico and slow migration of U.S. auto production south of the border. 
GM has said it respects the rights of its employees to make decisions over collective bargaining, and that it was not involved in any alleged violations. It declined to comment on the Labor Ministry report.
GM has indicated that it is ready to shift away from the old system that had let companies in Mexico turn a blind eye to worker rights, said Jerry Dias, the head of Canada's largest private sector union, Unifor. 
""The rules are changing and a company like GM is not going to get caught,"" he said. 

Dias said he hoped to personally monitor the follow-up vote at the Silao plant. 
Contract ratification votes are required under Mexico's 2019 labor reform, which underpins the renegotiated free trade pact, to ensure workers are not bound to contracts that were signed behind their backs.

Let’s take a closer look.The U.S. automotive industry witnessed a 14.6% decline in new-vehicle sales in 2020 due to the worst recession the nation has suffered since the Great Depression in the 1930s. However, the rising demand for secondhand cars and electric vehicles (EVs) have driven the auto industry to outperform the broader market since the second half of last year. This is evident in First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto Index Fund’s (CARZ) 43.9% returns over the past nine months compared to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust’s (SPY) 20.1% gains.
The auto industry’s recovery is expected to accelerate in tandem with the global economic recovery. The global motor vehicle and parts dealers' market is expected to grow at a 7% CAGR over the next five years to reach $5.68 trillion by 2025.
Given this growth potential, we think it could be wise to invest in the stock of auto dealers Penske Automotive Group, Inc. (NYSE:PAG), Group 1 Automotive, Inc. (NYSE:GPI), and Sonic Automotive, Inc. (NYSE:SAH), which have immense upside potential but are trading at discounts to their peers.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Electric car maker Fisker Inc has finalized its vehicle-assembly deal with Foxconn Technology Co Ltd, including plans to open a U.S. plant in 2023, the companies said on Thursday.
The plant's location has not been identified, but Fisker Chief Executive Henrik Fisker said four states are under consideration, including Foxconn's plant site in Wisconsin. Foxconn Chairman Liu Young-way previously said electric vehicles (EVs) have a ""promising future"" in Wisconsin but did not elaborate. 
The annual capacity for the U.S. plant will be at least 150,000 vehicles to start, Fisker said.
""When you look back at recent history and new technology products, they have been launched in the U.S. first,"" Fisker said in an interview. ""That's why we want to launch here."" He expects the U.S. market initially to be the biggest for the vehicle.
Fisker also cited access to Foxconn's supply chain, including semiconductor chips, as an advantage of the partnership.
Fisker is one of a handful of EV startups that have gone public through a reverse merger with a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) at a time when U.S. President Joe Biden has called for $174 billion in new spending to boost EVs and charging. 
Under the Fisker deal, the companies will jointly invest in ""Project PEAR"" (Personal Electric Automotive Revolution) and share in any profit. The companies reaffirmed Foxconn will eventually build more than 250,000 vehicles a year for Fisker across multiple sites, with initial production beginning at its U.S. plant in late 2023 which it announced in February.
""We have world-class supply chains in place to support Project PEAR - in particular, securing the reliable delivery of chipsets and semiconductors,"" Liu said in a statement.
The vehicle type has not been identified by Fisker, but will be based on a new lightweight platform - FP28 - designed by both companies. The five-passenger vehicle, which will be sold globally and is the second model under development, will have a starting price below $30,000 before incentives. Fisker said the vehicle would be described by some as a crossover.
Terms of the deal, which runs seven years, were not disclosed.
Fisker said in December that Canadian auto supplier  Magna International  (NYSE:MGA) Inc would initially manufacture its first vehicle, the Ocean SUV, in Europe. Production is on track to start in the fourth quarter of next year, said Henrik Fisker, who added the Foxconn deal does not affect those plans. Fisker will show the final production version in November at the Los Angeles auto show.
Fisker declined to say who will supply batteries for both vehicles.
Foxconn has ramped up its interest in EVs over the past year or so, including the formation of a joint venture for contract manufacturing with Chinese automaker Zhejiang Geely Holding Group.

Foxconn aims to provide components or services to 10% of the world's EVs by 2025 to 2027, posing a threat to established automakers by allowing technology companies a shortcut to competing in the vehicle market.
Last month, Foxconn, known for making iPhones in China for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), drastically scaled back a plan for a $10 billion factory in Wisconsin that was originally announced in 2017 and was supposed to build cutting-edge flat-panel display screens.

However, DoorDash said those same government benefits were partly responsible for delivery drivers working fewer hours in the quarter, reducing the number of deliveries it was able to make. 
The company, along with rivals Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats and Grubhub Inc have benefited from a surge in demand for app-based delivery services in the last year as the COVID-19 situation kept people at home.
DoorDash, which has also branched out into delivery from grocery and convenience stores last year, reported a near three-fold jump in quarterly revenue to $1.08 billion, beating analysts' estimates of $993.3 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company shares, which have gained about 13% over their December initial public offering price, rose 8% in extended trading. 
""As markets continued reopening and in-store dining increased across the United States, the impact to our order volume was smaller than we expected, which contributed to strong performance in the quarter,"" the company said in a statement.
However, the company added that it expects demand to slow as the effects of stimulus wear off.

DoorDash said it expects full-year marketplace gross order value (GOV) of $35 billion to $38 billion, up from its previous forecast of $30 billion to $33 billion. Marketplace GOV is the total value of all orders placed on its app as well as fees for its DashPass subscription service. 
The company also raised the top end of its forecast for full-year adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to between break-even and $300 million, compared to a previous forecast of as much as $200 million.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. shares rebounded on Thursday after falling for three consecutive days and benchmark Treasury yields dipped, as investors snapped up stocks that would benefit from an economic recovery and shrugged off worries about rising prices, for now.
After posting their biggest slump in at least 11 weeks on Wednesday, U.S. shares bounced back as investors flush with cash looked past concerns that accelerating inflation may prompt interest rate hikes sooner, and deployed their funds once more.
So intent were investors on leaving inflation worries aside that financial markets barely responded to Thursday's data, which showed U.S. producer prices posting their biggest annual gain since 2010 in April.
""It's rebound Thursday,"" said John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington Private Bank, which manages $20 billion in assets. ""Given the money on the sidelines, investors are going to be coming back in.""
Still, Augustine said investors should redeploy their funds in a measured way as ""inflation concerns are not going away"".
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day up 1.3%, the S&P 500 rose 1.2% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.7%. 
Gains were led by shares in small-cap companies, chip makers and transportation providers - businesses that stand to gain as the United States emerges from the pandemic recession. (N)
The bounce in U.S. stocks lifted the MSCI world equity index, which tracks 50 countries, by 0.3%.
Wall Street had tumbled earlier this week after data showed U.S. consumer prices unexpectedly jumped by the most in almost 12 years in April.
Some investors now worry that quickening price pressures could lead the U.S. Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected, reducing its supply of cheap money that has propelled financial markets higher.
For now, however, inflation woes took a backseat.
Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields, which spiked 7 basis points overnight in the biggest daily rise in two months, fell by nearly 4 basis points to 1.6556% as investors took a breather.
Benchmark two-year Treasury yields also pulled back to 0.1569%. [US/]
Against a basket of major currencies, the dollar was steady at 90.718, largely holding on to gains eked out on Wednesday, when expectations of rate hikes burnished the currency's appeal.
A firm dollar capped gains in the euro, which edged up 0.1% to $1.20805. [USD/]
The pullback in Treasury yields helped gold to recoup some of its previous day's losses, when rising bond yields dampened the allure of non-yielding bullion. Spot gold climbed 0.6% from a one-week low to $1,826.71 per ounce. [GOL/]
A recent rally in oil prices also paused on Thursday as investors turned their attention to the coronavirus crisis in India, and as the top U.S. fuel pipeline network resumed operations. [O/R]
Brent crude slumped 3.4% to $66.98 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude lost 3.5% to $63.78 a barrel.

Among cryptocurrencies, bitcoin, which tumbled 13% overnight when Elon Musk said Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc would stop accepting it as payment because of its high energy use, skidded again on Thursday following reports that the U.S. Justice Department was investigating crypto exchange Binance.
By Thursday evening, bitcoin had dropped 0.7% to $48.965.

This, combined with a resurgence in outdoor recreational activities due to declining COVID-19 infections, could keep the demand for guns high in the coming months. So, we think leading players in this sector, Sturm Ruger and Company (RGR), Smith and Wesson Brands (SWBI), and Big 5 Sporting Goods (BGFV), are uniquely positioned to benefit. Let’s take a closer look at these names.Gun stocks have been soaring this year on rising gun sales. Many consumers have been hoarding ammunition in fear of stricter gun laws that might be implemented under the Biden administration. In fact, in April the FBI conducted 3.5 million background checks compared to 2.9 million in the same period last year.
Furthermore, as the COVID-19 mass vaccination drive takes effect, the resumption of outdoor activities, including hunting, have been driving heightened demand for guns.
Given this backdrop, we believe Sturm, Ruger & Company, Inc. (RGR), Smith & Wesson Brands, Inc. (SWBI), and Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (BGFV) should see substantial growth in the near term. The shares of these companies have been heading north lately and they may continue doing so in the coming months.

However, the relatively better capacity of STMicroelectronics (STM) and Renesas (RNECF) to supply semiconductors to EV manufacturers we think position them for enviable gains in the near term. Read on.The manufacturing of electrical vehicles (EVs) has slowed significantly due to a global shortage of semiconductor chips. However, many semiconductor companies are now ramping up their production to meet the rising demand. So, the supply challenge may not exist for the EV industry for much longer. According to Meticulous Analysis, the electric vehicle market is expected to grow at a 33.6% CAGR of between 2020 - 2027, to hit $2.5billion by 2027.
Given the growing demand and supply shortage, the prices of semiconductors are rising, benefiting the semiconductor industry significantly. And strong investor attention to the semiconductor space is evidenced by the SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF’s (XSD) 59.1% returns over the past year versus the SPDR S&P 500 ETF’s (SPY) 41.4% returns.
While the timing of the recovery of the EV industry depends in-part on how quickly semiconductor companies are able to meet the industry’s demand for chips, two prominent players in this space—STMicroelectronics N.V. (STM) and Renesas Electronics Corporation (RNECF)—are exhibiting their strength in support of the EV industry through their relatively better supply now.

Dogecoin was initially created in 2013 as a joke and has since exploded in popularity and price after influential billionaires such as Elon Musk and Mark Cuban have been supporting it. In addition, Dogecoin is rising due to excitement on Reddit and Twitter (TWTR). While many young cryptocurrency investors have made fortunes in Dogecoin, they are likely to get burnt at some point. That’s because not only is there hardly any real-world use of Dogecoin but there is an unlimited supply.

488,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 13, 2021 03:09PM ET</span>",Progressives Split on Powell’s Renomination to Fed Chair,"(Bloomberg) --Progressives are starting to divide on whether Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell should be renominated by President Joe Biden for a second term.
Seven different climate-activist groups, including the Sierra Club, on Thursday raised questions about Powell’s renomination, demanding a stronger climate leader at the head of the central bank.
“If Joe Biden’s executive branch is going to live up to its commendably bold climate commitments, they will need a climate hawk as chair of the Federal Reserve,” Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project, said in a press release. “Nothing about Powell’s record at the Fed or as a Republican private equity titan before then suggests he is such a leader.”
The Revolving Door Project is part of the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington and a day earlier its co-founder, Dean Baker, threw his support behind Powell for a second term as chair.
“It would be good for the economy if Powell were reappointed, and if Biden announced this decision as soon as possible,” Baker said. He highlighted how Powell has shifted the central bank’s focus to “running the labor market as hot as possible without triggering inflation.”
Open Seats
Biden has an opportunity to reshape the leadership of the Fed board with terms for Powell -- and vice chairs Richard Clarida and Randal Quarles -- expiring in coming months. There is also a vacancy on the seven-member board.
The decision is politically intricate because Powell has largely sided with vice chair of supervision Quarles’ efforts to smooth out rules for the financial system, while Fed Governor Lael Brainard, the only official on the board now appointed by a Democrat, has dissented against many of those changes.
Powell has also received a thumbs-up from William Spriggs, a Howard University professor and the chief economist at the AFL-CIO, the country’s largest federation of labor unions.
In their statement Thursday, the climate groups argued that the Fed has lagged behind other big central banks in its climate-risk policies and criticized the Fed for failing to use its powers to address the crisis.
Baker in his essay attempted to head off climate criticism of Powell.
“It would be great to have a central bank that actively promoted clean energy and sought to penalize fossil-fuel companies, but this is not a power that has been given to the Fed by Congress,” he wrote. “While it can arguably do this with the power it has, it would be virtually certain to lose this power very quickly if it went this route.”

489,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2021 02:52PM ET</span>",Biden says fuel shortages should ease by this weekend as pipeline restarts,"By Steve Holland and Nandita Bose
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden said on Thursday that Colonial Pipeline should be reaching full operational capacity right now and he expects to see fuel normalcy this weekend, after an attack on the company triggered fuel shortages and panic buying in the southeastern United States.
Colonial Pipeline began to slowly restart the nation's largest fuel pipeline network on Wednesday after a ransomware attack shut the line.
""This morning Colonial reported that fuel is beginning to flow to (a) majority of the markets that they service and they should be reaching full operational capacity as we speak,"" Biden said, adding the impact will not be felt immediately at fuel stations and that it will take time for normalcy to return.
The administration has taken steps such as sending fuel to gas stations that will help fill the tanks of 5 million vehicles, the president said. On Wednesday, Biden also waived the Jones Act to accelerate fuel deliveries and said the administration will grant additional waivers if necessary.
Biden also urged customers to not get more gas than they need, saying he expects the situation to improve by this weekend and warned gas stations against price gouging.
""Nobody should be using this situation for financial gain,"" he said.
Biden also said he does not believe the Russian government was behind the attack but that those who were involved in the attack were based in Russia.
The president said the United States has been in touch with Moscow about the ransomware networks and ""we are going to disrupt their ability to operate.""
Biden said the United States is working to set an international standard that alerts governments about criminal activity. Biden hopes to discuss this with Russia's President Vladimir Putin, he added.

On Wednesday, Biden ordered the creation of an air accident-style cyber review board and the imposition of new software standards for government agencies.
He also urged the Senate to confirm key appointments such as Chris Inglis as the national cyber director.

ATLANTA (Reuters) -Shortages of gasoline at retail stations in the U.S. Southeast became more widespread on Thursday after days of panic buying triggered by a major pipeline shutdown that is now in the early stages of an attempted restart.
Drivers from Virginia to Florida struggled to find service stations that still had fuel to sell, and those that succeeded waited in long lines to pay prices that had climbed to their highest in years.
Nicole Guy, a leasing agent in Atlanta, spent much of Thursday morning driving from one shuttered gas station to another in a desperate attempt to refill her tank, before pulling over to gather her thoughts.
""My sister paid $3.50 at the pump last night for her car,"" she said. ""I thought if I went looking today I'd find a better deal. I never paid that much at the pump.""
She said she was about to call friends for help finding fuel: ""Maybe one of them knows of a spot,"" Guy said. ""Otherwise I'll keep looking.""
Around 70% of gas stations in the state of North Carolina were without fuel, along with about half the stations in Virginia, South Carolina and Georgia, an increase from Wednesday, according to tracking firm GasBuddy.
The average national gasoline price rose above $3.00 a gallon, the highest since October 2014, the American Automobile Association said, and prices in some areas jumped as much as 11 cents in a day. 
The Colonial Pipeline, which shut Friday after a ransomware cyberattack, said it had begun the restart process but would take days to resume normal operations, something that experts said will keep fuel stations scrambling for supply.
The Colonial system carries 100 million gallons per day of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel to the East Coast, nearly half the region’s supply. Motorists' tempers have frayed in recent days as panic buying led stations to run out even where normal wholesale deliveries were still being made.
State and federal authorities pleaded with motorists not to hoard gasoline, saying stockpiling would only make matters worse, and even had to issue a warning against using plastic bags to store fuel.
Ken Crawford, 51, a self-employed landscaper resorted to using a friends membership card to buy fuel at the members-only Sam's Club Fuel Center in metro Atlanta, after failing to find other retail stations that were open.
""I know it's not exactly kosher to use someone else's (card) but I'm in a spot,"" Crawford said. ""I need gas and I don't see any places still open.""
Katlyn Norton, 29, a stay-at-home mother of two from Mobile, Alabama, was in Atlanta Thursday visiting relatives and to take her children to the Atlanta Aquarium. She was lucky enough to find a Texaco still selling gas in Midtown Atlanta, charging about $3.43 a gallon for regular unleaded.
But she worried it would be the last top up for a while.

""We were supposed to head home today, but I'm not sure we'd get enough gas to make it,"" Norton said of the roughly five-hour trip to head more than 300 miles southwest.
""We thought about trying our luck, but with the kids, I think we'd better stay put. Better to be safe.""

The relatively low investor interest in the tech industry amid the fast-paced economic recovery is evident in Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF’s (XLK) 2.5% decline over the past three months. Also, the benchmark Nasdaq Composite declined by 5% over this period.
In light of these developments, we believe investors should steer clear of Reddit forum wallstreetbets (WSB) favorite software companies Fastly, Inc. (FSLY) and Sphere 3D Corp. (ANY) until the broader tech industry stabilizes.

493,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 13, 2021 02:09PM ET</span>",Lumber Prices Hover Below Record in Wild Trading as Demand Roars,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. lumber futures hovered below a record high in wild trading, but nonstop demand from builders combined with tight supplies means the rally may be far from over.
July futures rose by the exchange’s maximum daily trade limit on Thursday but then dropped to limit-down levels, all within two hours. The most-active July contract traded 2.7% lower at $1,453 per 1,000 board feet at 11:50 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange after reaching an all-time high of $1,733.50 on Monday.
Lumber prices have soared in the past year amid an unexpected surge in house building and renovations that left sawmills scrambling to catch up to demand. Though lumber’s climb began last year, the frenzy comes amid a broader rally in everything from steel to corn as vaccination campaigns allow countries to reopen and fiscal stimulus pumps up the U.S. economy. Lumber’s gains threaten to price out home buyers, with data from the National Association of Home Builders showing that the cost of boards for the average U.S. house rose by near nearly $36,000 over the last year.
Many order books at mills are now extended until June, with deliveries to builders and retailers for new orders not expected to arrive until July. Exacerbating the situation for all producers is a trucking shortage, which limits the amount of lumber that can be transported even as mills ramp up production. Lumber prices will increase into the U.S. summer months before turning lower, according to Forest Economic Advisors LLC.
“We expect a peak will occur in July-August at which point more lumber will start flowing to market as supply chain disruptions, a lack of rail cars and trucks to transport lumber to market, ease,” said Paul Jannke, principal at Forest, a wood product analysis company near Boston.
Jannke expects the most-active futures contract could rise to $1,800 per 1,000 board feet, if there are not extensive wildfires this year. A bad fire season, however, could see prices top $2,000.
In April, Resolute Forest (NYSE:RFP) Products Inc. said its order book exceeds its inventories. Interfor Corp. has said North American lumber inventories are at “critical levels.” Canadian lumber producers plan to ramp up U.S. production by expanding existing mills, but this will take years.
Limited “on ground” lumber supplies, combined with the unusual circumstances created by the pandemic, make it difficult to forecast price movements, said Joy Robles, who trades lumber on the cash market for Sherwood Lumber on Long Island, New York.

494,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2021 02:01PM ET</span>",Analysis: Elon Musk wants a greener bitcoin. Has he got a plan or a pipedream?,"By Tom Wilson and Anna Irrera
LONDON (Reuters) - Elon Musk says Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) won't use or accept bitcoin until he can be sure it's produced sustainably. He may be waiting some time. 
Musk announced his new position in a major U-turn on Wednesday, prompting speculation among some experts about whether he had a plan to wean the crypto industry off the fossil fuels that power ""mining,"" the energy-intensive process that creates coins. 
Tesla could itself take an active role in helping make bitcoin greener by investing in new projects aimed at boosting the use of renewable energy in mining, according to more than a dozen cryptocurrency specialists interviewed by Reuters. 
""Musk and Tesla certainly have the resources to support existing efforts to fully move bitcoin to renewable energy,"" said Diana Biggs, CEO of crypto startup Valour. 
But such ventures could take years to get off the ground.
Another potential route is for Tesla to shift from bitcoin to more eco-friendly digital currencies that don't rely on mega-computers spawning new tokens, according to the experts.
Yet this too presents major headaches, they say, not least gaining broad crypto industry agreement for software changes and resolving regulatory concerns over smaller coins.
Musk tweeted that while Tesla would no longer accept payment in bitcoin - two months after announcing that it would - the company wouldn't sell its bitcoin holdings, instead intending to use them when mining became greener energy.
Tesla is also looking at other cryptocurrencies that use less than 1% of the energy burned by bitcoin, he added. 
The industry experts interviewed by Reuters said they thought it was unlikely that Musk had been blissfully unaware until now of the environmental concerns surrounding bitcoin production. 
The move may represent an attempt to bolster Tesla's environmental credentials amid growing competition in the electric vehicle sector, said Sasja Beslik, head of sustainable business development at Bank J. Safra Sarasin in Zurich.
""My indication of this is that it is a way to further strengthen the brand,"" he said. ""It's up to them to hold any currency they want. But given the fact that it has a heavy CO2 footprint ... it is a challenging thing.""
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
GREENER OPTIONS? 
After his original tweet, Musk followed the next day with a chart showing bitcoin's power consumption. ""Energy usage trend over past few months is insane,"" he wrote.
Yet environmentalists have criticised bitcoin's energy consumption and its reliance on fossil fuels for years, not months. 
""As it stands, the use of bitcoin doesn't align with Tesla's own mission statement,"" said Alex De Vries, founder of research platform Digiconomist. 
""That's not something that suddenly happened during the past two months in which Tesla first decided to accept bitcoin. The network was already running on fossil fuels like Chinese coal - nothing has really changed in such a short timeframe.""
Bitcoin mining uses about the same amount of energy annually as Egypt did in 2019, data from the University of Cambridge shows. 
Much of it is powered by coal, the dirtiest of all fossil fuels. Chinese miners accounted for about 70% of production, data from the university shows https://cbeci.org/mining_map. Many use fossil fuels, switching to renewables like hydropower during the rainy summer months. 
(Graphic - Bitcoin: Power hungry - https://graphics.reuters.com/CRYPTO-CURRENCY/qzjpqbakdvx/chart.png) 
WATERMARKED BITCOIN?
Tesla could invest in greener mining options, said Yves Bennaim, the founder of Swiss crypto think-tank 2B4CH. It could create by itself groups of bitcoin miners that use green energy, or connect customers to mining pools, he added.
Projects globally are looking for ways to shift bitcoin mining towards cleaner energy, or at least to reduce its carbon footprint, from repurposing heat generated by mining using flare gas - a by-product from oil extraction - for crypto mining.
Payments company  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ), run by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, last year said it would give $10 million https://squareup.com/us/en/press/carbon to support firms boosting the use and efficiency of renewables in the bitcoin sector.
In theory, blockchain experts have said, it would be possible to track which bitcoins have been produced sustainably, also giving Tesla an option to only accept greener bitcoins.
""He can probably invest in some green energy miners and mandate that Tesla will only get paid by greenly mined bitcoin,"" said Maya Zehavi, a cryptocurrency and blockchain consultant.
""There's also been a lot of talk of watermarked bitcoin, splitting bitcoin mined by Western countries and those mined in China and North Korea.""
BITCOIN ALTERNATIVES
Tesla could also switch its focus on cryptocurrencies towards tokens that run on a less power-hungry system for producing new digital coins are created. 
Through bitcoin's protocol, or underlying code, computers hooked up to its network competed against each other to solve complex maths puzzle. The system, known in crypto lingo as ""proof of work"", is highly energy intensive.
An alternative protocol lets users create new tokens by committing existing cryptocurrencies to digital contracts - potentially lessening reliance on energy-guzzling computers. 
Ether, the second-biggest cryptocurrency, is moving to this system, known as ""proof of stake"". Still, many existing coins that use this system are still relatively hard to use at scale, and are less widely known than bitcoin.
""The only real answer is 1. actively investing in renewable mining farms and making mining ""greener"" or 2. switching to a protocol that is based on proof of stake,"" said Larry Cermak, director of research at crypto site The Block. 
Cryptocurrencies that consume less energy, such as seventh-largest coin XRP, may present other concerns, experts said.
Investors have worried about XRP since U.S. regulators charged blockchain firm Ripple, a major backer of the cryptocurrency, with an $1.3 billion unregistered securities offering last year. Ripple has denied the charges.

Some have also suggested changing bitcoin's protocol itself, to lower its power consumption. Yet getting all users in bitcoin's decentralised network of miners, run by no oversight body, to agree would be challenging, experts warned. 
""The whole bitcoin mining ecosystem has invested billions of dollars in hardware,"" said Jack Liao, CEO of Chinese mining firm LightningAsic. ""How can they change the protocol? Change means a loss of billions.""

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The Indian government has told doctors to look out for signs of mucormycosis or ""black fungus"" in COVID-19 patients as hospitals report a rise in cases of the rare but potentially fatal infection. 
The state-run Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said at the weekend that doctors treating COVID-19 patients, diabetics and those with compromised immune systems should watch for early symptoms including sinus pain or nasal blockage on one side of the face, one-sided headache, swelling or numbness, toothache and loosening of teeth. 
The disease, which can lead to blackening or discolouration over the nose, blurred or double vision, chest pain, breathing difficulties and coughing blood, is strongly linked to diabetes. And diabetes can in turn be exacerbated by steroids such as dexamethasone, used to treat severe COVID-19.
""There have been cases reported in several other countries - including the UK, U.S., France, Austria, Brazil and Mexico, but the volume is much bigger in India,"" said David Denning, a professor at Britain's Manchester University and an expert at the Global Action Fund for Fungal Infections (GAFFI) charity.
""And one of the reasons is lots and lots of diabetes, and lots of poorly controlled diabetes.""
India has not published national data on mucormycosis but has said there is no major outbreak. Media reports have pointed to cases in Maharashtra and its capital Mumbai, and Gujarat.
Aparna Mukherjee, a scientist at ICMR, said: ""It's not something to panic about, but you have to be aware of when to seek consultation."" 
But it is a complication that India's overwhelmed hospitals, desperately short of beds as well as the oxygen needed for severely ill COVID-19 patients, could do without.
Arunaloke Chakrabarti, head of the Center of Advanced Research in Medical Mycology in the Indian city of Chandigarh and an adviser to GAFFI, said that even before COVID-19, mucormycosis was more common in India than in most countries, ""partly because of the millions who have diabetes"".
He said serious cases might require specific antifungal therapy and several operations.
P Suresh, head of opthalmology at  Fortis  (NYSE:FTS) Hospital in Mulund, Mumbai, said his hospital had treated at least 10 such patients in the past two weeks, roughly twice as many as in the entire year before the pandemic. 
All had been infected with COVID-19 and most were diabetic or had received immunosuppressant drugs. Some had died, and some had lost their eyesight, he said. Other doctors spoke of a similar surge in cases.

""Previously if I saw one patient a year, I now see about one a week,"" said Nishant Kumar, a consultant ophthalmologist at Hinduja hospital in Mumbai, noting the potential for contamination of oxygen pipes and humidifiers in hospitals.
Denning called it a ""triple whammy"". ""You've got a high rate of mucormycosis, you've got a lot of steroids - maybe too much - being used, and then you've got diabetes which is not being well controlled or managed.""

496,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2021 01:57PM ET</span>",CDC panel clears way to COVID-19 vaccines for U.S. adolescents,"By Michael Erman and Manojna Maddipatla
(Reuters) -U.S. states are set to begin using the vaccine from  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) to inoculate young adolescents against COVID-19 after advisers to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) backed the plan in a unanimous vote on Wednesday.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Monday authorized the vaccine for children aged 12 to 15, offering relief to parents eager to get their children back to schools and summer camps. The action by the CDC group is an important, but not required, final seal of federal regulatory approval.
The youngest age previously approved for the Pfizer vaccine was 16 years old. 
Some states, including Georgia, Delaware and Arkansas, began offering the vaccine to young teens on Tuesday. California's main COVID-19 website said families could start making appointments for the younger group on Thursday.
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which provides recommendations to the CDC, voted 14-0 to back the vaccine after reviewing trial evidence. That showed no one in the 12-to-15 age group who received the vaccine got COVID-19. There were no severe allergic reactions.
Moreover, the vaccine produced robust antibody responses in the age group and showed 100% efficacy in the trial, with no cases of symptomatic COVID-19 among the fully vaccinated adolescents.
The move will open vaccination to about 17 million adolescents, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said in a statement, saying the agency officially recommends the vaccine.
The vaccination ""will decrease transmission within their family,"" said Dr. Henry Bernstein, a member of the advisory committee and professor of pediatrics at Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell. ""It will contribute to community immunity, and it allows the kids to more safely go back to camps this summer, and back for in-person school."" 
About a third of all Americans have been fully vaccinated, according to the CDC data. But the pace of vaccination has slowed in the recent weeks.
The rollout of a vaccine for adolescents should help limit the spread of the virus at a time when more contagious variants are circulating, and could shorten the road to normalcy for Americans.
Children have been considered by health officials as being at a lower risk for severe COVID-19, but they can still spread the virus. More than 1.5 million cases have been reported among 12 to 17 year olds, and as more adults become vaccinated, adolescents are accounting for a higher proportion of total cases.

Adjusted for underreporting, the working group estimated 22.2 million U.S. COVID-19 infections in those aged 5 to 17.
Pfizer is running a separate vaccine trial in children as young as 6 months old, and has said it expects data on 2 to 11 year olds in September. The 2,260 participants in the 12-to-15 age group - half of whom were given placebo - were tested as an expansion of Pfizer's more than 46,000-person trial.

So, we think it could be wise to now scoop up the shares of STMicroelectronics (STM), Vishay (VSH), and O2Micro (OIIM). They appear undervalued currently given their immense growth potential. Let’s pore over these names.As the demand for consumer electronics has increased worldwide as individuals and organizations seek to stay connected remotely amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for semiconductor chips that are needed to run these gadgets is on the rise. This, along with rising demand for semiconductors from the booming electric vehicle (EV) industry, has created a huge supply shortage. However, the resultant increase in chip prices has been working to the benefit of the chip manufacturers. This has attracted significant investor attention to the semiconductor space, as is evidenced by the SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF’s (XSD) 59.1% returns over the past year versus the SPDR S&P 500 ETF’s (SPY) 41.4% returns.
With the growing applicability of chips in the tech era, which includes Internet of things (IoT), Artificial intelligence (AI), EV, 5G network, data centers and cloud computing, the demand for chips should keep rising. According to Research and Markets, the global semiconductor market is expected to grow at a 6%-plus CAGR between 2021- 2026. Furthermore, President Biden announced last month that he has bipartisan support for his proposed $50 billion in spending to address the semiconductor shortage, which is a testament to the industry’s importance and immense potential.
Given this favorable backdrop, we think it is wise to bet on STMicroelectronics N.V. (STM), Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. (NYSE:VSH), and O2Micro International Limited (OIIM). They are still trading at reasonable valuations and have immense growth potential.

While the industry’s growth prospects have attracted several new entrants, many of them may not be able to capitalize on the industry’s growth potential in the near term. Hence, we think it is wise to invest in traditional car makers, such as Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) (VWAGY), Honda (HMC), and Volvo (VLVLY (OTC:VLVLY)), that are expanding into the EV space. Given their experience in the auto industry, we think they have the capacity to ride the wave better than many pure-play EV companies in the near term. Let’s discuss.Governments worldwide are pursuing policy measures and investing billions of dollars for the electrification of vehicles to reduce carbon emissions. While the electric vehicles (EVs) industry is currently struggling to meet rising demand due in-part to an ongoing semiconductor shortage, it looks well positioned for a solid growth in the long run with continued government and private initiatives to address climate change concerns. Indeed, the global EV market is expected to grow at a 41.5% CAGR over the next six years, according to a report by Million Insights.
Investors’ interest in the autonomous driving and EV space is evidenced by Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF’s (DRIV) 29.2% gains over the past six months versus SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust’s (SPY) 14.8% returns.

(Reuters) -China's top e-commerce platform  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd on Thursday posted its first quarterly operating loss since going public in 2014 due to a record anti-monopoly fine by the country's market regulator.
Its U.S.-listed shares fell nearly 3% in choppy trading, even as the company forecast strong 2022 revenue, betting that the pandemic-driven shift to online shopping will remain resilient.
The outlook, however, was overshadowed by a regulatory crackdown in China that led to the suspension of a $37 billion IPO of its affiliate Ant Group and a $2.8 billion fine in April for anti-competitive business practices.
The fine led to a 7.66 billion yuan ($1.19 billion)operating loss in the fourth quarter ended March 31.
""The Penalty Decision motivated us to reflect on the relationship between a platform economy and society, as well as our social responsibilities and commitments,"" Chief Executive Daniel Zhang said in an earnings call.
Alibaba forecast annual revenue of 930 billion yuan ($144.12 billion) for the year ending March 2022, above expectation of 928.25 billion yuan.
Core commerce revenue rose 72% to 161.37 billion yuan in the fourth quarter. But growth at its cloud computing unit slowed to 37% to 16.8 billion yuan from 58% a year earlier, its weakest since at least 2016. 
Alibaba said it was due to a top customer with a ""sizeable presence outside of China"" ending its business for ""non-product related reasons.""
Overall revenue rose to 187.4 billion yuan in the fourth quarter, topping a Refinitiv forecast of 180.41 billion yuan.
Alibaba's U.S. listed shares have fallen more than 30% since hitting a record high in late October when its founder Jack Ma delivered a speech in Shanghai criticizing China's financial regulators.
The sinking share price reflects investor anxiety over regulation, said Brock Silvers, chief investment officer at Hong Kong-based Adamas Asset Management.

SEOUL (Reuters) -Samsung Electronics on Thursday raised its planned investment in non-memory chips to 171 trillion won ($151 billion) through 2030, joining a rush of firms ramping up investments amid a global semiconductor shortage. 
Countries have also been working to bolster chip supply chains as the chip shortage affects production in industries such as autos. South Korea on Thursday said it would offer bigger tax breaks plus 1 trillion won ($883 million) in loans for its local chip industry. 
Some 153 chip companies including global No.1 and 2 memory chip makers Samsung (KS:005930) and SK Hynix already have plans to invest a combined 510 trillion won or more between this year and 2030, according to the Korea Semiconductor Industry Association. 
Samsung's increased investment target, up from 133 trillion won announced in 2019, is expected to be used for its goal to become the world's No. 1 logic chipmaker by 2030. It wants to challenge bigger rivals TSMC in contract chip manufacturing and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) in mobile processing chips. 
Samsung also said in a statement that its third chip production line at Pyeongtaek, south of Seoul - the size of 25 football fields - will be completed in the second half of 2022. 
""Countries around the world have entered fierce competition by reorganising supply chains around their own country,"" South Korean President Moon Jae-in said Thursday at Samsung's chip site at Pyeongtaek. 
""We need pre-emptive investments... to strengthen the domestic industrial ecosystem and lead the global supply chain to make this opportunity ours."" 
South Korea will increase tax breaks to 6% from the current 3% or lower for capital expenditures between second half of 2021 to 2024 for large corporations conducting ""key strategic technology"" including semiconductors, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said in a statement. 
The government will offer about 1 trillion won in long-term loans for increasing 8-inch wafer chip contract manufacturing capacity and investment for materials and packaging. It also raised number of chip industry workers to be educated to 36,000 by 2030, more than double its previous target in 2019. 
""Setting up an environment where smaller fabless firms can thrive, with plenty of workforce and foundries, would naturally bolster system chip industry,"" said Jinwook Burm, head of the Institute of Semiconductor Engineers. 
In March, U.S. President Joe Biden flagged plans to invest $50 billion in semiconductor manufacturing and research. 
Chips are the No. 1 export item for South Korea, accounting for about 20% of exports.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Boeing Co on Wednesday won approval from U.S. regulators for a fix of an electrical grounding issue that had affected about 100 737 MAX airplanes, clearing the way for their quick return to service after flights were halted in early April, the planemaker said.
An FAA official confirmed that the agency had approved the service bulletins and associated instructions. Boeing (NYSE:BA) sent two bulletins to air carriers on Wednesday on the fixes. 
""After gaining final approvals from the FAA, we have issued service bulletins for the affected fleet,"" Boeing told Reuters. ""We are also completing the work as we prepare to resume deliveries."" 
The announcement is a relief for U.S. air carriers that have been anxiously waiting to get the planes back into service before the traditional late May start to the summer travel season as air travel demand increases. 
The top three U.S. 737 MAX operators - Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Airlines - removed more than 60 jets from service after the notice from Boeing. The carriers did not immediately comment.
Earlier on Wednesday, FAA Administrator Steve Dickson told U.S. lawmakers that the electrical issue, which had grounded about a quarter of the MAX fleet, would need a ""pretty straightforward fix.""
Dickson also said he was fully confident in the safety of the MAX, which was approved to returned to service in November 2020 after being grounded for 20 months following two fatal crashes in five months that killed 346 people.
Reuters reported on May 4 that the FAA asked Boeing to supply fresh analysis showing numerous 737 MAX subsystems would not be affected by electrical grounding issues first flagged in three areas of the jet in April.
The electrical issue emerged after Boeing changed a manufacturing method as it worked to speed up production of the jetliner, a third person said. A fourth person said the change improved a hole-drilling process.
Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun in April told CNBC it was a ""three- to four-day fix recovery time frame"" after the bulletins were issued. 
Airlines pulled dozens of 737 MAX jets from service in early April after Boeing warned of the electrical problem, linked to a backup power control unit in the cockpit on some recently built airplanes.
The problem, which also halted delivery of new planes, was then found in two other places on the flight deck, including the storage rack where the control unit is kept and the instrument panel facing the pilots.

The FAA said other carriers affected include Cayman Airways, Copa Airlines, GOL Linhas Aereas, Iceland Air, Minsheng Leasing, Neos Air, Shanding Airlines, SilkAir, Spice Jet, Sunwing Airlines, TUI, Turkish Airlines, Valla Jets Limited, WestJet Airlines and Xiamen Airlines.
The regulator has daily meetings with Boeing to discuss the MAX's performance, Dickson said. In February, the FAA said it was tracking all Boeing 737 MAX airplanes using satellite data under an agreement with air traffic surveillance firm Aireon LLC.

""For the time being, we love them all and you cannot kill what you love,"" Tavares said at an Automotive News conference in answer to a question whether the automaker needs so many brands.
""When you love them, you give them a chance,"" he added. ""We are giving a 10-year visibility for each brand CEO in terms of product planning and funding.""
Stellantis was created from the merger of France's PSA and Italian-American automaker Fiat Chrysler. Its brands include Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY), Citroen, Fiat, Chrysler, Jeep, Ram, Maserati, Alfa Romeo and others.

Tavares added that the company is re-engineering its strategy in China. ""We are now negotiating and changing very many things at core,"" he said. ""That is also something that needs time.""
He said before Stellantis presents its overall strategic plan at the end of the year, there will be announcements around ""significant bricks of the things that we are right now negotiating and building with some partners."" He did not elaborate.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House Oversight and Reform Committee on Thursday voted to authorize $8 billion to quickly shift the U.S Postal Service (USPS) to an electric vehicle delivery fleet.
USPS in February awarded a contract to Oshkosh (NYSE:OSK) Corp that could be worth $6 billion to build a mix of up to 165,000 gas- and EV-powered delivery vehicles instead of choosing Workhorse Group Inc to build an all-electric fleet.

MILAN (Reuters) - Prysmian is close to a ""very interesting"" contract to develop a high-voltage underground network in the U.S., the Italian company's chief executive said on Thursday.
Valerio Battista said Prysmian, the world's largest cable maker, was ""not far"" from striking a deal on the U.S. project, which would be similar to one it has already signed in Germany.
""It's similar to the German Corridor, smaller in size, but very interesting,"" Battista told analysts after presenting estimate-beating first-quarter results which were supported by an ""excellent"" energy business performance.
""I am confident we can close the deal by the end of this year,"" Battista added.
Prysmian last year signed three contracts, worth a total of more than 1.8 billion euros ($2.2 billion), to develop the ""German Corridor"", a 2,300 kilometre high voltage underground cable interconnector in Europe's economic powerhouse.
Battista also said the company was considering building a plant in the U.S., which would be a first there, to produce submarine cables to support President Joe Biden's push towards offshore interconnection.
The U.S. said this week it had approved the Vineyard Wind project, its first major offshore wind farm, billing it as the launch of a new domestic energy industry that will help eliminate emissions from the power sector.
Prysmian said its adjusted core earnings (EBITDA) rose 8.1% to 213 million euros in the first quarter, slightly above a company-provided analyst consensus of 202 million euros.
The margin was broadly stable at 7.6%, as efficiency measures offset raw material price increases, it said.
Battista said Prysmian was increasingly confident it would achieve full-year targets, although it was too soon to raise forecasts.
Prysmian shares rose as much as 4.3% and closed up 2.76%, versus a 0.14% rise in Milan's blue chip index.
The company had forecast an adjusted EBITDA of between 870-940 million euros this year and free cash flow generation of 300 million euros, plus or minus 20%.
Chief Financial Officer Francesco Facchini told analysts he was confident Prysmian could deliver free cash flow at the very high end of guidance.

The bill - co-sponsored by Amy Klobuchar, the top antitrust senator, and Chuck Grassley, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee - would lower the fee for smaller mergers under $161.5 million from $45,000 to $30,000. But for deals worth $5 billion or more, the fee would rise from $280,000 to $2.25 million.
Under the bill, those costs would increase with inflation.
The Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department's Antitrust Division assess mergers to ensure that they comply with antitrust law.
The bill would increase authorizations to each, giving the FTC a budget of $418 million while the Justice Department's Antitrust Division would receive $252 million.
In brief remarks before the vote, Klobuchar said the fees had not changed since 2001, and that the Justice Department sued Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google last year while the FTC filed a major antitrust lawsuit against Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 
""You just cannot take on the biggest companies in the world with duct tape and Band-Aids,"" she said.

Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican, said in comments during a discussion of the bill that he was ""quite disappointed by the lax antitrust enforcement we saw in the previous administration.""
He said that he hoped that the FTC and Justice Department would be tougher. ""Democrats have historically been more vigorous on antitrust than Republicans, and so perhaps that instinct, which at times can be harmful, will be positively directed towards the monopolists we have in Silicon Valley.""

As many investors prefer to stay invested during times like these, they still need to hold solid stocks. That's why David Cohne suggests Gaming (BYD),  Owens Corning  (NYSE:OC), and O'Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY), three stocks exhibiting both fundamental and technical strength.Fears of inflation have rocked the market over the past three days, with the S&P 500 dropping 4% and the Nasdaq Composite losing 5.2%. Today the market was reacting to news that the Consumer Price Index posted its largest month over month increase since 2009 and its largest year over year rise since 2008. I've got three stocks I like right now even amidst the market turmoil, but first I'll explain why stocks are down.
Core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 0.9% last month, which was the most since 1982. A rise in inflation has both growth and value investors concerned, as higher inflation discounts a growth stock's present value and raises the likelihood that the Fed will raise rates, harming cyclical stocks. These factors have raised market volatility and drove stocks down. Whether the current market environment is temporary or could go on for a while, it's best to be more selective when picking stocks.
One strategy I like to focus on is picking stocks that have both fundamental and technical strength. So, I ran a screen for stocks rated a Buy in our POWR Ratings system that exhibits strong fundamental and technical indicators. Three top stocks that made the list were Boyd Gaming Corporation (NYSE:BYD), Owens Corning (NYSE:GLW) Inc (OC), and O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (ORLY), which I'm highlighting below.

The move comes after Citigroup said in March it would consolidate three of its investment banking units - energy, power, and chemicals - into a single entity that would be more responsive to clients' focus on sustainability.

The Clean Energy Transition sector will sit within that group and cover both public and private entities, as well as private equity and venture capital firms and their respective portfolio companies focused on green energy. Firms involved in renewable power generation will remain with bankers in the broader group.
""Clean energy transition is a global super trend that is accelerating rapidly and will last decades,"" said the memo, adding that to appropriately meet the challenges of the shift, the bank needed ""a clearly defined identity, dedicated resources, intense focus and direct accountability"".

Investing.com -- Canada Goose slid 8% despite a record fourth quarter after company executives said they don't expect tourism to return to normal this year. 
Sales of $172 million compared to the expected $129 million as the downy jacket maker pulled out a profit of 1 cent per share versus an expected loss of 10 cents, according to data compiled by Investing.com.
Meanwhile, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Sinclair told analysts that the company's forecast assumes tourism won't return to normal this year as Canada Goose boosts investments that are not expected to be profitable in the short-term, Bloomberg reported.   
The company expects revenue to exceed $1 billion in fiscal 2022 with direct-to-consumer sales approaching 70%, but fiscal first quarter sales are assumed to be less than double those from a year earlier.

Luxury goods makers including  Estee Lauder  (NYSE:EL) Cos Inc and  Coach  handbag maker Tapestry (NYSE:TPR) Inc have also seen store sales at major shopping destinations take a beating as the pandemic keeps their wealthy overseas customers at home. 
Tourism, which makes up a ""lush percentage"" of sales for Canada Goose, is not likely to reach pre-pandemic levels in fiscal 2022, Chief Executive Officer Dani Reiss said on an earnings call.
U.S.-listed shares of Canada Goose reversed earlier gains to decline about 6% in morning trade.
The company has opened new stores and doubled down on its online business in the world's second-largest economy to cushion the hit from lower spending by wealthy Chinese travelers at its stores.
Still, a full margin recovery is dependent on the return of international traffic, Finance Chief Jonathan Sinclair said. 
He noted that Canada Goose's adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin would likely be in the mid- to high-teens range.
Adjusted EBIT margin for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 had come in at 21.6% and 24.9%, respectively. In the pandemic-hit fiscal 2021, it was 14.7%
However, Canada Goose forecast annual revenue above C$1 billion for the first time in fiscal 2022, as it shifts to a largely direct-to-consumer model to tap the pandemic-accelerated shift to online shopping. 
In the fourth quarter ended March 28, revenue rose about 48% to C$208.8 million ($172.16 million), beating estimates, as sales more than doubled on its online channel.

Excluding items, Canada Goose earned 1 Canadian cent per share, versus estimates for a loss of 11 Canadian cents.

As vaccines become crucial to reopening of the economy, several U.S. retailers, including Dollar General (NYSE:DG), Kroger (NYSE:KR) and  Target  (NYSE:TGT), are offering bonuses or other perks to staff getting their shots.
Demand for hourly staff at restaurants, factories, retail stores and fulfillment centers is rising as e-commerce demand remains robust, while more consumers are expected to step out of their homes after a year of lockdown living.
The vaccine-related incentives are also aimed at attracting workers flush with relief checks and wary of the pandemic as well as the lack of childcare facilities back to work.
Amazon will pay the new hires an average starting pay of more than $17 per hour, reflecting recent hikes of between 50 cents and $3 an hour for about half a million fulfillment-center workers in the United States.

Client inquiries for what the industry calls active shooter policies have risen 50% year on year in the past six weeks, said Tarique Nageer, Terrorism Placement Advisory Leader at Marsh, the world's biggest insurance broker.
Such policies gained popularity in recent years following a spate of school shootings. They typically cover victim lawsuits, building repairs, legal fees, medical expenses and trauma counseling.
This year, however, even though fatal shootings in U.S. hospitals are comparatively rare and mass ones one-in-a-decade events, Nageer says demand has been particularly strong from the healthcare sector.
That finding is supported by Tim Davies, head of crisis management at Canopius, a Lloyd's of London global specialty insurer.
Most hospitals are open to the public and their emergency wards, where patients with COVID-19 and other severe illness and injuries get treatment, can become triggers for potentially volatile behavior. 
""Those are places where you could see people who are disgruntled that members of their family might have died and didn't get a vaccine or weren't treated properly,"" Davies said.
Such concerns have led to an about 25% to 50% hike in active shooter insurance prices compared to last year for healthcare firms, while overall rates have remained steady, he said. 
Chris Kirby (NYSE:KEX), head of political violence cover at insurer Optio, said active shooter policy rates had risen by as much as 50% for some clients, without specifying any industry sector.
SCHOOLS AND CHURCHES TOO
Brokers say that, besides hospitals, retail establishments, schools, universities, restaurants and places of worship are other prominent clients, buying cover ranging from $1 million to as high as $75 million.
The United States witnessed 200 mass shootings in the first 132 days of this year, according to a report by the Gun Violence Archive, a non-profit research group that defines them as any event involving the shooting of four or more people other than the assailant.
Hart Brown, senior vice president of R3 Continuum, a crisis management consultancy that helps clients deal with the aftermaths of about 800 shootings a year, said violence had migrated from public spaces into homes in 2020.
But this year, demand for R3 Continuum's services is up 15% to 20%, he says, with the gradual reopening of offices having brought violence back to the workplace - compounded by pandemic-induced stresses and economic insecurities often endured in isolation.

""The environment that was created by the pandemic, with the social distancing, the lockdown, and so forth and the compounding stressors is really what's driving much of the violence that we're seeing right now,"" he said.
A survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation backs up that assessment, showing 41% of U.S. adults reporting symptoms of anxiety or depressive disorders in January, compared with 11% in the first half of 2019.

524,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2021 11:37AM ET</span>","U.S. carriers begin repairs on Boeing 737 MAX planes, expect quick return","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - United Airlines and two other major U.S. carriers said on Thursday they will quickly repair more than 60 Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX planes grounded early last month over an electrical problem that could have interfered with some critical systems.
 Boeing Co  sent all affected carriers service bulletins late on Wednesday on how to address the production issue, which had affected 109 planes worldwide. The Federal Aviation Administration had signed off on the service bulletins, Reuters first reported late on Wednesday. 
The action was a relief for American carriers, which had anxiously awaited the green light to get the planes back into the air before the traditional late May start to the summer travel season. U.S. demand for air travel has risen as the COVID-19 pandemic has waned in the United States.
The halting of flights by about a fourth of the MAX fleet came after the plane was grounded for 20 months following two fatal crashes. The FAA lifted that grounding order in November after Boeing made a number of software and training upgrades.
The electrical problem being repaired did not cause any in-service failures, the FAA noted.
United spokeswoman Leslie Scott said on Thursday the airline expects its ""Boeing 737 MAX aircraft to return to service in the coming days as we complete our inspection process and ensure those aircraft meet our rigorous safety standards.""
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) said it would begin making required changes and anticipates ""all affected aircraft will begin safely returning to service in the upcoming days.”
Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), which has 32 affected planes, said it estimates the work will take two to three days per aircraft. The airline said it hoped to begin work within the next several days, and estimates it will take about three weeks to complete the work.
Shares in the airlines and Boeing were up 1.8% to 2.9% in late morning trading.
FAA Administrator Steve Dickson told U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday the electrical issue, which had grounded about a quarter of the MAX fleet, would need a ""pretty straightforward fix.""
Airlines removed dozens of 737 MAX jets from service in early April after Boeing warned of the electrical problem, linked to a backup power control unit in the cockpit on planes built since early 2019.

The problem was then found in two other places on the flight deck: the storage rack where the control unit is kept and the instrument panel facing the pilots.
The FAA said in statement last month that other carriers affected by the electrical issue were Cayman Airways, Copa Airlines, GOL Linhas Aereas, Iceland Air, Minsheng Leasing, Neos Air, Shanding Airlines, SilkAir, Spice Jet, Sunwing Airlines, TUI, Turkish Airlines, Valla Jets Limited, WestJet Airlines and Xiamen Airlines.

Is its stock a risky bet? Read on.Biotechnology company Vaxart, Inc. (VXRT) develops oral recombinant protein vaccines based on its proprietary oral vaccine platform. The price of its shares has risen 129.5% over the past year on investors’ optimism over the prospects of the company’s COVID-19 vaccine, VXA-CoV2-1.

Although the company’s room-temperature stable, tablet-based COVID-19 vaccine development has helped its shares soar to a $24.90 high in February, the vaccine candidate is still in its clinical trial phase. Also, VXRT’s norovirus vaccine has yet to advance to a Phase 2 challenge study and it could be some time before there are definitive results on its efficacy. Against this backdrop, VXRT’s high valuation doesn’t look reasonable. So, we think the stock could witness a retreat in the near term.

And, it's no coincidence that inflation worries have also perked up. Taylor Dart identifies more positive developments under the surface.We’ve seen a minor changing of the guard over the past month, with the previously hated precious metals complex coming back into favor, while the Nasdaq Composite (QQQ) has corrected sharply. The leader in the precious metals space has continued to be silver (SLV), which is up 11% thus far in Q1, clawing back all of its year-to-date losses. This relative strength amid weakness in the major market averages is a good sign, as is the metal’s outperformance vs. gold (GLD (NYSE:GLD)), which denotes a healthy precious metals market. Even better, despite the strength, we haven’t seen any signs of exuberance yet in silver, and bullish sentiment is resetting. Let’s take a closer look below:

As shown in the chart below, sentiment has improved considerably over the past few months, with bullish sentiment for silver sitting near 50% bulls and the long-term moving average plummeting from a reading near 80% to closer to 40%. This 4000 basis point improvement in bullish sentiment has helped to reset the silver market from an unhealthy amount of optimism in early February, which impeded the market’s parabolic rally. While this current reading of 40% bulls for the long-term moving average is nowhere near a buy signal, which we last got in 2018, it is a massive improvement and nearing a level where we’ve seen cycle lows in the past.

“And so, we're working through what some changes in our company-owned restaurants might look like from a wages and compensation perspective. We think the external environment is right to do this. We think the internal environment is also right to do this. And we think it's actually a great business decision for us,” Joseph M. Erlinger, President, McDonald's USA, said in the call.
Erlinger was responding to a question on what the company was doing to overcome staffing issues.

SpaceX will set up ground stations within Google's data centers that connect to the Starlink satellites, enabling fast and secure internet services via Google Cloud, the search giant said.
This service is expected to be available in the second half of 2021 for enterprise customers, the company said.
The deal comes at a time when demand for cloud-computing services has soared, with players like  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) dominating the market. Cloud companies have also tapped into the telecoms sector, thanks to a jump in demand for 5G connectivity.

Investing.com – Boeing (NYSE:BA) shares rose nearly 4% Thursday after the company secured the much-awaited regulatory nod for an electrical fix that had kept some 100 planes of its 737 MAX series grounded.
The plane-maker has informed the carriers that its electrical fix received Federal Aviation Administration approval.
The electrical problem has kept Boeing’s popular 737 MAX planes suspended for an extended period.
Two accidents in 2018 and 2019 forced authorities to ground the narrow body 737 MAX, which was at the time Boeing's biggest money maker in a booming market for narrow body planes. The 20-month safety ban was lifted in November after the company made the fixes.
But the flights were halted in April after a separate electrical issue led the manufacturer to stop deliveries of the planes with an advisory to its clients not to fly those in their fleet.
The FAA nod comes just in time for Boeing as its rival, Airbus (PA:AIR), was getting ready to produce more A320-family planes that compete with 737 MAX.
A Reuters report Tuesday said Airbus had asked key suppliers to get ready for a further 18% increase in A320-family jet output by the end of 2022, on top of existing targets for this year.

DETROIT (Reuters) -Ford Motor Co, in response to the global semiconductor shortage, is redesigning automotive components to use more accessible chips, the No. 2 U.S. automaker's chief executive said on Thursday.
Jim Farley, speaking at Ford's online annual shareholder meeting, also said the company is weighing other strategies for the future, including building a buffer supply of chips and signing supply deals directly with the foundries that make the wafers used in semiconductors.
Automakers typically get their chips through their largest suppliers, not dealing directly with chip makers and the foundries that make the wafers used to assemble the semiconductors.
The chip shortage has caused automakers globally to curtail production. Last month, Ford said the issue would cost it $2.5 billion this year and halve its vehicle production in the second quarter, when the shortage will be at its worst. The shortage has forced Ford at times to idle production of its highly profitable F-150 pickup trucks.
Farley said on Thursday that about 60% of the chips used in Ford's vehicles are 55-nanometer or larger, what he called ""mature nodes"". He said supply of those chips was constrained.
Longer-term changes about how Ford approaches chips are being considered, he said.
""Not only are we redesigning a lot of our components to work with chips that are more accessible ... but we think we need to look at buffer stocks, actual direct contracts with some of the foundries,"" Farley said. ""We think that's going to be a really critical approach to our supply chain as we get more electronic components.""
Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford also said on Thursday the automaker will look to reinstate the company's dividend ""as soon as possible."" 

Ford's dividend was suspended in March 2020 after the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic hit in a move to conserve cash. That saved the company $2.4 billion at an annual rate.
Ford shares were up 3% in morning trading.

(Reuters) - Vaccine makers  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc and  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE), with its German partner BioNTech, have been vocal in their view that the world will soon need COVID-19 booster shots to maintain high levels of immunity. What is less clear, however, is who should make that decision - and based on what evidence.
    THE MODEL FOR FLU VACCINES
    Public health officials have a well-coordinated mechanism, first established in 1952, for determining when seasonal flu vaccines should be updated to cope with fast-mutating strains of influenza.
    The World Health Organization's Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System gathers data collected by national health authorities on circulating flu strains and, twice a year, uses that information to select the strains manufacturers should include in seasonal shots for the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.
   Some experts have suggested a similar model could be used to gather data on COVID-19 variants and advise drugmakers on what to include in vaccine updates. 
However, another approach could be to mimic what happens with updates of many other infectious disease vaccines - where decisions are based primarily on what the drugmakers perceive is required. National health authorities are then free to assess clinical trial data and decide whether a particular version of a vaccine should be used in their country.
    Currently, COVID-19 vaccine makers are taking this approach, making the call to develop and test variant-specific booster shots, and leaving it up to governments to buy them as they see fit. 
    WHAT EVIDENCE WILL BE NEEDED?
   Some vaccine experts say there needs to be clear evidence that the current COVID-19 vaccines are failing to prevent infections and severe disease before countries embark on repeat nationwide vaccination campaigns.
    They argue the decision on booster shots should be guided by data showing how vaccines perform in people in clinical trials and real-world settings, as well as in lab studies showing declining levels of antibodies in blood samples from vaccinated people. 
So far, COVID-19 vaccine makers have shown that their shots offer strong protection for at least six months. But immunity may vary. Older people, for example, or those with compromised immune systems, may need boosters earlier than younger people with more robust immune systems.
Another important dataset known as “correlates of protection” – evidence from clinical trials showing the threshold level of antibodies required for vaccines to be protective – could help policymakers decide on whether boosters are needed, but this data is not yet available.
    ADAPTED FOR A COVID-19 WORLD
    Globally, the World Health Organization is putting together an expert advisory panel which would evaluate ongoing evidence on COVID-19 vaccine durability and emerging variants and then offer guidance for governments. 
Although some experts have noted possible similarities with the global mechanism for updating flu vaccines, they also stress that it will need to be adapted for a COVID-19 world. More likely, they say, is that global guidance will be adapted by nations or regions to target local needs.
For example, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is developing its own risk assessment framework to determine what evidence is needed to recommend a modified vaccine. 
The CDC and other U.S. health agencies have their own

studies underway to assess vaccine efficacy, including in older populations and children, and monitor the impact of new variants. 
In Britain, Public Health England and the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control are working with global agencies on an ""Agility Project"" to track and test the impact of viral mutations and new variants on COVID-19 vaccine development.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's financial services sector won't get access to the European Union's markets for the foreseeable future following Brexit, industry officials said on Thursday as a row with France simmers.
Britain fully left the EU on Dec. 31, 2020 and the City of London has been largely cut off from providing services in the bloc.
Billions of euros in daily derivatives and share trading have left the City for the EU and New York, with no sign that Brussels will reinstate UK access under its 'equivalence' regime.
""I don't think equivalence is particularly an issue as we don't think there is going to be any equivalence being granted by the EU,"" Nick Collier, the City of London's representative in Brussels told the UK Trade and Business Commission of lawmakers and industry representatives.
The EU wants to build up its own capital market, Collier said.
France is seeking to delay the ratification of a cooperation agreement in financial services between the EU and Britain due to disputes over fishing rights. The agreement is seen as helping to rebuild the trust necessary for any future market access.
The EU has only granted equivalence to allow the bloc's banks to continue clearing euro derivatives in London, but only until the middle of next year.
Emma Reynolds, managing director at TheCityUK, which promotes Britain as a financial centre, said the EU was pursuing an agenda of onshoring jobs from the City.
""The big question is have we hit rock bottom? Or are there further restrictions? Our member firms are not optimistic about further equivalence being granted,"" Reynolds said.
Equivalence would require Britain to avoid diverging from financial rules in the EU, but the Bank of England has warned that the UK should not become a ""taker"" of the bloc's rules.

""I don't see really the point in the UK cleaving to exactly what the EU is going to do, there isn't that much advantage in that,"" Reynolds said.
""The advantage to the UK to now being outside the EU is that regulators and the government have that agility to tailor regulation to the UK's market,"" she added.

LONDON/JERUSALEM (Reuters) -British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, Lufthansa and Iberia all cancelled flights to Tel Aviv as European carriers joined U.S. airlines in avoiding flying to Israel, which has activated a back-up airport in the far south as a precaution against rockets from Gaza.
Palestinian militants have repeatedly shelled the Tel Aviv area during hostilities that erupted on Monday, raising safety concerns over Ben Gurion Airport, Israel's main airport, and prompting it to reroute some flights to Ramon Airport, some 200 km (125 miles) to the south, which serves Eilat.
""The safety and security of our colleagues and customers is always our top priority, and we continue to monitor the situation closely,"" British Airways said after cancelling its flights to and from Ben Gurion for Thursday.
Hamas militants in Gaza said they had launched a rocket at Ramon Airport on Thursday, but the Israel Airports Authority said that no rocket had struck Ramon and that it was operating as normal. The airport, which opened in 2019, can handle about 2 million passengers a year. It is connected by bus routes to the north, although there is no train service.
Its arrivals board showed several El Al Israel Airlines Ltd. flights from abroad that had been originally scheduled to land at Ben Gurion.
An Israeli official said the two airports were operating in sync. Ben Gurion was handling cargo, private and some other flights, and Ramon is ""open for landing international commercial flights"" and running scheduled domestic flights, he said.
Social media carried footage, purportedly taped by a passenger on an El Al flight from Brussels that was the first plane rerouted to Ramon, showing the view through the window of rockets being fired and intercepted over Tel Aviv. Reuters could not independently verify the footage.
UK-based Virgin Atlantic cancelled its flights to Tel Aviv for Wednesday and Thursday.
Spanish airline Iberia also cancelled its flight to Tel Aviv from Madrid on Thursday and back on Friday a spokeswoman said, while Germany's Lufthansa also cancelled its flights.
""Due to the current situation in Israel, Lufthansa is suspending its flights to Tel Aviv until Friday, May 14,"" the airline said.
Wizz Air said it had delayed its Thursday flight from Abu Dhabi to Tel Aviv until Friday.
Emirati carrier Flydubai said it was continuing to operate daily flights from Dubai to Tel Aviv. The airline was scheduled to operate three flights on Thursday, its website showed, while a fourth, night-time flight was cancelled.
United Airlines, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) on Wednesday all cancelled flights between the United States and Tel Aviv.
Virgin Atlantic had said earlier this week that bookings to Israel had soared 250% week on week after an announcement by Britain that Israel was on its ""green list"" for the reopening of overseas leisure travel during the COVID-19 pandemic.
But an explosion of violence, with fighting in Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip causing mounting civilian deaths, have made international airlines wary of the region.

Israel's national airline El Al has said it was ready to operate additional planes to make up for shortfalls in foreign carriers.
British airline easyJet (LON:EZJ) said that it was not yet cancelling its flights to Tel Aviv. Its next flight there is from Berlin and not scheduled until May 16, with a service from London Luton to Tel Aviv scheduled for May 18.

Net revenue was $81 million, a 42% increase year-over-year, and above guidance of $76.5 million.
Adjusted Ebitda was $4.2 million, compared to an $8.7 million loss a year ago and above guidance of $1.5 million.

542,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2021 09:07AM ET</span>",Top scientists question the need for COVID-19 booster shots,"By Julie Steenhuysen and Kate Kelland
(Reuters) -COVID-19 vaccine developers are making ever bolder assertions that the world will need yearly booster shots, or new vaccines to tackle concerning coronavirus variants, but some scientists question when, or whether, such shots will be needed.
    In interviews with Reuters, more than a dozen influential infectious disease and vaccine development experts said there is growing evidence that a first round of global vaccinations may offer enduring protection against the coronavirus and its most worrisome variants discovered to date.        
    Some of these scientists expressed concern that public expectations around COVID-19 boosters are being set by pharmaceutical executives rather than health specialists, although many agreed that preparing for such a need as a precaution was prudent. 
They fear a push by wealthy nations for repeat vaccination as early as this year will deepen the divide with poorer countries that are struggling to buy vaccines and may take years to inoculate their citizens even once.
    ""We don't see the data yet that would inform a decision about whether or not booster doses are needed,"" said Kate O'Brien, director of the Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals at the World Health Organization (WHO). 
    O'Brien said the WHO is forming a panel of experts to assess all variant and vaccine efficacy data and recommend changes to vaccination programs as needed. 
 Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) Chief Executive Albert Bourla has said people will ""likely"" need a booster dose of the company's vaccine every 12 months - similar to an annual flu shot – to maintain high levels of immunity against the original SARS-CoV-2 virus and its variants.
""There is zero, and I mean zero, evidence to suggest that that is the case,"" countered Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
""It's completely inappropriate to say that we're likely to need an annual booster, because we have no idea what the likelihood of that is,"" Frieden, who now leads the global public health initiative Resolve to Save Lives, said of Pfizer's assertions on boosters.
Pfizer, responding to the criticism, said it expects a need for boosters while the virus is still circulating widely. That could change once the pandemic is more firmly under control, a company spokeswoman said.
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc CEO Stephane Bancel aims to produce a vaccine by the fall that targets a variant first identified in South Africa and expects regular boosters will be needed.  
The United States is preparing to have such doses on hand for Americans, while the European Union, Britain and Israel have ordered new supplies of COVID-19 vaccines to deploy as protective boosters.
Some health experts, including Richard Hatchett, chief executive of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) that has funded many vaccine projects, say vaccine makers are right to plan ahead for boosters given the uncertainty over what will be needed in the long run.
Governments can then decide for themselves whether to buy the products, he said.
""A LITTLE EVIDENCE""
Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) have so far found that their shot remains more than 91% effective for six months after people received their second dose, compared with nearly 95% demonstrated in their clinical trial. The companies will track how robust the protection remains over time.
    Dr. William Gruber, Pfizer's senior vice president of vaccine clinical research and development, told Reuters earlier this month the prediction for yearly boosters was based on ""a little evidence"" of a decline in immunity over those six months.
    Pfizer expects the COVID-19 vaccine to be a major revenue contributor for years, and has forecast sales of $26 billion from the shot in 2021. Global spending on COVID-19 vaccines and booster shots could total $157 billion through 2025, according to U.S. health data firm IQVIA Holdings (NYSE:IQV).
    Moderna President Stephen Hoge expects boosters will be needed to keep immunity levels high, due in part to vaccine hesitancy, as an estimated 30% of the U.S. population may not agree to be vaccinated. As long as the virus is circulating widely, people at high risk of severe illness may need to boost their immune protection, Hoge said.
    ""All governments are in conversations with (Moderna) and other companies about boosters,"" he said.
    BROADER IMMUNITY?
    Late last year, scientists were optimistic that highly effective vaccines could quickly curb the global pandemic that has battered economies and killed more than 3.4 million people.
    Those hopes dimmed by February with evidence that mutant versions of the virus might evade protection offered by vaccines. Laboratory (NYSE:LH) studies showed that the South African variant could produce six to eight-fold reductions in antibody levels among people vaccinated with the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines. 
Clinical trial data also showed that vaccines from AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) Inc were less effective at preventing infections in South Africa, where the variant is widespread. 
    These studies spurred drug companies to start testing booster doses of their vaccines and to develop shots that target specific variants of the virus.
    However, more recent research suggests that the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines produce high levels of protective antibodies to create a ""cushion effect"" against the known variants, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and a top White House adviser.
    And antibodies - which block the coronavirus from attaching to human cells - do not tell the whole story. Several studies suggest that T cells - a type of white blood cell that can target and destroy already infected cells - may help prevent severe COVID-19 and hospitalization.
    NIAID researchers found that T cells in the blood of people who recovered from the original virus could still fight off infections caused by the concerning variants found in the UK, South Africa and Brazil.
    ""It's quite possible"" that boosters would not be needed, Fauci told Reuters. ""It is conceivable that the variants will not be as much a problem with a really good vaccine as we might have anticipated.""
    Nevertheless, health authorities in the United States, Britain and Europe are assuring their populations that a new round of shots will be available if needed, with many nations still desperate for vaccine supplies.

    ""It's a huge concern that ... wealthy countries would begin administering booster doses and further constraining supply of people's first dose of vaccine,"" said Rajeev Venkayya, head of global vaccines for Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.
Dr. Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease doctor at the University of California, San Francisco, said ultimately, decisions on whether boosters will be needed ""will best be made by public health experts, rather than CEOs of a company who may benefit financially.""

544,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2021 08:55AM ET</span>",Sectors to watch as inflation fears spook U.S. markets,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Worries over inflation are rippling through the U.S. stock market, spooking equities overall while causing investors to consider which shares can hold up better in an environment where inflation may be heating up.
Inflation talk grew on Wednesday as data showed U.S. consumer prices increased by the most in nearly 12 years in April.
Rising prices and costs can crimp consumer demand and corporate profitability. They could also pressure the Fed to tighten monetary policy, which in turn could harm economic growth and stock valuations.
""Some inflation for companies and markets are healthy,"" said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist Advisory Services. ""There's a sweet spot and then it gets to a place where it gets a bit too hot.""
Research by UBS equity strategists found the S&P 500 starts moving in the opposite direction to inflation expectations when the breakeven rate on the 10-year U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) -- a market-based measure of inflation -- exceeds 2.5%. The rate rose above that level in the past week for the first time since 2013, according to Refinitiv data.
Here are some stocks groups to watch as inflationary concerns rise:
REFLATION VS INFLATION: Investors anticipating an economic rebound from the coronavirus pandemic have moved into cyclical sectors expected to see profits pick up in a ""reflationary"" environment. 
Financials stocks surged this year as longer-dated Treasury yields climbed. But if the Fed raises short-term rates to combat inflation, that could flatten the yield curve, so ""the spread between borrowing and lending narrows for the banking sector and results in a net interest margins squeeze,"" according to BCA Research.
""Depending on how far up the inflation expectations you want to move, financials benefit and then at some point they don't,"" said Jack Janasiewicz, portfolio manager at Natixis Investment Managers.
Industrials, another cyclical group that has outperformed, are ""located in the middle of the economic value chain and thus (have) diminishing power to pass on inflationary cost increases,"" according to BCA.
""Keep the S&P industrials index in the overweight basket early on into an inflationary spike,"" the firm says in a note, ""but do not overstay your welcome as inflation endures."" 
COMMODITY-LINKED STOCKS: Two other cyclical groups, materials and energy, may be better positioned to weather inflation. They are more tightly linked to prices of commodities and raw materials, many of which have hit new heights recently. 
So far this month, ETFs for gold miners, copper miners and steel, have climbed between 7% and 9%, with the S&P 500 materials sector up about 3%, while the S&P 500 has posted a nearly 3% decline.
How much more room commodity prices have to run remains to be seen, however, and equities linked to those commodities may fall back if prices abate.
PRICING POWER: A rising inflation environment will increase costs for companies, so investors will be looking for companies that can pass along those costs through increased prices.
Companies with strong relative pricing power, according to UBS, include Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), and Abercrombie & Fitch.
Broadly, consumer staples companies are seen by some strategists as relatively well equipped to pass through price increases.
""The investing premise is that the necessity aspect of Consumer Staples means their demand is inelastic, allowing for price increases during an inflationary cycle,"" Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, said in a recent note.
Whether that premise bears out will be closely watched. For example, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) Co said last month it would raise prices of certain products in the United States to offset rising costs.
TECH TRIPPED UP: Tech stocks have struggled this week, and some investors are pointing to inflationary concerns contributing to the weakness. 

Following the consumer price data, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to its highest level in about a month. Such higher yields pressure valuations for tech and other growth stocks, whose future cash flows are discounted at higher rates.
""It's not inflation, per se; it's inflation and the implications for interest rates,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management. ""It just leaves tech investors somewhat vulnerable because that tailwind of lower rates and valuation expansion is no longer on their side.""

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) announced on Thursday a 10% average hourly pay raise at the nearly 660 U.S. restaurants it operates, joining the industry's scramble to lure workers back into kitchens and dining rooms as pandemic restrictions ease. 
The wage increases do not apply to employees at the roughly 13,025 U.S. McDonald's restaurants owned and operated by franchisees. 
McDonald's said the pay hikes for more than 36,500 hourly restaurant workers had already begun and would continue over several weeks. Under the new pay scale, entry-level crew will make at least $11 to 17 per hour, and shift managers will earn at least $15 to $20 an hour.
The company, which wants to hire 10,000 more hourly employees over the next three months, expects average pay at all company-owned restaurants to hit $15 per hour by 2024, up from about $13.
""We are rewarding our hardworking employees in McDonald-owned restaurants for serving our communities,"" Joe Erlinger, McDonald's USA president, said in a statement.
Restaurants shed millions of workers after the pandemic forced many dining establishments to close or severely curtail service.
Some of those employees shifted to warehouse or retail work. Others depend on government payments ranging from stimulus checks to enhanced unemployment benefits - in some cases reaping more than they could earn working full-time at a restaurant. 

McDonald's joins  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (NYSE:CMG), Taco Bell and other chains in sweetening compensation to lure applicants. 
Burrito chain Chipotle said on Monday it plans to hire 20,000 more employees and will raise the average hourly wage to $15 by the end of June, an increase of $2. 
 
"
547,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 13, 2021 08:27AM ET</span>",McDonald’s Boosting Average U.S. Wages to More Than $13 an Hour,"(Bloomberg) -- McDonald’s Corp. (NYSE:MCD) will raise hourly wages to help it hire and retain workers in an increasingly tight labor market for U.S. restaurants.
The raises, which average about 10%, bring hourly entry-level salaries to a range of $11 to $17, with managers starting at $15 to $20, depending on location. Once the raises are completed, average hourly pay at company-owned restaurants will be more than $13, McDonald’s said.
The hikes, announced the same week  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (NYSE:CMG). said it would boost its average wage to $15 an hour, come at a time when widespread labor shortages have companies of all shapes and sizes reconsidering worker pay. Even before the pandemic, labor was a major concern for the food industry, with the health crisis only exacerbating the shortage. McDonald’s, heading into a busy summer season as Americans start to venture out, is looking to hire 10,000 new employees at its company-owned stores over the next three months alone.
Only employees at the chain’s 650 company-owned stores will get the pay increases at this time, not those at franchised locations where management makes its own decisions on wages. But franchisees are looking at wages, too, said Mark Salebra, chairman of the U.S. National Franchisee Leadership Alliance.
“Together with our franchisees, we face a challenging hiring environment, and staying ahead means we must constantly renew our commitment to offer one of the leading employment packages in the industry,” Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald’s USA, said in a message seen by Bloomberg. “Simply put: putting our people first and doing the right thing for them will drive continued growth for our business.”
Wages for restaurant workers have climbed steadily in recent years, though the trend eased during the Covid-19 pandemic, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show. With Democrats in control of Congress, there’s been more discussion in 2021 about raising the national minimum wage to $15 an hour, a plan endorsed by President Joe Biden.
Biden signed an executive order last month that raises the minimum wage for federal contractors and tipped employees working on government contracts to $15 an hour, but efforts to raise the national minimum wage appear to have stalled.
McDonald’s said more than 36,500 employees are slated to receive this round of hikes, which have already started and will be fully rolled out in the coming months. Average hourly wages across all company-owned locations are expected to reach $15 an hour by 2024.

Investing.com --  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) shares were down 3% in Thursday’s premarket following a quarterly loss brought on by a $2.78 billion antitrust fine.
The 5.47-billion-yuan ($848 million) loss for the March quarter surprised traders who expected the Chinese internet giant to report a profit.
Alibaba said its loss from operations was 7.66 billion yuan as a result of the fine. Discounting the fine, its income from operations would be 10.56 billion yuan, a 48% year-on-year rise.
Revenue came at 187.39 billion, up 64% year-over-year.
Alibaba would be hoping for an end to its troubles that started sometime in November when founder Jack Ma vaguely criticized the regulators. Immediately following that, the $34.5 billion initial public offering of Alibaba’s affiliate, Ant Group, had to be called off. That set the troubles for the group going.

(Reuters) - FirstEnergy Corp (NYSE:FE), the U.S. utility that gave activist investor Carl Icahn seats on its board this year, is exploring divestitures as an alternative to raising cash by selling stock, according to four people familiar with the matter.
Akron, Ohio-based FirstEnergy is trying to recover from the fallout of accusations it was involved with a $60 million bribery scheme involving financial aid for troubled nuclear power plants in its home state. 
The utility replaced its chief executive and let go of employees suspected of being linked to the corruption case, in a bid to assuage investor concerns. Its shares have recovered most of the value they lost when federal prosecutors unveiled the bribery scheme last July.
However, credit rating agencies have warned the episode may continue to affect FirstEnergy's ability to access bond markets.
FirstEnergy said last month it was seeking alternatives to issuing up to $1.2 billion of stock over 2022 and 2023, to help finance its spending plans.
The firm is working with an investment bank as it considers divesting stakes in some of its subsidiaries as one such alternative, according to the four people.
This includes selling part of Monongahela Power Company, which provides electricity to nearly 400,000 customers in West Virginia, as well as pieces of West Penn Power and Potomac Edison, power companies serving 720,000 customers in Pennsylvania and more than 400,000 people in Maryland and West Virginia respectively.
FirstEnergy could fetch $1.5 billion by selling all three outright, according to one of the sources.
The sources cautioned that no decision has been made and asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential.
FirstEnergy declined to comment.

FirstEnergy would be the latest U.S. utility to raise cash by selling stakes in a subsidiary. In January,  Duke Energy  Corp (NYSE:DUK) agreed to sell 19.9% of its Indiana operations to Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC for $2.05 billion. 
FirstEnergy operates 10 regulated electric companies, serving six million customers across six states, according to its website. It agreed to give two board seats to Icahn's representatives in March.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) on Thursday set out mid-term, carbon reduction goals for clients, as banks face pressure to align their financing activities with their climate change commitments.
The U.S. bank is asking clients in the electric power and auto industries to meet carbon intensity reduction goals and for oil and gas clients to meet operational and end-use carbon intensity reduction goals by 2030. 
""We are taking steps to address the emissions of the clients we finance,"" Marisa Buchanan, JPMorgan's global head of sustainability, told Reuters. 
She said the targets signal the bank's expectations that its clients operate responsibly and take the steps necessary to invest in a lower carbon future.
JPMorgan is asking electric power and automakers to reduce their direct carbon emissions, such as those produced from their buildings, plus emissions from companies that provide energy or other services necessary for these businesses to operate. 
The bank is asking oil and gas clients to reduce the intensity of direct and indirect emissions, plus emissions from the combustion of oil and natural gas. 
Banks face growing pressure to disclose more about emissions from activities they finance. 
JPMorgan along with the wider financial services industry has long been a target of climate activists which say the industry's backing for carbon-heavy projects run contrary to support of the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change.
Last month, JPMorgan said it aims to lend, invest and provide other financial services for up to $2.5 trillion of banking business to be done for companies and projects tackling climate change and social inequality over the next decade.

The bank's new carbon reduction goals for clients were welcomed by at least two environmental groups, EDF (PA:EDF) and CERES. 
""We welcome the move to interim targets,"" said Ben Ratner, senior director at EDF. ""We see JPM is starting the journey from pledges to progress.""

E-commerce has been booming since the outbreak of the pandemic, despite accelerated vaccination efforts, as people are still wary of walking crowded store aisles and prefer ordering everything from furniture to food supplies online. 
The company's online sales more than tripled in the quarter ended April 3.
The online surge compensated for a slowdown in store sales earlier this year following a resurgence of coronavirus cases that had triggered a fresh round of lockdowns and strict distancing recommendations, including limited store capacity and sale of non-essential items.
The retailer has been investing more in e-commerce in recent months, sending personalized promotions to about 10 million members of its loyalty program and ramping up its in-store pickup and curbside delivery programs. 
The Toronto, Ontario-based retail chain's revenue rose 16.7%to C$3.32 billion ($2.74 billion) from a year earlier, and beat analysts' average estimate of C$2.92 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
The automotive, home and sporting goods retailer posted a net income of C$186.4 million, or C$2.47 per share, compared with an income of C$12.2 million, or a loss of 22 Canadian cents per share, a year earlier.

Investing.com – Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares erased their losses premarket and were up 1% in Thursday’s volatile trade after its CEO Elon Musk said consumers could no longer use Bitcoin to buy its vehicles.
At one point, the shares were down 1.5%.
“We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel,” Musk tweeted while explaining his rationale for the decision.
Musk’s U-turn caught everyone by surprise given that Tesla and he, in his personal capacity, had both invested in the cryptocurrency.
The investment had led to a temporary surge in Tesla’s share price as well as value of Bitcoin.
Tesla had invested $1.5 billion in February, which it partly liquidated later.   
Musk added the company is looking at cryptocurrencies that use less than 1% of Bitcoin’s energy and would also look at using the biggest crypto for transactions as soon as its mining transitions to a more sustainable energy.
Tesla has been facing mounting problems elsewhere too, particularly in China where it faces social media backlash over claims of faulty brakes in its vehicles.
A Reuters report Tuesday said the company has dropped plans to expand capacity in China, its largest market outside the U.S.
The report said Tesla has halted plans to buy land to expand its Shanghai plant and make it a global export hub. Tesla had earlier considered expanding exports of its China-made entry-level Model 3 to more markets, including the U.S."

LONDON (Reuters) - Fresh outbreaks of COVID-19 and travel curbs are deterring tourists from flocking back to Thailand's beaches and Turkey's bazaars, stalling a recovery in tourism, a crucial source of foreign currency and a large employer for many emerging markets.
Global tourism suffered its worst year ever in 2020 with the sector shrinking in value by an estimated $4.5 trillion in the pandemic's wake, according to World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) figures. 
The scale of recovery in 2021 still hangs in the balance.
But with one in three countries and territories worldwide closed to tourism, key sources of tourists such as Britain barring foreign travel to most countries and fresh virus flare-ups in popular destinations such as Thailand, the prospects appear grim.
Tourism could revive in either July or September, estimates the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO), but it warns that, in either scenario, arrivals would still be less than half of 2019 levels.
Emerging economies, generally more reliant on tourism than their developed peers, are most vulnerable to the disruption.
Their lagging vaccination rates compared to developed peers add to pressure. 
Tunisia and Egypt have vaccinated less than 5% of their populations, compared to rates of 20-30% across the Mediterranean in Greece, Italy and Spain.
""It is indeed a hidden risk factor economically, socially and politically for several EMs, since after a difficult 2020 it is tough to lose two seasons in a row,"" said Sergey Dergachev, fund manager at Union Investment.
(Graphic: Vaccination rates in emerging vs developed tourist destinations, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/ygdpzoknwvw/Capture.PNG) 
FRAGILE FOUR
Turkey, Egypt, Tunisia and Sri Lanka are among the most vulnerable, with all four heavily relying on tourism to replenish FX reserves. 
A recovery in Turkey's current account deficit, which widened to $3.3 billion in March, hinges on a rebound in tourism as higher energy prices fan import costs.
Both Britain and Russia have effectively barred citizens from heading to Turkey for now. Even under an optimistic recovery scenario for tourism in the second half of the year,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) predicts Ankara might have to dip into precious foreign reserves to finance a chunk of its $21 billion deficit.
Egypt is expected to receive a boost from the resumption of flights from Russia following a five-year hiatus after militants downed a Russian jet in October 2015. Yet hampered by weakness in its two key sources of foreign exchange - tourism and Suez Canal receipts - Egypt's current account receipts will remain below 2019 levels over the next two years, estimates S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI).
Similarly to Egypt, tourism accounts for more than a third of hard currency earnings in Tunisia, whose economy is expected to grow just 3.8% in 2021 after a sharp contraction in 2020.
""This (tourism) is a big topic for any country with a current account deficit,"" said Guillaume Tresca, senior emerging market strategist at Generali (MI:GASI) Asset Management.
""If you think about tourism in emerging markets, you have to focus on weak countries with weak external balances that rely on tourism – Tunisia, Turkey, Egypt.""
Sri Lanka's government, which pinned economic revival hopes in large part on a tourism turnaround, saw April tourism revenues drop nearly 10% month-on-month and new arrivals from India have been barred since earlier this month.
(Graphic: Fragile current accounts leave some tourist hotspots vulnerable, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/azgvogajnvd/Capture.PNG) 
LIVELIHOODS
Up to 62 million jobs were lost across all global travel and tourism markets in 2020, estimates the WTTC.
The replacement of many of those jobs, as well as the security of others, in emerging markets depends in large part on how the summer season shapes up.
Most at risk from a slow resumption in tourism are small island nations, such as Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba and St Lucia, where more than two-thirds of total employment is within the tourism industry.
S&P Global Ratings lowered its sovereign credit rating on Aruba by one notch to 'BBB' from 'BBB+' in March, warning the government would likely rely more heavily on borrowing expenditures, pushing debt levels higher.

With unemployment already in double-digits in many countries heading into the pandemic, analysts warn of the risk of fresh social unrest a decade on from protests that blossomed into the Arab Spring.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - In its ongoing case against Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), ""Fortnite"" creator Epic Games is counting on this week's testimony from its star expert witness David Evans, chairman of Global Economics Group, to make its case that Apple is an anticompetitive monopolist over app developers.
Apple has called its own experts to rebut Evans' views on the market, but with an added personal twist: It called MIT economist Richard Schmalensee, who has authored numerous books and academic papers together with Evans, to accuse Evans of contradicting his own prior research.
Legal experts said Apple's aim was to chip away at Evans' credibility in the eyes of the judge who will rule on the case.
The erstwhile collaborators - who together have written works cited extensively by the U.S. Supreme Court in landmark antitrust decisions - are duking it out over the central issue in the three-week trial in federal court in Oakland, California: What is the relevant market in the case? 
Framed Epic's way, Apple and its app store are a monopoly that is abusing control over the mobile software market to extract commissions for payments made inside apps. But Apple argues that it is just one of many competitors in a healthy market for video game purchases.
Whichever side prevails in persuading Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers (NYSE:ROG) on the question of market definition will likely win the entire case, antitrust experts said.
""Epic absolutely has to win the market definition,"" said Daniel Lyons, a professor at Boston College Law School. ""If Apple is right that 'Fortnite' on iOS is just one small part of the larger 'Fortnite' universe, then Apple doesn't have market power and anything they do is unlikely to cause consumer harm because consumers can switch.""
On the stand this week, Evans testified that Apple is what is known as a single-brand market, arguing that once consumers buy an iPhone, the costs of switching to an Android are so high that they rarely make the jump. 
Since about 2010, Evans testified, Apple's App Store has effectively been its own market, and users rarely venture outside. After Apple kicked ""Fortnite"" off the App Store, Evans testified, only a small fraction of Apple users jumped to other devices like PCs or gaming consoles to play ""Fortnite.""
Schmalensee, by contrast, contends that the relevant market is gaming transactions, where Apple is just one platform among many -  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Xbox and  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Group Corp's PlayStation - sitting between game developers and gamers and charging commissions to facilitate transactions.
Apple's App Store is a two-sided marketplace, Schmalensee testified, a concept that he and Evans have written about extensively, including in an amicus curiae brief on behalf of  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) in a 2018 U.S. Supreme Court case.
American Express had prohibited merchants from steering their customers toward rival cards with lower swipe fees, arguing that its higher fees helped fund cardholder perks that benefited consumers. The court sided with American Express, citing Evans and Schmalensee extensively in its decision. 
Schmalensee said Apple's rules that prohibit apps from steering consumers to less costly payment presented an almost identical issue, and that Evans had contradicted many aspects of his previous work.
Outside observers have been surprised by the split between the two star economists.
""I would say (Evans') views on AmEx haven’t changed, but what he would say is the facts here are different and so the same result isn’t appropriate,"" said Geoff Manne, president and founder of the International Center for Law & Economics research center. ""Personally, I don’t see how he gets there and gets it to stick.""
Part of Apple's strategy in putting Schmalensee on the stand was to bring up the differences between Evans' previous work and his current view of the Epic case in a bid to make his testimony look less credible, observers said.

“Each of them knows though that whatever opinions they have said in the past have to be consistent with what they say now,"" said Steven Salop, professor of economics and law at Georgetown University and a self-described consultant to Epic on its case.
Schmalensee declined to comment, and Evans did not immediately return requests for comment.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening lower Thursday, adding to Wednesday’s sharp losses amid rising concerns the Federal Reserve may pare back its ultra-easy monetary policies sooner rather than later.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow futures contract was down 155 points, or 0.4%, S&P 500 futures traded 11 points, or 0.3%, lower, and Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 35 points, or 0.3%.
The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday fell almost 700 points, or 2%, its weakest day since January, the S&P 500 lost 2.1%, its biggest one-day drop since February, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 2.6%. 
This has been Wall Street’s worst week in six months on concerns increased inflation levels will pressure the Fed into raising interest rates more promptly than the central bank has guided.
The economic data slate also commands attention Thursday, with the weekly jobless claims, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), the main release, especially after last week’s disappointing jobs report for April and record job opening numbers earlier this week.
Economists are calling for 490,000 initial claims, below 500,000 for the second straight week, helped by the ramped-up vaccination program and widespread easing of social distancing restrictions. 
The latest factory gate price data are due at the same time, with the annual PPI figure expected to rise to 5.9% from 4.2% the previous month.
In the corporate sector, Disney (NYSE:DIS) releases its quarterly results after the close, and investors will be looking for the entertainment giant’s guidance for the rest of the year now that Disneyland has reopened and tourists are traveling again.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will also be in the spotlight after CEO Elon Musk said the electric car manufacturer is suspending the use of bitcoin as a method to purchase its vehicles, citing concerns about the impact on the environment from mining for the cryptocurrency.  
Oil prices weakened Thursday, after Colonial Pipeline began to slowly restart the nation's largest fuel pipeline network, lifting concerns of a lengthy shortage of fuel to major population centers on the east coast of the U.S.
Adding to the negative tone, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported a draw of 427,000 barrels in crude oil inventories for the week ending May 7. This was a smaller drop than the 2.82-million-barrel draw expected, as well as the near 8-million-barrel reduction recorded during the previous week.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.7% lower at $64.97 a barrel, the Brent contract fell 1.6% to $68.22. 
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,817.35/oz, while EUR/USD traded flat at 1.2069.

In a statement on Wednesday, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection said its officials at the Port of Kansas City seized 4.68 million latex gloves produced by a Top Glove unit in Malaysia with an estimated value of $690,000. 
In response, Top Glove said it has informed the U.S. agency that it has remediated all forced labour indicators found at the firm. 
This is the second Top Glove shipment seized in about a week. On May 5, U.S. Customs seized 3.97 million nitrile gloves worth $518,000.
The seizure shows that there is demand for Top Glove products despite the U.S. ban first announced in July last year. Top Glove is the world's biggest glove maker and has seen global demand soar due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
U.S. Customs prohibited the import of Top Glove products last year, saying it had found reasonable evidence of forced labour. 

And in March, it said it had found evidence of multiple forced labour indicators in Top Glove's production process, including debt bondage, excessive overtime, abusive working and living conditions, and retention of identity documents, and directed its officials to seize goods from the manufacturer.
Top Glove said in April it has resolved all indicators of forced labour in its operations and that this had been verified by London-based ethical trade consultant Impactt Limited.

For more than two years, Google has not allowed Enel's JuicePass to operate on Android Auto - a system that allows apps to be used safely in cars - unfairly curtailing its use while favouring Google Maps, the regulator said on Thursday.
""The contested behaviour can influence the development of e-mobility in a crucial phase ... with possible negative spill-over effects on the growth of electric vehicles (EV),"" it said.
In a statement announcing the fine for abuse of a dominant position, the regulator asked Google to make JuicePass available on Android Auto. 
JuicePass is owned by Enel's ""e-solutions"" subsidiary Enel X, which brought the case against Google. The app offers users services for finding and booking EV charging stations on maps and viewing details.
Google ""respectfully disagrees"" with the antitrust regulator's decision and will examine the documents to decide its next steps, a spokesman for Google in Italy said. 
Google's priority for Android Auto is to ensure safety while driving, with stringent guidelines on which apps it supports, he said.
""There are thousands of apps compatible with Android Auto, and our goal is to enable even more developers to make their apps available over time,"" the spokesman said.
The regulator said the U.S. giant had a dominant position that allows it to control the access of app developers to final users through Android and its app store Google Play.
Enel acknowledged the decision, saying it was an important enabling factor for the growth of electric mobility in Italy.

""In accordance with this decision, a level playing field with Google apps will be granted for Enel X's app, JuicePass, and in general for all recharging app developers,"" it said.

560,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2021 06:53AM ET</span>",Luxury jet makers battle over lucrative spy plane niche,"By Allison Lampert and Tim Hepher
MONTREAL/PARIS (Reuters) - Last month, a ghostly grey business jet took off from central Sweden and headed across the Baltic on a routine spying mission.
The converted Gulfstream, caught on a tracking website, was flown by the Swedish Air Force and patrolled an area thick with Russian radar signals off the militarised coast of Kaliningrad.
Apart from a couple of unobtrusive bulges underneath, Sweden's two Gulfstream-based S102B Korpen spy planes look like any other sleek corporate jet.
But inside, the Swedish jets and a growing fleet of newer corporate aircraft contain the eyes and ears of a relentless intelligence war. 
From the South China Sea to the Middle East and the Baltic, governments are eyeing ""special mission"" business jets capable of looking or listening at potentially lower running costs than converted passenger or military planes.
It's the latest chapter for a discreet market worth an estimated $3 billion to a handful of corporate jet specialists and the Israeli, European and U.S. arms firms that supply advanced intelligence systems.
The rising demand for small jets with systems once reserved for bigger planes has energised a market led by General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) subsidiary Gulfstream, with Canada's Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF) and France's Dassault Aviation snapping at its heels.
""A key area for growth is in signals and electronic intelligence,"" said defence analyst Francis Tusa.
""This is increasingly viable on smaller aircraft because of improvements in electronics and their reduction in size. It's all about processing power and the size of electronics.""
'NUMEROUS OPPORTUNITIES'
The trend accelerated last month when Sweden's Saab paired its new-generation GlobalEye early warning system, carried on Bombardier Global business jets, with Gripen warplanes in its bid for a crucial Finnish fighter contest.
Missions vary widely from intelligence planes that passively scoop up radar and listen to communications to the most advanced early warning aircraft that actively scan or watch for threats.
""It's the difference between listening out for the sound of a burglar or shining a bright torch,"" a defence executive said.
All eyes are now on South Korea, which may search for new early warning planes later this year to augment its Peace Eye fleet based on Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737s, analysts and industry sources said. 
It is already looking for target-tracking or ""listening"" jets, prompting U.S. defence giant Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) to propose putting consoles and artificial intelligence on Bombardiers.
While such orders are small in volume, they are more profitable and resistant to crises such as COVID-19.
""Even as demand generally softened due to the pandemic, Textron (NYSE:TXT) Aviation saw a slight increase in special-mission orders in 2020,"" its defence head Tom Hammoor said. Its Beechcraft King Air turboprops carry out reconnaissance and law enforcement.
Basic corporate jets can cost anywhere from $20 million to $60 million but the price tag for converting them into spy planes rises quickly and could surpass $200 million for a high-end product, industry sources say.
Heavily exposed to fluctuating demand for civil business jets after quitting the rest of the aerospace industry, Bombardier says it is now dedicating more resources to military missions.
""We've been approached (with) numerous opportunities ... I would say in the last couple of months,"" Chief Executive Eric Martell said in response to a Reuters query.
Jetmakers do not disclose data for sales of special-mission aircraft. The market is estimated by U.S. research firm JETNET to be about 5% of annual large-cabin business jet deliveries.
According to JETNET, Gulfstream is the leader in business jet deliveries to government customers, competing with rivals such as Bombardier and Dassault, which recently clinched orders for seven Falcon 2000 Albatros planes for the French Navy. 
LUXURY TO SPYCRAFT
But Gulfstream is ending production this year of its popular G550 corporate jet, which was recently delivered to Israel as a surveillance aircraft, creating a potential opening for rivals. 
""For Bombardier and (Dassault's) Falcon, much depends on what Gulfstream does to position a new model to take the place of the G550 as the dominant special-mission business jet,"" Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia said. 
""If they don't have a replacement that's as suitable and popular ... then Bombardier and Falcon gain.""
Gulfstream said orders will shift to its newer models. Dassault had no immediate comment.
The business of turning luxury into spycraft is not new, dating back to a Grumman executive turboprop in the 1960s.
But demand for ""missionized"" business jets is accelerating as radars get smaller and planes fly further. 
U.S. jetmaker Boeing argues only its larger 737-based platforms have the all-round capability needed for demanding missions. Its P-8 maritime patrol version also carries weapons.
Systems supplier L3Harris Technologies (NYSE:LHX), however, said large-cabin business jets were used in most projects over the last five years in areas such as multi-role surveillance.
Sean Stackley, president of its Integrated Mission Systems business, said it was looking at more than half a dozen new sales campaigns, including with two NATO countries.
Even as corporate airframes equip for war, there is talk of pressure from another emerging rival: long-endurance drones.

 Northrop Grumman  (NYSE:NOC)'s Global Hawk, for example, is used for intelligence gathering over water and coastal areas and costs about $130 million, according to industry experts https://reut.rs/3eBylD3.
""The main future threat to this market is from unmanned aerial vehicles and to a lesser extent low-earth-orbit satellites,"" Tusa said. ""But they are not cheap. So a business jet solution sits well with that.""

561,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2021 06:36AM ET</span>",New generation of digital banks bets on minority markets,"By Anna Irrera and Maria Caspani
NEW YORK (Reuters) - After a doctor's visit, three court appearances, five trips to the bank and having her name and address published in a newspaper, Billie Simmons finally got a debit card with her chosen name. 
As a transgender woman, that meant she didn't run the risk of outing herself every time she used her card for routine expenses like buying groceries.
The legal process to change her name and her gender on identity documents took several weeks. Yet four years on, Simmons still receives her monthly credit report in an email addressed to her dead name. 
She hasn't been able to change her online banking username and her credit score is incomplete, only reflecting transactions made after she legally changed her name.
""It's a constant emotional reminder that the system will always see me as the person I used to be and it won't let me move on with my life,"" the 27-year-old said. 
""On tough days that's a really hard thing to grapple with. These banking systems are not designed for us."" 
Hoping to address some of these issues, Simmons has co-founded Daylight, an online banking provider focused on the LGBTQ community that is set to launch this summer. 
Among its features, it allows users to set up an account online with their chosen name, regardless of what appears on their ID documents, and receive financial coaching focused on goals common among many LGBTQ consumers, such as saving for surrogacy or adoption.
Daylight estimates there are 30 million Americans who identify as LGBTQ. It is among a cohort of new digital banks in the United States targeting communities where many people say their needs have not been met by mainstream lenders.
Such startups include First Boulevard and Greenwood, both focused on serving Black Americans, Cheese Financial aimed at the Asian community and Majority serving immigrant groups. 
""Historically, community banks have focused on cheaper customer acquisition by focusing on an underserved geography,"" said Ian Kar, founder and CEO of research firm Fintech Today. 
""The internet removes geographical restrictions. Developing banking services around people's identity, like race and sexual orientation, is a modern approach.""
Digital banking startups that target specific demographics raised a collective $318 million from investors in 2020, according to data provider CB Insights. 
They've raised $86 million in eight deals in 2021, including a $40 million cash injection for Greenwood from U.S. financial institutions including Truist Financial (NYSE:TFC) Corp, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).
Yet such startups are entering an increasingly crowded market for digital banking, where many rivals offer similar basic services and pricing, like no monthly fees, overdraft fees or minimum balance.
They're betting their branding and tailored offerings for their target groups will trump the wider range of services offered by big banks. Yet they may need to swiftly expand their customer bases to challenge larger lenders who enjoy scale and cheaper sources of capital, according to some industry experts.
YAWNING WEALTH GAP
Kansas City-based First Boulevard, founded in the wake of George Floyd's murder last year, says it aims to help customers build wealth and reinvest in the Black community. 
The inequality in the United States is stark: the average wealth of Black families is $24,100 - less than 15% that of white families, at $142,500, according to Federal Reserve data.
Just 6% of Black business owners surveyed in 2020 by the Association for Enterprise Opportunity said their primary source of credit came from banks, versus 23% for all businesses. When approved, the median loan amount for Black business owners was less than half of the loan amounts extended to white peers, according to the survey.
""We are one of the only communities in the world that were considered property when our financial system was built,"" said Donald  Hawkins  (NASDAQ:HWKN), First Boulevard's CEO. 
Among its offerings, First Boulevard is building a marketplace which gives users cash back for buying at Black-owned businesses. 
Prentiss Earl, a teacher and entrepreneur in Kansas City, said he'd never felt comfortable asking his mainstream bank for financial advice, but would at a lender like First Boulevard.
""I want to feel I sense that my money is going to business ventures and people who look like me,"" Earl said. 
First Boulevard is launching on Juneteenth - an annual holiday on June 19 commemorating the abolition of slavery in the United States - and says it has a waiting list of 200,000 users. 
It recently raised $5 million in seed funding from backers including UK banking giant  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc and fintech investment firm Anthemis Group.
""If you see more attention to this segment it is because it has been lacking for so long,"" said Amy Nauiokas, founder and CEO of Anthemis, referring to minority groups.
'IT'S INTIMIDATING'
Given the challenges facing such entrants into the competitive digital banking market, success could hinge on how quickly they can grow their customer base by building a brand that resonates as authentic with the communities they aim to serve, according to analysts.
""You could make a mistake very easily as you will never appeal to every single person in that community. It's a community but not everyone is a carbon copy,"" said Sarah Kocianski, head of research at fintech consultancy 11:FS. 
Houston and Stockholm-based Majority provides banking services to immigrants in the United States, a diverse group spanning multiple nationalities, cultures and languages, and says it signed up 5,000 subscribers in its first 3 months since launching. 
The company began by offering financial services to the Nigerian community in Houston, later expanding to Cubans in Miami. It now plans to target immigrants from Ghana, Kenya and Ethiopia in Washington DC. It hires employees from the same communities who can act as local advisers. 
CEO Magnus Larsson said many migrants go to physical stores in their communities to access basic financial services.
""Why do people go there when it's expensive? Because of the cultural context,"" he added. ""They are uncomfortable or not feeling welcome (in mainstream banking). It's intimidating.""
FINANCIAL ACCESS
For some people, specialized banks can be crucial, according to Ken Lian, who lacked a credit profile and struggled to open a checking account after he moved to the United States from China in 2008. He ended up paying more than $1,000 in various fees like ATM withdrawals and overdrafts. 
He now has a 800 FICO credit score, which is considered above average, but says he can still get rejected by mainstream banks because of his relatively new status in the country. 
This year Lian co-founded Cheese Financial, a digital banking service for the 21 million Asian Americans.
Tailored to be accessible for customers with no credit history, the company is also working on being able to take on new customers without requiring a social security number.

It offers 10% cash back at more than 10,000 stores and Asian-owned businesses and has pledged to donate $10 for each new user to a non-profit organization focused on helping the community. 
""Given the current environment the Asian community is facing, we built Cheese as a new banking platform with a social cause,"" Lian said, referring in part to a spike in attacks on Asian Americans over the past year.

562,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2021 06:26AM ET</span>",Canada's Cargojet tells pilots it may shift some work to U.S.,"By Allison Lampert
(Reuters) - Canada's Cargojet Inc has threatened to move work to the United States unless it wins exemption from rules aimed at preventing pilot fatigue because of their cost, according to a deal rejected by its pilots seen by Reuters.
Cargojet has said it wants to reduce costs and grow in the United States as Canada's largest cargo carrier benefits from an increase in air freight demand due to a decline in ""belly capacity” from passenger aircraft grounded during the pandemic.
The Ontario-based company, which reported 30% higher quarterly revenues this month, has hired more than 60 pilots in the past three to four months to meet stronger demand and comply with Canadian rules that went into effect in December. Those shorten the number of hours pilots can work at night and extend their rest periods, among other conditions.
But 65% of Cargojet's 283 pilots on Wednesday voted against supporting the company's bid for an exemption from regulator Transport Canada, their union Unifor said by email. The company does not need union support for the exemption but hoped to have it.
Cargojet, which operates certain flights for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), had offered to protect jobs as part of the deal. Cargojet Chief Executive Ajay Virmani told analysts this month he was seeking a U.S. investment or partner for its ""growth strategy across the border.""
Cargojet did not respond to a request for comment. Transport Canada was not immediately available for comment on Wednesday but said on Tuesday it had not received an exemption request from Cargojet.
Cargojet warned that it might have to lay off up to 130 pilots and move ""part of its operation"" to the United States due to fatigue rules that create ""an uneven playing field"" with American cargo carriers, according to the proposed deal.
The agreement generated controversy among pilots on both sides of the border, pitting concerns over protecting Canada's hard-won fatigue rules against jobs at a time when cargo has emerged as an oasis of growth in aviation.
Scott Doherty, a Unifor official, said in an interview it was a problem for ""us to be losing jobs to the U.S. during a pandemic because they play by a different set of rules.""
While U.S. cargo pilots have restrictions in their contracts to prevent fatigue, they are not comparably covered by federal regulations.
That disparity is a sore point for U.S. unions, including the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), which want the same American rules that protect against fatigue in the cockpit of passenger airlines to also cover cargo operators.

Analysts were expecting the demerger, announced last year following pressure from activist investor Third Point (NYSE:SPNT), to take place this month. Prudential had previously said the demerger would take place in the second quarter.
The company said that while regulatory approvals for the demerger had been received from Michigan and New York, ""regulatory engagement"" was continuing so detail on Jackson's first-quarter performance could be included.
""The U.S. demerger will complete Prudential's structural transformation into a business solely focused on the growth opportunities of Asia and Africa,"" chief executive Mike Wells said in a trading statement ahead of the company's annual general meeting on Thursday.
Prudential's shares were down 5.4% at 0930 GMT, one of the worst performers in the FTSE 100.
Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analysts described the demerger delay as ""disappointing"", while retaining their ""buy"" rating on the stock.
Wells said that while vaccination roll-outs should bring ""a gradual return to more normal economic patterns"", uncertainty remained over the speed of roll-outs and their success.
New business profit in the life insurer's Asia and Africa operations rose by 21% to $624 million in the first quarter, helped by strong performance in China.
Asia and Africa annual premium equivalent (APE) sales rose 14% to $1.2 billion.
Jackson's first-quarter new business premiums were in line with the second half of 2020 and sales of variable
annuities were up. Sales of fixed index annuities and fixed annuities in the same period remained at historically low
levels following earlier pricing actions, the company said.

Prudential reiterated that it planned a $2.5-3 billion equity raising once the demerger is completed, likely to be through a global offering to institutional investors and a public sale in Hong Kong to retail investors. 
Prudential also said it would consider a preferential offering to Hong Kong-resident eligible employees and agents.

565,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 13, 2021 05:36AM ET</span>",Cooler Heads Prevail as U.S. Inflation Fears Ease From Highs,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors aren’t yet abandoning the view that inflation pressures will pass, even as the sticker-shock of the U.S. consumer prices report sends tremors across a broad range of assets.
Market gauges of inflation expectations pulled back from initial spikes following the data, which showed the biggest monthly increase in core CPI since 1982 U.S. Treasury long-end yields are still shy of their year-to-date peak, with a sale of new 10-year notes meeting strong demand. After a third day of losses for major U.S. equity indexes, futures were marginally down in European trading hours.
This moderation in market moves should reassure policy makers, who maintain that the acceleration in prices is temporary, due largely to supply bottlenecks as producers struggle to catch up with rebounding demand after the pandemic forced so much global activity to shut down.
“It is not a question of whether inflation will normalize but when,” said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY). “The pre-pandemic secular trends like globalization, technological efficiencies, demographics should push inflation lower, but how long these distortions continue to push inflation higher is unclear.”
Getting their call right on inflation is make or break for investors. Rising costs of living erode the value of their already low-yielding assets over time, and could force central banks to raise interest rates sooner than they’ve led markets to believe.
The run-up in prices of real assets, from commodities to housing, highlights the need to have sturdy inflation hedges in place, according to Thomas Poullaouec, multi-asset portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price.
“What they’re telling us is that there are different signs to suggest that higher inflation for longer than the market is pricing is a risk, and we definitely shouldn’t underestimate it,” he said.
Poullaouec this year shifted to favor value stocks -- such as financials, industrials and materials and some consumer-related sectors -- over growth assets for the first time in a decade. He sees the economic recovery spurring this rotation, which he says is only half-complete.
In fixed income, he is leaning into short-term inflation-linked bonds and bank loans, or even cash, to steer clear of the sort of long-dated, low-yield assets that are most vulnerable to higher borrowing costs.
Longer-term measures still don’t suggest price pressures getting out of hand. The rate on the five-year, five-year forward swap contract for CPI is still around 2.5%. Adjusted for the typical gap between CPI and the Fed’s preferred measure -- personal consumption expenditures -- that means longer-run inflation is seen running only modestly above the 2% target despite April’s extraordinary surge in price gains.
Even the bearish spike in equities bets -- reflected in the Cboe put-to-call ratio that tracks the volume of options tied to everything from single stocks to indexes -- may be a contrarian signal, according to Chris Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna International Group.
It was likely affected by a dropoff in call purchases among retail traders, he said, noting that the S&P 500 has posted a median two-week return of around 3% following the 10 highest put-call readings over the past 12 years.
Credit Traders Bet on Central Banks Keeping Nerve Amid Inflation
Yet rates markets aren’t ignoring inflation risks, which is underscored by the past month’s rise in breakeven rates, a market gauge of the inflation outlook derived from Treasury yields. The five-year rate, which is more influenced by the recent rebound in commodity prices, touched its highest level since 2005 before paring the move.
There are some lingering doubts that the Fed will be as tolerant of rising inflation as it has promised.
Eurodollars contracts are priced for roughly one 25-basis-point rate hike by the end of next year, and at least three by the end of 2023. The central bank’s latest guidance, from March, suggests policy makers see no increases over that whole period.

566,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2021 05:21AM ET</span>",Tesla says it supports standardisation of China auto industry,"BEIJING (Reuters) -U.S. electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc said via Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) on Wednesday that it supports standardisation of China auto industry.
Tesla was commenting on China's cyberspace administration's draft rules on auto data regulation, which was published on Wednesday.
The draft rules said automakers need to seek customer approval to collect data from driving and need to get permission from regulators when they need to provide important and private data to foreign entities. The cyberspace administration is seeking public opinions on the rules.

Automakers have been equipping more vehicles with cameras and sensors to capture images of a car’s surroundings. Control of use, sending and storage of these images is a fast-emerging challenge for the industry and regulators worldwide.
In March, Tesla came under scrutiny in China when the military banned its cars from entering its complexes, citing security concerns over vehicle cameras, sources told Reuters at the time.

Bitcoin plunged as much as 15%, sinking to as low as $46,045, before trimming the decline, after Musk said he was worried over the “rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions,” and suspended Tesla purchases with the asset, indicating he might favor other cryptocurrencies with much lower energy usage.
 Coinbase Global  Inc (NASDAQ:COIN), the operator of the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, fell 5.6% in U.S. premarket trading on low volume ahead of an earnings report due Thursday. Digital asset technology company Marathon Digital Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:MARA) fell 13%, as did peer Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT). Microstrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), which has put billions of dollars of its assets into Bitcoin, plunged 9.2% after market Wednesday, while Jack Dorsey’s  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ) also slipped.
In Asia,  Monex Group Inc  (T:8698), whose ownership of crypto exchange Coincheck Inc. had made it the second-best performing stock in Japan in 2021, dropped 11%. Nexon Co. (T:3659), which just last month became the first Japanese firm to make a significant bet with a $100 million purchase of the cryptocurrency, slumped 14%, the most since August 2019, though a poor growth outlook given at its earnings also weighed on sentiment.
In Europe, crypto-miner  Argo Blockchain  Plc (LON:ARB) slid 10%, blockchain technology firm On-Line Blockchain Plc lost 9.8% and crypto infrastructure group Northern Data AG (DE:NB2) dropped 15%.
Tesla Drops
Tesla’s own shares fell 1.8% in premarket trading, having already slumped about 30% since the company announced in February that it had invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin and signaled an intent to begin accepting the cryptocurrency as a form of payment. After last year’s huge rally, the stock has suffered from lofty trader expectations despite posting a record quarterly profit last month.
Musk said in his post that Tesla wouldn’t be selling any Bitcoin and aimed to use it for transactions once mining shifted to a more sustainable energy. “We believe it has a promising future,” he wrote, “but this cannot come at great cost to the environment.”
That puts Musk at odds with ARK Investment Management LLC’s Cathie Wood, who last month shared research that she said would “debunk the myth that Bitcoin mining” is bad for the environment. Wood’s ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK), which has been having a miserable month and has Coinbase as its ninth-largest holding, fell 1.3% premarket.
Musk’s move is a step in the wrong direction for Bitcoin bulls as well as for stock investors betting on the digital currency. Tesla’s disclosure in February added legitimacy to the cryptocurrency. It was the most visible catalyst during this year’s rally in the digital currency. Bitcoin was down 7.6% to $50,356 at 10:09 a.m. U.K. time.

Shares in the brand, known for its trench coats, check fabric and TB monogram, were down 8% at 0836 GMT, paring year-on-year gains to 42%.
Burberry said 2021-22 adjusted operating margins would be impacted by higher operating expenses as the pandemic recedes and increased investment to drive growth.
It forecast ""more meaningful"" margin accretion thereafter.
Burberry reported a 10% drop in sales for the year to March 27 to 2.34 billion pounds ($3.29 billion) hit by store closures and reduced tourism.
However, fourth-quarter comparable store sales increased 32% year on year, despite an average of 16% of stores still being closed.
It said full-price sales rose 63% in the quarter driven by mainland China, Korea and the United States.
Other big luxury groups such as Hermes,  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and LVMH are on course to put the COVID-19 crisis behind them, with first-quarter revenues already above pre-pandemic levels.
In March, Burberry faced calls for a consumer boycott in China over Xinjiang cotton.
Chief operating and chief financial officer Julie Brown told reporters the label was pleased with its performance in mainland China but declined to comment when asked if recent trading had suffered from any backlash to Western accusations of abuses in Xinjiang.
Taking full-year 2020 as the base year, Burberry expects revenue to grow in the medium term at ""a high, single-digit percentage"" compound annual growth rate at full-year 2021 constant exchange rates.
The company said this growth would be driven by full-price sales as the fashion company exits markdowns in mainline stores in full-year 2022. 
Burberry also said that the move to reduce markdowns would be a headwind against comparable store sales growth amounting to ""a mid-single digit percentage"" in the year.
Adjusted operating profit of 396 million pounds was above analysts' average forecast of 378 million but down 8% from 433 million in 2019-20.

The full-year dividend was reinstated at 2019 levels of 42.5 pence.

569,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2021 04:16AM ET</span>",Seven & i shares surge after news of ValueAct's stake build-up,"By Junko Fujita
TOKYO (Reuters) - Shares of Seven & i Holdings surged to a two-year high on Thursday after Reuters reported activist investor ValueAct Capital took a stake in the Japanese owner of the 7-Eleven chain, signalling a potential shake-up at the retail giant.
ValueAct amassed a 4.4% stake in Seven & i and believes the sum of its parts is worth much more than its current market value, the fund told investors in a letter seen by Reuters.
The hedge fund said the 7-Eleven business could be worth more than double what its parent is currently valued at if the company restructures itself to focus on the convenience stores or if 7-Eleven is spun out.
""I share the same opinion. Seven & i will be better off focusing on the capital-light convenience store business,"" said Oshadhi Kumarasiri, equity analyst at LightStream Research, publishing on the Smartkarma platform.
In a statement, Seven & i declined to comment on individual shareholder matters. It said it would continue to engage in dialogue with its shareholders.
In addition to 7-Eleven, arguably one of the world's best known convenience stores, Seven & i's businesses include department stores, supermarkets and financial services. Last year it spent $21 billion to buy Speedway convenience stores in North America.
Seven & i shares gained as much as 7.4% to their highest in more than two years on Thursday before closing up 5.0% compared to the broader Nikkei stock average's 2.5% fall.
After Thursday's gains, the company had a market value of about $39 billion, making ValueAct's stake worth about $1.7 billion. 
For a graphic on Seven & i shares:
https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gjnpwnjkxvw/image-1620869507510.png 
This is not the first time that Tokyo-headquartered Seven & i has caught the fancy of an activist investor. Five years ago, Daniel Loeb's Third Point (NYSE:SPNT) successfully engineered a management reshuffle at the company but the drastic restructuring it had suggested did not come about.
The situation in Japan, however, has changed considerably since then, with shareholder activism gaining momentum amid a government push for better corporate governance and higher returns to investors.
ValueAct, whose style is of collaborating with management by making suggestions instead of dictating terms to management and the board, said in the letter it has engaged with Seven & i's board directors and management and is optimistic that it can continue to build trust and alignment with the company. 

San Francisco-based ValueAct has had some notable success in Japan, where companies traditionally have been wary of activist investors. 
One of the fund's partners, Robert Hale, joined the board of Olympus Corp in 2019. Shares in the maker of endoscopes have nearly trebled since early 2019.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's COVID-19 vaccine chief has blamed a rigid drug approval system for a slow inoculation campaign that is relying on only one approved shot, as a fourth wave of infections raises worries amid preparations for the Summer Olympics.
Taro Kono, the minister in charge of vaccines, took responsibility for the public frustration with the vaccine distributed system but also said the approval process was a disadvantage in an emergency.
""Even though we are in a state of crisis, we're still using the same rules to approve vaccines that we do under normal times,"" Kono said in a TBS television interview broadcast on Wednesday.
""In the wake of this corona situation, the administration needs to change.""
The government aims to inoculate most of its 36 million people over the age of 65 by the end of July. The Olympics, postponed last year as the virus was spreading around the world, are due to begin on July 23.
To reach that vaccination target, the government hopes to deliver about 1 million shots a day, about three times faster than the current pace.
From early in the crisis, the government has said it would not skip regulatory steps to ensure the safety and efficacy of vaccines. That means domestic clinical trials and reviews taking several months to complete.
Some other countries have introduced emergency approvals to deploy vaccines faster.
Japan approved the vaccine developed by  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), in mid-February, two months later than in the United States. 
The delay, along with a host of logistical problems, has meant Japan has inoculated just 2.9% of its population, the lowest rate among wealthy countries.
Pfizer started its Japan trial in October, recruiting 160 volunteers to take its vaccine. AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) PLC, which is still being considered by domestic regulators, started its vaccine trial earlier with 256 subjects.
But trials involving such small numbers of people are ""really meaningless"", said Takahiro Kinoshita, a Japanese physician and researcher based in Boston. 
Global trials involve enough Asian subjects to ensure safety in their genotype, Kinoshita said.
Japan's trials, lengthy reviews and slow rollouts stem from public fears about vaccines that have undermined previous inoculation campaigns for HPV and other diseases.
""Everything is connected to vaccine hesitancy behaviour,"" he said.

The health ministry and the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, Japan's main drug regulator, did not immediately respond when contacted for comment on Kono's remarks.
About 75% of Japanese are dissatisfied with the vaccine rollout and Japan had the lowest rates of approval of government handling of the pandemic among six major economies in a survey by global consultancy Kekst CNC released on Wednesday.

By Mathieu Rosemain
PARIS (Reuters) - French media giant Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) said on Wednesday that the equity of its most prized asset, Universal Music Group, was worth 33 billion euros ($40 billion), or more than the market value of the parent company.
In documents released ahead of Vivendi's general meeting scheduled in June, the group went into the details of the prepared listing of Universal, which will see the group controlled by billionaire Vincent Bollore distribute 60% of Universal's capital to its current shareholders.
The transaction is aimed at extracting the most value from Universal, the world's biggest music label and home to singers such as Lady Gaga and Taylor Swift, as the music industry rebounds from a long downturn thanks to streaming revenues, driven by music platforms Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) and the like.
Universal's 33 billion-euro valuation was determined by accounting firms PwC and EY. This means the 60% stake distributed to Vivendi's shareholders is worth 19.8 billion euros. 
Universal's parent company has a market value of 32 billion euros, according to Refinitiv data. 
At the end of the IPO process, Universal's three biggest shareholders would be Vivendi (20%), the Tencent-led consortium (20%) and Bollore (16%).
In its documents, Vivendi said that Universal was drawing interest from potential investors and that it could sell some of its 20% stake to a ""strategic partner"" ahead of the distribution of Universal's shares. It added that its intention was to keep at least a 10% stake in the company for a long period of time.
There will be about 1.1 billion Universal shares distributed to Vivendi's shareholders, according to the documents. Dividing the valuation corresponding to 60% of Universal by the exact number of shares gives a price per Universal share of 18.2 euros.
The French conglomerate outlined plans in February to distribute 60% of Universal's capital to its current shareholders via a listing in Amsterdam, ending years of questions about Bollore's will to list the asset, whose operational earnings represent more than half of the all group.

Vivendi also outlined the calendar of Universal's initial public offering (IPO), setting a Sept. 27 deadline for the listing of the shares in Amsterdam.
The Paris-based group also disclosed the first-quarter financial earnings of Universal. Universal generated earnings before interest and income taxes (EBIT) of 322 million euros over the first three months of the year, up from 248 million euros the year before.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australian takeover target Crown Resorts has committed to end international gambling tours, or ""junket"" operations, and go cashless in its casinos, the gaming regulator in the country's biggest state said on Thursday. 
After being deemed unsuitable for a gambling licence in New South Wales in February, when an inquiry found Crown had enabled money laundering on its premises, the Melbourne-based casino operator has emerged as the target of a bidding war. 
Star Entertainment Group proposed an all-stock buyout this week of its larger rival Crown that values it at A$9 billion ($6.96 billion), taking on private equity giants Blackstone and Oaktree Capital Group for control of the troubled company.
The New South Wales Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority (ILGA), which would need to approve any potential merger, said on Thursday it had held talks with Star, which had also agreed to end junket tours.
The Sydney-based casino suitor had also agreed to work with the authority in moving towards cashless gaming, using a card linked to identity and to a recognised financial institution, it added. 
""Any changes to Crown's ownership structure, including takeover or merger proposals, require the authority to consider a range of issues,"" the regulator's chairman, Philip Crawford, said. 
These cover aspects such as how a merged entity would operate, and the extent to which any existing agreements with Crown would need to be reviewed, he added.
In a stock exchange filing, Crown said its pact with the regulator over its Sydney property provided for the firm to contribute A$12.5 million as the cost of the inquiry, along with an annual casino supervisory fee of A$5 million for two years. 
It will consult the regulator over any supervisory fee from 2023 onwards, it added.
""While we recognise we have more work to do, we welcome ILGA's indication today that Crown's reform implementation is well advanced towards suitability to operate gaming at Crown Sydney,"" the firm's executive chairman, Helen Coonan, said.
Star's approach this week follows buyout giant Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) upping its all-cash indicative bid to A$8.4 billion, and Oaktree's proposal to bankroll a A$3 billion buyback of Crown's founder's stake to remove a regulatory concern.

The regulator had also struck a pact with CPH, a vehicle owned by founder and 37% owner James Packer, to tackle issues regarding influence and control, it added, without giving details.

Investing.com – Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) Group Corp. (T:9984) shares took a tumble on Thursday after the Japanese conglomerate decided against extending its buyback program. The decision also raised concerns about frothy portfolio valuations that outweighed the company’s recent record earnings.
Shares were down 6.55% to JPY8579 ($78.6) by 12:50 AM (4:50 AM GMT), after falling up to 8% earlier in the session.
SoftBank completed a JPY2.5 trillion ($22.9 billion) buyback on Wednesday, although Chief Executive Masayoshi Son said further repurchases could be possible.
SoftBank reported record profit after its portfolio company, South Korean e-commerce firm Coupang Inc. (NYSE:CPNG), listed on the New York Stock Exchange in March 2021. However, shares of investments including Coupang and DoorDash Inc. (NYSE:DASH) have since plummeted thanks to a recent tech selloff, and top asset  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. (HK:9988) is currently caught in a regulatory crackdown in China.
""Without the buyback, SoftBank's stock price is likely to reflect the performance of its listed investments,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Atul Goyal said in a note, adding he was ""extremely surprised"" SoftBank did not extend the program.
Thursday’s slide in SoftBank shares extends the week's decline to 17% and concerns those valuations are too high amid record-low interest rates persist.
Coupang, the largest asset in the Softbank Vision Fund portfolio, is expensive compared to peers and ""despite the intense sell-off there is no valuation driven bottom in sight,"" LightStream Research analyst Mio Kato wrote on the Smartkarma platform.
Doordash and Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) are ""also unsustainably valued,"" Kato added, due to both companies’ loss-making business models and Uber’s worsening debt position.
However, Softbank is now looking ahead to a robust pipeline of startups preparing to list. The company’s Vision Fund 2, which invests smaller amounts than its first fund, has completed or approved investments in almost 100 startups."

LONDON (Reuters) - India's devastating COVID-19 crisis is making investors question more than ever whether after years of debt accumulation and patchy progress on reforms, a country touted as a future economic superpower still deserves its 'investment grade' status.
A spate of downgrades last year had already left India's investment grade credit ratings hanging by a thread and the severity of the current virus wave is making the main agencies, S&P, Moody's (NYSE:MCO) and Fitch agitated again.
All three firms have either cut - or warned they could cut - the country's growth forecasts in recent weeks and that government debt as a share of GDP will jump to a record 90% this year.
In that respect though, the world's second most populous country has long been an anomaly. 
The median debt level for countries Fitch has in the BBB bracket - India is BBB- - and on a downgrade warning with both Fitch and Moody's - is currently around 55% and only 70% even for those languishing at the lowest depths of 'junk' grade.
With COVID-19 pushing up debt almost everywhere and the ratings firms signalling they will wait for this latest wave to ease before any judgements, investors who buy rating-sensitive assets like bonds are making their own calls.
""We still see India as investment grade,"" said  NN  (NASDAQ:NNBR) Investment Partners' head of Asian Debt, Joep Huntjens, who thinks the country's economy will bounce back quickly. ""But we do think there is at least a 50/50 chance that at least one rating agency downgrades, probably next year"". 
With calls growing for another national lockdown to tackle the new virus surge, plenty of others are wary too.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) says rating agencies are making ""a leap of faith"" by holding fire at the moment. M&G's Eldar Vakhitov says his firm's models have been flagging a downgrade, while UBS points out India will soon have the third highest debt level among big emerging markets after junk-rated Brazil and Argentina.
UBS analysts also estimate India needs to grow at least 10% a year for public debt to stabilise and come down. It hasn't got anywhere near that since 1988, World Bank data shows. Last year's full lockdown saw the economy contract 24% in the first quarter and Moody's said this week it expects growth to settle at around 6% longer term.
""We do see the risk that it (a downgrade) can definitely happen,"" said UBS's head of emerging market strategy Manik Narain. ""It seems more a question of when rather than if"". 
For a graphic on India's sovereign credit rating:
https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/nmovagwdmva/Pasted%20image%201620853423586.png 
ANOTHER BRIC TO FALL? 
Neither India's finance ministry nor its central bank responded to requests to discuss the risk of a downgrade but, as Brazil and South Africa have experienced, becoming a ‘fallen angel’ - as a demotion to junk is known in rating agency parlance - can set off a wave of problems. 
It automatically excludes government or corporate bonds from certain high-profile investment indexes, which means conservative funds - active managers as well as passive “trackers” - sell out, aggravating the situation. 
India's government debt is not yet in most of those indexes, so the big issue will be the roughly $40 billion to $45 billion worth of investment grade corporate debt that is also likely to get cut. 
NN's Huntjens thinks around 90% of Indian IG corporates would be hit and while giants like Reliance might be spared, India's 7.4% share of JPMorgan's Asia Investment Grade Corporates Index means there would be plenty of selling. 
For a graphic on India's weight in the JPMorgan CEMBI corporate bond index:
https://graphics.reuters.com/INDIA-CORPORATES/jznvnrzyyvl/chart.png 
CHASTENING
If a cut does come, it wouldn't be the first time India has lost investment grade status. It was first stripped in 1991 just a year after getting its initial S&P rating as a balance of payments crisis hit. 
A repeat now though would be a chastening moment for its nationalist leader Narendra Modi who rallies supporters on promises to advance India on the world stage and compete with the likes of China. 
While it has built up a healthy stock of currency reserves, its huge population of 1.4 billion means it still has the lowest prosperity level of any investment grade country when measured by GDP per capita of $2,164. China's figure is nearly $13,000. 
Subhash Chandra Garg, India's former economic affairs secretary, acknowledges the government's double-digit deficit and overall debt position are ""bad"", but he doesn't think the ratings firms will cut again.
""A debt-to-GDP ratio of 90% is certainly a matter of great concern and these things cannot go on,"" Garg said. ""But the fundamental view about India is that it is not a basket case, it is a strong economy.""
""In the end the debt levels need to come down and that can only happen if growth remains strong,"" NN's Huntjens added. ""And it can't just be based on (government)stimulus because then the debt just rises even higher"".

TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp shares tumbled 8% in morning trade on Thursday after the conglomerate did not extend its buyback programme, removing support for the stock as concern over frothy portfolio valuations outweighed record earnings. 
SoftBank completed a 2.5 trillion yen ($22.8 billion) buyback on Wednesday, though Chief Executive Masayoshi Son said further repurchases remain an option. 
""If we think it's beneficial to buy back shares we will,"" Son told reporters, adding that investment opportunities and any significant underperformance of the group's shares would be taken into account. 
SoftBank reported record profit following the listing of e-commerce firm Coupang Inc, but shares of many investments have since been caught in a tech sell-off while top asset  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd has been hit by a regulatory crackdown. 
""Without the buyback, SoftBank's stock price is likely to reflect the performance of its listed investments,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Atul Goyal wrote in a client note. He said he was ""extremely surprised"" SoftBank did not extend the programme. 
The slide in SoftBank shares extends this week's decline to 17%, with market observers continuing to express concern that valuations are too high amid rock bottom interest rates. 
Coupang is expensive compared to peers and ""despite the intense sell-off there is no valuation driven bottom in sight,"" LightStream Research analyst Mio Kato wrote on the Smartkarma platform. 
Doordash Inc and Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) are ""also unsustainably valued,"" Kato added, citing their money losing business models and Uber's worsening debt position. 
SoftBank executives point to a robust pipeline of startups preparing to list. 

Vision Fund 2, which is cutting smaller cheques than the first fund, has completed or approved investments in almost 100 startups. 
Stakes in companies with valuations discounted during the COVID-19 pandemic have not been marked up despite stabilising earnings, offering upside in future quarters, said a person familiar with the matter speaking on condition of anonymity.

PIRC urged opposition to Wirth because of the company's combined board chairman and CEO roles. The No. 2 U.S. oil producer also faces several climate and governance proposals that London-based PIRC said it supports.
It has pledged to limit the pace of growth of its carbon emissions that contribute to climate change, but has not set longer-term targets to achieve net zero as many European rivals have done.
PIRC is the first of the major proxy advisory firms to comment ahead of the company's May 26 shareholder meeting. 
Chevron directors recognize the importance of independent oversight and have ""structures and practices to enhance such oversight,"" spokesman Sean Comey said, including selecting a lead director from among themselves when the CEO is selected as chairman. 
""The role of the lead director is highly empowered,"" Comey said.

PIRC recommended votes in favor of shareholder resolutions that include asking the company to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of its products, report on how net zero scenarios would impact business, report more information on lobbying, become a public benefit corporation and split the board chairman and CEO roles after the next chief executive transition.
The company is recommending that its investors vote against the shareholder proposals, including the one for an independent board chair.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Wednesday said Antonio García Martínez, a former  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) product manager who joined Apple recently to work in its advertising business, is no longer with the company.
García Martínez, who came to Silicon Valley after a stint on Wall Street, wrote the 2016 book ""Chaos Monkeys"" about his time in the technology industry. He joined Apple as a product engineer in Apple's advertising platform business in April, according to his LinkedIn page. 
Technology news publication The Verge reported on Wednesday that more than 2,000 Apple employees https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432909/apple-petition-hiring-antonio-garcia-martinez-chaos-monkeys-facebook had signed an internal petition sent to the company's leaders with concerns about what the petition writers described as sexist and racist views in the book and whether Apple had followed its own rules in hiring García Martínez.
Apple said García Martínez is no longer at the company but gave no further details.

""At Apple, we have always strived to create an inclusive, welcoming workplace where everyone is respected and accepted. Behavior that demeans or discriminates against people for who they are has no place here,"" the company said in a statement.
García Martínez did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside normal business hours.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were down Thursday morning, continuing a downward trend as bond yields rose over concerns that the bigger-than-expected increase in U.S. consumer prices could impact the economic recovery from COVID-19.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.90% by 10:16 PM ET (2:16 AM GMT). March’s current account n.s.a., released earlier in the day, was a disappointing JPY2.650 trillion.
South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.36% and in Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.34%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 1.16%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.77% and the Shenzhen Component was down 0.78%.
Investors digested Wednesday’s U.S. inflation report, which said the Core Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.9% month-on-month in April, much higher than the 0.3% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com. The CPI also grew 0.8% month-on-month and 4.2% year-on-year.
With U.S. consumer prices at their highest levels since 2009, the debate on whether inflation is high enough to force a change in the U.S. Federal Reserve’s current dovish policy sooner than expected is likely to continue.
Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said he was surprised by the jump in prices but expected it to be largely transitory.
Some investors suggested that the soonest that the Fed would act is at its June meeting.
“It likely would take a very strong May jobs report, with sizable upward revisions to March and especially April, to get the Fed to start a discussion about tapering at its June meeting... we continue to expect the Fed to begin scaling back its pace of asset purchases early next year,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) economist Michael S. Hanson told Reuters.
Other investors argued that a loss of investor confidence could trigger a Fed reaction sooner than Hanson suggests.
“The concern is that the markets have lost a little bit of confidence that the Fed has control of inflation; I don’t think it’s necessarily the level, I think it’s the concern over ‘is the Fed going to wait too long to address the inflation question... I am not sure the market is extremely comfortable with that at this point,” Crossmark Global Investments chief market strategist Victoria Fernandez told Bloomberg.
The U.S. will release its April producer price index later in the day.
Treasury yields steadied on Thursday, giving up some of their gains from the previous session after an auction for benchmark 10-year notes saw strong demand.
Meanwhile, bitcoin continued its fall after Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk tweeted that the company has suspended vehicle purchases using the cryptocurrency over environmental concerns. The tweet also added that Tesla will not be selling any bitcoin."

The ""Charge on Innovation Challenge"", run by BHP Group (NYSE:BHP), Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) and Vale S.A. with Australian mining services body Austmine, is looking for fast-charging concepts that would deliver around 400 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity to truck fleets at remote mine sites.
The mining industry is looking to move its diesel powered truck fleets to electric to cut emissions. But one of the issues is that current stationary charging systems require lots of time to charge large trucks, which would impact productivity, they said in a joint statement. 
Diesel is a major contributor to miners' carbon emissions. 
“We expect the Challenge will stimulate innovative ideas, some of which could be immediately applied to existing diesel-electric equipment and help fast-track implementation of longer-term solutions,"" said President of BHP Minerals Australia Edgar Basto. 
Participants would need to come up with a solution that would charge and propel the 220 tonne trucks within the truck’s haul cycle which consists of load, travel, dump, return and queue. 
Expressions of interest will be open from May 18, and short listed candidates are expected to pitch their concepts later during this calendar year.
The group is also inviting other miners to join the competition as ""patrons"" which would allow them to influence the commercialisation of mine charging concepts that promote standard and interoperable approaches.

“Partnerships and collaborations across a diverse range of sectors can drive significant technological change,"" Rio Tinto Group Executive Safety, Technical and Projects Mark Davies said in the statement.
""This is an important, industry-wide approach that has potential to create new jobs and opportunities for suppliers, both globally and locally.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street closed lower on Wednesday with the S&P suffering its biggest one-day percentage drop since February, as inflation data fueled concerns over whether interest rate hikes from the Fed could happen sooner than anticipated.
All three major U.S. stock indexes ended the session deep in the red following the Labor Department's April consumer prices report, which showed the biggest rise in nearly 12 years.
The report was hotly anticipated by market participants who have grown increasingly worried over whether current price jumps will defy the U.S. Federal Reserve's reassurances by morphing into long-term inflation.
But pent-up demand from consumers flush with stimulus and savings is colliding with a supply drought, sending commodity prices spiking, while a labor shortage drives wages higher. 
""The topic on everyone's mind is obviously inflation,"" said Matthew Keator, managing partner in the Keator Group, a wealth management firm in Lenox, Massachusetts. ""It's something the (Fed) has been looking for and they're finally getting their wish.""
""The question is how long will its fires run hot before starting to simmer?""
That concern is shared by Stuart Cole, head macro economist at Equiti Capital in London.
""Going forward, the big question is just how long can the Fed maintain its dovish stance in opposition to the markets,"" Cole said. ""Particularly if companies begin raising wages to encourage unemployed labor back into the workforce, in turn driving a large hole in the Fed’s transitory inflation argument.""
Core consumer prices (CPI), which exclude volatile food and energy items, grew at 3% year-on-year, shooting above the central bank's average annual 2% inflation growth target.

""The CPI number being stronger than expected has led to further weakness in tech stocks,"" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A U.S. Senate committee voted 24-4 to pass a compromise measure authorizing more than $110 billion for basic and advanced technology research over five years in the face of rising competitive pressure from China.
The ""Endless Frontier"" act would authorize most of the money, $100 billion, over five years to invest in basic and advanced research, commercialization, and education and training programs in key technology areas, including artificial intelligence, semiconductors, quantum computing, advanced communications, biotechnology and advanced energy.
The bill must still be approved by the full U.S. Senate and the U.S. House is working on a similar effort.
""This legislation will allow the United States to out-compete countries like China, create more good-paying American jobs and help improve our country's economic and national security,"" said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, who sponsored the bill along with Senator Todd Young, a Republican from Indiana. 
Schumer said in a statement after the vote that he intended for the full Senate to ""consider and finish"" the legislation before the end of the month, and that he expected strong bipartisan support.
Though there is broad consensus to increase funding for U.S. innovation, concerns are mounting among some Republicans that the bill lacks tough rules to prevent U.S. entities that benefit from the massive spending package from later sending research and development overseas, including potentially to China. 
Senator Marco Rubio said in a speech on the Senate floor on Tuesday that the legislation must prohibit American money from being invested in China's military companies.
One Republican House aide told Reuters that the ""lack of stringent guard rails"" was counter to the objective of the bill.
""The fundamental concern with this bill as currently written is that it basically promotes taxpayer funded intellectual property, innovation, and research and development that could go into the hands of entities affiliated with or controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, or to China in general,"" the aide said.
Senate Democrats say they are confident sufficient safeguards will be added before it is finished. 
The measure would also authorize another $10 billion to designate at least 10 regional technology hubs and create a supply chain crisis-response program to address issues like the shortfall in semiconductor chips harming auto production.
The bill does not include legislation to allow automakers to deploy tens of thousands of self-driving vehicles on U.S. roads despite a push by some lawmakers.

The self-driving effort came under criticism from unions and a plaintiff lawyer group.
Senator Gary Peters on Wednesday won approval for an amendment to establish a $2 billion supplemental financial assistance program at the Commerce Department to support production of mature semiconductor chips used by automakers and others.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The head of the Federal Aviation Administration said on Wednesday the agency is going to mandate strengthening a key engine part on Boeing (NYSE:BA) 777-200 planes equipped with Pratt & Whitney (PW) engines like the one involved in an emergency landing in February.
FAA Administrator Steve Dickson told a U.S. House committee that the agency is ""requiring the manufacturers to address strengthen(ing) the cowling.""
The agency said in a separate statement the ""exact timing"" of the new requirements and expected airworthiness directive ""will depend on the completion of design and engineering work and will be approved by the FAA.""
He also said the agency was working with  Boeing Co  and PW to ensure ""the structure around the engine, the cowling and the inlet area, does not damage the aircraft structure.""
A United Airlines 777 PW4000 engine failed shortly after takeoff from Denver on Feb. 20, showering debris over nearby cities, but no one was injured and the plane safely returned to the airport.
The FAA in February ordered immediate inspections of 777 planes with PW4000 engines before further flights, after the National Transportation Safety Board found a cracked fan blade on the United engine was consistent with metal fatigue.
Boeing said on Wednesday it was continuing to work with the FAA on ""potential design improvements"" for the ""inlet and fan cowlings,"" adding that the ""work is exacting and time consuming.""
United, which is the only U.S. operator of 777s with the PW4000 engine and has 52 of those planes, is working to resume flights.
United Chief Operations Officer Jon Roitman said in April the airline had a ""really productive collaboration with Pratt, Boeing and the FAA. ... We look forward to getting that aircraft back to safe operations in the future.""
United declined to comment on Dickson's remarks on Wednesday.
Also in April, Japan Airlines said it had retired its fleet of 13 Boeing Co 777s with PW4000 engines a year earlier than planned, having suspended operations in February.

The Japanese carrier had an incident of its own with the PW4000 engines in December, when a malfunction forced a Tokyo-bound JAL 777 to return to Naha airport in Okinawa.
The engines are on only a small number of older 777s operated by JAL, United, ANA Holdings Inc, Korean Air Lines Co Ltd, Asiana Airlines Inc and Jin Air Co Ltd.

(Reuters) -Online second-hand apparel retailer ThredUp Inc on Wednesday posted a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss in its first report as a public company and warned of clothing budgets remaining constrained even as the U.S. economy reopens. 
The company's shares tumbled 10% in extended trading as investors shrugged off a revenue beat and focused on surging costs.
The stock has gained more than 43% since the late-March debut as investors bet on a sharp growth fueled by younger customers increasingly looking past the stigma of second-hand products and rooting for sustainability.
To support that growth, ThredUp is spending rapidly on new distribution centers, marketing and automation. 
Total operating expenses jumped 18.5% to $54.4 million in the first quarter and the company said it does not expect to generate positive cash flow in the near term as it re-invests in its expansion. 
""We have confidence that things are getting better but you still have very high unemployment rates with women making up a disproportionate share of the job losses, so I don't think the recovery is evenly distributed,"" Founder and Chief Executive Officer James Reinhart told Reuters. 
""The reality is we're still going to have the virus impact consumer spending trends for some time.""
Reinhart added the third quarter is when the company, which sells only women and kids products, expects things to start to normalize. 
ThredUp's net loss widened to $16.2 million in the three months ended March, from $13.2 million a year earlier. 
On a pro-forma basis, the company lost 17 cents per share, bigger than the 16 cents loss analysts expected, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
ThredUp also forecast second-quarter revenue of $53 million to $55 million, above estimates of $48.8 million. 
Meanwhile, shares of rival Poshmark Inc fell about 12% on Wednesday after it forecast second-quarter revenue largely below estimates.

(Reuters) -Connected speaker maker Sonos (NASDAQ:SONO) Inc on Wednesday raised its annual sales forecast above Wall Street expectations as the company said it believes it can beat a global chip shortage to keep shipping products, sending shares up as much as 14%.
In an interview with Reuters, CEO Patrick Spence said Sonos has direct relationships with its chip suppliers and started ramping up its orders for semiconductors last year. He said Sonos believes it can work through supply shortages to meet the new forecast and ship its Roam portable speaker. 
“We feel like we’re mitigating and got ahead of it as much as anyone could have,” Spence told Reuters. ""We've shown (chipmakers) that this is real demand and we're turning inventory around super quickly."" 
The Santa Barbara, California-based company forecast fiscal 2021 sales at a midpoint of $1.65 billion, above its prior forecast of $1.55 billion and above analyst expectations of $1.56 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. For the company's fiscal second quarter ended April 3, the company said sales were $332.9 million, up 90% from the prior year, and adjusted profits were 31 cents per share, versus a loss of 34 cents per share a year earlier.
Analysts had expected fiscal second-quarter sales of $248.41 million and an adjusted loss of 22 cents per share, according to Refinitiv data. 
Sonos faced competitive pressure when major technology firms such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) released smart speakers, some of which targeted Sonos' core market of premium-priced products focused on audio-quality.
In recent months, both Apple and Google have discontinued their largest, highest-priced smart speakers to focus on smaller, cheaper speakers that showcased their voice-assistants and smart home features. Sonos has stuck to a focus on audio quality and being a neutral player, Spence said.
""Their strategic intent in getting into the space is different than ours,"" Spence said. ""We're the only ones across those big tech companies who support all of the music services, and we also do it for voice assistants.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. stocks suffered the biggest slump in at least 11 weeks on Wednesday and benchmark Treasury yields jumped after data showed consumer prices in April unexpectedly rose by the highest level in nearly 12 years, prompting bets on earlier interest rate hikes.
A 0.8% jump in the U.S. consumer price index - outpacing a 0.2% forecast - boosted the U.S. dollar as expectations of rising real interest rates burnished the currency's appeal.
The gyrations in financial markets underscored concerns among some investors that the Federal Reserve could be wrong in its prediction that inflation pressures in the United States are temporary, and that the central bank may have to raise rates sooner than it expects.
The prospect of tighter monetary policy knocked shares lower and the stock market steadily extended losses through the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 2%, the S&P 500 dropped 2.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 2.7%. (N)
For the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite Index, Wednesday's tumble was the biggest fall in a single day since Feb. 25, while the Dow's decline was the sharpest in a day since Jan 29.
Richard Clarida, vice chair of the Federal Reserve, acknowledged on Wednesday that the latest inflation report was the second piece of data in a week to catch the central bank off-guard, describing it as the ""biggest miss in history.""
Yet Clarida maintained the Federal Reserve's dovish note, saying it will be ""some time"" before the U.S. economy is sufficiently healed for the central bank to consider pulling back its crisis-level of support.
Some investors continued to challenge the Federal Reserve's assessment, however.
""We’ve been warning about the prospect of higher for longer inflation in the United States for many months, but even we hadn’t predicted this,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING Group (NYSE:ING).
""We increasingly doubt the Fed’s position that this is transitory and think they will end up hiking rates far sooner than 2024.""
Some money market investors seemed to agree. Eurodollar futures contracts expiring in December on Wednesday priced in a 25-basis-point rate hike by the end of next year, compared with 22 basis points before the inflation report.
DOLLAR GAINS
Weakness on Wall Street mirrored stock market losses in Asia, as surging commodity prices stoked inflation concerns. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had slumped 0.95% overnight, after hitting its lowest level since March 26.
European shares fared better. London's blue-chip FTSE 100 rebounded 0.8% as buoyant corporate earnings and a better-than-expected economic growth report bolstered hopes about a sharp recovery from the pandemic-driven recession. 
In the United States, the surprisingly strong inflation data lifted Treasury yields. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield jumped to 1.6952%, its biggest rise in a day since March 18, and the two-year Treasury yield also rose to stand at 0.1668%. [US/] 
In keeping with expectations of rising price pressures as the U.S. economy recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, the yield curve steepened, and the spread between two- and 10-year Treasury yields widened to 152.8 basis points.
The dollar, which could benefit from rising real interest rates, gained after wobbling briefly earlier in the day.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six major currencies, rose 0.65% to 90.795.
A stronger dollar dented the euro, which slid 0.6% to $1.2070.

594,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2021 05:32PM ET</span>","U.S. CDC finds more clotting cases after J&J vaccine, sees causal link","By Michael Erman and Julie Steenhuysen
CHICAGO (Reuters) -The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Wednesday it had found more cases of potentially life-threatening blood clotting among people who received the Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) COVID-19 vaccine and sees a ""plausible causal association.""
The CDC said in a presentation the agency has now identified 28 cases of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) among the more than 8.7 million people who had received the J&J vaccine. TTS involves blood clots accompanied by a low level of platelets - the cells in the blood that help it to clot.
So far, three of the 28 have died. Previously, as of April 25, the CDC had reported 17 cases of clotting among nearly 8 million people given vaccines.
The benefits of the vaccine still outweigh the risk and no updates to vaccine policy are needed at this time, CDC official Dr. Sara Oliver said.
She was speaking at a meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices or ACIP, which advises the U.S. CDC.
ACIP recommended on April 23 that the U.S. lift a 10-day pause on the J&J vaccinations imposed to review safety data on the clotting issue.
The CDC said on Wednesday the events appear similar to what is being observed following administration of the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) COVID-19 vaccine in Europe.
Both vaccines are based on a new technology using adenoviruses, which cause the common cold, that have been modified to essentially render them harmless. The viruses are used to carry instructions into the body to make specific coronavirus proteins, priming the immune system to make antibodies that fight off the actual virus.
Scientists are working to find the potential mechanism that would explain the blood clots. A leading hypothesis appears to be that the vaccines are triggering a rare immune response that could be related to these viral vectors.
The syndrome does not appear to be associated with either of the COVID-19 vaccines produce by  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SA or  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc.
Most of the cases were among women aged 18 to 49, the CDC said, with rates among women aged 30-39 at 12.4 cases per million and those aged 40-49 at 9.4 cases per million.
Only six of the clotting events identified were in men.

Symptoms typically occur several days after vaccination to up to 2 weeks.
ACIP member Dr. Sarah Long, professor of pediatrics at Drexel University College of Medicine said she was very concerned about the CDC's decision to not add any additional restrictions on the J&J vaccine. Dr. Long said she believed that younger women should be informed of the risks and give consent before receiving their shot.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Florida private equity manager has been indicted on charges he lied about his investors in order to obtain a $95 million bank loan for his $500 million fund, federal prosecutors in Manhattan said on Wednesday.
Elliot Smerling, 52, of Lake Worth, Florida, was charged with wire fraud and bank fraud, each carrying a maximum 30-year prison term, as well as aggravated identity theft.
The indictment came after Silicon Valley Bank sued Smerling on March 24, saying he fraudulently obtained the loan after saying he had backing from prominent investors like billionaire hedge fund manager and New York Mets owner Steven Cohen.
David Kubiliun, a lawyer for Smerling, declined to comment.
According to court papers, Smerling, a principal at JES Global Capital, falsely claimed in his loan application that New York University had agreed to invest $45 million with him, while an unnamed investment manager would invest $40 million.
Prosecutors said Smerling also submitted a forged audit letter and falsified bank records for a wire transfer.
Silicon Valley Bank, based in Santa Clara, California, said Smerling drew the $95 million from a $150 million credit line it provided, and had yet to repay $80 million.
It said Smerling obtained the credit line after providing subscription agreements from investors who had purportedly committed $500 million to his fund, but that the documents were inauthentic, inaccurate or forged.
Among the alleged investors were three banks and endowment funds for NYU and the University of Miami, as well as Cohen, Silicon Valley Bank said in its civil complaint.
Smerling was arrested in February, and a federal judge in West Palm Beach, Florida on March 3 ordered him jailed.
The judge said Smerling had ""significant assets"" including two Florida homes and luxury vehicles from Audi, Cadillac, Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), Mercedes-Benz and Porsche, among others.
He also said Smerling's wife was a Brazilian-U.S. citizen, and that if Smerling fled to Brazil there would be no viable way to extradite him.
The criminal case is U.S. v Smerling, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 21-mj-02223. The bank case is Silicon Valley Bank v. JES Global Capital GP III et al in the same court, No. 21-02552.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The National Highway Traffic Safety Agency (NHTSA) said on Wednesday it is opening a safety probe into a fatal May 5 Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) crash in California amid growing concerns about the automaker's driver assistance systems.
A Tesla crashed into an overturned truck on a highway near Fontana, California, killing the Tesla's driver and injuring the truck driver and a motorist who had stopped to help him, the California Highway Patrol said.
The highway patrol report did not say whether the Tesla was operating on Autopilot, its semi-autonomous driving system, when the crash occurred. The Mack truck had crashed and overturned five minutes earlier, blocking two lanes of the highway, the report said.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

NHTSA said it previously had opened 28 special investigations into Tesla crashes, with 24 pending.
Police in Texas last month said they believed an April 17 fatal crash near Houston occurred with no one in the driver's seat. A preliminary government report Monday said footage from the owner’s home security cameras showed the owner entering the driver’s seat and the passenger entering the front passenger seat.

598,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2021 04:46PM ET</span>",Traders not betting on a quick U.S. market rebound as tech stocks tumble,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Traders have been placing more bearish bets on equity derivatives in recent days, data showed on Wednesday, indicating less confidence in U.S. stocks rebounding from a sharp sell-off which has particularly hit high-flying tech names.
Investors' tendency to look past minor wobbles in stocks as the S&P 500 rallied about 90% over the past year or so has been a key feature of the equity market since it rebounded from March 2020 pandemic lows and has helped make market pullbacks shallow and brief. That, however, may be changing.
On Wednesday, Wall Street's major indexes extended their decline from earlier this week after stronger-than-expected inflation data stoked worries of tighter monetary policy to combat what many investors fear could be a prolonged period of inflation. The S&P 500 Index was down 1.7%, while the Nasdaq Composite was 2.3% lower.
The tech index is down more than 7% from its recent high. 
Rather than positioning for a quick rebound, as they have typically done in recent past, traders in the options market are laser-focused on defensive plays.
""The really irrationally bullish equity options traders that I have been warning about for a long time have finally gone away,"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for the Schwab Center for Financial Research.
Options market measures, including skew - a gauge of demand for upside vs downside - show investors extremely concerned about further weakness for U.S. stocks.
There are few takers for upside bets in equity index options even as defensive options remain in high demand, Charlie McElligott, managing director, cross-asset macro strategy at Nomura, said in a note. 
For S&P 500 options, the 30-day implied-volatility skew is higher than it has been 87% of the time over the past 52 weeks, data from options analytics firm trade alert showed. 
On Tuesday, the trading in S&P puts - contracts often used for bearish bets - outpaced that in calls - options used for bullish wagers - by a margin of 2-to-1, the highest this measure has been since February. The ratio was similarly high on Wednesday. 
The elevated ratio was likely due to less retail call buying as well as more put trading, Susquehanna International Group’s Chris Murphy said.
Meanwhile, the Cboe Volatility Index an options market gauge of expectations for near-term volatility - jumped to a two-month high of 26.96 on Wednesday, highlighting investors' jangled nerves.

The VVIX Index, which measures the cost of hedging with VIX options, jumped as high as 145.5 on Wednesday. 
The VVIX being north of 120 points to a market that is ""wound really tight,"" Nomura's McElligott said.

(Reuters) - Boss Elon Musk said Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc is tweaking its self-driving software to eliminate a phantom braking problem and may release a significantly improved version within the next couple of months. 
Tesla shares were down 4.4% at $589.89 in late afternoon, extending falls after the U.S. safety regulator said it has launched a probe into a fatal crash near Fontana, California, involving one of the company's vehicles.
U.S. federal and state regulators have been scrutinizing Tesla's semi-automated driving system following accidents in Texas and other states. 
In March, Tesla told California regulators it may not achieve full self-driving technology by the end of this year. It said it is currently offering a driver assistant, level-2 technology that requires driver supervision. 
""I think we’re maybe a month or two away from wide beta. But these things are hard to predict accurately,"" Musk said in a tweet on Wednesday. 
In April, Musk said he would be ""surprised"" if wide test service were available later than June, calling a May launch ""aspirational."" 
In October, Tesla rolled out a pilot program of its long-touted full self driving (FSD) technology to a limited number of employees and customers, but has delayed the wider launch. 
""We had to focus on removing radar & confirming safety,"" Musk said, referring to the carmaker's plan to rely on cameras for its system. 

When asked by a Twitter user whether its vision-only system would remove the ""phantom braking"" issue, in which a Tesla car sometimes applies a brake abruptly under an overpass or a bridge, he said, ""yes."" 
Subscriptions to the software for the system would be offered within a month, Musk said, without elaborating.

603,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2021 04:21PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Fed privately presses big banks on risks from climate change,"By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve has asked lenders to start providing information on the measures they are taking to mitigate climate change-related risks to their balance sheets, according to four people with knowledge of the matter.
The previously unreported supervisory discussions highlight how U.S. watchdogs are moving to execute President Joe Biden's agenda to incorporate climate risk into the financial regulatory system, with potentially major ramifications for Wall Street. 
While European regulators are this year rolling-out climate-change ""stress tests"" for lenders, the Fed lags its peers.
Fed officials have previously said they are considering a new scenario analysis to help them understand how climate change may affect trillions of dollars' worth of bank assets, but have not said how or when they would start to apply such tests.
In private discussions, however, Fed supervisors have begun pressing large lenders to detail the measures they are taking to understand how their loan books would perform under certain climate change scenarios, the four people said. 
Fed officials have not dictated the parameters for the analysis but have made it clear they expect lenders to conduct the internal risk-management exercises and hand over the data, the people said.
That analysis includes testing the geographical exposure of bank assets to physical risks such as flooding, drought and wildfires, as well as testing exposures to different sectors, such as how oil and gas loans may perform versus renewable energy loans. 
The aim of the tests is to identify risks, but the Fed has not indicated that the data it is gathering would translate into any additional capital charges or other regulatory actions. 
""They're being very pragmatic. They're doing their homework,"" said one of the people. 
Global banks -- including JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) -- have been exploring the implications of climate change for some time, both internally and in some cases with European regulators like the Bank of England who are more aggressively integrating climate change risks into the regulatory framework.
Nevertheless, the new climate scrutiny from the U.S. central bank adds to the pressure on Wall Street lenders, forcing them to make investments in technology, data management and staff.
""The data work is a big deal,"" said another of the sources. 
The banks did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the private discussions with the Fed.
STRESS TESTS
Climate change could upend the financial system because physical threats such as rising sea levels, as well as policies and carbon-neutral technologies aimed at slowing global warming, could destroy trillions of dollars of assets, risk experts say.
In a 2020 report, a Commodity Futures Trading Commission panel cited data estimating that $1 trillion to $4 trillion of global wealth tied to fossil fuel assets could be lost.
The Fed in January appointed Kevin Stiroh, one of its top supervisors, to lead a new team focusing on climate-related financial risks, but some congressional Democrats are pushing the central bank to move much faster and add climate risks to bank stress tests which dictate Wall Street's capital plans. 
In March, Fed governor Lael Brainard said that climate scenario tests could be helpful but that they would also rely on qualitative judgments and be highly uncertain. 
Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said the agency will tread carefully and focus on incorporating climate change into existing regulatory obligations, as opposed to creating strict new rules. It is unclear, though, if he will be renominated to lead the Fed after his term expires next year, while his vice chair Randal Quarles, a Republican appointee who oversees bank regulation, is expected to leave this year. 
Progressive (NYSE:PGR) groups say there is much more the central bank could do to address climate risks, even if it does not want to go as far as its European counterparts. 

Tim Clark, a former senior Fed official who helped build its stress tests after the 2008 financial crisis, said it should publicly communicate that it expects banks to incorporate climate change into their risk management processes.
""That's something they can basically start right now and make it clear to the industry that they expect banks to be working hard on this.""

The cannabis industry has enjoyed a surge in demand from customers staying at home during the pandemic. It is also benefiting from burgeoning investor interest as expectations rise that Democratic lawmakers will soon pass legislation granting the industry access to federal banking.
Green Thumb last week agreed to buy privately-owned Dharma Pharmaceuticals in Virginia, soon after the U.S. state legalized marijuana's recreational use, expanding its footprint to 13 states.

The latest update on inflation expectations suggest this is unlikely to be a one and done story.
The 10-year inflation ""breakevens” -- a key measure of inflation expectations over the next decade – jumped 2.57%, the highest level since September 2012.
The Federal Reserve has previously reiterated that the factors boosting inflation will eventually run out of steam.
""While this was a massive surprise, the Fed will likely continue to make the case that a lot of these pressures are transitory and will fade later this year as consumer demand for goods subsides and the supply side catches up,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said.
Investors continued to shun growth stocks like technology, which have higher valuations that are less attractive in an inflationary environment, where money today is worth more than money in the future.
Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) fell 3%, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) fell more than 2%. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) closed down 1.3%. 
Consumer discretionary was also down sharply as Casino stocks and retailers came under pressure with Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR) and Gap (NYSE:GPS) leading the decline.
Energy ended flat, outperforming the broader market, with rising oil prices as bullish sentiment on the recovery in crude demand ahead of the summer driving season offset data showing a weekly build in U.S. crude supplies.
Crude oil supplies fell 427,000 barrels last week, compared with analysts' expectations for a draw of 2.817 million barrels.
Looking ahead, some on Wall Street are anticipating further downside in the S&P 500 if selling sparks a meaningful break below 4,100 in the S&P 500.  
""Our short-term call for elevated volatility in Q2/Q3 has materialized, and we are still looking at the potential of a correction in the magnitude of -10-15% for the S&P.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A federal judge on Wednesday rejected  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)'s request to extend a freeze on about $504 million it accidentally sent a group of Revlon Inc lenders, while it appeals his decision that they can keep the money.
U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan said it was ""tempting"" to extend the freeze, given the large dollar amount and the bank's argument that lenders should ""do the right thing"" rather than enjoy a windfall from its unprecedented mistake.
But he said an appeal would face an ""uphill battle"" and Citigroup had not demonstrated irreparable harm absent a freeze.
""Armed with a final judgment in their favor, defendants and their clients are entitled to use the money without interference,"" he wrote.
Furman gave Citigroup seven days to appeal, and said if it did the defendants must wait for a ruling before using the money.
The dispute arose after Citigroup, acting as Revlon's loan agent, accidentally used its own money last August to repay an $894 million loan for the cosmetics company that was not due until 2023, when it intended to make a small interest payment.
Citigroup sought the extended freeze after Furman ruled on Feb. 16 that 10 asset managers, whose clients include the Revlon lenders, did not have to return the $504 million.
""We disagree with the district court's decision and will file an expedited motion with the court of appeals to ensure the funds are preserved,"" Citigroup said in a statement.
The asset managers, including Brigade Capital Management, HPS Investment Partners and Symphony Asset Management, have said they had no reason to believe the ""sophisticated"" New York bank would blunder so badly.
Their lawyer Adam Abensohn was pleased with Furman's decision, saying Revlon's lenders ""received what they were owed"" and under binding New York law could keep it.
Citigroup had argued that ending the freeze would convert its secured interest in the disputed funds into an unsecured interest, and could force it to bring dozens of lawsuits against individual lenders.

Furman's Feb. 16 decision led Citigroup to lower previously-reported fourth-quarter profit.
The case is In re Citibank August 11, 2020 Wire Transfers, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 20-06539.

(Reuters) - Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou and her legal team are set to return to court for three more weeks of extradition hearings starting Aug. 3, following a fourth attempt by Meng’s lawyers to introduce new evidence, a Canadian court heard on Wednesday.
Meng, 49, was arrested at Vancouver International Airport on a U.S. warrant for bank fraud in December 2018. She is accused of misleading HSBC about Huawei’s dealings in Iran, causing the bank to break with U.S. sanctions.
Meng maintains she is innocent of the charges and has been fighting her extradition while living under house arrest in Vancouver. For more than two years, her lawyers have pushed to have the case thrown out because of alleged abuses of process that they say violated her rights.

Last month Meng requested a delay in proceedings to allow her legal team to review new documents that could bolster her defense. The request followed a settlement between HSBC and Huawei in a Hong Kong court allowing company records to be released.
Meng's lawyers told the British Columbia Supreme Court on Wednesday they plan to file their application to introduce new evidence on June 7. The case is expected to wrap on Aug. 20.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A former federal prosecutor and special inspector general who oversaw a $700 billion U.S. government bailout fund was named on Wednesday as the independent monitor to oversee the United Auto Workers union.
The appointment of Neil Barofsky, now a lawyer at Jenner & Block, was approved by U.S. District Judge David Lawson.
In total, 16 people have been convicted in a wide-ranging probe conducted by the office for the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, which last December reached a deal with the union for independent oversight.
On Tuesday, former UAW President Dennis Williams (NYSE:WMB), was sentenced to 21 months in prison and fined $10,000 on Tuesday for conspiring to embezzle union funds.
Under the Justice Department consent decree, Barofsky has authority to exercise disciplinary powers within the UAW, investigate possible fraud or corruption within the union, and seek discipline against UAW officers and members.
The monitor can investigate, audit and review all aspects of the UAW other than collective bargaining agreements.
Several UAW officers, including the two former UAW presidents, have pleaded guilty to embezzling millions of dollars for their personal benefit, using the funds to purchase expensive liquor and cigars and to pay for golfing outings and related equipment, and expensive hotel stays.
The UAW represents about 400,000 U.S. workers, including workers at Detroit’s Big Three automakers and in other fields. At its peak in 1979, the union had a membership of some 1.5 million.
Barofsky's oversight of the UAW is scheduled to last six years, with a potential early termination or extension depending on the circumstances. Barofsky said Wednesday he was ""honored by this historic assignment and look forward to working with the UAW and the government in carrying out the Consent Decree.""
In 1988, the U.S. Justice Department sued to force out senior leaders at the International Brotherhood of Teamsters union and appointed a trustee because of the union’s connection to organized crime. The government oversaw the Teamsters from March 1989 until 2015, and a five-year transition period ensued.

The court filing said the company and the U.S. government would agree to resolve their ongoing litigation, bringing to an end a brief and controversial spat between the hardware company and Washington that had further soured Sino-U.S. ties.
Emily Horne, a spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council, said ""the Biden Administration is deeply concerned about potential U.S. investments in companies linked the Chinese military and fully committed to keeping up pressure on such companies."" 
A Xiaomi spokeswoman said the company is watching the latest developments closely, without elaborating. 
Shares in the company jumped over 6% in Hong Kong as news of the decision spread. The company's share price has tumbled roughly 20% since it was placed on the blacklist in January in the waning days of the Trump administration.
The Defense Department did not immediately comment. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment.
The department had designated the firm as having ties to China's military and placed it on a list that would restrict U.S. investment in the company.
Seven other Chinese companies were also placed under similar restrictions.
Xiaomi went on the offensive by filing a lawsuit against the U.S. government, calling its placement ""unlawful and unconstitutional"" and denying any ties to China's military.
In March, a federal judge temporarily blocked enforcement of the blacklisting, citing the U.S. government’s ""deeply flawed"" process for including it in the ban. The judge last week also suspended an investment ban imposed on Luokung Technology Corp, the Chinese mapping technology company. 
The Biden administration has agreed not to challenge that ruling. Horne cited the ruling saying ""the Trump Administration failed to develop a legally sufficient basis for imposing restrictions on the company and compelled this action.""
'LOW-HANGING FRUIT'
Soon after the victory, Reuters reported that other Chinese companies placed on the same blacklist were considering similar lawsuits. [L1N2LD2YY]
Xiaomi was among the more high-profile Chinese technology companies that former President Donald Trump targeted for alleged ties to China's military. 
Trump had made countering the rise of Beijing a centrepiece of his administration's economic and foreign policy.
Xiaomi's local smartphone rival Huawei Technologies Co Ltd was also put on an export blacklist in 2019 and barred from accessing critical technology of U.S. origin, affecting its ability to design its own chips and source components from outside vendors.
The measures effectively crippled the company's smartphone division.
Later, the U.S. Department of Defense placed similar restrictions on China's Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, a firm key to China's national drive to boost its domestic chip sector.

Professor Doug Fuller, who tracks China's semiconductor sector at the City University of Hong Kong, says that Xiaomi's win was ""low-hanging fruit"" for the Biden administration in its efforts to correct the excesses of Trump's China policy as his term ended.
""I think it is a sign that Biden will be a bit softer,"" he said. ""Calling Xiaomi a Chinese military company was always ridiculous. For firms tied to more legitimate defence concerns, or (Chinese province) Xinjiang, however, it will be more difficult.""

618,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2021 01:54PM ET</span>","Greensill, Archegos point to tougher 'non-bank' rules, says UK watchdog","By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The collapse of supply-chain company Greensill and meltdown at hedge fund Archegos highlight the need for better data on the growing role of ""non-banks"" in finance, Britain's Financial Conduct Authority said on Wednesday.
Regulators and central banks are increasingly taking a closer a look at ""non-banks,"" which have grown rapidly since banks themselves became subject to far stricter rules after bailouts of lenders in the 2008 global financial crisis.
The FCA is formally investigating Greensill, which lent money to firms by buying their invoices at a discount, a type of commercial lending that is not regulated in Britain.
""What this experience does show is that where there is interaction with regulated activity, be it at a bank or capital market, there is scope for us to further strengthen the information that we are gathering,"" FCA CEO Nikhil Rathi told a parliamentary hearing on Greensill.
The Archegos episode also raises questions about how family office investment operations report transactions, Rathi said. Archegos struggled after it was asked to meet a huge margin call from its banks.
Rathi said the FCA and finance ministry are scrutinising two sets of rules dating to the 1980s.
The first allows foreign financial firms to access Britain's market without telling regulators, while the second allows a regulated firm to give an ""appointed representative"" permission to carry out financial activities, a mechanism used by Greensill.
""At the very least we need to know what's going on in these areas which are not formally regulated,"" Rathi said.
The appointed representative regime was only intended for limited use but has been applied far more widely, Rathi said.
""That feels to me like we need to be looking much more closely at systems and controls the principal has in place, and potentially placing restrictions on the scale of business that can be undertaken through this mechanism,"" he said.

619,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2021 01:54PM ET</span>","Uber, Lyft want more public subsidies to meet California EV mandates","By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - California clean-air regulators want nearly all trips on Uber (NYSE:UBER) and  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) ride-hailing platforms to be in electric vehicles, mandating costly measures that the companies call unrealistic without more public subsidies for EVs.
The proposed rules by the California Air Resources Board (CARB), expected to pass on May 20, mandate that EVs account for 90% of ride-hailing vehicle miles traveled by 2030. That's a lesser goal than the companies themselves have set: Both Uber and Lyft recently committed to convert their U.S. fleets entirely to EVs by that year.
Graphic on CARB electric-vehicle goals: https://tmsnrt.rs/3u5EVaq (Graphic: California's aggressive targets to electrify Uber, Lyft, https://graphics.reuters.com/UBER-ELECTRIC/CALIFORNIA/jznvnarexpl/chart.png) 
And yet the firms are pushing back on the CARB effort to force the transition, arguing taxpayers should shoulder much of the burden.
The total cost of meeting the state's 2030 standard could reach $1.73 billion, even when government subsidies and projected declines in electric-vehicle costs are considered, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit research and advocacy organization that projected the transition's total cost at Reuters' request.
California and the ride-hail duopoly are on a collision course less than a year after the companies won a battle against the state to maintain their drivers' status as independent contractors, rather than employees. The firms' business models pose among the biggest obstacles to converting their fleets to EVs. Their drivers own their cars and work as much or as little as they please. Even those working full-time don't make enough to justify the higher upfront costs of EVs.
""You'd need to pay off my car ... and then give me incentives to make it worthwhile for me for be on a new payment program,"" said Daniel Russell, who drove for Uber and Lyft in Los Angeles before the pandemic.
Most drivers buy used vehicles, Russell said, and many have poor credit that forces them into expensive car loans.
Uber and Lyft say they can't afford the EV transition either. Uber said in a December letter to CARB that, without ""sufficient"" subsidies, the rule would unduly burden the companies, along with their drivers and consumers.
""No one government nor single company ... can bear the full cost of a rapid transition alone,"" Uber said in a statement to Reuters. Lyft said in a statement that taxpayers should finance the transition because current government subsidies are only sufficient to make EVs affordable for ""typically high-income white homeowners,"" while most California Lyft drivers are lower-income minorities.
Neither company has reported a profit after a decade in business, but both generate billions of dollars in revenue and are publicly traded. Uber is valued at about $86 billion; Lyft is worth about $16 billion.
Joshua Cunningham, chief of CARB's sustainable transport staff, said the agency supports more subsidies for lower-income drivers but that, regardless, Uber and Lyft can handle the transition CARB is mandating. The electrification targets, he said, are aggressive but feasible.
Graphic on CARB emission goals: https://tmsnrt.rs/2QDFNV6 (Graphic: California wants Uber, Lyft to eliminate CO2 emissions, https://graphics.reuters.com/UBER-ELECTRIC/CALIFORNIA/qzjvqzbkxpx/chart.png) 
California State Senator Nancy Skinner - who introduced the 2018 law on which the CARB regulations are based - said the companies should pay most of the cost for fleet conversion because their businesses have increased carbon emissions.
""It's because of them that these vehicles are driving additional miles and making additional trips,"" she said. 
LONG ROAD AHEAD 
The debate will test the ride-hailing firms long-stated commitment to carbon reductions. Uber and Lyft have claimed their businesses would reduce climate damage by decreasing traffic and providing an alternative to private car ownership. But several studies have found that, by contrast, private car ownership has grown slightly in recent years and that the ride-hailing fleets have worsened urban traffic congestion. Uber and Lyft say their impact on traffic is small, citing a study they commissioned. 
Uber and Lyft cited existing partnerships with rental companies and charging station providers to lower drivers' EV costs and said they are seeking similar arrangements with automakers. Uber last week announced a partnership with British electric van and bus maker Arrival to develop a car for European drivers on ride-hailing platforms.
Uber has also said it will invest $800 million globally through 2025 to help drivers globally switch to EVs. But that's a drop in the ocean of money needed to convert the about five million drivers on its platform as of February 2020. 
California currently offers some of the most generous U.S. EV subsidies and has said it will end the sale of new combustion engine vehicles by 2035. But battery electric cars only accounted for 1.3% of the state's 2020 light-duty vehicle fleet and 6.2% of all new 2020 vehicle sales, according to California's Energy Commission. Ride-hailing trips currently make up just 1.2% of all passenger vehicle miles traveled in California. But drivers for ride-hailing firms produce more pollution per passenger-mile traveled because they spend more than a third of their time cruising without riders and only rarely carry multiple riders, according to CARB. Researchers generally assume that electrifying one ride-hail vehicle reduces the same amount of CO2 as converting three regular gas-powered passenger vehicles to EVs. 
Some Uber and Lyft vehicles produce a lot more pollution than others, however. CARB has suggested the companies could meet its 2030 goals for electric vehicle-miles by converting less than half of their fleets - if they focus on full-time drivers who travel more miles. 
FOUR CENTS PER MILE 
Despite the high upfront costs of converting California ride-hailing fleets to electric cars, the transition would only cost Uber and Lyft an extra four cents per mile traveled by their drivers between now and 2030, according to Elizabeth Irvin, a senior transportation analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists. Drivers would save $1.1 billion in lower maintenance costs and fuel savings over the same time period, the organization estimates. 
CARB's proposed legislation would allow the companies ways other than adding EVs to meet carbon reduction goals. But those efforts pose their own challenges. 
The rules would award the firms credit for building bike lanes and connecting riders to public transit by allowing them to buy tickets through their apps. Such efforts, however, will be complicated by California's fragmented transit systems. Regulators also suggest the companies could cut emissions by limiting miles traveled while cruising without riders, but that would undercut their efforts to keep prices and wait-times low. The companies could also increase car-pooled trips with multiple riders, but they have long tried that with little success. 
Those strategies are not likely to help much in meeting CARB's emissions reduction goal, Lyft said in a statement, encouraging the agency to focus instead on electric-car incentives. Such subsidy programs, regardless of who pays for them, are difficult to design for drivers who are independent contractors. 
If Uber and Lyft helped pay for their drivers to buy EVs, for instance, they have no way under their current business models to ensure their freelance drivers continue working for them. And drivers have few avenues to resist being saddled with the extra costs of electrification mandates on the companies. 

Most EVs are bought now by higher-income people who purchase and install chargers in homes they own. Uber and Lyft drivers are the opposite: Renters with limited income and no access to home chargers, leaving them dependent on costly public chargers. Lower-income drivers cannot - and should not - bear the costs of the EV transition, said Irvin, of the Union of Concerned Scientists. 
""It's really important that the companies pay the upfront costs, not the drivers,"" Irvin said. ""After all, this rulemaking process is only holding the companies accountable for promises they've already made.""

620,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2021 01:36PM ET</span>","Exclusive-ValueAct takes stake in 7-Eleven owner, says changes could boost share price","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
(Reuters) -Activist investor ValueAct Capital has amassed a $1.53 billion stake in Seven & i Holdings and would like the Japanese owner of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain to consider changes, including a potential break-up.
ValueAct told its investors on Wednesday in a letter seen by Reuters that it built a 4.4% stake in Seven & i and believes that the sum of its parts is worth much more than its current market value.
The hedge fund said the 7-Eleven business could be worth more than double what its parent is currently valued at if the company restructures itself to focus on the convenience stores or if 7-Eleven is spun out.
The new stake in Seven & i marks a return to Japan for ValueAct, where shareholder activism is gaining traction and the firm has considerable experience, having made an investment in Nintendo last year and having previously bet on Olympus Corp and JSR Corp. 
Seven & i last year spent $21 billion to buy the Speedway convenience stores.
7-Eleven's convenience stores are a consistent, high-return business, while Seven & i's other retail and financial assets, such as real estate have not contributed to cash flow of late even though they are backed by valuable assets, the investment firm noted.
""We invested in Seven & i Holdings at an estimated P/E ratio of 11 times, while global peers trade at 15 times to 25 times,"" ValueAct said in the letter.
The company's shares that are traded in the United States climbed 4% on a day the broader market is down. Seven & i did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment. 
ValueAct declined to comment. The investment firm, run by Mason Morfit, is up 18% since January after returning 12.5% last year, an investor in the firm said.
ValueAct underscored the role 7-Eleven could play for Japan in the letter, arguing it could become what McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) and  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) are to the United States, what  Inditex  (MC:ITX) is to Spain and Aldi is to Germany. 
But work is necessary to achieve these goals, ValueAct said noting that 7-Eleven would need to speed up its global digitalization strategy. In the United States it could focus more on food, which can be quickly tailored to tastes, and cut corporate costs.
Over the last months, ValueAct has engaged with Seven & i's board directors and management and is optimistic that it can continue to build trust and alignment with the company, it said in the letter.
The letter reflects ValueAct's style of collaborating with management by making suggestions instead of dictating terms to management and the board.
Over decades ValueAct has distinguished itself from other activist investors. While rivals often publicly demand board seats and push management to accept their plans quickly, ValueAct prefers to work behind the scenes, making few public statements or releasing detailed plans for change.

In the letter ValueAct also said that this new investment echoes the firm's previous investments in Japan. 
""The challenges and opportunities facing Seven & i—strategy, organizational design, digitalization and ESG—are very familiar to us,"" the letter said. ValueAct has helped facilitate sales of businesses at Olympus and JSR.

Knighthead, Certares and Apollo have been in a bidding war with other companies to provide equity capital to Hertz.
Hertz filed for bankruptcy protection in May last year after travel demand sank during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and talks with creditors failed to provide relief. 
Under the proposal, Hertz will be funded through direct common stock investments for a total of $2.781 billion, the issuance of $1.5 billion of new preferred stock to Apollo, and a rights offering to existing shareholders to purchase $1.635 billion of additional common stock. 
The plan includes $239 million of cash, common stock representing 3% of the reorganized company's shares and 30-year warrants for 18% of the common stock with a strike price based on a total equity value of $6.5 billion.

The activist group had called on BP to publish short, medium and long-term targets to reduce emissions that are consistent with the U.N.-backed 2015 Paris agreement to limit global warming to below 2 degrees celsius from pre-industrial levels.
The board had opposed the resolution.
Mark van Baal, the head of Follow This, told Reuters that ""a fifth of shareholders want BP to go back to the drawing board and rethink their strategy."" 
BP, led by CEO Bernard Looney since February 2020, last year announced plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from oil and gas it produces to zero and reduce by half the carbon instensity of all products it sells by 2050. 
In one of the sector's most ambitious strategies, BP also plans to slash its oil output by 40% and boost its renewable power business by 20-fold by 2030.
BP said in a statement following the vote that it ""will continue to engage with shareholders on our strategy, targets and aims so as to ensure their views are fully understood.""

The company will publish an update on its engagement with shareholders around climate within 6 months, it said.
BP Chairman Helge Lund said at the start of the AGM that ""in practice the resolution would constrain BP's ability to adjust its strategy in future as the energy transition unfolds.""

Investing.com – Hertz (OTC:HTZGQ) soared 56% Wednesday as traders lapped up the news that the company has accepted a $6 billion bid from a clutch of investors to exit Chapter 11.
Funds and accounts affiliated to Knighthead Capital Management, Certares Opportunities and Apollo Capital Management will provide the equity capital to fund Hertz's revised plan of reorganization and exit Chapter 11 proceedings.
The fate of the offer hinges on two court hearings now, one on May 14 and the other on June 10.
The Knighthead group's proposal would eliminate approximately $5 billion of Hertz’s corporate debt including the elimination of all corporate debt of its European business.
It will additionally provide the car rental operator with over $2.2 billion of liquidity. Hertz will also have to go for equity dilution at a later stage to fund the proposal."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States is testing powers to protect workers under the trade deal replacing NAFTA and asked Mexico on Wednesday to probe alleged abuses at a General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) factory, a move that may put tariffs on some of the firm's profitable pickups. 
U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said her office and the Department of Labor received ""information appearing to indicate serious violations"" of worker rights in an April union contract vote at GM's Silao factory in central Mexico.
Tai said she will partner with the Mexican government to try to ""prevent a race to the bottom"" for U.S. and Mexican workers.
Mexico's leftist president welcomed the action, crediting provisions in the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade deal that aim to strengthen Mexican unions and slow migration of U.S. auto production south of the border. 
""It's a good thing. Before, the trade deal did not look at the labor situation,"" President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said at a regular news conference. 
Mexico's labor ministry has already said it found ""serious irregularities"" in the union-led vote by the GM Silao plant's 6,000 union workers to ratify a labor contract and ordered a new vote within 30 days. Officials have said some ballots were destroyed.
Labor remedies under USMCA include revoking tariff-free access for the violating factory's goods. In GM's case, that could mean applying a 25% U.S. pickup truck import tariff on Silao-made trucks, a move that could add thousands of dollars to each vehicle's cost. 
GM said it will cooperate with the U.S. and Mexican governments and that it condemned violations of labor rights including actions to restrict collective bargaining.
The so-called request for review marks the first use of the Rapid Response Labor Mechanism in USMCA, which allows countries to target labor rights violations at specific factories. Tai helped negotiate the labor enforcement mechanism on behalf of Democrats in the U.S. Congress.
GM won key changes to USMCA that allowed it to continue to build hundreds of thousands of high-profit pickups in Mexico for export to the United States annually.
In a statement, Tai praised Mexico ""for stepping in to suspend the vote when it became aware of voting irregularities"" and said the U.S. action ""will complement Mexico’s efforts to ensure that these workers can fully exercise their collective bargaining rights.""
Under NAFTA, Mexican factory wages stagnated for more than two decades, in part because of a union system that made it hard for workers to organize freely. Mexico's minimum wage of less than a $1 an hour is the lowest among the OECD group of industrial economies.
Despite the new USMCA powers, a domestic labor reform, and government hikes to minimum wages, Mexican workers are expected to earn far less than U.S. peers for the foreseeable future. 
PROFIT CENTER
GM's Silao plant https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trade-nafta-autos/game-of-chicken-gm-bets-on-mexican-made-pickup-trucks-idUSKBN1F42G7 is a linchpin of its North American truck strategy, producing more than 339,000 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra full-sized pickup trucks in 2019. That was more than a third of the company's total of 906,000 that year.
""We do not believe there was any GM involvement in the alleged violations or that any government-approved inspectors were denied access to the facility, and have retained a third-party firm to conduct an independent and thorough review,"" the company said in a statement.
USTR's request comes days before U.S. President Joe Biden travels to Dearborn, Michigan, to tour a Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co electric vehicle plant to highlight his push for $174 billion in government funding to expand electric vehicle production and charging infrastructure.
Ford builds all of its U.S. full-size pickup trucks in the United States but both GM and Ford are investing in electric vehicle production in Mexico, prompting the United Auto Workers union to call for tax incentives to apply only to U.S.-assembled EVs.
White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki declined to say on Tuesday if Biden supported limiting EV subsidies.
Tai's request warns all automakers - including Ford, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Chrysler parent Stellantis - that the Biden administration will not tolerate past Mexican labor practices that critics say kept wages depressed.
In cases of workplace violations at factories that export to the United States, Lopez Obrador said the two governments would establish a dialog and intervene so that rights were respected.

If the United States and Mexico cannot reach an agreement to resolve the matter, Tai can request a dispute settlement panel to review the matter, with the entire process meant to take about 90 days from the initial request.
Tai has requested that the U.S. Treasury immediately suspend final settlement of customs accounts for U.S. border entry of GM's Silao trucks, a move that preserves the option to apply tariffs to them later.

This shift is the result of growth stocks soaring to the point that they were trading at egregiously high forward P/E ratios.
In particular, growth stocks in the tech sector were trading at elevated prices. The pendulum eventually swung the other way, moving the market-wide emphasis toward value stocks. There is a good chance the pendulum will soon move right back to growth stocks simply because plenty of investors have been patiently waiting for these high-flyers to pull back to reasonable prices.

This has bolstered the demand for sports and fitness apparel. Consequently, we think leading players in this space, Adidas (OTC:ADDYY), Under Armour (NYSE:UA) (UAA), DICK’s Sporting Goods (DKS), and  Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL), are uniquely positioned to benefit. Let’s discuss.The COVID-19 pandemic kept gyms and yoga centers closed for a lengthy period last year. However, at-home fitness activities and a more casual lifestyle led to increased purchases of activewear apparel, and a fading of the distinction between office wear, casual wear and activewear. Now that nearly one-third of the U.S. population is vaccinated for COVID-19, gyms are reopening with rising demand from fitness enthusiasts. This has been driving a surge in demand for all types of fitness clothing.
Widespread rising health consciousness amid growing concerns about the impact of a remote lifestyle on physical and mental health should keep driving the demand for outdoor fitness activities and, by extension, athletic apparel. The global sports apparel market size is expected to grow at a 4.6% CAGR over the next four years to reach $308.38 billion in 2025.
Given this backdrop, we think athletic apparel manufacturers  Adidas AG  (DE:ADSGN) (ADDYY), Under Armour, Inc. (UAA), DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. (DKS), and Foot Locker, Inc. (FL) could be solid bets now.

Shares rose 2.3% to $23.30 as the burger chain also beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly same-store sales in the United States.
Wendy's (NASDAQ:WEN) is getting ready for customers to return to its restaurants with new launches like the fried chicken sandwich, to tackle that of its competition, iced beverages and its popular breakfast offerings. 
The company had invested millions of dollars in its breakfast menu over the past year to hire staff and market its morning offerings. 
""We got to get this great food in consumers' mouths,"" Chief Executive Officer Todd Penegor told analysts.
Penegor expects more customers to make Wendy's a part of their breakfast routine, as they get back to eating breakfast in restaurants rather than making it at home.
""Breakfast is very habitual... we got to continue to be able to build the habit to use the brand for breakfast rather than just dinner,"" Penegor added.
The company expects sales from its breakfast category to grow 30% in 2021.
For the year, Wendy's expects adjusted earnings between 72 cents and 74 cents per share, up from its prior projection of 67 cents to 69 cents. 
It hiked its quarterly dividend by 11% to 10 cents per share and increased its share repurchase program by $50 million.

Banks globally are adopting different methods to ensure a successful back to office plan including hybrid working models and vaccination drives.
Here is the state of play with back-to-office plans in various regions:
UNITED STATES
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co
The bank said in March it plans to start bringing workers back to its offices after Labor Day due to the increasing availability of vaccines. The company is evaluating whether to allow certain businesses or functional subgroups in the United States to return to the workplace before Labor Day.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)
The bank is planning to bring U.S. employees back to the office by mid-June.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)
The largest U.S. bank will bring its employees in the United States back to the office on a rotational basis from July and plans to maintain a 50% occupancy cap during the return-to-office phase. 
The bank also plans to step up the return of all of its employees in England to working at least part of their week in its offices from June 21.
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)
Chief Executive Officer Jane Fraser said in a memo in March that post-pandemic, most of the employees would be able to work in a ""hybrid"" setting, allowing them to work from home for up to two days a week.
UNITED KINGDOM:
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc 
Chief Executive Officer Jes Staley has said the bank will adopt a hybrid working model, and will reduce its real estate footprint but maintain its main offices in London and New York. 
 HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA)
HSBC has said it plans to cut its global office footprint by around 40% as it moves to a hybrid working model for most employees. The lender moved 1,200 call center staff in Britain to permanent home working contracts, Reuters reported in April, going further than some rivals in cementing changes to working patterns.
Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LON:LLOY) 
Britain's biggest domestic bank is hoping to resume office-based trials and experiments with around 5,000 of its staff this summer, once government restrictions allow. The lender has said it plans to cut 20% of its office space over two years.
Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Plc
StanChart said it will make permanent the flexible working arrangements introduced during the pandemic, and that it could cut a third of its office space in the next three to four years.
NatWest 
Chief Executive Officer Alison Rose has said the bank is likely to adopt a hybrid working model, but has stressed offices will remain important as a place to bring people together to collaborate.
GERMANY
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) 
Germany's largest lender said it is following a regional approach to the pandemic and return to the office issues, reflecting the different situations in individual countries, in line with government guidance in individual jurisdictions.
SWITZERLAND
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN)
Credit Suisse in July 2020 launched a global program evaluating various work-from-home options, which are expected to shape its post-pandemic working models. It has been monitoring and adapting work arrangements since launching work-from-home globally in March 2020, taking into account local guidelines.
UBS

UBS Chairman Axel Weber in May said flexibility would remain part of work arrangements at Switzerland's biggest bank going forward, where roles allow. Return to office plans vary from region to region, in accordance with local government guidelines.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The head of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) told a U.S. House panel that an electrical issue that grounded about 100 Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX planes last month worldwide appeared to be a ""pretty straightforward fix.""
FAA Administrator Steve Dickson told the U.S. House Appropriations subcommittee overseeing transportation that he was fully confident in the safety of the MAX that returned to service after being grounded for 20 months following two fatal crashes in five months.
""It is performing as well or better overall than any other airplane out there in the aviation system right now,"" Dickson said.
The FAA has daily meetings with Boeing to discuss the MAX's performance, Dickson said. In February, the FAA said it was tracking all Boeing 737 MAX airplanes using satellite data under an agreement with air traffic surveillance firm Aireon LLC.
Reuters reported on May 4 that the FAA asked Boeing to supply fresh analysis showing numerous 737 MAX subsystems would not be affected by electrical grounding issues first flagged in three areas of the jet in April.
Boeing declined to answer Wednesday when it might submit service bulletins to airlines allowing them to make fixes. 
The electrical problems have suspended nearly a quarter of its 737 MAX fleet. Dickson said the FAA ""is looking at both the root cause of how that change was introduced into the manfacturing process and making sure we run down whether there were any other implications.""
Airlines pulled dozens of 737 MAX jets from service in early April after Boeing warned of a production-related electrical grounding problem in a backup power control unit situated in the cockpit on some recently built airplanes.

The problem, which also halted delivery of new planes, was then found in two other places on the flight deck, including the storage rack where the affected control unit is kept and the instrument panel facing the pilots.
The FAA said the issue impacts 109 in-service planes worldwide.

639,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2021 11:51AM ET</span>",European banks: Q1 full house is no winning hand just yet,"By Julien Ponthus
LONDON (Reuters) -European banks' first-quarter earnings have surpassed all expectations in a turnaround from the COVID-19 doldrums of a year ago, yet after a decade of travails more than one season may be needed to win over sceptics.
European bank shares are up 25% already this year, more than double the gains of the underlying STOXX 600 index. Since November, when President Joe Biden won U.S. elections with pledges for big-time spending, the sector has rallied some 66%.
Vaccine rollouts, massive government spending and hopes of a resumption of post-pandemic normality have made investors eager to buy into the recovery; many are rotating portfolios to so-called cyclical stocks, which benefit when the economy looks up.
European banks have become a proxy of choice though some caution the trading frenzy which boosted investment banking revenues may fade over coming months and that non-performing loans could rise once governments cut back on emergency support.
All of Europe's top 10 lenders by market capitalisation beat forecasts for the January-March period thanks to buoyant revenues from securities trading, lower provisions against bad loans and rising bond yields.
The majority of other big players such as  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) and Unicredit (MI:CRDI) passed the season with flying colours too.
Refinitiv data shows a rough 200% profit jump off the troughs of a year ago after the markets crashed last March as the COVID-19 pandemic hit Europe. 
""We have got effectively 95% of all banks beating expectations, and not only that, beating them by an average of 24%,"" said Magdalena Stoklosa, head of European banks research at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS). 
While European bank shares already are on course for their best performance since 2009, Stoklosa sees potential for another 10% gains from current levels.
Jerome Legras, head of research at Axiom Alternative Investments, which invests in bank equity and debt, said earnings could improve further if banks trim provisions to cover for any pandemic-related losses.
STILL RISKY 
It seems a sea change from last year when the sector lost almost half its market value on fear that lockdowns would send waves of loan losses crashing into balance sheets. 
The sector was also still nursing wounds from a series of banking scandals, low interest rates, higher capital requirements, and restructurings. All these contributed to a decade of underperformance since 2010.
An economic recovery could pump up expectations for bank earnings, raising the bar for positive surprises. 
""This was really the peak in terms of results"", Martin Moeller, co-head of Swiss & global equity portfolio management at UBP, said, predicting profit margins to stay under pressure from record-low interest rates. 

Nor has the sector lost its capacity to upset, Moeller said, adding: ""Remember Archegos?"" -- a reference to a U.S. investment firm whose default wiped out what would have been a stellar quarter for  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN). 
""Banks continue to be quite a risky investment"", said Moeller, who prefers taking exposure to the financial industry via shares in asset managers or payment services.

Investing.com – Technology shares were big losers in Wednesday’s broader market selloff as worries over inflation gripped market players.
April consumer prices ran up 4.2% from a year ago, the fastest acceleration since 2008 and higher than the expected 3.6% as per a Dow Jones estimate.
While the Fed has on more than one occasion said it was focused on employment and that it was comfortable with an inflation rate higher than its target of 2%, a reading this high is causing anxiety.
Barring Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), the other FAANG stocks were all down around 2% each. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) was down just over 2%. Netflix fell 1.7%.
Tech shares have been under pressure lately after reporting record numbers for the last quarter. Worries over high inflation, privacy concerns around sharing of users’ data, and fears of higher regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. and Europe to curb their market dominance have kept these shares under pressure.
Another worrying factor has been the shortage of chips amid booming consumer demand for gadgets, electronic devices and electric cars.
Elsewhere in tech, shares of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and NXP (NASDAQ:NXPI) were all down 2% to 4%.

Sibur said earlier on Wednesday that it had obtained a $50 million loan from UniCredit with an interest rate that is linked to its sustainability performance, becoming the first Russian petrochemical company to do so.
Peter O'Brien, a member of Sibur's management board, said in emailed comments that the predominant share of available financing tools will be linked to ESG (environmental, social and corporate governance) performance in next 3 to 5 years.
Sibur has been considering an IPO for years. The size of a potential offering has previously been estimated at up to $3 billion.
""If and when the shareholders of Sibur decide to proceed with an IPO, our ESG-linked financing initiatives, agreements (and performance vs the required metrics in these agreements) will further enhance our ESG profile and credibility,"" O'Brien said.
""This is important to an increasing range of investors (providers of all types of capital).""

The breed of exchange-traded fund targeting niche investment ideas from sports betting to artificial intelligence is on pace for its first month of outflows in more than a year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Traders have pulled about $1.6 billion in May so far. While that’s only 1% of assets in the category, it’s a striking reversal from the start of the year when inflows peaked at $18 billion in January.
The sector’s most popular funds are being hit hardest. The Ark Innovation ETF (ticker ARKK), the poster child of the thematic frenzy, has dropped more than a third from its February peak. Investors have withdrawn about $500 million in the past two weeks.
“For some of the more short term money, folks are exiting,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist for the U.S. SPDR ETF business at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors. “Investors are a bit anxious about the growth prospects for a lot of these companies and the valuations as interest rates rise.”
ARKK was falling for the 10th day out of 12 on Wednesday, with tech shares once again leading Wall Street declines on the back of the biggest inflation surge since 2009 last month.
Investors are adjusting portfolios and turning away from stocks most vulnerable to rising yields and prices. These include expensive-looking tech names, in particular those whose valuations are more reliant on hopes for future growth than current earnings.
The pain is particularly acute for the products at Ark Investment Management. Cathie Wood’s slate of funds, which led inflows in the boom with $8 billion added in January alone, have in total lost about $1.3 billion in May.
Clean-energy ETFs are also struggling after a record-breaking few months. Cybersecurity funds are suffering too, with the likes of Global X’s BUG ETF losing about $300 million in May even after a high-profile hack disrupted U.S. fuel supplies.
Thematic ETFs now boast about $160 billion in assets, down from a peak of around $176 billion in February.
That’s still almost treble a year ago, however. For many, the trend of investing according to easy-to-understand narratives is likely to persist, even if the specific themes change.
“Although thematic funds have bled about $1.6 billion this month, it is relatively small compared to their aggregate size,” said James Pillow, managing director at Moors & Cabot (NYSE:CBT) Inc. “As long as we cling to narratives, there will always be thematic funds.”

However, there are signs that the selling pressure may relax and we could see a bounce in certain semiconductor stocks.The semiconductor industry has been quite volatile during the ongoing chip shortage. Some semiconductor experts insist the chip shortage will last well into 2022 while others are adamant the shortage will end at some point in ’21.
The cost of automobiles, computers, smartphones, and other devices/machines that are built with computer chips is increasing due to the reduction in chip supply. Add in ongoing inflation and there is even more reason for chipmakers as well as those that sell products with these essential chips to hike prices all the more. It is clear the supply and demands dynamic combined with increased overhead costs are being passed on to the consumer.
Qorvo (QRVO) and Lam Research Corporation (LRCX) have taken a beating as a result of the chip shortage and sector uncertainty. Semiconductor industry bulls view the recent pullbacks as buying opportunities. After all, consumers have amassed a record amount of savings during the pandemic. Furthermore, consumers' pockets are lined thanks to the stimulus payments so it only makes sense that the demand for products with chips will hold steady despite elevated prices.

So, considering their inadequate financials and dismal growth prospects, we think it is best to avoid these stocks now.With the states of New York, New Jersey, Virginia and New Mexico legalizing recreational marijuana this year, the U.S. cannabis industry has attracted immense investor attention. However, selling recreational marijuana products legally is possibly months away given that implementing the changed regulations and distributing licenses to dispensaries will be time consuming. While Democrats’ control of Congress and the White House has so far been a blessing for most multi-state pot producers, some could still struggle to generate substantial revenues and profit.
In fact, the Senate’s stance on the Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act, a bill aimed at supporting cannabis companies by authorizing banks to do business with them, is still not clear. While the U.S. House of Representatives has passed the bill with bipartisan support, it is unlikely that the Senate will take it up for a vote soon. Amid this uncertainty, we think it is safer to invest in cannabis companies that are already generating high revenue growth.
Multi-state cannabis operators that are trading at lofty valuations compared to their peers absent adequate financial and fundamental strength could witness significant retreats in the near term. We think Jushi Holdings Inc. (JUSHF) and Charlotte's Web Holdings, Inc. (CWBHF) have limited growth opportunities against an uncertain industry backdrop and they currently look highly overvalued.

The world's second-largest cinema chain, which sunk to its first-ever loss last year due to the COVID-19 crisis, said 74% of the votes cast in the meeting were in favour of the remuneration report.
That marked a significantly lower level of support compared to the 93.41% votes in favour in 2020.
The UK-listed company, which owns Regal Cinemas, said its board will continue its dialogue with shareholders on executive pay matters following this.
Advisory groups Glass Lewis and ISS had recommended shareholders to vote against the executive pay policy, with ISS concerned that the long-term incentive plan (LTIP) was not ""appropriate"" given the sector's exposure to the pandemic.

The LTIP entails a bonus of up to 65 million pounds for its chief and deputy chief executives each, if performance and share price targets are met.

The ruling reverses a 2019 decision not to prosecute either company over the accident, in which the pilots lost control of the Airbus A330 jet after ice blocked its airspeed sensors.
Victims' families welcomed the ruling, but Airbus and Air France said they would seek to overturn it at the Cour de Cassation, France's highest appeal court.
""The court decision that has just been announced does not reflect in any way the conclusions of the investigation,"" Airbus said in an emailed statement.
Air France ""maintains that it committed no criminal fault at the root of this tragic accident"", said a spokesman for the carrier, which is part of Air France-KLM.
Air France flight AF447 from Rio de Janeiro to Paris crashed on June 1, 2009, killing everyone on board.
French investigators found that the crew had mishandled the situation arising from the loss of speed data from sensors blocked with ice and caused an aerodynamic stall by holding the aircraft's nose too high. 

The earlier decision not to go to trial drew legal challenges from the families as well as pilot unions and prosecutors who had pursued charges against Air France alone.
Wednesday's ruling upheld new demands for a trial of both companies from senior prosecutors who have accused Air France of pilot training failures and Airbus for underestimating dangers posed by known problems with the speed sensors.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Amazon won its fight against an EU order to pay about 250 million euros ($303 million) in back taxes to Luxembourg in a blow to competition chief Margrethe Vestager's crusade against preferential deals.
The setback renewed calls from EU lawmakers for a global corporate tax deal and legal analysts said Vestager was unlikely to give up her pursuit of large companies over the amount of tax they pay.
The bloc failed to show that Luxembourg had given the U.S. online retailer special treatment in violation of state aid rules, the EU's General Court ruled on Wednesday.
Its ruling follows last year's landmark defeat for Vestager against Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which had contested an order that it pay 13 billion euros ($15 billion) in Irish back taxes.
Both Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple were targeted by Vestager in a campaign to stamp out tax deals used by EU states, including Luxembourg and the Netherlands, to attract large companies. The Commission views such agreements as unfair. 
""The Commission did not prove to the requisite legal standard that there was an undue reduction of the tax burden of a European subsidiary of the Amazon group,"" the Luxembourg-based EU judges said.
Amazon in a statement welcomed the ruling, saying it was in line with ""our long-standing position that we followed all applicable laws and that Amazon received no special treatment"". 
The Luxembourg government said the judgment showed the tax deal was not state aid - or an advantage that could distort competition.
Vestager said she would examine the ruling before deciding whether to appeal to Europe's top court. [B5N2GD001]
She is unlikely to stop her crusade, said Ioannis Kokkoris, professor of competition law and economics at London-based Queen Mary University of London.
""The future approach of the Commission in state aid cases may be fine-tuned to adjust to the concerns the court identified, but this hiccup is not going to forestall the drive of Vestager in this area,"" he said.
WIN SOME, LOSE SOME
It wasn't all bad news for Vestager. In a separate case on Wednesday, French utility Engie lost its appeal against an EU order to pay back taxes of 120 million euros to Luxembourg.
But the spotlight was on the Amazon decision, which was criticised by groups campaigning for higher taxes to be levied on multinationals.
""Today's ruling is a blow,"" said Chiara Putaturo, a tax expert with Oxfam EU. ""It shows again that case-by-case investigations do not solve large-scale tax dodging.""
The amount at stake in the Amazon decision is tiny compared to the billions of dollars the online retailer earns each quarter, but it could help other companies in their appeals against the bloc's tax probes.
Like Oxfam, EU lawmakers said there was a need for a systematic approach and urged the bloc to back U.S. President Joe Biden's call for a 21% minimum tax rate on multinationals.
""Such a minimum tax rate would allow member states to reclaim lost tax revenues from Amazon in the future. This would put an end to Luxembourg's business model as tax haven,"" EU lawmaker Sven Giegold said in a statement.
""At the same time, public country-by-country reporting must be introduced as soon as possible. Then large corporations will have to disclose their profits and taxes paid per country,"" Giegold said.
Vestager's success in making Belgium, Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands change their tax practices has helped to spur efforts for a global deal. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said last week that the chances of achieving one had never been higher.
Amazon's Luxembourg-based main European operating subsidiary, Amazon EU Sarl., has not reported a tax charge in any of the last three years, because it reported losses on its 104 billion euros of revenue, corporate filings lodged with the Luxembourg registry show.
Over the last two decades, Amazon reduced its European taxable profits by having Amazon EU Sarl pay affiliated, tax-exempt partnership fees in return for the use of intellectual property, corporate filings show. 
Amazon EU Sarl racked up tax credits of almost 600 mln euros over the 2018-2020 period. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tax-amazon-idUSBRE8B50AR20121206
The European Commission in its 2017 ruling, knocked down on Wednesday, said Luxembourg spared Amazon from paying taxes on almost three-quarters of its profits from EU operations by allowing it to channel profits to a holding company tax-free.
In its 2018 decision on Engie, the EU said the arrangement with Luxembourg authorities artificially reduced the company's tax burden, which meant it paid an effective corporate tax rate of 0.3% on certain profits in Luxembourg for about a decade.
The court sided with the Commission, saying the French utility had benefited from a tax advantage.

The cases are T-816/17 Luxembourg v Commission & T-318/18 Amazon EU v Commission.

LONDON (Reuters) - An Australian computer scientist who alleges he created bitcoin has launched a London High Court lawsuit against 16 software developers in an effort to secure bitcoin worth around 4 billion pounds ($5.7 billion) he says he owns.
In a case that was promptly labelled ""bogus"" by one defendant, Craig Wright is demanding that developers allow him to retrieve around 111,000 bitcoin held at two digital addresses that he does not have private keys for.
In his second London lawsuit in three weeks, Wright alleges he lost the encrypted keys when his home computer network was hacked in February 2020. Police are investigating.
Wright, who is bringing the case through his Seychelles-based Tulip Trading firm, concedes he is a controversial figure since alleging in 2016 that he wrote the bitcoin white paper - which first outlined the technology behind the digital assets - under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. 
The claim is hotly disputed.
The Australian, who is autistic and lives in Britain with his wife and two of his three children, alleges in his latest lawsuit that developers have breached their duties to act in the best interests of the rightful owner of globally-traded assets.
""Our client has always maintained that he created bitcoin to operate within existing laws and that in the event of loss or theft, where legitimate ownership can be proven, the developers have a duty to ensure recovery,"" said Paul Ferguson, a partner at law firm Ontier, which is representing Wright.
The case is being brought against the developers of four networks - Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV), Bitcoin Core (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin Cash ABC (ABC) - at addresses in continental Europe, the United States, New Zealand, Australia and Japan, a court filing seen by Reuters showed.
One of the defendants, Peter Todd, said he and others were not involved in day-to-day network development, that Wright had not proven his ownership and that bitcoin should not be subject to ""arbitrary seizure"".
""As this very case shows, if we allow people to get coins seized and reassigned by court order, that puts your coins at risk of being stolen by abuses of those fallible processes,"" he said by email.
Other defendants were not immediately available.

Bitcoin, which surged to hit a record of almost $65,000 in April, was trading at $56,749 on Wednesday afternoon.

The question now is, will it recover as the broader shipping industry gradually recovers with the reopening of the global economy? Let’s find out.Like most shipping companies, Athens, Greece-based international shipper Seanergy Maritime Holdings Corp. (SHIP) suffered a major setback from COVID-19 related travel and other restrictions. Consequently, the stock lost more than 56% over the past year to close yesterday’s trading session at $1.09. It is currently trading 81.6% below its $5.92 52-week high.
As the global economy gradually reopens, the demand for several commodities, including coal, iron ore and steel, is expected to grow in the coming months, which will increase the demand for shipping.
But even though SHIP transports primarily iron ore through its dry bulk transportation services, it is not well-positioned to capitalize on the shipping industry’s recovery in the near term, and so a question hangs as to the degree the company’s operations and its stock price can recover lost ground?

Investing.com -- Array Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:ARRY) stumbled more than 34% as it pulled guidance amid a surge in costs.
The manufacturer of ground-mounted systems used in solar energy projects reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization that was below expectations because of higher than expected logistics costs. Despite record demand, increases in ""unprecedented"" steel and shipping costs will hurt results, the company said in a statement.
“At the same time as we are seeing record demand for solar, our industry is contending with increases in steel and shipping costs that are unprecedented both in their magnitude and rate of change. From Q1 2020 to Q1 2021, spot prices of hot rolled coil steel, the primary raw material used in our products, more than doubled and have continued to increase in the second quarter with spot prices up over 10% since April 1st.   
""Steel represents almost half of our cost of goods sold and we do not hold large amounts of steel inventory, so a significant increase in the price of steel over a short period of time can negatively impact our results,"" Chief Executive Officer Jim Fusar said. ""The continuing increases in both steel and freight costs will impact our margins in the second quarter and potentially in subsequent quarters if prices do not normalize.""
The news comes as inflation hit its highest in more than a decade, up 4.2% on the year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Commodity prices are jumping as demand pops after the U.S. pumped trillions of dollars into the economy and parts of the world return to pre-pandemic times.   
Quoting activity for the company's products is at the highest levels yet and Array is planning on passing costs onto customers, among other tactics to handle the high prices.       
“We are not able to affirm our previously provided guidance for the full year,"" said Chief Financial Officer Nipul Patel. ""We expect to update our guidance once we have completed the review of all of our open purchase orders and commodity and shipping prices remain stable for a long enough period of time to give us confidence in using them to develop a forecast for the remainder of the year.""

658,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2021 10:18AM ET</span>",Bankers quit London as Brexit relocations to EU step up,"By Pamela Barbaglia, Tommy Wilkes and Gwénaëlle Barzic
LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) - Investment banks are shifting more rainmakers out of London to financial centres across the European Union, accelerating the pace of moves after the pandemic and uncertainty over Britain's access to the bloc slowed relocations. 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS),  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) are among those moving senior bankers, according to sources at the lenders, as European regulators push banks to better staff their EU offices and travel restrictions ease. Local hiring has also increased.
The lack of a breakthrough in talks for a meaningful deal between Brussels and London on financial services post-Brexit has added to the impetus. Client-facing bankers in London are required a ""chaperone"" based inside the bloc whenever they speak to clients, spurring some to relocate to avoid that complication when sealing deals.
Lifestyle choices are also playing their part, with traders and other senior staff moving too. Working from home during the pandemic enabled some bankers to leave London for warmer continental climes, mirroring a shift by Wall Street executives to Miami during the height of the COVID outbreak in New York.
Some European bankers are now looking at making the shift permanent.
""There is Brexit but not only, there is a post-Covid phenomenon too,"" said Emmanuel Goldstein, Morgan Stanley's France chief executive, explaining that some French bankers were returning home having spent their entire careers overseas.
Morgan Stanley will add 50 staff to its 150-strong Paris office by end-2021 and plans to double in size by 2024 through a mix of relocations and local hiring as it expands its central Parisian hub, Goldstein said.
Barclays' head of M&A for Europe and the Middle East, Pier Luigi Colizzi, has recently moved to Milan and will run the region's deals team from there, two sources familiar with the lender said, making him one of the few regional M&A heads based outside of London.
The bank has also beefed up its offices in Paris and Frankfurt with local hires, poaching senior M&A bankers from BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) and  Greenhill  (NYSE:GHL) & Co.
Goldman Sachs' head of European corporate and sovereign derivatives, Alessandro Dusi, has moved to Milan, where overall headcount has swelled to about 60 from 20 in 2017, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. In its Madrid office, Goldman now has 60 staff, double pre-Brexit levels, a second source close to the bank said.
Barclays and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.
Predictions of an exodus of tens of thousands from London after the 2016 Brexit referendum have not yet materialised -- consultancy EY calculates that 7,600 Brexit-related financial services jobs had left London up until March, a fraction of London's half-a-million financial workforce.
But bankers and analysts say many of the moves are still to happen.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) is to shift around 200 more employees into the EU from London this year including traders, bringing total relocations since the referendum to some 400 with the largest number in Paris, a person familiar with the plans said.
Financial lobby group Paris Europlace in 2016 predicted Brexit would create 10,000 new finance jobs in Paris by 2025. To date, fewer than half of those jobs have materialised but it's sticking with its forecast.
Up to 35,000 London financial jobs could eventually disappear, said William Wright of think tank New Financial.
The European Central Bank's bank supervisor, Andrea Enria, this month said that he understood the pandemic had slowed down relocations and the ECB's objective was not ""to put people in chains and move them to Frankfurt"".
But he stressed banks need to ensure people in charge of interactions with European clients and managing risk are inside the bloc.
""There are banks that have done the 'full monty' and are already there and we're fully satisfied and there are banks that have done much less,"" he said.
PARIS AHEAD
Expectations Frankfurt would emerge the biggest beneficiary of 7,600 Brexit job moves to date have been confounded, with Paris attracting the most people, according to EY, which estimates 2,800 jobs have gone to Paris. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), for example, has 400-odd staff in the French capital.
Other cities including Milan, Madrid and Amsterdam are also luring senior figures as banks give employees more leeway about where to work.
The Bank of France's banking supervisory arm, ACPR, said by December 2020, 50 financial firms from Britain had obtained authorisation in Paris, representing almost 2,500 jobs transferred to the French capital, along with at least 170 billion euros in assets. (Graphic: Paris ahead for Brexit moves, https://graphics.reuters.com/BREXIT-BANKS/yxmvjmndopr/chart.png) 
""We are seeing an acceleration of jobs in investment banking and trading activities after a slowdown due to COVID,"" said Arnaud de Bresson, Paris Europlace's managing director, adding that bankers had chosen Paris because of its proximity to London, the lifestyle and its ""capital markets culture.""
Morgan Stanley's Goldstein said there was ""a new found attractiveness"" for working in France today, pointing to a more pro-business climate under President Emmanuel Macron.
According to estimates from the city of Frankfurt, it expects 2,000 new Brexit-related jobs created by end-2022, up from the 1,500 new jobs created in Frankfurt by end-2019.
A senior banker at UBS said some employees had relocated to Italy or the Netherlands rather than Frankfurt for personal reasons, and the city's bland image and relatively small size didn't help.
""We have to do more to promote it,"" the banker said.
Bankers say they have struggled to find sufficient skilled staff in Frankfurt and that German regulators' inexperience versus French supervisors in overseeing several major investment banks had frustrated some American banks in particular.
Still, Frankfurt offices are expanding hiring too. Andreas Halin, founder of Global Mind Executive Search Consultants, said senior bankers had realised they ""cannot hide behind COVID"" and were under regulatory pressure to expand Frankfurt headcount.
While Paris is ahead for staffing numbers, no city has emerged a single EU capital markets hub. 

Germany is the preferred destination for EU legal bank entities, while Paris has won trading-related divisions. Amsterdam has gained much of the stock and swap trading departing London, as well as trading platforms, but few new jobs. 
New York has meanwhile emerged the global winner in derivatives, winning a bigger volume of the interest rate swap trading leaving London than the EU.

659,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 12, 2021 10:09AM ET</span>","Manchin, Other Democrats Back Biden Plan to End Carried Interest","(Bloomberg) -- Three Senate Democrats, including key moderate Joe Manchin, expressed support for the Biden administration’s proposal to end a long-standing tax break beloved by Wall Street.
Senators Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Sherrod Brown of Ohio joined with West Virginia’s Manchin to introduce legislation that would end the carried interest tax breaks used by private equity money managers and others to lower their tax bills. President Joe Biden proposed to eliminate the tax preference to help fund his $1.8 trillion social-spending focused American Families Plan released last month.
“The carried interest loophole is yet another example of Wall Street executives exploiting our tax code to pad their pockets rather than invest in workers and Main Street,” Brown, chair of the Senate Banking Committee, said in a joint statement by the trio on their legislation.
The bill would require that carried interest profits -- which under current law can be taxed as low as 20% -- be subject to the same tax rates as other income. Under Biden’s proposal, the top income tax rate would climb to 39.6% from the current 37%.
Manchin has long been a proponent of killing carried-interest preferences, and his involvement in the bill signals that Democrats are united on at least some of Biden’s proposals to boost taxes on the wealthiest Americans. Manchin has expressed some skepticism about other parts of Biden’s plan, however, such as the corporate tax rate. Manchin has said he supports raising that to 25%, from the current 21%, and viewed Biden’s proposed 28% as too high.
Carried interest has been under attack from both Republicans and Democrats for years, though the financial industry has successfully blunted efforts to remove it. The tax break is important to many donors to both parties, particularly those representing New York, such as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.
President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax overhaul limited the benefit, but fell short of ending it all together.
The bid to end carried interest is one of several plans that Biden is pursing as he seeks to raise tax revenues to fund his economic agenda. Biden is also proposing to tax all capital gains for those earning $1 million or more at 39.6%, up from a 20% base rate.
Eliminating carried interest would have limited budgetary effects, though it may prove popular politically. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that ending the tax break would raise only $15 billion over a decade -- a small fraction of the more than $4 trillion that Biden is seeking to fund his full longer-term economic agenda.

660,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2021 09:52AM ET</span>",Airline CEOs call for summit to speed relaunch of UK-US travel,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Bosses of major U.S. and UK airlines called on Tuesday for a summit between the two governments to speed the reopening of transatlantic travel, still paralyzed even though the countries have among the world's highest COVID-19 vaccination rates.
""The airline industry needs adequate lead time to establish a plan for restarting air services, including scheduling aircraft and crews for these routes as well as for marketing and selling tickets,"" said the letter to the transport chiefs of both countries.
It was signed by the CEOs of American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), United Airlines, British Airways , Virgin Atlantic and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU).
Flights between the United States and Britain, normally some of the world's busiest international long-haul routes, are still largely stalled even as both countries are loosening COVID-19 restrictions and travelers are making summer holiday plans. Britain has administered the most vaccine doses per capita of any big country, and the United States is close behind.
MANAGING RISK
Willie Walsh, the former British Airways boss who now heads global airline body IATA, voiced exasperation over what he described as a failure by governments to ""manage the net risk"" proportionately.
""You see some politicians just afraid to make decisions because they're afraid of the consequences, whereas (in) the airline industry we live with that all the time,"" Walsh said at a virtual event on Wednesday. ""Sometimes it's necessary for us to be vocal and try to force that approach upon people.""
Since March 2020, the United States has barred nearly all non-U.S. citizens who have recently been in Britain. For its own citizens, the U.S. State Department on Monday eased its UK travel advisory, lowering it to a ""Level 3: Reconsider Travel"" rating.
Britain requires visitors from the United States to quarantine on arrival. Next week it is set to lift a nearly five-month ban on most international travel by its own residents, but it has so far excluded the United States from a small ""green list"" of destinations where British passengers can travel for leisure and return without a quarantine.
A spokesman for U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg noted that G7 Transport Ministers met last week ""to discuss the complexities around reopening international travel and how to do so safely.
""These conversations are ongoing. The department will be reviewing the letter with other agencies as part of the whole of government approach to COVID recovery.""
The British Embassy in Washington did not immediately comment.
A coalition of U.S. and European travel, airline, union, business and airport groups called last week for a full reopening of the U.S.-UK air travel market ""as soon as safely possible.""
Investment bank Cowen and Co said in a research note it believes ""the Biden Administration needs to make a decision about international travel within the next week to 10 days...

""Americans are making their summer travel plans now, and without a decision on Europe soon, we believe they will continue to travel"" to other destinations.
Travel firm TUI said on Wednesday it still expects a strong 2021 travel season, assuming some of its best destinations are added to Britain's ""green list"" later this month.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets resumed their sell-off at the open on Wednesday after figures showing that inflation accelerated even more quickly than feared in April.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics said the consumer price index rose 0.8% on the month, and 4.2% on the year, the highest annual rate of inflation since the eve of the financial crisis in 2008. 
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 140 points, or 0.4%, at 34,137 points, while the S&P 500 was down 0.7% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.1%.
Surging prices for second-hand cars and trucks accounted for around one-third of the monthly increase. However, stocks of used car dealerships were unimpressed by confirmation of a trend that has already been in evidence for some time, driving up their prices by over 25% in the last two months alone. CarMax (NYSE:KMX) stock fell 1.8% and AutoNation (NYSE:AN) stock fell 2.1%.
The market responded to the figures by pricing in a first rate hike from the Federal Reserve before the end of next year, rather than in 2023 as the central bank is currently guiding. Hiowever, Richard Clarida, the Fed's vice-chair who is widely seen as one of the most influential figures when it comes to setting interest rate policy, again downplayed what he said was a 'transitory' spike in price.
“Readings on inflation on a year-over-year basis have recently increased and are likely to rise somewhat further before moderating later this year,” he said in the text of remarks to be delivered to the National Association for Business Economics on Wednesday. However, “I expect inflation to return to -- or perhaps run somewhat above -- our 2% longer-run goal in 2022 and 2023.”
Among the early movers were Fubotv (NYSE:FUBO) stock, which rose 17% after the sports streaming company said its revenue more than doubled in the first quarter. It also raised its guidance for the full year. The stock is still down by more than two-thirds from its peak at the end of 2020, however. 
Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) stock slid 6.4%, extending its rollercoaster ride as a burst of short-covering in the wake of its earnings report proved short-lived.
Elsewhere,  Alibaba  ADRs (NYSE:BABA) stock gained 0.5% after an upgrade from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s analysts, while Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) ADRs rose 6.8% after the U.S. government took it off a blacklist of companies owned or controlled by the Chinese military, effectively ending restrictions on U.S. investors owning the stock.."

LONDON (Reuters) -Holiday company TUI Group expects a strong 2021 summer season and will operate 75% of pre-pandemic capacity, with rising levels of vaccinations set to fuel last-minute bookings, it said on Wednesday. 
The pandemic has hammered TUI, the world's biggest holiday group, and while it sunk to a 1.3 billion euro ($1.6 billion)loss for the six months to the end of March, it said that the worst was behind it as European resorts start to reopen.
New bookings have doubled since April, with customers from Germany and Belgium driving demand for holidays after winter lockdowns, and the group expects UK bookings to catch up as more destinations are opened in the next few weeks. 
Those bookings should help relieve the pressure on heavily indebted TUI, whose finances have been strained by 14 months of COVID-19 restrictions. 
""When the business is coming back, as it is right now, liquidity will be coming into the system,"" TUI Chief Executive Fritz Joussen told reporters. 
""When you see the bookings coming in like now...(we) will make profits in Q4,"" he said referring to the busy three months to the end of September.
Extending the summer season into October and November was a possibility given the high demand for holidays, he added. 
BRITAIN LAGS
Shares in the group, which have jumped 40% since the start of the year, traded down 3.2% to 414 pence at 0930 GMT, reflecting the risks over a smooth reopening of resorts.
""The summer capacity assumption is massively reliant on the opening up of restrictions,"" said Redburn analyst Alex Brignall. 
Britain, which along with Germany is one of TUI's two biggest markets, last week said that people could travel again from May 17, but with only a limited list of destinations not requiring quarantine on return.
Some of TUI's most popular destinations, such as Spain and Greece, were kept off Britain's ""green list"" of low-risk destinations, but the company said it expects this to change when the list is reviewed at the end of the month. 
""(When) everybody opens, the Brits, will at some point in time think, it's maybe a good idea,"" said Joussen.
The return of big-spending Britons would be a welcome boost for southern Europe economies. In Greece, tourism accounts for about a fifth of the economy and jobs market, while Spain used to derive a tenth of its gross domestic product from tourism.
Britain did put Portugal on its list, which TUI said led to a spike in bookings.

For now, TUI, which took 23 million people on holiday annually before the pandemic, said it has a total of 2.6 million summer bookings, 69% lower than at this time in 2019.

Investing.com – Fubotv (NYSE:FUBO) shares were up by almost a fifth in Wednesday’s premarket as the streaming service gave an outlook that was brighter than last time’s, owing to more than 100% growth in both subscribers and revenue in the March quarter.
The company now expects its 2021 revenue between $520 million and $530 million, the midpoint of which represents an increase of 101% year-over-year. This is higher than the 78% increase the previous guidance gave.
This subscriber outlook implies full year 2021 net additions of at least 282,000, 22% higher than 2020 net additions of 232,000.
Fubotv said its approximately 303,000 net subscriber additions since the first quarter of 2020 resulted in subscriber growth of 105% year-over-year.
The company clocked a 135% year-on-year jump in revenues to $119.7 million in March quarter. Net subscriber additions were approximately 43,000, a reversal from a decline of approximately 28,000 in the first quarter of 2020.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) -Israel's Wix (NASDAQ:WIX).com on Wednesday forecast more than $14 billion in revenue from existing customers over the next 10 years, saying the COVID crisis has led to more small businesses using its services to build and operate websites.
After higher-than-expected first-quarter revenue, Wix also slightly raised its 2021 outlook.
""The growth that we experienced last year is actually continuing this year,"" Wix Chief Financial Officer Lior Shemesh told Reuters. Due to the coronavirus, ""merchants changed their behaviour. We are not going to go back."" 
He said the projection of $14 billion in revenue stems from Wix's large marketing campaigns which currently eat into its profit but help to grow its market share. Revenue would be even higher from future customers, Shemesh said.
""Marketing is for future"" customers, he added.
As of this quarter, Wix has stopped publishing the amount of users it has, but in February, it had 200 million worldwide, with 5.5 million premium customers at the end of 2020.
The company, which operates on a ""freemium"" model, noted conversions from free to paid services are growing as Wix adds more tools to help firms manage their business in the wake of acquisitions.
Wix -- whose Nasdaq listed shares are up 16% so far this year -- raised its outlook for 2021 and expects revenue of $1.28-$1.29 billion for annual growth of 29-30% versus an estimate of $1.272-$1.286 billion made in February.
""While businesses increasingly require online commerce capabilities, we believe our growth will continue throughout the year,"" the company said.
In the first quarter, it lost 54 cents per share excluding one-time items versus a loss of 1 cent per share a year earlier as financial, research and development and other expenses rose.
Revenue grew 41% to $304.1 million.

Analysts had forecast a loss of 66 cents per share on revenue of $295.2 million, I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv showed.
For the second quarter, Wix projects revenue of $308-$312 million, up 30-32% from last year. Analysts are forecasting Wix will post revenue of $312.3 million in the April-June period.

LISBON (Reuters) -The mailbox of a well-known hotel in the heart of Lisbon was bombarded with queries as soon as Britain announced it was including the country on its travel ""green list"" this summer.
Manuel Pinto, Mundial Hotel's director, is over the moon that British holidaymakers, who are essential to Portugal's tourism industry, will be able to return after a five-month travel ban, giving a much-needed boost to the struggling sector.
""I was delighted, not only on a personal level but for our country,"" Pinto said, standing in Mundial's rooftop bar, adding that British visitors had already booked around 4,000 room nights at the hotel this year.
Portugal was one of just 12 countries and territories to be added to Britain's ""green list"", allowing Britons to visit them from May 17 without needing to quarantine, but still requiring two COVID-19 tests - one before returning to the UK and one on arrival into the UK.
Travel search website Skyscanner said there was a 616% increase in bookings to Portugal last week compared to the previous one, prompting airlines to add capacity to existing routes and, in some cases, launch news ones to meet demand.
EasyJet and Ryanair have both added more flights to Portugal from the UK for this summer. EasyJet said it was putting up to 100,000 extra seats on routes over the May-October period, while Ryanair is adding 195,000 in May-June.
Holiday company TUI said on Wednesday that demand for Portugal was so strong it planned to use its bigger 787 Dreamliner planes, which it tends to use for long haul trips, on UK-to-Portugal routes to add capacity.
Still, a tourism sector scarred by Britain's last-minute changes to travel rules last summer and Christmas is braced for another turbulent year, and Portugal has yet to spell out exactly what rules would apply to Britons arriving.
Some executives said they were only too aware of how quickly the tide could turn again if coronavirus cases rose or governments changed their mind.
""I have to be cautious,"" Chitra Stern, CEO of luxury hotel chain Martinhal, said. ""People are still booking refundable rates.""
COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
Other popular holiday destinations for Britons like Spain and Cyprus are on the ""amber list"", meaning travellers would need to quarantine for 10 days upon return and take two tests.
Tourism plays a crucial role in Portugal, representing around 15% of gross domestic product in 2019. But it suffered its worst year since the mid-1980s in 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic kept visitors away.
Last year, only 460,000 Britons visited Portugal, from 2 million the previous year. 
Eliderico Viegas, president of Algarve hotel association AHETA, said hotel owners were aware they were benefiting from the fact that other countries faced greater restrictions.
""Our main competitors have been left out of the 'green list' for now,"" he said. ""It is a competitive advantage for us.""
Britain's Thomas Cook said bookings had tripled compared to a week ago, with trips to Portugal accounting for a majority of that rise.
Airbnb bookings also started increasing and British airline easyJet (LON:EZJ) said UK bookings for Portugal surged after the announcement, although it declined to provide figures.

Yet the high cost of COVID-19 testing and limited availability of flights pushing up prices, combined with the fact that the pandemic is still present, means the summer season is hard to forecast, even for Portugal.
""It's not just a matter of a recovery of traditional flying, it's a complete reshaping,"" travel consultant for Bain & Co, Geoffrey Weston, said. ""That's why this is so hard to judge.""

Investing.com – Carnival (NYSE:CCL) shares were down 1% in premarket Wednesday following the company’s decision to cancel most cruises through July.
It said it is working on a possible July restart in the U.S. on select ships.
The cruise operator has given its customers the option to cancel without penalty by May 31 and get a full refund.
Last week, Carnival had notified its guests that its ship Splendor's pause out of Sydney was extended by another month, as it cancelled sailings from August 19 to September 17.
Cruise operators had last month submitted their plans to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for permission to resume operations, with a goal of setting sail from U.S. ports by mid-summer.
Cruise liners have been amongst the hardest hit by the restrictions imposed by several countries last year to control the pandemic. But as vaccinations roll out and life at many places returns to normal, there were hopes that travel and leisure businesses will boom. Those hopes may have to wait a little longer now."

LONDON (Reuters) - German carmaker BMW plans to unveil a limited series hydrogen fuel cell model SUV in 2022 as the company continues to research zero-emission alternatives to battery-electric cars, the company's top executive said on Wednesday.
Speaking at the carmaker's annual shareholder meeting, Chief Executive Officer Oliver Zipse said the company plans a small production run of a hydrogen fuel-cell powered x5 SUV next year.
Most of the auto industry is focusing its efforts on developing battery-electric cars to meet tightening emission standards in Europe and China. 
But BMW is one of a small number of carmakers that currently sees possibilities for the mass adoption of hydrogen fuel cells, which emit only water, and has said it is keeping its options open for the future. 
As well as offering the prospect of harmless emissions, hydrogen fuel cells also provide greater range than battery-electric cars, but there is very little fuelling infrastructure currently in place to support mass adoption of the technology.
Last December Japanese carmaker  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp unveiled its revamped Mirai hydrogen fuel cell car, in a fresh push to promote the zero-emission technology amid rapidly growing demand for electric vehicles.
BMW has forged an alliance with Toyota centred on developing fuel cells.
Japan's Honda Motor Co and South Korea's Hyundai Motor have developed fuel-cell models.

Earlier this year Jaguar Land Rover said it was investing in developing hydrogen fuel cells in anticipation of a future shift to hydrogen to power vehicles.
JLR, owned by India's  Tata Motors  (NYSE:TTM), will have prototypes using hydrogen fuel cells on Britain's roads within the next year, it said, as part of a long-range investment plan.

MILAN (Reuters) - Andrea Orcel stamped his mark on UniCredit within weeks of taking the reins, axing management committees and a dual head structure that had irked some top investors while hiring key lieutenants to oversee strategy and relations at the Italian bank.
Orcel, a veteran UBS and Merrill Lynch dealmaker who almost landed the top job at Spanish bank Santander (MC:SAN), was hired by UniCredit after its board fell out with his predecessor, Jean Pierre Mustier, over strategy.
""I have heard your concerns about the complexity of our business ... I have felt your frustration about some of the decisions that have been made; confusion about where ultimate responsibility lies; and the resulting lack of accountability,"" Orcel said in a message to UniCredit staff on Wednesday.
UniCredit is struggling with profitability after Mustier, a French investment banker, focused on repairing its balance sheet and replenishing capital reserves, while failing to land a mooted cross-border merger.
Orcel's appointment as CEO signals a new expansionist era for UniCredit, which underwent a major retrenchment under Mustier who shed 15 billion euros ($18 billion) in assets. In a break with his predecessor, Orcel said last week he could consider mergers and acquisitions to drive revenue and profit growth.
A hard-hitting investment banker behind many deals in financial services during his decades at UBS and Merrill Lynch, Orcel has also pledged to address operational flaws.
""I have spent the last few weeks speaking and listening to our people,"" he said as UniCredit announced that it was removing the bank's twin heads and appointing a chief technology officer as part of a broad overhaul.
It is also replacing its executive management committee, which is made up of 27 people, with a 15-member group executive committee and cutting its internal committees to 15-20 from 44.
""I promised you a less complex, simplified organisation,"" Orcel said ahead of unveiling a new business plan later this year. (Graphic: Unicredit (MI:CRDI) top management structure, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yzdpxzxzxpx/Unicredit%20top%20management%20structure.png) 
Underpinning Orcel's pledge to place technology at the core of every decision, UniCredit hired Jingle Pang, who oversaw the digital transformation of Chinese insurance and banking conglomerate Ping An, as its new digital and information officer.
STAKEHOLDER FOCUS 
UniCredit said as part of the changes it is axing its Western Europe and Finance & Controls divisions and forming a CEO office to include a stakeholder engagement arm as well as a ""strategy and optimisation"" division.
The latter will be led by Fiona Melrose, former head of strategy at UBS's investment banking arm before joining Santander's strategy division in 2019.
The moves come after Orcel, 57, only narrowly defeated a shareholder revolt over the terms and size of his up to 7.5 million euro ($9 million) remuneration package, securing just 54.1% of votes at a general meeting last month.
In an apparent indication of bridge building, Orcel has engaged Joanna Carss, another former Merrill and UBS ally, to run the new stakeholder engagement function at UniCredit. 
""On paper the changes are very positive ... with people and digital technologies as key drivers. Success will hinge on executives holding the key roles,"" said Alessandro Zattoni, an Italian academic who chairs the International Corporate Governance Society.
UniCredit will appoint Niccolo Ubertalli as head of Italian operations, having previously been in charge of Eastern Europe together with Gianfranco Bisagni.
Like the heads for Germany, Central Europe and Eastern Europe, Ubertalli will now report directly to Orcel in a move that UniCredit said reflected Italy's ""critical importance"".
Mustier had sought to reduce UniCredit's exposure to its debt-laden home country, which people close to the matter have said was one of the reasons he clashed with the board.
Michael Diederich will continue to lead Germany, Bisagni will be in charge of Central Europe and Teodora Petkova, head of UniCredit's Bulgarian unit, becomes head of Eastern Europe.
Stefano Porro and TJ Lim retain their current roles as, respectively, chief financial officer and chief risk officer, as does Richard Burton head of commercial investment banking.

Ranieri de Marchis remains chief operating officer.

672,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2021 06:58AM ET</span>",SoftBank joins corporate heavyweights with $37 billion Vision Fund profit,"By Sam Nussey and Tim Kelly
TOKYO (Reuters) -SoftBank Group Corp on Wednesday reported a record 4.03 trillion yen ($37 billion) Vision Fund unit profit from a fourth-quarter gain on Coupang, putting it among the world's top earning firms a year after an unprecedented loss.
Group net profit was 4.99 trillion yen ($45.88 billion) in the year ended March, beating the $42.5 billion made by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) in its last business year. 
""This is not a result to make us puffed up with pride... I don't want it to be a one time thing,"" founder and CEO Masayoshi Son told a news conference. 
The profit compares with an 962 billion yen loss a year earlier after teetering tech bets https://www.reuters.com/article/softbank-group-results-idINKBN22U0KM depressed the value of SoftBank's portfolio. 
""It's clearly validation of Masa's thesis,"" Navneet Govil, Vision Fund's chief financial officer, told Reuters in an interview. 
Market enthusiasm for tech stocks drove the public listing of SoftBank-backed e-commerce firm Coupang and used-car trading platform Auto1 Group and the rising share price of ride-hailing firm Uber (NYSE:UBER) during the quarter.
To sustain SoftBank's position among the global corporate elite, Son will have to replicate that performance with other yet-to-list companies in the Vision fund portfolio. Son has likened that to laying golden eggs. 
Candidates including ride-hailing firm Didi, TikTok owner Bytedance and truck service platform Full Truck Alliance https://www.reuters.com/article/us-full-truck-alliance-listing/chinese-startup-full-truck-alliance-to-launch-15-billion-ipo-source-idUSKBN2CS1RK have strong revenue growth, healthy market share and a clear path to profitability, according to Govil. 
These companies are ""sizeable investments with significant value to be unlocked,"" he said. 
Much of the Vision Fund's gain, however, is on paper with the value of the portfolio locked up in the stock market amid concern over frothy valuations and a boom in special purpose acquisition vehicles (SPACs) which has drawn regulatory scrutiny.
The total fair value of the first $100 billion Vision Fund and the smaller second $10 billion fund was $154 billion at the end of March, with SoftBank distributing $22.3 billion to limited partners.
SoftBank has hiked its committed capital in the second fund to $30 billion, reflecting the breadth of investment opportunities, Govil said. 
Two of SoftBank's highest profile bets, space sharing firm WeWork and ride-hailing firm Grab, have outlined plans to list via SPAC mergers, with Vision Fund reportedly in talks to use its own such vehicle to list portfolio company Mapbox.
Son said that the group's SPACs are an option for listing portfolio companies but with many investments they are not the main method for listing. 
The Grab deal offers further upside for the Vision Fund should the transaction go through, Govil said. 
The group's trading arm, SB Northstar, is expanding dealmaking this week leading a $1 billion investment in acquisitive e-commerce firm THG.
SB Northstar and the broader group recorded a 233 billion yen loss on investments in listed stocks and derivatives as efforts to work cash reserves outside the Vision Fund sputter.
Son, who was dressed in a trademark polo neck and blazer, expressed regret for high profile failures like WeWork and supply chain financing firm Greensill Capital but said he ""regrets even more missing great opportunities for investment."" 
SoftBank has completed a 2.5 trillion yen buyback programme launched last year which pushed the stock price to two-decade highs in March. The end of the buyback pulls support at a time when shares are sliding in line with weakness in U.S. tech stocks.

No decision has been made on further buybacks, Son said.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening lower Wednesday, continuing the recent selloff ahead of the eagerly-awaited April inflation release.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 130 points, or 0.4%, S&P 500 Futures traded 18 points, or 0.4%, lower, and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 85 points, or 0.6%.
The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closed sharply lower Tuesday, dropping almost 500 points, or 1.4%, its worst day since February, while the S&P 500 slipped 0.9% and the Nasdaq Composite ended the day as the relative outperformer, closing down just 0.1%
Investors have started fretting about a potential sharp rise in prices, and what that means in terms of a speedy economic recovery and the Federal Reserve’s ultra-easy monetary policies.
St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard on Tuesday joined the chorus of Fed speakers that have been at pains to state that it’s still not time to change the central bank’s accommodative stance. 
However, the latest consumer price data, due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), could well raise the pressure on the policy makers. The year-over-year reading will be distorted by base effects from last year's pandemic-induced plunge in energy prices, but consensus is for a 3.6% gain, which would be its highest since 2008.
Meanwhile, U.S. national average retail gasoline prices have risen above $3 a gallon for the first time since 2014, after a cyberattack shut operations at Colonial Pipeline, the main supply link for the East Coast.
Colonial has only restarted a small section in the five days since the shutdown, and doesn’t expect substantial restoration of service before the weekend.
Oil prices pushed higher Wednesday as a drop in U.S. crude stockpiles reassured traders that the recovery in demand remains on track.
The official government inventory report, due later Wednesday, is expected to largely confirm the American Petroleum Institute’s report. 
U.S. crude futures traded 1.2% higher at $66.04 a barrel, the Brent contract rose 1.1% to $69.31. Additionally, gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,834.60/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.2125.
In the corporate sector, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) won its fight against an EU order to pay about 250 million euros ($303 million) in back taxes to Luxembourg, while Electronic Arts' (NASDAQ:EA) outlook for the full year turned out stronger than expectations and Carnival (NYSE:CUK) pushed back almost all cruise sailings to at least the end of July.
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), and its partner BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX), could also be in focus as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will meet later Wednesday to discuss recommendations for the use of the drugmaker’s Covid-19 vaccine in children aged 12 to 15.

674,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2021 06:51AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Tesla seeks entry into U.S. renewable fuel credit market - sources,"By Jarrett Renshaw and Stephanie Kelly
(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc is seeking to enter the multi-billion dollar U.S. renewable credit market, hoping to profit from the Biden administration's march toward new zero-emission goals, two sources familiar with the matter said.
The electric car maker is one of at least eight companies with a pending application at the Environmental Protection Agency tied to power generation and renewable credits, the sources said. The EPA produces a list of pending applications with some details, but not companies' names.
Tesla's entry could potentially reshape the renewable credit market, established in the mid-2000s to boost investment in the U.S. biofuel industry. The market generated some 18 billion credits in 2020 and is currently dominated by ethanol producers. Tesla's application would likely be tied to the production of electricity associated with biogas. 
The Biden administration is expected to review the EPA applications and lay out how electric vehicles could qualify for tradable credits under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) this summer, the two sources said.
The move could represent the largest expansion of the RFS program that was created by President George W. Bush and aimed at boosting rural America and weaning the country off oil imports. 
The entry of Tesla and other electric vehicle makers to the renewable energy scheme could attract investment for a much-needed infrastructure network, including charging stations, for electric vehicles.
However, it is likely to anger some in the U.S. refining industry who would need to buy the credits, known as RINs, generated by Tesla and other alternative fuel providers, essentially subsidizing an electric car company that seeks to put petrochemical refiners out of business. 
Rural farmers could view Tesla's entry as the Biden White House prioritizing electric vehicles over biofuels as an answer to the climate crisis.
BIOGAS LOGISTICS 
In 2016, just before the Obama administration exited office, the EPA published a proposal seeking comment on how best to structure credits for renewable electricity that is used as a transportation fuel. 
The proposal largely sat dormant during the Trump administration, which spent most of its time on fuel credits trying to find common ground among rivals in the corn and oil industries.
Electricity from biogas - mainly pulled from the nation's landfills - is already eligible for generating credits under the RFS program, but the EPA has never approved applications to do so because the agency hasn't yet figured out the logistical issues.
Key questions include how to trace the credit-eligible biogas from its origin through to a car's battery, and who along that supply chain should be allowed to claim the lucrative credits.
Under the RFS, refiners must blend biofuels like corn-based ethanol into their fuel pool or purchase compliance credits in a credit market, where prices have swung wildly in recent years.
The program has helped drive investment in ethanol plants in states like Iowa and Nebraska, but liquid fuels have been under attack from the Biden administration. 

Tesla would generate the most lucrative type of credits, known as D3s, which trade at a significant premium to the larger pool of traditional ethanol credits.
As well as building electric cars, Tesla is also investing in charging stations and large-scale batteries.

675,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2021 06:46AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Waymo, Cruise seek permits to charge for autonomous car rides in San Francisco","By Hyunjoo Jin and Paresh Dave
BERKELEY, Calif. (Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc’s Waymo and rival Cruise have applied for permits needed to start charging for rides and delivery using autonomous vehicles in San Francisco, state documents reviewed by Reuters showed, setting the stage for the biggest tests yet of their technology in a dense urban environment.
Neither company revealed when they intend to launch services. But they detailed contrasting deployment plans, with Waymo starting with ""drivered operations"" and Cruise expecting to deploy vehicles without humans behind the wheel. 
California's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) has yet to decide on the previously unreported applications made by Waymo on Jan. 19 and Cruise on March 29, according to the documents. The agency said it is still reviewing the applications.
The efforts come at a turning point for Waymo, which Google launched over a decade ago. Waymo has provided paid, driverless rides hailed through its app in the Phoenix suburb of Chandler since 2019. But it has failed to scale up Arizona operations as quickly as analysts once envisioned.
Its longtime chief executive, John Krafcik, stepped down in April and was replaced by two co-CEOs. 
Cruise, backed by General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Honda Motor Co Ltd and SoftBank Group Corp, has focused on San Francisco since its beginning. It said in the permit application it has logged 2 million autonomous driving miles (3.22 million km) in the city. 
Waymo said it has had over 83,000 autonomous miles in its proposed deployment area, according to its application.
""You have a faster path to meaningful revenue in dense urban environments such as San Francisco than in the suburbs such as Chandler,"" said Grayson Brulte, a consultant who advises companies around autonomous mobility strategies. 
Waymo told Reuters that the permit would allow it to ""complete paid deliveries in autonomous mode, with a driver behind the wheel."" The company said it could eventually offer passenger service without anyone else in the car.
Cruise did not have an immediate comment.
The companies would not be the first to obtain one of two permits required to operate robotaxis for hire in California. Silicon Valley startup Nuro in December became the only company to secure a DMV deployment permit. Nuro in March announced an unspecified investment from  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (NYSE:CMG), which said it was interested in new delivery systems. 
LIMITED OPERATION
If Waymo and Cruise secure DMV approval, they would next need a permit from the California Public Utilities Commission to begin charging passengers.
Until now, self-driving cars in San Francisco and Silicon Valley primarily have been used on a test basis, although the vehicles - with whirring lidar sensing gear on their roofs - have become an increasingly common sight. Cruise and Waymo plan to maintain some limits during commercial operations as public concerns grow over the safety of self-driving systems.
Waymo said in its application it would have a safety driver in its hybrid Chrysler Pacifica minivans and all-electric Jaguar I-Pace SUVs. They would operate around the clock, offering rides or transporting goods on roadways with posted speed limits of up to 65 mph in San Francisco and in the northern part of bordering San Mateo County. 
Waymo said it may switch off autonomous mode in specific areas such as freeway ramps and construction zones, or for heavy rain and wet roads. Cruise also said it may limit driverless deployment to ""certain routes"" and ""non-inclement weather conditions,"" without elaborating. 
Cruise said its service hours would be late evening to early morning with speeds of up to 30 mph, according to the documents. 
When ready for commercial deployment, the company would receive $1.35 billion from SoftBank's Vision Fund as part of an earlier investment agreement. 
The timeline for revenue-generating deployment of self-driving vehicles has been pushed back repeatedly.

""It's an incredibly difficult thing that we're trying to solve for,"" said Timothy Papandreou, a former Waymo employee who now leads consultancy Emerging Transport Advisors. 
This year, Waymo also has been discussing collaborating with San Francisco transportation authorities and university labs to secure an unspecified U.S. Department of Energy grant ""to investigate the use of AVs to provide first-/last-mile transit service"" in San Francisco, according to public records seen by Reuters.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Former Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor executive Greg Kelly denied helping ousted boss Carlos Ghosn hide earnings, saying at his trial in Tokyo on Wednesday that his only goal had been to retain a chief executive who could have been lured away by a rival automaker.
Ghosn escaped to Lebanon in Dec. 2019 hidden in carry-on luggage on a private jet that flew out of Kansai Airport, while he awaited trial on charges of financial wrongdoing, including understating his compensation in financial statements.
Kelly and Ghosn, who also denies the charges, have both said they are victims of a boardroom coup by former colleagues worried the latter would push through a merger between Nissan and Renault SA (OTC:RNLSY), its largest shareholder.
Taking the witness stand for the first time since his trial began in September, Kelly said, ""I didn’t conspire with Mr. Ghosn or other people,"" according to a court pool report. 
Dressed usually in a dark suit and red striped tie, Kelly has sat quietly through months of testimony from witnesses such as former Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa, former vice president in charge of legal affairs Hari Nada and Toshiaki Ohnuma, an official who oversaw details of Ghosn's compensation.
Prosecutors have used that testimony to accuse Kelly of being an accomplice in a scheme to hide 9.3 billion yen ($86 million) of Ghosn's earnings over eight years through deferred payments.
That was prompted by rules introduced in 2010 by financial regulators to force company executives earning more than 1 billion yen a year to disclose their compensation. 
Both Nada and Ohnuma, the head of Nissan's secretariat office, agreed to cooperate with prosecutors and did not face charges. 
Kelly, who has been on bail in Japan since his release from jail at the end of 2018, faces prosecution alone after Ghosn fled.
Kelly's wife, Dee, who lives with him in Japan, has attended most court sessions, sitting in the public gallery near her husband and taking notes. 
On Wednesday, Kelly also denied knowing details of Ghosn's remuneration before 2010, apart from being aware that Ghosn had cut the amount to keep it below the disclosure threshold.
He said Ohnuma was responsible for discussing compensation details and that any final decision was made by Ghosn.
If convicted, Kelly could face a jail term of up to 15 years and a fine of 10 million yen. Japan's conviction rate is about 99%, but a ruling may not come until next year. 

Ghosn also faces two separate breach of trust charges that he enriched himself at Nissan's expense through $5 million in payments to a Middle East car dealership, and temporarily transferred personal financial losses to his employer’s books. 
The trial of the American father and son, Michael Taylor and Peter Taylor, accused of helping him escape, begins in Tokyo on June 14, after U.S. authorities extradited the pair in March.

678,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2021 06:00AM ET</span>","Toyota unfazed by chip shortage, forecasts rebound in profit","By Eimi Yamamitsu
TOKYO (Reuters) -Toyota Motor Corp forecast its profit would bounce back to pre-pandemic levels this year, as the world's biggest automaker exuded confidence it can tackle a global chip shortage that has stung its rivals.
Japan's top automaker, which has been stockpiling the semiconductors that are used in everything from engine maintenance to car safety and entertainment systems, said on Wednesday it is not seeing any major short term impact from the shortage which has been baked into its forecasts.
Toyota also announced a $2.3 billion share buyback, a one-to-five stock split and set bigger targets for electric vehicles (EVs) production.
The upbeat forecast for the full fiscal year reinforces Toyota's robust growth momentum that saw its March-quarter profit almost doubling and deepens a performance divergence with its rivals, who are battling billions of dollars of lost revenue due to the chip shortage.
CFO Kenta Kon said Toyota, famous for its just-in-time inventory management, benefitted from efforts to improve its supply-chain management to mitigate the impact of natural disasters following the Fukushima earthquake in 2011.
""We are now able to make assessments of alternative products in a speedy matter. That is one of the factors of us being able to mitigate the impact of semiconductor supply shortages,"" he told a media briefing.
The Toyota executive warned against complacency, though, saying the shortage situation was still fluid and the impact in the second half of the fiscal year was uncertain.
Toyota surprised rivals and investors last quarter when it said its output would not be disrupted significantly by ongoing chip shortages even as Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford, Honda and Stellantis, among others, have been forced to slow or suspend some production.
The global auto industry has been grappling with that chip shortage since late last year, which was worsened in recent months by a fire at a chip plant in Japan and blackouts in Texas where a number of chipmakers have factories.
Toyota shares reversed course on Wednesday to rise 2.1% after the results, contrasting with a 10% tumble for smaller rival Nissan (OTC:NSANY) whose guidance disappointed investors.
Toyota, the maker of the RAV4 SUV crossover and Prius hybrid vehicles, almost doubled its fourth-quarter operating profit to 689.8 billion yen, beating an estimate of 641.5 billion yen from 10 analysts compiled by Refinitiv.
It forecast a 14% jump in profit to 2.50 trillion yen for the fiscal year that began on April 1 against an 8.4% profit decline for the year that just ended.
Toyota expects renewed demand in the United States, its biggest market, to drive that recovery and forecast overall sales to grow 6.4% to 10.55 million vehicles for the year.
Nissan, Japan's No.3 automaker, said on Tuesday it expects to break even this business year, defying expectations for a return to profitability.
Japan's second-biggest automaker Honda is due to report annual results on Friday.
Toyota also laid out on Wednesday its EV gameplan, saying 8 million of its vehicles would be electrified annually by 2030, or around 80% of its current yearly vehicle sales.
That target compared with Honda's aim to increase its ratio of EVs and fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) to 100% of all sales by 2040, and Volkswagen's 2025 deadline to overtake U.S. pioneer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and become the world's biggest seller of EVs.
Nissan has also set a goal to electrify all of its new models in key markets in the early 2030s.
Toyota executives took pains to defend the automaker's long-time strategy of selling a mix of fuel-efficient cars that suited each market - gasoline-electric hybrids and plug-in hybrids in some, and battery electric vehicles in others. 
""The solution has to be sustainable and practical,"" Chief Communications Officer Jun Nagata said.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Merck KGaA on Wednesday said that U.S. regulations that give priority to U.S. government contracts to purchase COVID-19 vaccines are a challenge as it seeks to meet soaring demand for its lab equipment and supplies across the globe.
""We are actively expanding our capacity to be able to supply this unprecedented and ever increasing demand. Is this being a challenge? Obviously it is being a challenge,"" Chief Executive Belen Garijo said in a media briefing when asked what impact the U.S. Defense Production Act is having on its ability to serve vaccine makers elsewhere in the world. 
She said U.S. law required that a preference be given to so-called rated state orders for COVID-19 programmes over any other orders. 
""For us, all our customers and all the other COVID-19 programmes are very crucial and we are making capacity expansion a top priority of our agenda,"" she said, pointing to investment projects both in the United States and Europe. 
Under the U.S. priority access programme, the government has laid claim not only to finished COVID-19 vaccines but also to vaccine components and equipment.
Germany's CureVac, which is gearing up to publish results of a COVID-19 vaccine trial, said last week that U.S. export restrictions on already tight supplies of materials were making it impossible to predict its short-term production ramp-up in Europe.
Merck in March unveiled plans to invest 25 million euros ($29.9 million) to make disposable plastic materials for bioreactors in France, an essential input for COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing.
The new site, Merck's first such facility in Europe, will likely come on stream at the end of this year, Garijo reiterated on Wednesday.

Merck in December announced a combined $47 million investment at U.S. production facilities in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, also to produce supplies for makers of COVID-19 vaccines and therapies.
Merck, which competes in lab equipment with Thermo Fisher (NYSE:TMO) and Sartorius, has another site for single-use plastic bags for bioreactors in Wuxi, China.

Flutter's London-listed shares fell more than 2% after the news.
The owner of Paddy Power, Betfair and PokerStars also said it was keeping the FanDuel floatation under review and was looking for a successor to King.
""With FanDuel well positioned for the next chapter of its growth and always an entrepreneur at heart, now is the time for me to take on new opportunities as the next step in my career,"" King said in a statement. 
Flutter said King had been the top boss at FanDuel for four years and that he had overseen the growth of the online sports betting and gaming business after a 2018 lift on a ban on sports betting made the United States the next big growth market. 
Last month, Flutter reported that its first-quarter U.S. sales more than doubled almost exclusively through FanDuel, in which the Irish company increased its stake to 95% through a $4.2 billion deal in December.

King's decision to leave FanDuel was ""clearly a disappointment,"" analysts at Davy Research said in a note.
However, they added that the role is likely to attract ""high calibre"" candidates because of the opportunity to lead the ""best positioned"" U.S. sports betting operator.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mexican authorities on Tuesday ordered the General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) union in the city of Silao to repeat a worker vote following pressure from U.S. lawmakers for the automaker to address alleged abuses that could potentially violate a new trade deal. 
Mexico's labor ministry said it found ""serious irregularities"" in last month's vote, which is required under a Mexican labor reform to ensure workers are not bound to contracts that are signed behind their backs and keep wages low.
Such votes are part of Mexico's broader effort to uphold worker rights as part of a new free trade pact that replaces NAFTA. 
The concerns over GM come amid various complaints in recent days regarding Mexican workplace abuses, just as U.S. activists and politicians begin to flex new powers to enforce labor standards south of the border enshrined in the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). 
The largest U.S. labor federation, the AFL-CIO, on Monday urged the U.S. government to file a complaint under USMCA against Tridonex, an auto-parts plant in the Mexican border city of Matamoros where it said workers have been blocked from electing an independent union. 
In the GM case, some ballots were destroyed during the union-led vote, Mexico's labor ministry found. It also said the union, which is part of the powerful Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM), refused to give labor inspectors documentation of the vote tally.
U.S. representatives Dan Kildee, Bill Pascrell and Earl Blumenauer, all Democrats, called on GM to answer questions about potential abuses.
The largest U.S. automaker ""has a responsibility to speak out against violations of labor and human rights abuses at the Silao GM plant,"" they said in a letter to GM Chief Executive Mary Barra. 
The lawmakers also cited news reports indicating that GM officials had removed independent inspectors, among other intimidation tactics targeting workers.
GM has denied wrongdoing, and said government-approved inspectors were not prevented from entering the voting site. It also said it condemned labor rights violations and had hired a third-party firm to review the matter. 
GM's union must hold a new vote within 30 days, the ministry said, after the initial vote ""violated principles of safety and certainty.""
Hugo Varela, head of the CTM in Guanajuato state, where the Silao plant is located, did not respond to a request for comment on the labor ministry's order.
He previously said that CTM was committed to complying with the law and keeping jobs in Mexico. 
A spokesman for the U.S. Trade Representative's office declined to comment on GM.
The disputed vote at Silao, which employs some 6,000 people, came several days before GM said it would invest $1 billion in an electric vehicle manufacturing complex in Mexico, triggering criticism from the United Auto Workers. 
UAW spokesman Brian Rothenberg told Reuters separately this week that it was ""concerned and is having appropriate discussions"" about the Mexico vote. 

In addition, Geneva-based IndustriALL Global Unions and Toronto-based Unifor said in letters to GM President Mark Reuss last week that the incident appeared to violate the USMCA and urged GM to protect workers.
Unifor's president, Jerry Dias, expressed his ""outrage"" at the situation and said he would explore ""all available avenues"" to uphold worker rights in Mexico, including dispute resolution tools under the USMCA.

682,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2021 05:22AM ET</span>","Taiwan warns COVID alert level could rise, but not yet, shares tumble","By Yimou Lee and Ben Blanchard
TAIPEI (Reuters) -Taiwan reported its largest daily rise in domestic COVID-19 cases on Wednesday, while the stock market tanked after the health minister warned the island could move to a higher alert level, though he later clarified that step was not imminent.
Early and effective prevention steps succeeded in shielding Taiwan from the worst of the pandemic, with just 1,231 infections reported so far. 
But markets have been on edge since renewed domestic outbreaks began late last month, with 16 new domestic cases announced on Wednesday setting a record daily high.
Taiwan's benchmark stock index was down more than 8% at one point in a fall that accelerated as Health Minister Chen Shih-chung told parliament the alert level could be raised, potentially leading to strict new limits on gatherings and closure of non-essential businesses.
The index regained some ground but still closed down 4.1%, its biggest percentage fall since March 2020. 
The health minister later told reporters that the government would not be ordering a shift to stiffer restrictions for now.
""We are not going to raise the alert level yet,"" Chen told reporters.
While Taiwan has plenty of stocks of personal protective gear, including face masks, people must not rest on their laurels, he added.
""Everyone should be nervous about these domestic cases, and raise their alertness and protect themselves properly.""
President Tsai Ing-wen called on people not to panic, while encouraging them to remain on guard against the virus, maintaining the success that has allowed the economy to boom.
""At this moment the challenge is still severe. Please be alert and follow the guidelines. I believe we will be able to overcome this challenge together,"" she said at the headquarters of the ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party.
CALL FOR CALM IN MARKETS
The vast majority of Taiwan's cases have been imported from abroad, but the latest spate of domestic cases have worried people as authorities have yet to identify a clear source.
Investors should have confidence that economic fundamentals and the stock market are sound, Taiwan Deputy Finance Minister Frank Juan told Reuters.
But if the situation worsens, Juan said he did not rule out calling a meeting of the National Stabilisation Fund, which the government can use to intervene in case of large fluctuations in the market.
The spectre of restrictions affecting semiconductor production was enough to spook investors already nervous about selling pressure on tech shares, said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at ANZ Bank.
""Cases are pretty low, but you can see we're in an environment now where investors are cautious,"" he said.
""Even though I doubt very much the restrictions will have an impact on export-orientated sectors, investors are playing it safe and that's contributed to the selloff."" 
Taiwan largely closed its borders early in the pandemic and has a robust contact tracing and quarantine system, allowing life to stay close to normal. 

The government this week asked hospitals across Taiwan to allocate enough wards for potential new infections, Chen said, adding they are capable of providing 3,000 beds to treat patients.

683,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2021 04:51AM ET</span>",Airbus revives plan for new single-aisle jet plant in Toulouse,"By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus has revived plans for a new production line for its A321neo jet in Toulouse, France, as it reshapes production of the medium-haul single-aisle jets that it hopes will lead its factories out of the coronavirus crisis.
The European planemaker said on Wednesday the new line, to be installed in the deserted assembly hall where it once built the now-abandoned A380 superjumbo, would open by end-2022.
Airbus decided in 2019 to halt output of the world's largest jetliner and the last A380 rolled out in March, leaving the world's second-largest industrial building in limbo.
Airbus plans to use part of the Jean-Luc Lagardere building to add a new line with state-of-the art facilities to meet demand for the smaller A321neo, which has seen a rise in demand to represent more than half of its single-aisle backlog.
That will replace one of the original lines used for the A320, a slightly smaller and earlier model, in Toulouse.
Airbus suspended similar plans in April last year when the outbreak of COVID-19 forced it to cut global production, angering French unions who called for the plan to stay intact.
The relaunch comes as Airbus tells suppliers to be ready for a further recovery in single-aisle output to 53 jets a month by end-2022, first reported by Reuters on Tuesday.
Toulouse, where Airbus is headquartered, is one of four sites used worldwide to assemble its single-aisle planes.
Currently only its lines in Hamburg, Germany, and Mobile in Alabama are equipped to make the A321neo, which has a dominant share of sales against large versions of Boeing (NYSE:BA)'s 737 MAX.
The new facility will also be able to handle production of the A320neo sister model, whose sales are more balanced against the competing Boeing 737 MAX 8, as well as the newest A321XLR variant which Airbus also plans to assemble in Hamburg.
The two planemakers have clashed over where the centre of the market is for such types of planes, but are increasingly involved in a contest over production strategy as they seek to deliver on bulging order books for single-aisle aircraft.
The new Toulouse line will employ 500 people and deploy robots introduced at the latest of four lines in Hamburg, despite teething problems with the new production technology.

Airbus said it aimed to return to pre-crisis single-aisle production between 2023 and 2025. Before the pandemic, its factories were running at a record 60 single-aisles a month.
Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Sandy Morris said Airbus could regain output of 57 single-aisle jets a month in 2024.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Commerzbank raised its revenue outlook on Wednesday after surprising investors by swinging back to profit in the first quarter, buoyed by strong trading commissions.
Shares in Germany's second biggest bank rose 7% after the better-than-expected performance, which Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said was largely attributable to net commission income from securities trading, a rebound that has also helped other banks.
Commerzbank posted a net profit of 133 million euros ($161 million) in the three months to March 31, against a loss of 291 million euros a year earlier. 
Analysts, who had expected a net loss of 131 million euros for the quarter, still expect Commerzbank to report a loss this year as it carries out a 2 billion euro restructuring involving hundreds of branch closures and 10,000 job cuts. 
​ The bank, which is still partially owned by the state after a bailout during the financial crisis more than a decade ago, now expects full-year revenue to slightly exceed last year's, a shift from previous expectations for a slight decline.
""After a very good start to the year, we are looking confidently to the future despite the ongoing pandemic,"" Commerzbank Chief Executive Manfred Knof said.
Knof last week struck a deal with employees over the planned job losses, central to efforts to restore profitability at Commerzbank, which has never fully recovered since its bailout and made a 2.9 billion euro loss last year.

Fees from the surge in securities trading are expected to ease in the coming months as markets become less volatile, Commerzbank's finance chief Bettina Orlopp told analysts.

685,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2021 03:47AM ET</span>","Japan's Nomura still betting on global expansion to lift profit, despite Archegos hit","By Makiko Yamazaki
TOKYO (Reuters) -  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) Inc raised its pretax income target for the next fiscal year by 14%, showing the long-cherished ambitions of Japan's top brokerage and investment bank to join the global elite remain undimmed, despite sustaining a near $3 billion hit from the collapse of U.S. investment fund Archegos.
Setting out guidance in a mid-term presentation, Nomura on Wednesday said it was basing its raised target on a strategy of developing its footprint in global private markets, taking in business with unlisted companies, like private equity funds, as well as services for wealthier private clients. 
Nomura now estimates 320 billion yen ($2.94 billion) in pretax income for its three core divisions in the year from April next year, citing strength in wholesale arm, comprising global markets and investment banking.
The new target raises the bar from the 280 billion yen profit targeted in an estimate issued a year ago, and represents a 29% jump from the 247.6 billion yen it posted for the year ended in March 2021.
The raised ambitions come soon after the implosion of Archegos, a family office run by Bill Hwang that failed to meet margin calls on heavily leveraged stock bets, rekindled concerns about Nomura's global expansion strategy.
Chief Executive Kentaro Okuda told a media briefing on Wednesday that Nomura has exited more than 99% of its Archegos-related positions and reiterated that it has no plans to shy away from the prime brokerage business.
But he added that the bank would reduce prime brokerage transactions that only provide credit using stocks as collateral.
The upward profit target revision is driven by a higher forecast for the wholesale division, which is expected to post a profit of 150 billion yen for April 2022-March 2023, more than double the 64.3 billion yen posted for the year just ended.
Earnings at Nomura's wholesale arm, which includes overseas operations, have been highly volatile since its disastrous 2008 acquisition of Lehman Brothers' Asian and European businesses, forcing the bank to repeatedly implement drastic cost cuts.

In an effort to expand stable revenue sources, Nomura now targets a 50% income growth in the advisory business and a 40% increase from private equity and private debt markets, which includes businesses with unlisted companies, over the next few years.

Malaysian and U.S. investigators say at least $4.5 billion was stolen from 1MDB between 2009 and 2014, in a wide-ranging scandal that has implicated high-level officials, banks and financial institutions around the world.
The United States has been returning funds it has recovered from seized assets that were allegedly bought with stolen 1MDB money. 
Malaysia has so far received 16.05 billion ringgit ($3.89 billion) of seized and repatriated 1MDB funds, the finance ministry said in a statement.
It plans to use the recovered funds to repay liabilities of 1MDB and its former unit SRC. 1MDB has 39.8 billion ringgit in outstanding debt, while the unit SRC has 2.57 billion ringgit of remaining debt, the ministry said. 
The funds - held in a special trust account - are sufficient to service 1MDB's debt obligations for 2021 and 2022, the ministry said. 
The account does not currently include the $700 million settlement reached with Malaysian banking group Ambank and $60 million settlement with audit firm Deloitte earlier this year. 
Negotiations are also currently ongoing with auditor KPMG, the finance ministry said without disclosing more details. 
Over the last three years, Malaysia has been trying to recover 1MDB funds from global banks, financial institutions, individuals and other entities it says have caused losses from 1MDB. 
This week, 1MDB filed 22 lawsuits in a court in Malaysia to recover assets worth in excess of $23 billion. 
Those being sued include units of  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), J.P. Morgan and Coutts & Co.

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), which helped raise billions for 1MDB, last year paid $2.5 billion to settle a Malaysian probe into the investment bank's role in the 1MDB scandal. It has also promised to help Malaysia recover assets worth $1.4 billion.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Wednesday, with the FTSE 100 outperforming after better-than-expected U.K. growth data, although moves are limited ahead of key U.S. inflation data.
At 3:40 AM ET (0840 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.1%, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.6%.
Britain's economy grew by a stronger-than-expected 2.1% in March from February, official data showed earlier Wednesday, while gross domestic product shrank by 1.5% in the first three months of 2021, when the country was under a third lockdown.
The Bank of England said last week it expected the world's fifth-biggest economy would recover quickly as coronavirus restrictions are lifted to grow by 7.25% in 2021 as a whole.
While welcome news, global stock markets have been fretting that this growth will result in a sharp jump in inflation, pushing central banks, and the U.S. Federal Reserve in particular, into tightening their ultra-easy monetary policies earlier than they had previously guided for. 
Investors will thus be keeping a close eye on the U.S. consumer price index for April, due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), which is expected to grow 0.2% from the previous month, a 3.6% jump from last year. 
While the year-over-year reading will be distorted by base effects from last year's pandemic-induced plunge in energy prices, such a jump would be the largest since September 2011. 
Back in Europe, Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) stock rose 6.9% after the German lender swung to a first quarter profit, beating expectations, and Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) stock climbed 3.2% after the German pharmaceutical giant reported a rise in net profit and upheld its outlook for the year.
Ahold Delhaize (AS:AD) stock rose 3.1% after the supermarket operator reported better than expected first-quarter sales on the back of a strong performance online, and UniCredit (MI:CRDI) stock rose 0.8% after new Chief Executive Andrea Orcel reorganized the Italian banking group's top management structure.
On the flip side, Tui (DE:TUIGn) stock fell 1.5% after the world’s biggest holiday company said that it had a total of 2.6 million bookings for this summer, 69% lower than it had at this time of year in 2019.
Oil prices stabilized Wednesday, after a volatile few days, as a drop in U.S. crude stockpiles reassured traders that the recovery in demand remains on track.
U.S. crude inventories fell by 2.5 million barrels for the week ended May 6, according to an estimate released Tuesday by the industry body the American Petroleum Institute. The official government inventory report, due later Wednesday, is expected to largely confirm this report. 
Meanwhile, Colonial Pipeline, the largest fuel pipeline in the United States, has still only restarted a small section in the five days since its shutdown following Friday’s cyber attack, and doesn’t expect substantial restoration of service before the weekend.

""While COVID-19 continues to create significant uncertainty for the remainder of 2021, the strong Q1 results provide management the confidence to raise the underlying EPS (earnings per share) growth outlook for the year,"" the company said.

Underlying operating income fell 12% to 849 million euros but was better than a company compiled forecast of 740 million euros. 
Guidance on underlying EPS growth was raised to a ""low to mid-teen"" percentage, up from the ""mid to high single-digit"" growth previously forecast.
Ahold finance chief Natalie Knight cited the operating margin and U.S. online sales growth of 188% as justification for the more optimistic outlook, which was based on 2019 figures to compensate for pandemic-related anomalies.
It maintained a 2021 underlying operating margin outlook of ""at least 4%"", with projected cost savings of more than 750 million euros.

692,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2021 02:15AM ET</span>","Analysis: China Express bets on subsidised routes, home-grown jets as path to profits","By Stella Qiu and Jamie Freed
BEIJING/SYDNEY (Reuters) - China Express Airlines, a regional carrier based in the southwestern city of Chongqing, is betting that its business model of flying heavily subsidised routes using an increasingly Chinese-made fleet will give it an edge over rivals.
The airline reported a 22% rise in annual profit last year - a near-impossible feat in the pandemic-ravaged aviation industry - thanks to subsidies of more than 625 million yuan ($97.14 million) that accounted for 87% of its total profits before tax.
Routes in third and fourth-tier cities, 90% of which are monopolies, helped fuel growth and made it the only listed Chinese airline to make a profit in 2020.
That put the previously obscure carrier on the radar of investors seeking faster-growing, domestic-focused alternatives to China's three biggest airlines.
""The company has very few direct competitors nationwide, but only faces localised competition on their shared routes,"" said Wu Yifan, transportation analyst at Huachuang Securities.
Shares in China Express, with a fleet of 52 mostly Western-made planes as well as 100 domestically manufactured jets on order, surged 56% last year and have risen close to 20% this year. 
It is benefiting from Beijing's drive to develop new airports in regional areas, as well as a push for locally built jets to challenge the dominance of Airbus, Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Brazil's Embraer.
The airline's strategy, which depends on continued government route subsidies and the reliability of relatively unproven Chinese-made planes, is not without risk.
But analysts say the benefits from the subsidies and other government policies should continue for at least a few years. A blueprint issued by the State Council in February said China will build 150 civil airports in the next 15 years, mostly small facilities in less-developed regions.
Guosheng Securities forecast the airline's earnings will double from last year's 613 million yuan to 1.24 billion yuan by 2023.
In a sign of its strategic importance, China Express was the first private airline in China to take delivery of the home-grown ARJ21 regional jet; it plans to buy a mix of 100 ARJ21s and C919s, a boost to state plane maker Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC).
China Express predicts COMAC planes will account for the majority of its fleet by 2025. 
The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) will offer favourable airport slots to domestically made airplanes and favour them in fleet planning over the next five years, the agency said late last year.
China Express set a record in 2020 for the most time flown by any ARJ21 jet in a single day at 13.53 hours, it said in December. But the CAAC, out of safety concerns, asked the airline to cut back on its utilisation and build up public confidence in the jet slowly, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. 
China Express, which had declined an interview with Reuters to discuss its strategy, referred any comment on ARJ21 utilisation to CAAC. CAAC did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
DOMINANT PLAYER 
Founded in 2006, China Express is the only listed airline focused on regional aviation in China, making its investment profile very different from the three big state-owned carriers.
From CAAC alone, China Express, though tiny compared to the biggest airlines, got the most in government subsidies, at 217 million yuan, followed by China Eastern's 186 million yuan and China Southern's 130 million yuan. It is set to get 297 million yuan this year.
It also has other fixed-price deals with local governments and airports that pay it regardless of passenger numbers.
Subsidised routes are a small business for China's biggest three airlines, which are focused on reviving the lucrative traffic between big cities.
Other regional airlines in China, part-owned by local governments, are small and focus mostly on local routes. 
In Xinjiang, China Express chose Korla, the region's second-largest city, as its regional hub and has linked it with around 15 other cities across the region. It has cooperated with big airlines, which usually have the best time slots at big airports, to direct traffic from Urumqi to Korla. 
The airline is looking to replicate that in Yunnan, a popular tourist destination that has poor infrastructure, after signing an agreement last year with Dehong Prefecture government to make it a regional hub. 
There are signs the subsidies are luring tourists.
Philip Yu, a travel enthusiast, said he had flown China Express around half a dozen times over the last year as pandemic-related restrictions kept him from flying overseas.

""I would recommend China Express to any of my friends who want to fly within regions like Xinjiang, Guizhou or Inner Mongolia, particularly places where high-speed railways have yet to reach or have a limited presence,"" he said. ""It's really convenient.""

693,By Investing.com,"<span>May 12, 2021 02:02AM ET</span>",European Stock Futures Lower; Global Selloff Continues,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening lower Wednesday, continuing the recent global selloff as surging commodity prices and growing inflationary pressure in the United States stoke concerns of early rate hikes.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.4% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.7% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.4%. 
The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 1.4%, or almost 500 points, lower Tuesday, its worst day since February, while Asia has largely followed suit, with both Japan’s Nikkei and South Korea’s KOSPI down 1.6%.
Economic data released on Tuesday showed job openings at U.S. companies jumped to a record high in March, suggesting the labor supply is not keeping up with surging demand as employers scramble to find qualified workers. This points to increasing wage inflation going forward.
Investors will thus be keeping a close eye on the U.S. consumer price index for April, due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), which is expected to grow 0.2% from the previous month, a 3.6% jump from last year. 
While the year-over-year reading will be distorted by base effects from last year's pandemic-induced plunge in energy prices, such a jump would be the largest since September 2011. 
Ahead of that, and back in Europe, the U.K.’s GDP contracted 1.5% in the first quarter as the country’s government took the first steps to exit the Covid-19 restriction measures only in early March.
In corporate news, Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) swung to a first quarter profit, beating expectations, as the German lender undergoes a major restructuring, while Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) reported a rise in net profit despite slightly lower sales and upheld its outlook for the year.
In a busy day of earnings, releases are also due from the likes of EDF (PA:EDF), Allianz (DE:ALVG), Tui (DE:TUIGn), Aegon (NYSE:AEG) and RWE (DE:RWEG).
Oil prices stabilized Wednesday, after a volatile few days, as a drop in U.S. crude stockpiles reassured traders that the recovery in demand remains on track.
U.S. crude inventories fell by 2.5 million barrels for the week ended May 6, according to an estimate released Tuesday by the industry body the American Petroleum Institute. The official government inventory report, due later Wednesday, is expected to largely confirm this report. 
Meanwhile, Colonial Pipeline, the largest fuel pipeline in the United States, has still only restarted a small section in the five days since its shutdown following Friday’s cyber attack, and doesn’t expect substantial restoration of service before the weekend. 
U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% higher at $65.35 a barrel, the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $68.61, while gasoline futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange dropped 0.4% to $2.1313 a gallon.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,830.60/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.2127.

The U.S. fund giant said on Wednesday its wealth management venture with a unit of China Construction Bank (OTC:CICHF) Corp (CCB) and Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings (Pte) Ltd can now start business.
The venture, 50.1% owned by BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and 40% by CCB's wealth management unit, will draw on BlackRock's investment expertise and CCB's vast distribution network, the U.S. firm said in a statement. 
BlackRock will ""support China in building a sustainable ecosystem for investing,"" Chairman and CEO Laurence Fink said in the statement.
""The Chinese market represents a significant opportunity to help meet the long-term goals of investors in China and internationally."" 
China opened its massive financial sector last April as part of an interim Sino-U.S. trade deal.
Guo Shuqing, chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC), said in March that Chinese regulators welcome more foreign entry into China's financial sector, including the wealth management space. 
Amundi has set up a wealth management joint venture with Bank of China, and  Schroders  (LON:SDR) has applied to partner with Bank of Communications (BOCOM) in wealth management.

BlackRock CCB Wealth Management Ltd, which received the licence from CBIRC, will expand BlackRock's presence in China. 
BlackRock already owns a mutual fund venture with Bank of China, and is setting up a wholly-owned mutual fund house in the country.

Investing.com – Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co., Ltd. (T:7201) shares slumped to their lowest level in four months on Wednesday, after the release of weaker-than-expected guidance for the 2020 fiscal year.
Shares dropped 11.75% to JPY510.60 ($4.7) by 12:47 AM ET (4:47 AM GMT), after falling over 12% earlier in the session.
The Japanese automaker missed expectations for a return to profitability in the year ending March 2022, as the current global chip shortage, combined with increasing raw material prices hindered its recovery from a record annual operating loss.
“The fiscal year 2020 was a year dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic and impacted by multiple factors including the growth of environmental awareness and political as well as economic changes,” Nissan Chief Executive Makoto Uchida told an online earnings call.
“If we look at the immediate challenges today, there is a big impact from business risks like semiconductor and commodity price hikes... so at this point in time, we are foreseeing operating profit coming out even,” he added.
The company said its annual operating loss in the year ended Mar. 31 ballooned to JPY150.65 billion ($1.39 billion) from the previous year’s JPY40 billion-yen shortfall.
Nissan will further update its outlook guidance after the first quarter."

Nissan (OTC:NSANY) defied expectations on Tuesday for a return to profitability in the year ending March 2022, as the global chip shortage and raw material price increases curb its recovery from a record annual operating loss.
The forecast by Japan's No.3 car maker by sales to break even for the year that began on April 1 was lower than a 241.7 billion yen ($2.23 billion) profit predicted by SmartEstimate.
Nissan CEO Uchida said on Tuesday that the automaker foresees an operating profit even as it faces a huge impact from business risks including semiconductor supply issues. He added that the company will give updates on its outlook guidance after the first quarter.
Toshihide Kinoshita, analyst at SMBC Nikko, wrote in a note that Nissan's ""somewhat conservative guidance"" was within expectations as the automaker faces uncertainty as it tries to improve profitability, but its break-even guidance was a negative surprise.
""While global OEMs continue to post strong results, Nissan's slow recovery stands out, though the low-ball guidance may include an impression strategy while aiming for an upward revision ahead,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Takaki Nakanishi wrote in a note, adding that the stock's fall will be short-lived.

""Despite no clear disclosure being made, we estimate that the company may have factored in about ¥150bn in risk factors as a basis of the breaking-even guidance,"" Nakanishi wrote.
The company said its annual operating loss in the year ended March 31 widened to 150.65 billion yen from a 40 billion yen shortfall in the previous year, though it beat its February forecast.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down Wednesday morning, staying near one-month lows as investors remain concerned about the implications of faster inflation and the continuous surge in commodities on the global economic recovery from COVID-19.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.72% by 10:36 PM ET (2:36 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI slid 1.02%
In Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.71%. The country’s 10-year bond jumped after the government handed down a big-spending budget to further boost the country’s economic recovery from COVID-19.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.28%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.23% while the Shenzhen Component edged down 0.15%.
The most recent drop in global stocks has some investors confused as to the reason behind it.
""There isn't a clear catalyst behind this purge... it seems to be a combination of inflation fears making a comeback and some market participants moving higher along the value spectrum, cutting their exposure to anything with a stretched valuation,"" XM investment analyst Marios Hadjikyriacos told Reuters.
Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury yields advanced and the dollar, while inching up on Wednesday, traded near the lowest levels of 2021.
Investors now await U.S. inflation data for April, including the Core Consumer Price Index (CPI), due to be released later in the day alongside U.S. government debt sales. They are also bracing for the possibility that both events combined could trigger another bond selloff.
The data is forecast to show that inflation accelerated in April, with the lockdowns in 2020 as COVID-19 spread globally expected to amplify the year-on-year figure.
The debate on whether the data will force the U.S. Federal Reserve to tighten its current dovish policy sooner than expected also continues. A slew of Fed officials has reiterated that the U.S. economic recovery, while on the right track, is not far enough and it is still too early to pull back the monetary support currently in place.
“It’s all about inflation expectations,” TD Securities global head of rates strategy Priya Misra told Bloomberg, adding that if the CPI indicates that “inflation is likely to be higher for a while, I think the taper discussion will come back into the forefront and then we can get a bigger interest rate move.”
In the U.K., Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey is due to speak later in the day.
Meanwhile, commodity prices continue to surge, with copper trading near record levels. However, China’s Dalian Commodity Exchange raised trading limits and margin requirements on Tuesday, while also pledging to strengthen market supervision, as attempts to temper prices continue."

TOKYO/HONG KONG (Reuters) -Toshiba Corp's board is set to appoint UBS as financial adviser to work on a strategic review for the Japanese conglomerate as it faces a possible private equity bidding war, people familiar with the matter said.
Last month, Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) became the target of a potential takeover bid and other bids could be forthcoming.
Investment banks have pitched to Toshiba's independent directors for an advisory role, the people, who could not be named as the information has not yet been made public, told Reuters.
A UBS spokesman in Japan declined to comment.
Toshiba also declined to comment specifically on the appointment of UBS, but said in a statement to Reuters that the appointment of advisers would help increase the transparency around its decision-making.
""The board is independently appointing financial and legal advisers, and will strategically consider ways to increase our corporate value from an independent standpoint,"" it said in an emailed statement.
One of the sources said that UBS will also communicate with Toshiba shareholders. It will have a separate role from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), which is an activist defence adviser for Toshiba's management team.
An announcement of the appointment could be made as soon as Friday at Toshiba's earnings briefing, the person said.
Toshiba has faced calls from its leading shareholders to explicitly seek offers from potential suitors and undergo a strategic review following a $20 billion buyout bid from CVC Capital Partners last month.
The future ownership of Toshiba, however, remains uncertain after CVC later said it would ""step aside and await guidance"" from the company after the Japanese conglomerate dismissed the bid as lacking in substance.
U.S. buyout firm Bain Capital is also considering a bid to take Toshiba private, Reuters reported last month, and has entered discussions with banks to secure funding for its potential deal. Bain had declined comment.
KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc and Canada's Brookfield Asset Management are also interested in Toshiba, sources have said. KKR and Brookfield had previously declined to comment on reports of potential bids.
A senior executive at one of Toshiba's main lenders said last month that several private equity funds had contacted his bank for potential financing to take the company private, but no talks are in progress.
CVC had approached Bain about a joint bid before its offer was made public but Bain was not interested, the first person said.
Bain has successfully tackled a major complex deal that involves Toshiba.

In 2017, it led a consortium with partners including South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Inc to win an intense and long-fought battle for control of Toshiba's chip unit, now called Kioxia Holdings. 
Toshiba retains around 40% of Kioxia.

(Reuters) -Billionaire Elon Musk and cryptocurrency aficionado on Tuesday asked https:// his 54 million followers on Twitter ""Do you want Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to accept Doge?,"" referring to a digital currency worth roughly 48 cents with no real-world use.
The question, in the form of a Twitter poll, comes days after he called dogecoin a ""hustle,"" sending the meme-inspired cryptocurrency's price reeling after a 700% rally in a month.
A proponent of digital currencies, the Tesla Inc chief executive made the comment as a guest host on the ""Saturday Night Live"" TV show this past weekend.
Musk is one of the world's richest people and owner of several futuristic companies, including SpaceX and Neuralink. He has used his candid Twitter feed to give his opinion on cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, most times affecting their price.
In March, Musk said U.S. customers could purchase Tesla vehicles with bitcoin, marking a significant step forward for the cryptocurrency's use in commerce. The electric-car maker had bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin earlier this year, propelling its prices to record highs.
Based on current prices, one would need nearly 80,000 dogecoins or 0.7 bitcoin to buy the cheapest Tesla Model 3 car.
Dogecoin was last up 9% at $0.507, according to data tracker CoinGecko.com.
Musk's poll on dogecoin received over 3.3 million responses in the 12 hours since he posted it, with nearly 80% of the respondents voting to ratify the new payment method.
It comes just days after Musk said that SpaceX would accept dogecoin as payment to launch a lunar mission next year.
The limited supply of bitcoin helps drive its value as the digital currency gradually gains acceptance for commercial transactions. Whereas dogecoin, which began as a social media joke in 2013 with a shiba inu dog as its avatar, has an unlimited supply and remains seldom used to make payments for goods.
Dogecoin jumped more than 700% over the last month and is now the fourth-largest digital currency. It hit a record high Thursday above 73 cents.

The billionaire' s tweets have drawn SEC scrutiny in the past, but his recent remarks about cryptocurrencies have not landed in him in any regulatory troubles so far.
Shares of Tesla were down 1.3% at $621 a share in late trading on the Nasdaq after Reuters reported the U.S. electric car maker had halted plans to buy land to expand its Shanghai plant.

""I think the Post has a real opportunity to lead and model what the future of journalism in the digital era is going to look like, but always just really marrying that to very deep, very strong factual reporting,"" Buzbee said in an interview Tuesday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed lower on Tuesday as rising commodity prices and labor shortages fed fears that despite reassurances from the U.S. Federal Reserve, near-term price spikes could translate into longer-term inflation.
While all three indexes pared their losses from session lows, the sell-off was fairly evenly dispersed across the sectors. 
""Today feels like a catch-up in that tech has been weak so far this month and it’s finally spilled over into other areas of the market and we’re seeing broader weakness,"" said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA) in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Economic data released on Tuesday from the Labor Department showed job openings at U.S. companies jumped to a record high in March, further evidence of the labor shortage hinted by Friday's disappointing employment report.
The report suggests labor supply is not keeping up with surging demand as employers scramble to find qualified workers. 
Burrito chain Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) announced it would hike the average hourly wage of its workers to $15, a further sign that the worker shortage in the face of a demand revival could add fuel to the inflation surge.
That worker shortage, along with a supply drought in the face of booming demand could contribute to what is seen as inevitable prices spikes, which the U.S. Federal Reserve has repeatedly said are unlikely to translate into long-term inflation.
""The inflation concerns continue,"" Detrick said. ""The supply chain issues coupled with record stimulus coupled with apparently a tighter labor market have all contributed to fears that inflation could trend higher over the summer months.""
""I don’t think (the market) believes the Fed when it says they won’t raise rates until after 2023,"" Detrick added. ""That could be where the market and the Fed do not see eye to eye.""

(Reuters) - Toymaker Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) is encouraging kids to return Barbies, Matchbox cars and MEGA Bloks they no longer play with to the company for recycling into new toys.
    The goal of the company's new 'Playback' program is to recover and reuse materials across all products and packaging by 2030, Mattel said as it announced the program this week. 
    ""Mattel's Playback program is a great step,"" said Jim Silver, CEO of TTPM, a toy industry research firm. ""The consumer is becoming more and more concerned about the future and becoming more eco-friendly; manufacturers are starting to step up and start to try and make the environment better.""
    The company is encouraging consumers to ship their old toys back to Mattel, where they are sorted and separated by material type, processed, and recycled. Materials that cannot be recycled will be either ""downcycled"" or ""converted to energy.""    
    Last month, Mattel unveiled the Matchbox Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Roadster, its first vehicle made from 99% recycled materials and carbon.

(Reuters) -Electronic Arts Inc on Tuesday forecast annual adjusted revenue above analysts' estimates, betting that demand for its titles, including ""FIFA 21"" and ""Apex Legends,"" would stay strong even as COVID-19 restrictions ease.
The video gaming industry has been a big pandemic winner thanks to a surge in engagement from gamers staying indoors. U.S. consumer spending on video games rose 18% in March to a record $5.6 billion, according to data from research firm NPD.
But speedy vaccinations and easing curbs have encouraged people to head outdoors, raising concerns that the gaming boom would soon fade.
EA on Tuesday signaled it expected the momentum to continue, estimating full-year adjusted revenue to be $7.30 billion, higher than a Refinitiv IBES estimate of $6.61 billion.
""We expect to continue to drive strong organic growth in Apex Legends in fiscal 2022 and expand the franchise to new platforms with the launch of Apex Mobile in the back half of the year,"" Chief Financial Officer Blake Jorgensen said on a post-earnings call. 
The company's shares were nearly 3% higher at $145.05 in extended trading.
EA has been expanding its customer base and mobile gaming footprint through deals for companies including UK-based Codemasters, known for racing titles ""F1"" and ""Dirt"", and ""Kim Kardashian: Hollywood"" creator Glu Mobile (NASDAQ:GLUU).
However, the costs of the acquisitions and some minor tax changes impacted its fourth-quarter profit, Jorgensen said in an interview with Reuters. 

Net income for the quarter ended March 31 fell to $76 million, or 26 cents per share, from $418 million, $1.43 per share, a year earlier.
Excluding one-time items, the company earned $1.23 per share, beating expectations of $1.05 per share. Revenue of $1.49 billion also exceeded estimates of $1.39 billion.

(Reuters) -A former president of the United Auto Workers, Dennis Williams (NYSE:WMB), was sentenced to 21 months in prison and fined $10,000 on Tuesday for conspiring to embezzle union funds as part of a larger federal probe of corruption in the union.
Williams, 68, is one of 16 people convicted in a wide-ranging probe conducted by the office for the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, which last December reached a deal with the union for independent oversight.
“The court’s sentence for former UAW President Williams demonstrates that the very highest level of leadership of the UAW has been held accountable for betraying the 
trust of the UAW’s membership,” said Acting United States Attorney Saima Mohsin.
Williams, who pleaded guilty on Sept. 30, apologized to UAW members and his family at a video hearing.
Williams' successor as head of the UAW, Gary Jones, pleaded guilty to embezzlement of union funds last June and is scheduled to be sentenced next month.
Williams was charged with conspiracy with others to embezzle money from the union between 2010 and September 2019. He was head of the UAW from June 2014 to June 2018, and was forced to resign last September.
Prosecutors said Williams accepted housing for himself and friends at private villas in Palm Springs, California, golf clothing and other merchandise, rounds of golf, meals, high-end liquor and cigars provided by co-conspirators, all paid for with union funds.

""I undermined my life's work by making a personal decision to accept things like condo stays and golf, cigars and liquor without questioning how those things were being paid for,"" an emotional Williams told Judge Paul Borman on Tuesday. ""What I did was wrong.""
Williams paid $132,517 in restitution to the UAW and $15,459 in restitution to the Internal Revenue Service on embezzled items he personally received.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior Republican U.S. senator on Tuesday asked the chief executives of Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) America Electronic Components, Seagate Technology, and  Western Digital  Corp (NASDAQ:WDC) if the companies are improperly supplying Huawei with foreign-produced hard disk drives.
Senator Roger Wicker, the ranking member of the Commerce Committee, said a 2020 U.S. Commerce Department regulation sought to ""tighten Huawei's ability to procure items that are the direct product of specified U.S. technology or software, such as hard disk drives.""
He said he was engaged ""in a fact-finding process... about whether leading global suppliers of hard disk drives are complying"" with the regulation.
Western Digital said in a statement to Reuters it ""stopped shipping to Huawei in mid-September 2020 to comply with new rules issued by the Department of Commerce. We requested a license to ship products to Huawei in September 2020. Our application is still pending.""
The other companies and Huawei did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Wicker asked the companies if they believed the regulation ""prohibits shipment of hard disk drives to Huawei or any affiliate without a license"" and the status of all license applications to ship covered products to Huawei.
Wicker also copied Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo on the letter and encouraged her act ""against any company found to be circumventing any part"" of the rule, saying Huawei poses ""serious harm"" to national security.
The Commerce Department action in August was also aimed at cracking down on its access to commercially available chips.

In August, former President Donald Trump's administration also added 38 Huawei affiliates in 21 countries to the U.S. government’s economic blacklist raising the total to 152 affiliates since first adding Huawei in May 2019.
Washington has pushed governments around to world to squeeze out Huawei, arguing the company would hand over data to the Chinese government for spying. Huawei has denied spying for China.

The regulator in April issued guidance which called into question whether warrants issued by hundreds of SPACs could be considered equity instruments. The guidance suggests that many SPACs may have to refile their financial statements to account for the warrants as a liability.
The SEC in March had asked Lordstown for information related to its merger with blank-check company DiamondPeak Holdings and preorders of its vehicles.
""The restatement pertains to the accounting treatment for public and private placement warrants that were outstanding at the time of the business combination with DiamondPeak on Oct. 23, 2020,"" the company said in a statement on Tuesday.
Lordstown said it would restate its results for the year ended Dec. 31, such that some, if not all, of the warrants are accounted for as liabilities and marked-to-market each reporting period.
Separately, sensor maker Velodyne earlier said, as a result of the SEC guidelines, it had re-evaluated the accounting treatment of its warrants and concluded that certain warrants should have been classified as a liability measured at fair value.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks hit a one-month low on Tuesday as speculation that rising inflation pressure could prompt interest rate hikes sooner rather than later dragged on shares and hobbled the dollar, which hovered near a 2-1/2-month low.
Technology stocks were among the biggest losers, mirroring a sell-off in China, where talk of tighter regulation sent technology shares skidding.
But U.S. shares clawed back some of their losses over the course of the day, with the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite reversing the bulk of its early 2% decline.
Investors said the snap back in shares suggested that inflation concerns were not quite so entrenched yet, despite rising commodity prices and labor shortages in the United States. They said the sheer volume of money sloshing around in financial markets also meant some individuals are always looking to invest their cash on pull-backs.
""Welcome to a lot of money,"" said Paul Nolte, a portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management, which oversees $2 billion. ""The worry is maybe inflation is something more than transitory, but it looks like this is a mood swing for now rather than a longer-term concern.""
The Nasdaq Composite ended little changed, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.4%. The S&P 500 fell 0.9%, off a one-month low struck earlier Tuesday.
Bets that inflation could accelerate in the coming months burst to the fore on Monday when the breakeven rate on five-year U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) - a measure of inflation expectations - jumped to a decade-high 2.717%. It traded at 2.695% by late Tuesday.
The 10-year TIPS breakeven rate stood at 2.539%, indicating that the market sees inflation averaging 2.5% a year for the next decade.
All eyes are now on the U.S. consumer price index report to be released by the U.S. Labor Department on Wednesday. Until then, some investors appeared to be buying on dips.
The dollar, which slipped to a 10-week low on Tuesday on concerns that mounting price pressures could erode its value, also narrowed some of its earlier losses. 
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six major currencies, was little changed at 90.188, after touching a low of 89.979. [USD/]
The currencies of major natural resource suppliers such as Canada held ground amid rising commodity prices. The loonie was little changed at C$1.2097 after hitting a 3-1/2-year high of C$1.2078. 
The Australian dollar, another proxy for commodity prices, was steady at $0.7839, but off a 10-week high of $0.7891 struck on Monday.
Gold also recouped early declines, as a softer dollar offset losses generated by rising U.S. Treasury yields. Spot gold edged up 0.11% to $1,837.39 per ounce, after dropping as much as 1% earlier.
In keeping with market worries about a pick-up in inflation, the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasuries edged up to 1.6235%, though off a high of 1.6310%. [US/]
The spread between benchmark two- and 10-year Treasuries also widened slightly to 146 basis points, up more than 1 basis point from the previous day.
Oil prices were not spared of the day's volatility, and had reversed all early losses by the end of Tuesday's session, lifted by fears of a gasoline shortage after a cyber attack caused an outage at the largest U.S. fuel pipeline system.
U.S. crude gained 0.8% to $65.44 a barrel. Brent crude added 0.5% to $68.69 per barrel. [O/R]

In cryptocurrencies, ether dipped from record levels hit on Monday, but was nevertheless up 3.7% at $4,101.15. The value of the second-biggest digital token has surged over 5.5 times so far this year.

Investing.com - Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) reported Tuesday mixed fourth-quarter results as earnings missed, but revenue beat expectations.
The company shares fell 1% in after-hours trade following the report.
Electronic Arts announced earnings per share of $0.26 on revenue of $1.49B. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $1.05 on revenue of $1.39B.
Shares are down 1% from the beginning of the year, still down 5.97% from its 52 week high of $150.30 set on January 25. They are under-performing the Nasdaq which is up 3.89% from the start of the year.
Net bookings, the number of products and services sold digitally or sold-in physically, grew 15% to $1.49 billion, driven by sales of games such as Apex Legends, FIFA 21 and The Sims.
""Apex steadily grew through the last year, driven by the games team and the content they are delivering,” said COO and CFO Blake Jorgensen.
Looking ahead, the company forecast fiscal 2022 diluted earnings per share to be approximately $1.34 on revenue of $6.8 billion. Net bookings is expected to be about $7.3 billion for the year.
“Looking forward, the momentum in our existing live services provides a solid foundation for FY22. Combined with a new Battlefield and our recent acquisitions, we expect net bookings growth in the high teens,” Jorgensen added.

In fact, some market observers speculate that iron ore prices will hit $200 per ton, surpassing the record $194 level achieved more than a decade ago.

The Columbus, Ohio-based company held talks with multiple interested buyers while reviewing its lingerie line, but concluded that a spin-off would offer more value to its shareholders than a sale.
Victoria's Secret went under review after a failed attempt to sell a majority stake to buyout firm Sycamore in 2020, when the brand had to close shops and furlough staff to cope with the COVID-19 crisis.
The New York Times' DealBook division earlier on Tuesday reported https://nyti.ms/2R91NYd, citing sources, that L Brands (NYSE:LB) received several bids over $3 billion for Victoria's Secret, but the offers did not match what it expects to get in a spinoff. 
Victoria's Secret expects to be valued between $5 billion and $7 billion in a spinoff to L Brands shareholders, the NYT report said. 
L Brands did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on the valuation of the brand.
After the company splits into two public units - Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret - L Brands top boss Andrew Meslow will lead the personal care brand while Victoria's Secret Chief Martin Waters (NYSE:WAT) will head the new standalone lingerie business.
The deal is expected close in August. 
L Brands also expects sales for the first quarter ended May 1 to be $3.02 billion, up from $1.65 billion a year earlier, with revenue growth across both banners.
Analysts on average expect net sales of $2.89 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

With organizations looking for increased scalability and business continuity, the demand for services offered by cloud provider Box (BOX) is increasing. Conversely, Coupa Software (NASDAQ:COUP) is struggling to stay afloat even amid the favorable industry backdrop. So, let’s evaluate each name more closely.Amid the COVID-19 pandemic's deep disruptions, cloud services have been a godsend regarding keeping the economy and people’s lives from coming to a complete halt. Enterprises are increasingly adopting cloud-based platforms to function efficiently and flexibly amid remote working requirements.
Because cloud computing’s long-touted benefits, such as agility and stability, are becoming a necessity for conducting business, a growing number of individuals and businesses are adopting it. The demand for these services should continue increasing because public and private cloud servers have become the new standard for daily frontend and backend operations, information storage, and disaster recovery. The global cloud computing market is expected to hit a $760.98 billion value, growing at a 18.6% CAGR over the next six years.
Since a reliance on cloud computing is expected to increase, Box, Inc. (BOX) should deliver solid returns based on its increasing global footprint and digital innovations. But we think it is best to avoid Coupa Software Incorporated (COUP) in the near-term owing to its bleak growth prospects and weak financials.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) and Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) petrochemical joint venture imported significant quantities of the toxic chemical benzene into the United States for several years without reporting it to regulators as required by law, according to a company document seen by Reuters.
Benzene is a known carcinogen that is used in the production of pesticides, detergents, plastics, and other synthetic materials, and companies must report imports of 25,000 pounds (11,340 kg) or more to help regulators track potential exposure. 
Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC imported ""reportable quantities"" of the chemical between 2013 and 2020 that it did not immediately disclose to regulators, according to the document, a letter from the company's attorney to non-profit watchdog group Center For Environmental Health dated April 21.
The letter said the company has since filed paperwork to correct the issue. 
Chevron Phillips Chemical declined to comment on the matter for this story, citing pending regulatory review. The Environmental Protection Agency said it does not disclose whether or not there are enforcement actions underway. 
""As a general matter, if a company were to identify a mistake in what was report (ed), the company must correct its (Chemical Data Reporting) submission,"" the agency said.
The EPA has fined companies in the past for similar violations, running into the tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars, according to agency documents.
Woodlands, Texas-based Chevron Phillips had sent the letter to CEH after the watchdog group threatened to sue it for allegedly violating the U.S. Toxic Substances Control Act, which requires the disclosure of significant imports of dangerous chemicals.
CEH https://ceh.org/latest/press-releases/chevron-phillips-chemical-fails-to-report-massive-imports-of-benzene-and-dangerous-chemicals-to-epa said it believes the company imported more than 350 million pounds of the product without reporting it to the EPA from the years 2013 to 2015, citing the most recent publicly available data. It did not have an estimate for unreported imports since the 2016 reporting period. Most of the chemicals were shipped to the company's Port Arthur, Texas, facility, CEH said. 
CEH said it had also found that other chemical companies imported benzene without reporting it on required U.S. Chemical Data Reporting rule forms, but in lesser quantities.
“We believe these violations are the tip of the iceberg within the industry and CDR non-compliance is likely widespread and significant,” said Robert Sussman, CEH counsel and a former EPA senior official. 

“Non-profit groups like CEH can do only so much to deter violations if EPA does not effectively use the enforcement tools at its disposal to find and penalize violators.” 
Deemed a carcinogen by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, benzene can evaporate and also pool underground, contaminating air, soil and groundwater that can cause people and animals to become sick over time.

But the restaurant industry came back swinging, with curb-side delivery and drive-thru facilities that played a big role in saving many.

LONDON (Reuters) - If the European Union wants to push a faster shift to zero-emissions cars then  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) is ready, but there needs to be an open debate on the impact electrification will have on auto jobs, the carmaker's top executive said on Tuesday.
""It's an ambition that we say yes to,"" Chief Executive Ola Källenius said during an interview at a Financial Times conference on the future of the car. But he added ""we have to have an honest conversation about jobs."" 
""Everyone knows it takes more labour hours to assemble and build a combustion based powertrain compared to an electric powertrain,"" he said.
The EU last month raised its target for cuts in net greenhouse gas emissions to 55% by 2030 from 1990 levels instead of 40% and Europe's automakers will find out in July what their contribution on CO2 emissions is expected to be.
There are broad expectations within the auto industry that there will be job losses associated with electrification, focused primarily in combustion engine factories.
Germany's car industry faces an ""employment fiasco"" unless it gets badly needed investment in new technologies, especially batteries, the country's top labour leader said last week.
The warning from Joerg Hofmann, president of IG Metall, came after a survey by the Ifo institute showed that the transition to electric vehicles (EVs) could cost the industry some 100,000 jobs in combustion engine production by 2025 if companies fail to beef up efforts to reskill workers.

Källenius said the impact on jobs needs to be handled in a ""socially responsible way."" He said the German carmaker is in ""very constructive dialogue"" with its works council and the industry will create more jobs in areas like software engineering. 
""But it (the engine jobs impact) is not something where we should not acknowledge that it's there,"" Källenius said. ""It is there.""

The fund will launch in the coming months and pay creators this year and 2022, YouTube said.
The investment comes as platforms are racing to attract young creators who are building huge fan followings -- and big earning potential -- by filming short comedy skits and dance routines. Viral app TikTok jump-started the trend of short-form video clips and was quickly copied by other apps such as Facebook-owned Instagram's Reels, Snapchat Spotlight and YouTube Shorts.
YouTube said the new fund will pay thousands of creators each month whose videos on Shorts receive the most engagement from viewers.
The streaming video site added it will begin to test ads on Shorts.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden plans to visit a Ford Motor (NYSE:F) electric vehicle manufacturing facility in Michigan next week as he makes a push for a $174 billion government boost for electric vehicles and charging stations.
The following day, Ford is set to unveil its electric F-150 pickup dubbed the F-150 Lightning at an event. The F-150 is the best-selling U.S. vehicle and the EV version's success is crucial to U.S. efforts to shift the vehicle fleet away from internal combustion engines.
Ford spokeswoman Melissa Miller said the second-largest U.S. automaker was honored to host Biden at its Ford Rouge complex in Dearborn on May 18. She called the EV F-150 ""a milestone in our country’s transition to cleaner transportation.""
A dozen governors and many U.S. lawmakers have urged Biden to endorse banning new passenger gasoline-powered vehicle sales by 2035, following California's lead -- a step he has declined to take.
The United Auto Workers union is worried about the impact of the shift to EVs on U.S. jobs.
""When autoworkers hear about zero emission by a certain date they get very uncomfortable because they feel it's a challenge to their very employment,"" UAW President Rory Gamble told Reuters last month.
Biden's $174 billion EV proposal includes $100 billion in new consumer rebates.
The UAW wants Biden to limit EV incentives to U.S.-built vehicles.

In March, the UAW criticized Ford Motor's plan to build a new vehicle in Mexico rather than at an Ohio plant. Ford said in November it was planning to build an additional EV at its plant in Cuautitlan, Mexico, where it builds the Mustang Mach-E.

(Reuters) -AstraZeneca said a ""meaningful proportion"" of its shareholders voted against CEO Pascal Soriot's improved pay package on Tuesday, exposing a rift as the drugmaker deals with problems surrounding its COVID-19 vaccine. 
At its annual investor meeting, 60.19% of votes cast were in favour, AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) said, adding that it would ""engage and listen to ensure investors' concerns regarding the approach to executive remuneration are understood.""
Large corporations typically win about 90% support for their pay in annual advisory votes, compensation consultants say, making narrow-win results such as AstraZeneca's effectively a call to review the programme and talk to shareholders.
Shares in London-listed AstraZeneca slipped 1.1% after the vote, which comes as the drugmaker faces a second European Union legal move over delayed deliveries of its COVID-19 vaccine and concerns over rare blood clots.
The new pay policy takes Soriot's maximum annual bonus for 2021 to 2.5 times his base salary, up from twice his salary, and makes him eligible for long-term share awards worth as much as 6.5 times his salary, up from 5.5 times.
His new package puts him among the best paid European pharmaceutical bosses but still lags Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) CEO Alex Gorsky's near-$30 million pay plan which was approved https://www.reuters.com/article/us-johnson-johnson-ceo-pay-idCAKBN2C927M by shareholders last month, also after some opposition. 
Soriot, who has been in charge of AstraZeneca since 2012, told The Times in a 2018 interview https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/salary-size-matters-says-astra-zeneca-boss-on-9-4m-vg9c7hm2t that he found it annoying to be the lowest-paid CEO in the industry. His package has since jumped almost 50% from its level in 2017.
Soriot's total pay package for 2020 of 15.4 million pounds ($21.7 million) was roughly unchanged from 2019. Most of that comprised bonuses and long-term share awards on top of a base salary of 1.3 million pounds.
Shareholder advisory groups ISS, Glass Lewis and PIRC all recommended that investors vote against Soriot's pay increase.
AstraZeneca recognised remuneration was ""a sensitive matter"" during the pandemic but noted its contributions to tackling the crisis and the scale and scope of what Soriot and chief financial officer Marc Dunoyer were being asked to deliver.
The company has pledged not to make any profit from its COVID-19 vaccine during the pandemic and also not from low income countries thereafter.
""The Board considered it appropriate to take another step to address their market pay positioning in order to retain and incentivise them; and enable succession planning,"" it said. 

Soriot has driven a change in AstraZeneca's fortunes by betting on newer products while thwarting a 2014 bid by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE). AstraZeneca's oncology drug business, in particular, is thriving as its not-for-profit pandemic vaccine is distributed. 
In a separate meeting, AstraZeneca shareholders approved its planned $39 billion takeover of U.S. group Alexion (NASDAQ:ALXN).

738,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2021 12:46PM ET</span>",Analysis: What happened when a U.S. state required details on corporate diversity,"By Ross Kerber and Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - Aerospace company Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co was explicit, naming who among its dozen directors were women, Asian and African American. Agricultural giant Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) Co offered a more general accounting, saying its board was 55% diverse.
Illinois officials have seen the range of responses from local companies - many with international profiles - to new state requirements they identify the gender and race or ethnicity of each board member. The regulators say they are going to push all to be more like Boeing.
Companies, investors and elected officials will watch closely what happens next with the state's rare requirement for director-by-director declarations.
Other say less specific disclosures protect directors’ privacy, but even those plans face opposition. Some Republicans have called for regulators to reject a Nasdaq Inc proposal to ask for the number of directors by gender, race and ethnicity - without any names. 
State Representative Chris Welch, speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives, proposed what became the 2019 Illinois law on board diversity reporting. ""You can't go wrong with more data,"" said Welch, who is Black. 
Corporate America's white-dominated leadership has been under a spotlight for supporting the Black Lives Matter movement while listing few leaders of color. Activists point to some studies suggesting companies with diverse boards perform better. 
Chicago-based Morningstar Inc CEO Kunal Kapoor said, ""Over time investors want more detail, rather than less."" 
""Putting sunlight on areas that lacked it has rarely had a poor outcome for investors,"" added Kapoor, who is Indian American and identified as Asian in a corporate filing last year.
Companies face no penalty if they do not fully report but may comply to avoid criticism by people scrutinizing the information, which began appearing on the Secretary of State’s website last year. 
Last month Illinois officials tweaked a disclosure form to make more explicit the call for companies to list the self-identified race or ethnicity of each director, and gender. 
A spokeswoman for ADM - which in 2020 gave the 55% figure and noted five of its 11 directors were African American, Asian or Hispanic, and that three were women - told Reuters the company will consider reporting further detail next year. It has since added a director and says that half its 12-person board is now African American, Asian or Hispanic.
Sixty-six of the 74 companies that filed forms since the law was passed provided enough information to parse out their racial diversity, University of Illinois professor Richard Benton said in a March study https:// He found non-white people held about 15% of the average company's boardroom seats, compared to their 40% share of the state’s population. 
But even among companies with incomplete filings there seemed to be little resistance to the disclosures. For instance at U.S. Cellular Corp only two of fifteen directors provided their race on a form last July. The company did not make directors available to comment but a spokeswoman said for a more current filing, “100% of our members have self-identified.” 
Phyllis Lockett, a director at exchange operator CME Group Inc (NASDAQ:CME), said that diversity disclosures should give some breakdown by race and ethnicity to help identify what groups might be missing. She said she did not mind being identified as a Black woman on a filing last August. ""I am Black and I am a woman. There’s no secret there,” she said. 
Ekta Singh-Bushell, who described herself as Indian American and is identified as Asian in a filing from  Huron Consulting  (NASDAQ:HURN) Group, said that disclosure must have details and nuance on directors’ skills, knowledge and experience to show they do more than ""check the box"" for gender or race
“To bring about sustainable and real, lasting change, the conversation should be, 'Do we have the right representation to fulfill our highest purpose as a corporation?'” she asked.
Among the S&P 500, 9% of directors were Black as of January, according to researcher Equilar, up from 8% in August. Hispanics were 4.2% of S&P 500 directors, up from 3.6% in August. Asian or Pacific Islander directors accounted for 4.5%, up from 4.4% in August. 
African Americans were 13.4% and Hispanics 18.5% of the U.S. population, as of 2019. Asians were 5.9%. Women, 51% of the U.S population, held 23.5% of board seats at Russell 3000 companies last year, up from 18.5% in 2018, Equilar found.
Illinois State Senator Jacqueline Collins, an African American who co-sponsored the legislation, said that without name-by-name disclosures, it can be hard to determine whether companies are being frank when they declare they are diverse.
""So we want to know the specific participation,” Collins said.
Other plans do not go as far. Stock exchange operator Nasdaq Inc is awaiting regulators' approval to require companies it lists to report the number of directors by gender and in categories including Black or Hispanic and LGBTQ+, but not name-by-name. The exchange wants boards to have at least one woman and one minority or LGBTQ+ member, or explain why they do not.
""We don't actually care about which person is which. We want to understand the boardroom as a whole,” said Wendy Cromwell, vice chair of the $1.1 trillion Boston money manager Wellington Management. It supports the Nasdaq plan especially for having companies provide diversity information in easily compared tables. 
But Joe Shoen, the CEO of U-Haul’s parent company, Nasdaq-listed  Amerco  (NASDAQ:UHAL), objects.

""As soon as you sort people by skin color, you got my back up,"" Shoen, who described his family as interracial, said in an interview. “That it has some meaningful indication as to how a corporation is being managed is superficial at best.”
Shoen said he regularly speaks with entry level U-Haul employees to gain diverse perspectives.

739,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2021 12:37PM ET</span>",Tech giants join call for funding U.S. chip production,"By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Some of the world's biggest chip buyers, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, are joining top chip-makers such as  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) to create a new lobbying group to press for government chip manufacturing subsidies.
The newly formed Semiconductors in America Coalition, which also includes Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Amazon Web Services, said Tuesday it has asked U.S. lawmakers to provide funding for the CHIPS for America Act, for which President Joe Biden has asked Congress to provide $50 billion. 
""Robust funding of the CHIPS Act would help America build the additional capacity necessary to have more resilient supply chains to ensure critical technologies will be there when we need them,"" the group said in a letter to Democratic and Republican leaders in both houses of the U.S. Congress.
A global chip shortage has hit automakers hard, with Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co saying it could halve second-quarter production.
Automotive industry groups have pressed the Biden administration to secure chip supply for car factories. But Reuters last week reported administration officials were reluctant to use a national security law to redirect computer chips to automakers because doing so could hurt other industries.
The new coalition includes some of those other chip-consuming industries, with members such as AT&T (NYSE:T), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO),  General Electric  (NYSE:GE), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) and  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ). It cautioned against government actions to favor a single industry such as automakers.
""Government should refrain from intervening as industry works to correct the current supply-demand imbalance causing the shortage,"" the group said. 

Tech companies such as Apple are also being hit by the chip shortage, but far less severely than automakers. 
The iPhone maker said last month it will lose $3 billion to $4 billion in sales in the current quarter ending in June because of the chip shortage, but that equates to just a few percent of the $72.9 billion in sales analyst expect for Apple's fiscal third quarter, according to Refinitiv revenue estimates.

But let’s find out which of these stocks is a better buy now.The world’s leading sports brands Nike, Inc. (NKE) and  Adidas AG  (DE:ADSGN) (ADDYY) have driven growth in the sportswear market and increased their brand values significantly over the past several years. NIKE sells its products in six categories—running, NIKE basketball, the Jordan brand, football, training, and sportswear. ADDYY sells footwear, apparel, accessories and gear, equipment, and golf products under the Adidas and Reebok brand names.
The rebound in outdoor individual sports activities and team sports has accelerated the demand for sportswear and athletic gear this year. In fact, an increased focus on activities such as home workouts, running, yoga, and Pilates have motivated consumers to buy more sports and wellness-related products. Increasing health awareness and the growing popularity of athleisure should bolster the demand for products offered by sporting giants NKE and ADDYY. Given their continued innovation and seamless marketplace operations, we believe both companies have plenty of room to grow.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -More than half of 100 companies with the lowest median employee wages in the S&P 500 Index boosted CEO pay by changing the rules for assessing executive performance during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a report by a left-leaning policy group published on Tuesday.
The report from the Institute for Policy Studies found that 51 of these 100 companies, including beverage and snack maker Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co, cruise ship operator Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp and fast food corporation Yum Brands Inc, reduced median worker pay by 2% to $28,187 on average in 2020 compared to 2019, even as the median compensation for their CEOs rose 29% to $15.3 million. 
The findings offer ammunition to investors opposing executive compensation hikes in non-binding votes held at the annual shareholder meetings of companies. More companies are facing shareholder backlash against their CEO pay this year than last, Reuters has reported.
The companies studied in the report bolstered executive compensation by lowering performance targets, giving retention bonuses and swapping out stock awards linked to financial results with time-based share grants, the report found. 
Carnival awarded CEO Arnold Donald special retention and performance-based stock awards valued at $5.2 million last August, according to a securities filing.
A Carnival spokesman said in an email that, despite the awards, Donald received no cash bonus in 2020 and his total compensation in the last year was down 29% versus 2019.
A Coke spokesperson referred comment to the company's proxy statement, which notes that roughly 1,000 employees received special share awards, in addition to executives.
""We can't rely on corporate boards to fix the problem of excessive CEO compensation,"" Sarah Anderson, a co-author of the report, said in an interview. Anderson suggested in the report that companies with the highest CEO-to-average worker pay ratios should be taxed more. 
The CEO-to-average worker pay ratio for the 51 companies in the report was 830-to-1. 
The Yum Brands board authorized discretionary adjustments to bonus programs resulting in a $1.4 million bonus for CEO David Gibbs he otherwise would not have received, according to a securities filing. He also received a one-time stock award of $882,127, for a total 2020 compensation of $14.6 million, according to the filing. 
The company's board said the compensation boost was appropriate given that Gibbs and other executives helped stabilize the business and positioned it for success coming out of the pandemic.

In a prepared statement, Yum Brands said Gibbs gave up his base salary and used it to help fund one-time $1,000 bonuses for nearly 1,200 restaurant general managers. The company also awarded special bonuses to team members in company-owned restaurants globally.
Yum Brands identified a part-time worker at its fast food chicken chain KFC as its median employee, with a total compensation of $11,377, in the filing.

(Reuters) -European stocks tumbled from all-time highs on Tuesday, with the travel, retail and technology sectors among the top losers after global sentiment turned risk-averse on worries about rising inflation in the United States.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 2.0%, its biggest percentage decline since late December. The main bourses in Frankfurt, Paris and London all lost more than 2%. 
Wall Street's main indexes slid for the second straight day, with the benchmark S&P 500 hitting a one-month low on fears that rising inflation could push the U.S. Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy faster than expected. (N)
""We will see inflation bounce back in the short term. The second thing is we have bottlenecks in certain areas,"" said Niall Gallagher, European equity fund manager at GAM.
Gallagher said jumps in commodity prices and issues around semiconductors were some of the factors that will lead to a short-term spike in inflation. 
European technology shares fell 2% to their lowest in six weeks, while mining firms handed back some of the strong gains notched up in the previous session.
Travel and leisure stocks slumped 5.7% overall. Sweden's Evolution Gaming Group tumbled 13.8% after the bookrunner announced the pricing of block trades.
Meanwhile, British Airways' owner, IAG (LON:ICAG), slumped 7.4% after announcing a convertible bond offering worth 800 million euros.

German minerals group K+S fell 2.7% despite raising its 2021 core profit forecast.

The pullback in European stocks comes after a strong rally, with the STOXX 600 up 9% so far this year as a solid earnings season and optimism about the reopening of the economy saw more buying in economy-sensitive parts of the market. 
Among the few gainers was the UK lifestyle e-commerce company THG HG Plc, which soared 11.9% after raising more than $1 billion in equity, including $730 million from Japan's SoftBank Group.

A 66-34 joint venture of Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) and Italy's De Nora, Thyssenkrupp Uhde Chlorine Engineers (TKUCE) is the world's largest supplier of chlor-alkali membrane technologies used to produce hydrogen.
In a call with analysts, Merz said Thyssenkrupp has hired an investment bank to explore strategic options for the business and to come up with proposals by the summer.
Two people familiar with the matter said the bank was Citi. Citi declined to comment.
""The main objective behind it is to fund further growth in this business. So we would want to dedicate the potential funds into growth. And that can, of course, mean also to find partners in order to grow,"" Merz said.
TKUCE, rivals of which include Norway's Nel ASA, Britain's ITM Power and France's McPhy Energy SAS, has a fair value of 2.8 billion euros ($3.4 billion),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) wrote in a note last month.
TKUCE, which sources say has annual sales in the double-digit million euro range, was carved out of Thyssenkrupp's Plant Technology division due to its growth prospects.
Thyssenkrupp declined to comment on the name of the investment bank it had hired or the estimated sales figure.

Investing.com – Boeing (NYSE:BA) shares fell more than 2% in Tuesday’s session on reports its rival Airbus (PA:AIR) has asked suppliers to be ready for a higher output next year even as the U.S. company struggles to fix an electrical issue with its 737 MAX planes.
The electrical issue has kept Boeing’s popular 737 MAX planes suspended for an extended period.
A Reuters report said Airbus is asking key suppliers to get ready for a further 18% increase in A320-family jet output by the end of 2022, on top of existing targets for this year.
The European manufacturer’s A320 competes with Boeing's 737 MAX.
Two accidents in 2018 and 2019 forced authorities to ground the narrow body 737 MAX, which was at the time Boeing's biggest money maker in a booming market for narrow body planes. The 20-month safety ban was lifted in November after the company made the fixes.
But a separate electrical issue soon after led the manufacturer to halt deliveries of the planes with an advisory to its clients to not fly those in their fleet.

(Reuters) -  Ebay Inc  on Tuesday allowed the sale of non-fungible tokens for digital collectibles like trading cards, images or video clips on its platform, the first e-commerce company to tap into the recent frenzy around NFTs.
NFTs, virtual assets that exist on a blockchain ledger, have exploded in popularity this year, as enthusiasts spend enormous sums of money on artwork and other items that exist only online, with some selling for tens of millions of dollars recently at auction houses Christie's and Sotheby's.
While multi-million dollar deals, including the $69 million sale of a digital artwork by Beeple in March, have created ripples in the art world, a market for digital collectibles such as NFT trading cards, images or video clips have also thrived alongside.
These could range from something like Kurt Cobain's last photoshoot to historic moments from NBA games. While anyone can view the NFTs for free, the buyer has the status of being the official owner - a kind of digital bragging rights.
In the short term, an NFT inventory will be provided to sellers who meet eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY)'s standards, the company told Reuters, adding that users can expect to see programs, policies and tools in future that will let them buy and sell NFTs across a broader range of categories.
""In the coming months, eBay will add new capabilities that bring blockchain-driven collectibles to our platform,"" said Jordan Sweetnam, senior vice president and general manager for eBay's North America market.

The announcement comes after eBay said last week it was open to the possibility of accepting cryptocurrency as a form of payment in the future and was looking at ways to get NFTs on its platform.

With 25% tariffs on imported Chinese electric vehicles imposed on top of existing levies under former U.S. President Donald Trump still in place, Tesla now intends to limit the proportion of China output in its global production, two of the four people said.
Tesla had earlier considered expanding exports of its China-made entry-level Model 3 to more markets, including the United States, sources told Reuters, a plan that had not previously been reported.
Tesla currently ships China-made Model 3s to Europe, where it is building a factory in Germany.
Shares of Tesla fell as much as 5.3% early on Thursday.
Tesla sold 25,845 China-made vehicles in China and overseas in April, down from 35,478 in March, according to data from China Passenger Car Association.
Tesla's Shanghai factory is designed to make up to 500,000 cars per year, and has the capacity to produce Model 3 and Model Y vehicles at a rate of 450,000 total units per year.
In March, Tesla refrained from bidding on a plot of land across the road from the plant as it no longer aimed to boost China production capacity significantly, at least for now, three of the people said, declining to be named as the discussions were private.
In a statement to Reuters, Tesla said its Shanghai factory was ""developing as planned."" 
The Shanghai city government, a key supporter in Tesla's establishment of a wholly owned factory in China - the first and only foreign passenger car plant not required to form a joint venture - did not respond to a request for comment.
Tesla had never declared an intention to acquire the land, which is about half the size of the 200-acre (80 hectare) plot housing Tesla's current facility and would enable the company to lift capacity by another 200,000 to 300,000 cars, said two of the people. 
Tesla's China sales are surging despite mounting regulatory pressure in the country after consumer disputes over product safety and scrutiny over how it handles data.
It generated $3 billion in revenue in China in the first three months of this year, more than tripling year-earlier sales and accounting for 30% of total revenue.
LAND PLANS
Led by mercurial Chief Executive Elon Musk, Tesla is known for shifting gears on strategy, including in China. 
Construction documents posted on a government website in March show Tesla is revamping its plant in Shanghai to add capacity.
Tesla still has land, designed for production but now used for parking, at its Shanghai site. One of the people said Tesla could expand its capacity beyond 500,000 on its existing site. Another said Tesla may acquire more land for more car production lines in the future.
Separately, Tesla is building facilities to repair and reproduce key components such as electric motors and battery cells and build EV chargers at its Shanghai plant.
The Shanghai government has been talking to several companies to sell the land for new-energy commercial vehicle production, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter. 
Tesla faces intensifying competition in China with domestic players such as Nio (NYSE:NIO) Inc, which is considering making mass market products under another marque.
Even before the trade war tariffs, relatively few China-made cars were shipped to the United States.

General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) sells its China-made Buick Envision in the United States, paying the additional 25% tariff, although the SUV is not a high volume model.

International Air Transport Association Director General Willie Walsh said strong freight revenues had been ""the difference between life and death for some airlines"" as COVID-19 lockdowns brought passenger traffic to a standstill.
""Cargo will continue for the next few years to play a bigger role than it did before the crisis,"" he told an online briefing.
The mass grounding of passenger planes that normally carry half the world's air freight in their holds has driven cargo prices and revenue higher. That led some airlines to post record freight earnings last year, even as overall losses peaked.
Despite returning passenger capacity, a broader economic recovery will sustain cargo income that surged to 35% of airline revenue last year from 10-15% pre-crisis, IATA predicts.
Major airlines like Lufthansa are also counting on further support from the historically volatile freight business.

""Even if there's more passenger aircraft coming (back), the global economy will pick up further,"" CEO Carsten Spohr said during the German airline's results presentation last month.

752,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2021 11:52AM ET</span>",Factbox: Global big banks plot back-to-office plans as vaccines roll out,"(Reuters) - The biggest banks in the world plan to re-open their offices, emboldened by aggressive vaccination drives and falling case numbers in major financial hubs, after sending most employees home early last year to help stem the spread of the virus.
Banks globally are adopting different methods to ensure a successful back to office plan including hybrid working models and vaccination drives.
Here is the state of play with back-to-office plans in various regions:
UNITED STATES
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co
The bank said in March it plans to start bringing workers back to its offices after Labor Day due to the increasing availability of vaccines. The company is evaluating whether to allow certain businesses or functional subgroups in the United States to return to the workplace before Labor Day.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)
The bank is planning to bring U.S. employees back to the office by mid-June.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)
The largest U.S. bank will bring its employees in the United States back to the office on a rotational basis from July and plans to maintain a 50% occupancy cap during the return-to-office phase. 
The bank also plans to step up the return of all of its employees in England to working at least part of their week in its offices from June 21.
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)
Chief Executive Officer Jane Fraser said in a memo in March that post-pandemic, most of the employees would be able to work in a ""hybrid"" setting, allowing them to work from home for up to two days a week.
UNITED KINGDOM:
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc 
Chief Executive Officer Jes Staley has said the bank will adopt a hybrid working model, and will reduce its real estate footprint but maintain its main offices in London and New York. 
 HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA)
HSBC has said it plans to cut its global office footprint by around 40% as it moves to a hybrid working model for most employees. The lender moved 1,200 call center staff in Britain to permanent home working contracts, Reuters reported in April, going further than some rivals in cementing changes to working patterns.
Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LON:LLOY) 
Britain's biggest domestic bank is hoping to resume office-based trials and experiments with around 5,000 of its staff this summer, once government restrictions allow. The lender has said it plans to cut 20% of its office space over two years.
Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Plc
StanChart said it will make permanent the flexible working arrangements introduced during the pandemic, and that it could cut a third of its office space in the next three to four years.
NatWest 
Chief Executive Officer Alison Rose has said the bank is likely to adopt a hybrid working model, but has stressed offices will remain important as a place to bring people together to collaborate.
GERMANY
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) 

Germany's largest lender said it is following a regional approach to the pandemic and return to the office issues, reflecting the different situations in individual countries, in line with government guidance in individual jurisdictions.

753,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2021 11:42AM ET</span>",Pandemic propels makeover at shipping giant Maersk,"By Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen
COPENHAGEN (Reuters) -Maersk is accelerating its plan to transform itself from a container shipping giant into an integrated logistics company following its strong performance during the pandemic, Chief Executive Soren Skou said on Tuesday.
Maersk, which handles one in five containers shipped worldwide, aims to expand its land-based logistics services, hoping to gain a larger share of the supply chain from existing shipping clients such as Puma and Walmart (NYSE:WMT).
""I don't want to put a date to it, but I'm certain that our logistics business has potential to become just a big as ocean shipping measured in turnover,"" Skou told Reuters in an interview.
While container shipping, which accounted for 73% of revenue last year, will continue to be at the centre of the company, land-based services such as shipments from factories, customs services and warehousing will be its ""growth engine"", Skou said.
""The pandemic has no doubt underlined the value for our customers of doing business with a company that can take responsibility for everything all the way from the factory to the end destination,"" Skou said.
Maersk is targeting like-for-like growth in its logistics business above 10% in the next five years, complemented by future acquisitions that could be in the magnitude of $1 billion, he said.
""We see a huge opportunity in land-based logistics,"" Skou said, noting that its 200 biggest customers in ocean container shipping currently only place a ""very, very small fraction"" of their land-based logistics with Maersk.
Last week, the Copenhagen-headquartered company posted record quarterly profit and said it expected the exceptionally strong performance to continue for the rest of the year, driven by high demand for containers to meet a surge in orders.
Skou told investors on Tuesday that he expected a return on invested capital (ROIC), a measure of how well a company uses capital to generate profit, above 12% from 2021 to 2025, compared with an average 2.3% in the previous five years.
The focus on land-based logistics could result in Swiss rival MSC overtaking Maersk as the world's biggest container liner during the second quarter of next year, said Hua Joo Tan, an analyst at shipping consultancy Liner Research Services.

""If MSC ends up having more capacity that we do, that's not the end of the world,"" Skou said. ""That's not how we think about being No 1. Our focus is on having a much higher turnover per container that we ship.""
Maersk owns or operates about 710 container vessels with a total capacity of 4.1 million containers and operates 66 container ports around the world.

""The world is gradually coming out of the crisis, and that opens up enormous market potential under our own steam. If too much is bought in, we will no longer be Siemens.""
The German engineering group would look at acquisitions to round out its presence in some sectors and also accelerate growth, said the Danish executive who has been chairman since 2018.
Hagemann Snabe said he also sees big opportunities for Siemens in helping customers reduce their environmental impact.

Investing.com -- Callaway Golf (NYSE:ELY) Company rose more than 4% after beating estimates, perhaps because it's easier to socially distance on the course. The year-long forecast also promises to be at least as good as pre-pandemic times.
Earnings per share of $2.19 easily beat the expected 12 cents on record sales of $652 million versus the estimated $562 million, according to data compiled by Investing.com.Golf equipment is seeing unprecedented demand as the soft goods and Topgolf segments are recovering from the pandemic faster than expected, the company said.
Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) called the stock its top pick on a ""rebirth"" of the sport, with profit recovering and outperformance of the Topgolf business, StreetInsider reported.
“We are very pleased with our first quarter financial results, with revenues increasing 47% and Adjusted EBITDA increasing 113% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020,” said Chief Executive Officer Chip Brewer in a statement. ""We believe our three operating segments are well positioned for both the current environment and our expectations over the next several years.” 
Callaway completed its purchase of Topgolf, which runs golf entertainment venues, in March. Shares have tripled to the highest in decades since the pandemic hit in March 2020. The outlook is pretty good, too. 
Callaway previously guided that business would not achieve 2021 revenue or an adjusted Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) equivalent to 2019 levels -- that's been revised to show the legacy Callaway business will exceed 2019 levels and the Topgolf business will meet or exceed the full twelve month 2019 levels.

761,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2021 11:12AM ET</span>",Samsung sees pandemic-led appliances boom extending run to rest of year,"By Joyce Lee
SEOUL (Reuters) - A pandemic-driven boom in home appliance sales will last longer than previously anticipated and extend into the second half of the year, Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd's head of the business said.
Lee Jae-seung, president of the South Korean company's digital appliances business, told Reuters in an interview that he had originally expected the boom to subside after the first quarter of this year.
But extended travel restrictions despite vaccine rollouts and consumers being flush with cash due to economic stimulus measures of governments plus limited spending avenues for them had stretched the boom, Lee said.
A buoyant demand outlook from one of the prominent global home appliances makers brings supply-chain issues to the fore, specifically a shortage of semiconductors that has hurt many industries, particularly the automobile sector.
Lee acknowledged that the global chip shortage is weighing on Samsung (KS:005930) too, but said the appliance business has ""secured enough to respond"".
It has done this by swapping chips to 12-inch wafer ones from 8-inch ones, undertaking software workarounds, and diversifying chip sourcing firms to two or more per chip from countries such as Japan, Taiwan and China, he said.
""When all market players are buoyed by rising demand, supply competitiveness is crucial in occupying the market early,"" Lee said
Samsung saw first-quarter home appliance sales jump in all markets, including a 144% surge in vacuum cleaner sales in North America, a 79% increase in dishwashers in Europe and a 12-fold jump in robot vacuum sales in Brazil.
Samsung is also globally expanding its 'Bespoke' brand customised appliances. For example, Korean fridge customers can choose from 360 colours for each door. 
Higher personalisation has led Samsung to increase subcontractor outsourcing similar to the auto industry, Lee said, which also allowed Samsung's appliances production to rise around 30%-50% without extensive investment. 
Samsung, though, is also in the process of adding new lines in most factories including in Mexico, the United States and South Korea to meet rising demand. 
It will offer customised, connected refrigerators, kitchen appliances, air purifiers and vacuum cleaners as well as closets that produce steam to clean clothes and shoes and kill bacteria, in markets such as North America, Europe and Korea this year. 

Samsung does not disclose standalone home appliance earnings, but according to Eugene Investment & Securities, the business made an operating profit of about 400 billion won ($357.71 million) in the January-March quarter, more than a two-fold jump from about 140 billion won a year earlier.

Investing.com – Shares of oil giants  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDSa) slumped Tuesday even though fears about a prolonged outage of the largest U.S. fuel pipeline system receded.
Chevron and Shell each fell 2%, while Exxon fell nearly 3%. BP (NYSE:BP) traded 2% lower, Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) fell 2.4% and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) fell more than 7%, the last one also owing to it reporting losses Monday for the March quarter.
A disruption to retail supplies would have hiked prices at the pump, a distant eventuality now given that Colonial Pipeline has said it is working on restarting its network with ""the goal of substantially restoring operational service by the end of the week"".
Some temporary firmness in fuel prices could still be seen now that a long-term disruption to the Colonial Pipeline can be ruled out.
Colonial’s network transports more than 2.5 million barrels per day of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel from the Gulf to states on the East Coast.
U.S. crude futures Crude Oil WTI Futures fell 0.9% at $64.35 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent Brent Oil Futures contract fell 0.7% to $67.86.
“Refined product markets do not seem overly concerned about the disruption to the Colonial pipeline, with prices settling only marginally higher yesterday,” said analysts at ING, in a note. “This is still likely to lead to some tightness in gasoline on the East Coast, with inventories in the region currently sitting below the 5-year average. We will likely see increased flows of seaborne cargoes into the East Coast in order to help with this tightness.”

(Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co said on Tuesday 737 MAX jet deliveries fell to just four airplanes in April from 19 in the previous month, as the U.S. planemaker's best-selling aircraft struggles with an electrical problem that has re-grounded part of the fleet.
Boeing said last month it was halting deliveries of the jet again due to the electrical problem.
The planemaker started delivering the 737 MAX to airlines in December nearly two years after the jet returned to service following a lengthy safety ban.
The company said it delivered a total of 17 airplanes in April, bringing its deliveries to a total of 94 aircraft for the first four months of the year.
Apart from the four 737 MAX jets, Boeing said it delivered nine 787 Dreamliners, two 767s and two 777-freighters last month and booked 25 gross orders.
The gross orders include five previously announced 777-freighters for Silk Way West Airlines and 20 orders for the 737 planes - 14 for Dubai Aerospace Enterprise, three for Air Lease (NYSE:AL) Corp and three for unidentified customers.
Boeing said customers canceled 17 737 MAX airplane orders in April. Net of cancellations and conversions, Boeing booked eight aircraft orders last month and had no adjustments for stricter accounting standards.

The company's gross orders for the first four months were 307 airplanes. Net orders after accounting adjustments were 84 aircraft for the same period, Boeing said, up from 76 planes in March.
Boeing said its official backlog fell to 4,045 aircraft orders in April, from 4,054 aircraft orders in March.

(Reuters) - Global investors have turned net buyers of hedge funds in recent months, data showed, attracted by their strong gains and the prospects of higher market volatility as countries recover unevenly from the pandemic.
Hedge funds have attracted cumulative net inflows worth $1.3 billion in the past three months, data from Refinitiv Lipper shows. These funds, whose complex strategies generally do better in volatile times, registered massive outflows of $25 billion in 2020. (Graphic: Monthly flows into hedge funds, https://graphics.reuters.com/HEDGEFUNDS-FLOWS/qmypmenwqpr/chart.png)
The data shows hedge funds have delivered an average gain of 4.3% this year so far, after gaining 11.6% in the last quarter of 2020 - the biggest quarterly gain since 2009. (Graphic: Hedge funds' quarterly gains, https://graphics.reuters.com/HEDGE-FUNDS/qmyvmenyqvr/chart_eikon.jpg)
""Since the first quarter of 2020 we have seen market volatility and dispersion rise,"" said Chris Walvoord, U.S.-based global head of hedge fund portfolio management and research at investment consultant Aon (NYSE:AON). ""This is generally good for relative-value hedge fund strategies that go both long and short and rely on the relative movement of prices.""
""We have also seen an increase in events, ranging from mergers to restructurings and even SPACs, that again provide opportunities for other types of hedge funds.""
Hestia Capital Partners LP led the gainers among 1,514 hedge funds tracked by Lipper, climbing 224% this year. Hestia has large holdings in GameStop (NYSE:GME), which soared at the start of the year thanks to a social media frenzy.
Arca Digital Assets Master Fund LP and Hashdex Digital Assets Index Fund, which invest extensively in cryptocurrencies, were also among the top gainers.
Investors had exited hedge funds in the past few years, disappointed by the lack of ""alpha"", which is the measure of a manager's skill in beating stock returns, and their higher fees and bigger downside risks. (Graphic: Hedge fund's performance vs MSCI World index, https://graphics.reuters.com/HEDGEFUNDS-PERFORMANCE/jbyvryjdjpe/chart_eikon.jpg)
A steady equity rally since March last year, backed by government stimulus, also attracted investors.
Jim Smigiel, Pennsylvania-based chief investment officer of non-traditional strategies at investment management firm SEI, said hedge funds' performance should not be compared to that of equity indices because of the diverse investment strategies they employ.
According to SEI's own measure of hedge fund returns, based on exposure to market factors such as equity, credit and interest rates, 2020 was one of their best years in the recent past, he said.
Lipper data indicates that contrarian and ""bottom-up"" hedge fund strategies, aimed at the stocks deemed undervalued after the 2020 rally, have performed better. (Graphic: Price performance of hedge funds based on strategies, https://graphics.reuters.com/HEDGEFUNDS-ANALYSIS/gjnpwnezmvw/chart_eikon.jpg)
On the other hand, systematic-quant funds, which buy and sell securities according to mathematical formulas and computer models, lagged broader hedge fund returns. (Graphic: Hedge funds returns this year- by strategy, https://graphics.reuters.com/HEDGEFUND-RETURNS/gjnpwnybkvw/chart_eikon.jpg)
Smigiel said there were many examples of speculative excesses in areas such as SPACs, cryptocurrencies and ""meme stocks"" - driven by social media - where prices have diverged from fundamentals.
""While such periods of excess can persist for a while, prices eventually tend to implode, creating compelling opportunities for short sellers,"" he said.

765,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2021 10:56AM ET</span>",America's mask makers face post-pandemic meltdown,"By Timothy Aeppel
(Reuters) - The small U.S. manufacturers that rushed to produce face masks over the past year are now stuck with hundreds of millions of unsold face coverings because China is flooding the market with below-cost masks, and most may not survive the end of the pandemic.
That's the thrust of a letter to President Joe Biden released Tuesday by a trade group representing 26 small manufacturers that set up production of the badly needed safety items as the health crisis took hold last year. 
The manufacturers said over half their production would be forced offline in 60 days if they don't get immediate federal aid, costing thousands of jobs. They blame low-priced imports, especially from China.
""We write to you with a request for immediate help against unfair trade practices by foreign nations that threaten the viability of the U.S. domestic PPE mask manufacturing industry, as well as future U.S. pandemic preparedness efforts,"" the newly formed group, the American Mask Manufacturer's Association, said in the letter.
The group said they have capacity to produce 3.7 billion surgical masks and more than 1 billion of the higher-protection N95 masks a year - and are now sitting on stockpiles of 260 million surgical masks in their warehouses that they are struggling to sell. Another 20 million N95s are also on factory shelves.
When masks were in short supply last year, prices surged. But prices have now crashed, and hospital administrators and others are shopping for the best prices in a market crowded with new offerings.
A box of 50 surgical masks which sold for more than $50 a year ago can be found for $5 now.
The trade group said while there are 3 to 6 cents in raw material in every surgical mask, imported Chinese surgical masks now sell for an average of 1 cent each. ""China ... is effectively dumping masks on the U.S. market at well below actual costs."" 
""If this remains unchanged, 54% of our production will go offline in 60 days and 84.6% in less than a year,"" the group said in the letter. The group said they'd created more than 7,800 U.S. jobs in the last year, but roughly a third of those have already been lost to production cuts.
PROTECTING PRODUCERS
The Biden administration has pledged to look at ways to support domestic producers of protective equipment - including potentially finding ways to subsidize U.S. producers - but the government reviews are still underway.
""The idea that everyone expressed during the crisis - that we need to avoid (PPE shortages) ever happening again - hasn't changed profit-driven institutions,"" said James Wyner, chief executive of Shawmut Corp., a West Bridgewater, Massachusetts, maker of engineered materials that expanded into mask production during the crisis. ""The distributors are still sourcing their stuff at the lowest price.""
Wyner said he's selling masks from his new production lines, but ""substantially less than we would like.""
Adam Albrecht, senior quality control manager at Indiana Face Mask, another small producer, said when the firm first started producing the higher-filtration N95 masks last year, ""People came out of the woodwork, saying: 'We can sell this, we can sell this.' But it seems no matter how much we adjust prices down, the Chinese stay just below.""
Some of the small mask makers are confident they will survive. 
Dan Izhaky, who together with a partner has invested $4 million in a new mask factory outside Los Angeles, said the challenge is greater for makers of surgical masks, the ubiquitous safety masks that are relatively easy to make. Izhaky's company makes more complex N95 masks and he said he has continued to expand. ""But we also believe the Biden administration is going to take a number of steps down the road to really help us be sustainable,"" he said. 
The mask trade group - which doesn't include industry giants such as 3M Co. and Honeywell International Inc (NYSE:HON). - urged the Biden administration to take immediate action to support the industry. 

Their recommendations include requiring the federal government and any other institution receiving federal dollars for buying protective equipment to buy only U.S.-made masks that comply with government rules on domestic content and remove any masks in the federal stockpile that don’t meet federal standards. They also want the administration to require any hospital that accepts federal funds to earmark 40% of its spending on PPE for domestic producers by 2023.
They are also asking the government to consider buying the 260 million masks now stockpiled at the new factories.

IAG, which also owns Aer Lingus, Iberia and Vueling, has a weekly cash burn rate of 175 million euros while most of its fleet is grounded due to restrictions, meaning its focus over the past year has been on raising funds. 
Forecasting a travel recovery from July, the group said last week that it had liquidity of 10.5 billion euros, helped recently by a new revolving credit facility and the deferral of some pension payments.
On Tuesday, it said its convertible bond issue would boost its liquidity by around 825 million euros. Strong demand for the offering meant it would raise more than the 800 million euros initially targeted for the senior unsecured bonds, which are convertible into IAG shares, and due in 2028.
The group's shares were down 5.6% at 197 pence in afternoon trading, underperforming a 2% decline in London's blue-chip share index.
IAG said the proceeds would strengthen its finances given continued uncertainty around the travel recovery, but could also be used to provide extra resources to take advantage of a recovery in demand. 
""This is simply the next move for IAG to continue to bolster liquidity while the crisis drags on,"" said Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska. 
IAG was left disappointed by Britain's cautious reopening of travel last week, which left its big markets, Spain and the United States, off a list of low-risk destinations.

Announcing the final terms of the bonds, IAG said the bonds would carry a fixed rate of interest of 1.125% payable semi-annually in arrears and the conversion price of the bonds has been set at 3.3694 euros per share, a premium of 45% over the volume weighted average price of the shares in the period from launch to pricing, translated into euros.

Real sales, however, missed the mark, coming in at $387 million versus the estimated $573 million. First quarter sales were also worse than the previous two quarters. The company also paid up for that virtual currency, reporting a loss of 46 cents, way worse than the expected loss of 13 cents, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com.Roblox jumped more than 50% when it listed in March, and shares are currently trading at around that same level, about $69. The kid's gaming site saw daily active users up 37%, to 43.3 million from April 2020.
“Our first quarter 2021 results enabled us to continue investing aggressively in the key areas that we believe will drive long term growth and value, specifically hiring talented engineering and product professionals and growing the earnings for our developer community,” said Chief Financial Officer Michael Guthrie in a statement. “We believe we must continue to innovate and so remain focused on building great technology to make progress on our key growth vectors, primarily international expansion and expanding the age demographic of our users.”

(Reuters) -Germany received a record 39 billion euros of demand on Tuesday for a 30-year green bond, extending its yield curve for environmentally focused debt and drawing strong investor interest despite a selloff across euro debt markets. 
The bond, which raised 6 billion euros, is Germany's first green issuance of the year and follows an inaugural 10-year green bond last September and a five-year in November.
Investors hope the growing German curve will serve as a reference point for other borrowers in Europe, where governments have generally focused on a single maturity for green issuance. 
The 30-year bond priced for a yield of 0.391%, 2 basis points below its conventional twin, according to two lead managers, the biggest green premium Germany has so far secured at issuance, according to Climate Bonds Initiative data. 
Germany's green bonds are all twinned with an otherwise identical conventional bond, allowing investors to switch between the two to mitigate liquidity concerns. 
Green bonds, with their limited supply, usually trade with a lower yield. Germany's twin structure offers a clearer gauge of the green premium, which can be hard to estimate.
Jens Peter Sorensen, chief strategist at Danske Bank, said premiums tend to be higher on longer-dated green bonds given they are rare and are mostly issued by governments rather than companies.
""These are being bought by life insurance and pension funds and there are few alternatives,"" Sorensen said. 
Germany will raise another 6 billion euros from green bonds this year, through a new 10-year issue to be auctioned in September and re-opened in October.
U.S. INFLATION EYED
Demand for the deal topped the 33 billion-euro order book seen at last year's 10-year green bond and was the highest ever for a syndicated German government bond. 
The bumper orders came despite a broader debt market selloff that sent Germany's benchmark 10-year yield up 6 bps to the highest since March 2020 at -0.152%. 
Italian yields also rose sharply, with the 10-year touching the highest since last September at 0.951%. 
Bonds sold off alongside equities ahead of Wednesday's U.S. inflation reading, which investors will gauge for a possible change of stance from the Federal Reserve.
A market gauge of long-term euro zone inflation expectations, the five-year, five-year forward, rose above 1.60%, its highest since December 2018 after a German investor morale survey far exceeded expectations.

""I think it is half supply-related and half macro-related. Given the magnitude of the move and broad consensus for higher Bund yields I would venture that this morning's move has served as the sell signal everyone was waiting for,"" said Antoine Bouvet, senior rates strategist at ING. 
A $58 billion auction of three-year U.S. Treasuries follows later on Tuesday.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Thyssenkrupp's closely watched cash flow plunged deeper into the red in the second quarter, hit by restructuring costs and investments that overshadowed a guidance upgrade on the back of stronger demand and prices.
Shares in the German conglomerate fell as much as 9.6% after the group said that negative free cash flow before mergers and acquisitions (M&S) widened to 750 million euros ($911 million), worse than analysts at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) and JP Morgan had expected.
""This is putting pressure on the stock,"" said one trader, also pointing to profit-taking as inflation jitters triggered a global sell-off in equities.
Returning to positive cash flow has been one of the key targets of the submarines-to-bearings group in its efforts to win back confidence among investors and to prove it has a sustainable business model.
""We want and need to return to positive cash flow as quickly as possible,"" said Chief Financial Officer Klaus Keysberg, adding that investments also need to be made to ensure the company can grow.
Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) confirmed free cash flow before M&A would be negative at about 1 billion euros this year.
Keysberg also toned down expectations ahead of a supervisory board meeting scheduled for May 19, saying no major decisions are planned for that meeting.
Thyssenkrupp in February said it would come up with concrete proposals in May for how to develop its hydrogen division, which has drawn huge interest from investors.
Thyssenkrupp is emerging from years of crisis, during which it lost two CEOs, warned on profits numerous times and sold its prized elevators division to private equity.
Boosted by a global economic recovery that is driving both demand and prices for steel, car parts and materials, Thyssenkrupp also raised its full-year outlook for the second time in three months.
The company now expects adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) in the hundreds of millions of euros in the year to September, having previously said it expects to almost break even.

In the second quarter, adjusted EBIT came in at 220 million euros, the company's highest profit in eight quarters.

A sale of the business was among the several options L Brands had considered before deciding on a spin-off.
The retail business of bath, body and home fragrance will be housed under a different company, Bath & Body Works.
L Brands held talks with several potential buyers while reviewing its lingerie line, but concluded that a spin-off offered more value.
Victoria's Secret expects to be valued between $5 billion and $7 billion in a spinoff to L Brands shareholders, the New York Times reported.
According to Reuters, L Brands expects sales for the first quarter ended May 1 to be $3.02 billion, up from $1.65 billion a year earlier, with revenue growth across both brands."

HOUSTON (Reuters) -Britain's biggest asset manager, Legal & General, on Tuesday said it will vote for an activist hedge fund's board slate at  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM)'s shareholder meeting later this month, fueling a pitched fight over the oil major's future.
Top U.S. oil producer Exxon is battling hedge fund Engine No. 1 over four seats on its 12-member board and the direction of the company. The fund has criticized Exxon's poor returns, spending on fossil fuels and lack of clear plans for the energy transition. 
Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM) owns Exxon shares worth nearly $1 billion, according to Refinitiv data. It disclosed its voting plans in a blog on Tuesday. Exxon's annual shareholders meeting will be held on May 26.
LGIM also opposed the reelection to the board of Exxon's chief executive, Darren Woods, and lead independent director Kenneth Frazier, and backs the separation of the CEO and chairman roles, John Hoeppner, head of U.S. stewardship and sustainable investments at LGIM, said in an interview.
LGIM will vote for Engine No. 1's nominees - Gregory Goff, Anders Runevad, Kaisa Hietala and Alexander Karsner - he said. The Engine No. 1 slate also has support from large pension funds in California and New York.
""We think they have a good, complementary set of experiences that would be in the best interest of the long-term shareholders,"" Hoeppner said.
Exxon's current board is full of ""incredibly accomplished CEOs"" but lacks people who understand oil and gas and the energy transition, and who have overseen business transformation, Hoeppner said.
Exxon did not comment but pointed to a Monday letter to shareholders that said its directors ""bring valuable expertise in capital allocation across industries, complex corporate transitions, the energy industry, investor perspectives, Asia-Pacific markets and environmental, social and governance,"" practices.
LGIM has ""very rarely, if ever,"" spoken with Exxon's directors and has not found that its board offers ""the same level of board-level buy-in that we see in other organizations,"" Hoeppner said.

LGIM last year voted against CEO Woods and in favor of an independent chairman. It has signed onto the Net Zero Asset Managers  Initiative, which vows to press portfolio companies to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner.
Exxon has not set 2050 net zero targets as European peers have done. To try to address investor concerns on climate, in recent months it has expanded its board, pledged to increase spending on lower-carbon initiatives and said it would lower the intensity of its oilfield greenhouse gas emissions.

773,By Investing.com,"<span>May 11, 2021 09:43AM ET</span>",Wall Street Slumps at Open as Correction Broadens; Dow Down 380 Pts,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets slumped at the open on Tuesday, as the selling that first hit tech stocks on Monday broadened to take in virtually everything else.
Fears that inflation may force the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy earlier than it wants have again exposed the precariousness of valuations for some stocks, especially loss-making startups in the technology space. Those fears have intensified as commodity prices have risen relentlessly over the last few weeks.. 
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 383 points, or 1.1%, at 34,359 points. The S&P 500 was also down 1.1% but the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, which lost nearly 2% on Monday, again underperformed with a loss of 1.2%. However, all three indices pared their losses in the minutes after opening to be down around half a percent by 10 AM ET. 
The selling comes, paradoxically, at the end of an earning season that has more than matched most expectations, even allowing for the fact that the first quarter of 2020 - when the pandemic first erupted – made for some easy year-earlier comparables.  Randy Frederick of  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) noted via Twitter that with 91% of S&P 500 companies having reported, earnings per share were around 47% higher than a year ago, almost double what had been expected two weeks ago.
It also comes against broadening signs of inflationary pressures in the economy, although there is still much disagreement over how serious or sustained such threats could be. Prices for industrial metals and some agricultural commodities continued to gain on Tuesday, soybean futures hitting their highest since 2012. Overnight, China's April producer prices had posted their fastest growth since 2018 at nearly 7%, suggesting that the final price of manufactured goods is likely to rise in due course.
Finally, the U.S. National Federation of Independent Businesses' May survey, released earlier, corroborated what many had suspected after Friday's shock payrolls report: that companies are struggling to find the workers they want, even though 16 million people continue to claim unemployment-related benefits. That suggests that wages may rise further and faster than the Fed has so far assumed. The Labor Department's JOLTS job openings survey for April, also released on Tuesday, showed an all-time high of 8.123 million vacancies, far above the 7.5 million expected. 
Among individual stocks, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock fell below $600 briefly before bouncing to be down only 2%. The carmaker has reportedly shelved its plans to buy land to expand its Shanghai factory, putting a question mark over its medium-term growth trajectory.
Reports also suggested its sales in China fell 27% in April after a high-profile and – apparently – politically approved wave of bad publicity that suggested Tesla is starting to become something of a political football as relations between China and the U.S. remain in the deep freeze.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock also fell 2.3% amid reports that investing guru Cathie Wood had sold Apple stock and other liquid names such as Roche ADRs (OTC:RHHBY) out of her suite of investment portfolios ahead of likely redemptions. Wood's ARK Innovation ETF has been a popular vehicle for those seeking long-duration exposure to technologies that boast a bright future but are still unprofitable today. Poor liquidity in some of ARK's smaller holdings is widely seen as making forced sales deeply unattractive."

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus is asking key suppliers to get ready for a further 18% increase in A320-family jet output by the end of 2022, on top of existing targets for this year, as airlines eye a partial return to normal travel, industry sources said.
The tentative new planning goal would lift output of the workhorse domestic and medium-haul jet, which competes with Boeing's (N:BA) 737 MAX, to 53 a month, they told Reuters.
The number being floated for the end of next year remains informal and Airbus has only committed so far to raising output in two steps to 45 a month by the end of 2021, from 40 now. 
But it is the first concrete indication of the shape of recovery that the world's largest planemaker hopes to achieve for benchmark single-aisle jets beyond the end of this year, as it tries to replenish coffers emptied by the pandemic.
""We do not comment on speculation regarding the longer-term trajectory,"" an Airbus spokesman said.
""We see the market recovering to pre-COVID levels in the 2023-2025 timeframe, with single-aisle recovering first,"" he said, adding, ""uncertainties remain"".
Airbus, which had been enjoying record jet demand before the virus triggered widespread travel bans, cut output of its best-selling model by a third to 40 a month one year ago.
In January, it announced plans partially to restore output to 43 a month in the third quarter and 45 a month in the fourth.
Chief executive Guillaume Faury said last month Airbus aimed for a ""steep ramp-up"" in 2022 and 2023, without elaborating.
Airbus has yet to set even its 2021 targets in stone with firm contracts to all suppliers, suggesting part of the immediate increase will be addressed by using up inventory.
Suppliers say they need anything between 3 months and 18 months to get ready for changes in A320 production.
SHIFT IN DIRECTION
But Airbus' preliminary attempt to put numbers on end-2022 production are bolder than some analysts predicted.
""A rate increase of this scale would only be implemented if Airbus was very confident in its customers’ ability and willingness to take the planes, and that appears to be the case,"" Vertical Research Partners analyst Rob Stallard wrote.
""The focus now shifts to the aerospace industry's ability to abruptly shift direction from shrinking to growing, and to actually deliver to this higher rate.""
Several suppliers and leasing industry executives have warned, however, of bumps ahead in restoring pre-pandemic production as smaller parts makers face cash shortages. 
Airbus must also address industrial snags that held up dozens of deliveries even before COVID-19, they say.
Rating agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO) on Tuesday upped its outlook for global airlines to positive from negative, predicting improved demand over the next 12-18 months despite a growing health emergency in India and travel bans elsewhere.

Analysts say domestic travel in the United States and China is leading the recovery in medium-haul travel, with Europe's cross-border sector also gradually reopening. 
Output of long-haul, wide-bodied jets remains depressed by a business travel slump and is not expected to recover soon.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Financial Conduct Authority said on Tuesday it was formally investigating the UK operations of collapsed supply chain finance company Greensill as part of global probes.
""We are also cooperating with counterparts in other UK enforcement and regulatory agencies, as well as authorities in a number of overseas jurisdictions,"" FCA CEO Nikhil Rathi said in a letter to parliament's Treasury Select Committee.
Greensill Capital lent money to firms by buying their invoices at a discount, but it collapsed in March 2021 after insurers pulled their cover. Among the investors burnt in the widespread fallout included clients of Swiss banking giant  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), steel magnate Sanjeev Gupta's GFG Alliance and some 26 German towns.
Lawmakers have opened an inquiry into lessons from Greensill's implosion and later on Tuesday will meet with the company's founder Lex Greensill in a public hearing. Rathi will appear before the committee on Wednesday.
The FCA is investigating matters relating to Greensill Capital UK, Greensill Capital Securities and the oversight of the latter by its principal, Mirabella Advisers LLP, Rathi said.
""We are also cooperating with counterparts in other UK enforcement and regulatory agencies, as well as authorities in a number of overseas jurisdictions,"" Rathi said.
The FCA said it was only responsible for supervising how Greensill Capital UK complied with anti-money laundering (AML)safeguards.
""The wider activities that GCUK undertook were not regulated by the FCA....and the origination of a supply-chain finance instrument is not a regulated activity,"" Rathi said.
To help with the ""smooth functioning"" of the administration of Greensill, the FCA has decided that for now it won't cancel the firm's registration for AML compliance.
""We agree with the Bank of England’s assessment that the Greensill entities were not systemically important for the purposes of UK financial stability,"" Rathi said.
""GCUK was not regulated by the FCA to conduct regulated activities and, in line with the Bank’s assessment of Greensill, no specific analysis was done for reasons other than direct supervision.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Trillions of dollars stashed by U.S. and European companies during the coronavirus pandemic are starting to flow to shareholders, largely via buybacks, after a 2020 drought.
Buyback announcements came thick and fast with first-quarter results, with multi-billion dollar programmes from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stealing the limelight.
Analysts note a buyback rebound in Europe too, ranging from Maersk and Unilever (NYSE:UL) to  Carrefour  (PA:CARR), which is planning its first in a decade.
Some $360 billion in buybacks were announced in the first four months of 2021, versus $190 billion in the same year-ago period, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said. 
U.S. buybacks accounted for $300 billion, Panigirtzoglou said, up from $130 billion a year ago. 
""We are seeing buyback activity almost doubling relative to 2020. Annualising that, we get a full-year figure of $900 million for the United States which is what we saw in 2019.""
The announcements could prove a key source of support for markets, by decreasing the number of a shares outstanding, buybacks boost earnings per share and drive down the price-to-earnings ratio, a valuation measure. 
The S&P 500 buyback index is up 22% year-to-date, trumping the main benchmark's 12% gain. (Graphic: Buyback index outperforms, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/azgpogklopd/Pasted%20image%201620722859254.png) 
Analysts attribute the buyback rebound to corporate cashpiles that stem from last year's record borrowing and cuts to shareholder rewards. Cumulative holdings of cash and cash equivalents rose by roughly $3 trillion at S&P 500 and STOXX 600 companies, compared to 2019, Refinitiv data shows. (Graphic: As cash levels rise, so do share buybacks, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzz/gjnvwnxrnpw/Pasted%20image%201620722820974.png) 
Some banks say European firms, known to favour dividends for returning cash to investors, may also shift to buybacks which are widely credited for driving U.S. equity outperformance.
""A step change in buyback activity would likely encourage U.S. and global investors to re-engage with Europe on the grounds of greater corporate focus on perceived shareholder-friendly activity,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s Ross MacDonald wrote.
Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) analysts predict European share buybacks at 150 billion euros ($182 billion) in 2022 and 190 billion euros the year after. In 2019, buybacks totalled roughly $100 billion.
JPMorgan's Panigirtzoglou does not, however, expect buybacks to breach the 2018 global record of $1.2 trillion, unless the coming months bring a market correction. Selloffs in 2015 and 2018 prompted companies to snap up newly cheap shares, he noted.

Buybacks generally recover quicker than dividends after a crisis. But while Refinitiv I/B/E/S data shows U.S. dividends fully recovering over the coming year, European payouts are expected at $276 billion, still $40 billion off pre-COVID peaks.

Investing.com – Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) was down 7% in Tuesday’s premarket following reports that the electric vehicle maker has halted plans to expand its capacity in China, its largest market outside the U.S.
Along with the stock, ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK), part of Tesla cheerleader Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment group, was down too. Tesla is the ETF’s largest holding with a 10.88% weight.  
A Reuters report said Tesla has halted plans to buy land to expand its Shanghai plant and make it a global export hub. Tesla had earlier considered expanding exports of its China-made entry-level Model 3 to more markets, including the U.S.
Trade tensions between the two countries, showing little sign of abating even under the Biden administration, have put paid to Tesla’s ambitions. Cars imported from China in the U.S. carry a 25% tariff besides other duties.
The company had planned to use the expanded output to ship cars to the U.S. It currently uses the existing capacity in China to export to Europe.
Last few months have not been smooth for Tesla in the world’s largest market for EVs. There was a deadly crash involving a Tesla vehicle in China. The state media has carried articles panning the company over what it claims are faulty brakes.
The company was last month forced to issue an apology following an incident that showed a woman climbing atop a vehicle at the Shanghai Auto Show to protest against what she claimed were malfunctioning brakes in a Tesla she owned.
There was some brighter news the company, however, in that a regulatory investigation into a fatal crash in Texas in April involving a Tesla car suggested that the so-called 'autopilot' software was not engaged at the time of the incident."

The forecast by Nissan (OTC:NSANY), Japan's No.3 carmaker by sales, to break even for the year that began April 1 was lower than a 241.7 billion yen ($2.23 billion) profit predicted by SmartEstimate. 
""If we look at the immediate challenges today, there is a big impact from business risks like semiconductor and commodity price hikes... so at this point in time, we are foreseeing operating profit coming out even,"" Uchida said on an online earnings call, adding that Nissan will give updates on its outlook guidance after the first quarter.
The global auto industry has been grappling with a chip shortage since the end of last year, exacerbated in recent months by a fire at a plant of key automotive chip maker Renesas Electronics Corp in Japan and blackouts in Texas where a number of chipmakers have factories.
That forced Nissan to cut production by 130,000 vehicles in the year just ended, although the company has been able to recover half of that production, Chief Operating Officer Ashwani Gupta said. 
The ongoing shortage of semiconductors, mainly due to the fire at Renesas's plant, will impact Nissan in the first quarter and will also likely affect Nissan's production of 500,000 vehicles this year, Nissan executives said.
The company expects to recover half of the affected production in the second half of the year, they said.
The alliance partner of  Renault  SA (OTC:RNLSY) will slash production at several factories in Japan in May, three sources with direct knowledge of the plan told Reuters last month. It will also adjust production schedules at plants in North America and Mexico.
Nissan has also struggled to make money as it pulls back from the global expansion pursued by ousted chairman Carlos Ghosn that left it with an aging vehicle line-up. It has not made a profit since the year ended March 2019.
The company said its annual operating loss in the year ended March 31 widened to 150.65 billion yen, from a 40 billion yen shortfall in the previous year. 
However, it beat its February forecast of a 205 billion yen loss thanks to cost cutting and a sales recovery led by China and the United States.
Nissan plans to sell 4.4 million vehicles this business year, up from 4.052 million in the previous 12 months but still significantly less than the 4.9 million vehicles it sold two years earlier.
""Despite headwinds, we have reduced our losses more than we forecasted due to accelerated transformation focused on rationalization and quality of sales, while enhancing investments in new products and technologies,"" Gupta said.
Mitsubishi Motors (OTC:MMTOF) Corp, a junior partner in the three-way alliance with Renault (PA:RENA), on Tuesday forecast an operating profit of 30 billion yen for the full year ending March.

Nissan's bigger rival Toyota, which is due to report annual results on Wednesday, said in February that it expects a 54% rise in profit for the year that ended in March. It became the world's biggest car maker last year and has shielded its operations better than its peers from the chip shortage.

Investing.com – The FAANG pack was down 1%-2% in Tuesday’s premarket as traders grappled with multiple factors pulling the stocks lower, ranging from fears over high valuations to monetary tightening to regulatory action to tame Big Tech.  
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was leading the other four, down just short of 2%. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) was down 1.5% while Amazon.(NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) were all lower by 1.3%-1.4%.
Most of the tech shares have been trading close to the year’s highs, propelled by record earnings on the back of pandemic-led consumption of digital services. Unprecedented liquidity sloshing around as a result of fiscal and monetary stimulus has fueled the rally, as has record amounts of margin debt.
With earnings out of the way and the U.K. and Canadian central banks now trimming their bond buying, fears are the Fed could also begin to do the same sooner even though it hasn’t so far indicated any such move. Unemployment remains high too, a number the Fed is most focused on and one that it has said that will hold it back from a premature tightening.
The Fed has on more than one occasion said it is comfortable with an inflation higher than 2% but some market makers choose to forget that on a given day.
Many Big Tech companies, particularly Facebook and Alphabet, and Apple also in Europe, are under increasing scrutiny over alleged anti-competitive practices and sharing of users’ data with advertisers and third-party apps.
On Monday, Citi (NYSE:C) downgraded Facebook and Alphabet to 'neutral' from 'buy' due to what the analyst saw as “a more challenging environment for companies dependent on internet ad growth”.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Hedge fund Honest Capital said on Tuesday that it opposes a $2.8 billion deal that At Home Group (NYSE:HOME) Inc signed last week to sell itself to private equity firm Hellman & Friedman, even as the U.S. home goods retailer searches for a higher bid.
Honest Capital wrote to the company's board of directors to argue the $36-per-share all-cash deal was too low a valuation for At Home, given that it has plans to more than double its number of stores to 600 and consumers have more cash to spruce up their decor. Home decorating trends are expected to be fueled by low mortgage rates, continued housing demand and a trend for ongoing work from home after the pandemic.
""The proposed acquisition price of At Home is materially inadequate,"" Shawn Badlani, Honest Capital's managing partner wrote in the letter reviewed by Reuters. He did not disclose how much of At Home Honest Capital owns. 
A representative for the company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Hellman & Friedman also did not immediately respond for comment.
At Home has negotiated a 40-day ""go shop"" period with Hellman & Friedman that allows it to solicit bids from other potential buyers. Its stock price jumped 20% to close at $37.69 after the deal announcement on Thursday, suggesting some shareholders expected a better deal. The shares ended trading at $36.30 on Monday, still above the deal price. 
Badlani, who had been a partner at activist investor Mick McGuire's Marcato Capital Management for nearly a decade, founded Honest Capital in 2020. Since its launch, Honest Capital has returned a net 109.6% largely by betting on smaller, less-recognized stocks.
In the letter, Badlani argued that At Home's management is on track to deliver strong returns and that the company could be worth as much as $10 billion, based on expansion plans and revenue estimates.
He also pointed to the fact that the company's management could earn big compensation packages in case of a change of control, questioning executives' alignment with shareholders' best interests.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening sharply lower Tuesday, with investors continuing to clobber the heavily-weighted tech sector on rising inflation worries.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 165 points, or 0.5%, S&P 500 Futures traded 32 points, or 0.8%, lower, and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 175 points, or 1.3%.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed sharply lower Monday, down 2.6% at the session’s low, as investors deserted the mega cap high growth stocks, which were behind much of the index’s gains over the last year.
This selloff is expected to continue Tuesday on fears that the pace of inflation will eventually lead the Federal Reserve to tighten its ultra easy monetary policy before its current guidance.
The energy sector will also be in focus as the shutdown of the nation’s biggest fuel pipeline by hackers entered its fifth day, raising concerns about price spikes heading into the summer driving season.
Colonial Pipeline said Monday it expects to ""substantially"" restore operational service by the end of the week, but its website was down on Tuesday as it continues to deal with the cyberattack.
Gasoline futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange dropped 0.2% to $2.1300 a gallon Tuesday, but reports already point to a shortage of supply in the southeastern United States, a region that relies heavily on the Colonial system.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% lower at $64.48 a barrel, and the Brent contract fell 0.6% to $67.90.
Later in the session, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will publish its monthly oil market report, while the industry body American Petroleum Institute will report its weekly inventory levels of US crude oil, petrol and distillate stocks.
In the corporate sector, the likes of Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK),  Hanesbrands  (NYSE:HBI) and Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) will deliver earnings results on Tuesday.
Other companies in the spotlight, aside from the major tech stocks, include Simon Property (NYSE:SPG), which lowered its full-year profit per share forecast on Monday, and Callaway Golf (NYSE:ELY), which said demand for its products has never been higher.
The major economic data release will be the JOLTs job opening number, at 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT), particularly after Friday’s soft April nonfarm payrolls release. This is expected to show 7.5 million openings, closing in on the record high seen in 2019.
There are also a number of speeches from Federal Reserve officials scheduled Tuesday, starting with New York Fed President John Williams (NYSE:WMB), before Lael Brainard, Raphael Bostic, Mary Daly and Patrick Harker chip in.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,840.55/oz, just off a three-month high, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% higher at 1.2160.

789,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 11, 2021 06:36AM ET</span>","Tesla Falls as China Sales Dip, Musk Polls Followers on Dogecoin","(Bloomberg) -- Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. shares slumped in early trading as fresh signs of trouble emerged for its China business while Elon Musk polled Twitter followers on whether the carmaker should accept Dogecoin.
China’s Passenger Car Association said Tuesday that Tesla sold 25,845 locally made vehicles in April, a 27% drop from March. Reuters reported separately that the Model 3 maker decided against acquiring more land next to its Shanghai plant, as U.S.-China trade tensions undercut plans to turn the site into an export hub.
While Musk has been playing damage control during what has been a turbulent few months in China, he’s also been preoccupied with Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency started years ago as a joke that has gained value in part thanks to the billionaire’s attention. The token spiked to about 54 cents from 46 cents after Musk asked his almost 54 million followers whether Tesla should accept it as the company has with Bitcoin.
Shares of Tesla -- which recently warned investors the digital assets it’s acquiring could be subject to volatile prices and risk of losses -- slumped as much as 4.4% before the start of regular trading.
China Troubles
Tesla’s issues in China started in March when its EVs were prohibited from some military complexes and housing compounds because of concerns about sensitive data being collected by cameras and sensors in its vehicles. Shortly after the ban became public, Musk said during a virtual appearance at a conference in China that the automaker would never use technology in its vehicles for spying and would be closed down if it did.
In April, a highly public protest by a customer during the Shanghai auto show went viral, prompting deeper investigation by a local market regulator and heated criticism of Tesla’s customer service. The company initially played down the incident but quickly struck a more conciliatory tone after criticism mounted.
Reuters said that because 25% tariffs put on electric vehicles under former President Donald Trump are still in place, Tesla now intends to limit China’s portion of its global production, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter. The company had earlier considered expanding China-made Model 3 exports to more markets including the U.S., the news organization said.
Musk, who’s been a vocal supporter of Dogecoin, drew more than 750,000 respondents within 30 minutes to his Twitter poll on whether Tesla should start taking the Shiba Inu-themed token.
The fourth-largest cryptocurrency has been volatile since the CEO appeared on “Saturday Night Live” and called it “a hustle” during one segment. Its market capitalization has fallen from as high as $95 billion to about $67 billion.

LONDON (Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google has launched international money transfer partnerships with remittances firms Wise and  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) Co for users of its U.S. payments app, the companies said on Tuesday.
Google Pay users in the United States can now transfer money to app customers in India and Singapore, with plans to expand to the 80 countries available via Wise, and 200 via Western Union by the end of the year. 
Google's foray in the $470 billion remittance market, marks a further step by the technology company to expand its financial services offering, ramping up competition in the digital payments sector. 
London-based Wise was launched in 2011 with the aim of making international money transfers cheaper and easier, while Western Union remains a market leader in remittances, with a sprawling global network of physical locations.
Their partnership with Google Pay, which has 150 million users in 40 countries, comes as the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a boom in online payments, but an estimated drop in overall remittances flows. The money migrant workers sent home is projected to have declined 14% from 2019 due to worsening economic conditions and employment levels in migrant-hosting countries, according to the latest estimates from the World Bank. 
""Even with COVID a lot of people have relocated around the world and we wanted to focus on how we can help facilitate these payments,"" said Josh  Woodward  (NASDAQ:WWD), director of product management at Google. ""Our goal for this year is to work with Wise and Western Union to roll this out for the countries they support."" 
The Silicon Valley technology company redesigned its U.S. payments app in November, introducing paid promotions to the service and opening a waitlist for bank accounts being launched next with several lenders.

The new remittances functionality escalates competition among technology companies and traditional finance firms over consumers' money and data, with providers looking to become a one-stop shop for their users' financial needs.
Ant Group, Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL) also offer mobile wallets aiming to be hubs for services ranging from crossborder payments to credit.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - With Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co theme park operations limited due to the coronavirus pandemic, investors watching the company report earnings on Thursday are expected to zero in on its fast growth into streaming TV. 
During the January to March quarter, the Disney+ streaming service was aided by box office heavyweight Marvel Studios. The producer of blockbuster superhero films released its first TV series, ""WandaVision,"" in January followed by ""The Falcon and the Winter Soldier"" in late March.
The animated Disney movie ""Raya and the Last Dragon"" was offered to Disney+ customers in March for $30, at the same time it was shown in theaters, which are struggling to rebound from the global health crisis.
Chief Executive Bob Chapek said in early March that Disney+ had reached 100 million subscribers worldwide. That number likely swelled to 110 million by the end of March, MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson said.
The rapid build-up has made Disney+ the most formidable challenger to Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), which pioneered movie and TV streaming in 2007, and reached 207.6 million customers as of March. 
Competitors including AT&T Inc (NYSE:T)'s HBO Max, ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) Inc's Paramount+ and Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA)'s Peacock also have picked up customers during the pandemic.
A big question is whether streaming growth can be sustained as movie theaters reopen and people who have been vaccinated emerge from their homes to enjoy summertime activities outside. 
Netflix reported in April dramatically slowing new sign-ups this year, after a boost during the pandemic.
Disney's streaming media division, known as direct-to-consumer, is losing money as it pays for new programming, marketing and rollout around the world. Analysts expect a $673 million quarterly loss for the unit, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Overall, analysts project the Mouse House to report earnings-per-share of 28 cents for the quarter and revenue of $15.9 billion. 

Outside of streaming, Disney's parks remain under pressure from extended pandemic-induced shutdowns and safety measures. The California and Paris Disneylands were closed during the quarter, and parks that were open capped attendance to allow for social distancing. Disney cruise ships remain idle.
Edward Jones analyst Dave Heger, who rates Disney a ""buy,"" said he expects those operations will rebound as the pandemic eases. ""We feel that these businesses will recover due to strong creative franchises and a loyal customer base,"" Heger said in a research note.

The company, which recently raised $10 billion, has lost $30 billion in market value over two days amid a broader drop in Chinese tech shares as investors remain jittery over a regulatory clampdown that last month ensnared Meituan. 
The poem, posted on May 6 by Chairman and CEO Wang Xing on a small social media site that he founded, criticises the emperor of the Qin dynasty, who burnt books to suppress intellectual dissidents, only for it to be overthrown by illiterates. While many on Chinese social media interpreted the posting as an allusion to the anti-monopoly campaign backed by Xi, Wang on Sunday said he was referring to business rivals, saying that ""the most dangerous opponents are often unexpected ones"".
The original posting has been removed.
Meituan declined further comment.
Adding to investor concerns, the Shanghai Consumer Council said late on Monday that it had summoned Meituan and e-commerce firm  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD), accusing them of violating consumer rights. On Tuesday, Meituan shares tumbled 5.3% to a seven-month low. ""I think mainland investors paid more attention to the poem, but international investors are more worried about the rising cost of employing riders of the company,"" said Fred Wong, chief investment officer at Hong Kong-based eFusion Capital.

He was referring to social media criticism of Meituan and other industry players' treatment of delivery riders, most of whom are not covered by basic social and medical insurance.
The Hang Seng Tech Index, which includes Chinese tech giants  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), Tencent and JD (NASDAQ:JD).com, dropped as much as 4.5% on Tuesday to a six-month low.

Japan's biggest drugmaker is handling the imports, and discussions are underway with the government to double shipments to 100 million, Takeda CEO Christophe Weber said. 
""Japan is behind. So our goal now is to really support an acceleration of the vaccination,"" Weber said in a conference call after the company released full-year earnings results. 
The company had reported positive interim results from a domestic trial of the Moderna shot, and Weber said he expected approval to come ""very soon"". 
The COVID-19 pandemic has defined much of Takeda's activities in the past 12 months. This time last year, the company was promoting a plasma treatment for the disease, which ultimately failed in clinical trials.
Takeda is also handling domestic approval and production of 250 million doses of  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) Inc's vaccine candidate. The Japanese government wants to use 150 million, with the remainder being dispatched elsewhere, Weber said. 
For the year ended on March 31, Takeda reported a five-fold increase in operating profit versus the previous year, driven by sales of its Entyvio colitis treatment and other mainstay drugs.
Operating profit was 509 billion yen ($4.68 billion), compared with earlier guidance of 434 billion yen and a consensus estimate of 567 billion yen from a Refinitiv poll of 14 analysts. 
Takeda also exceeded its goal for asset sales this year to reduce debt following a $59 billion purchase of  Shire  Plc (LON:SHP) in 2019. It has off-loaded about $12.9 billion in assets so far, mostly in over-the-counter and consumer goods, as part of a renewed focus on prescription drugs. 
Among the biggest divestitures was Takeda's 227.7 billion yen sale of its Japanese consumer healthcare company to funds controlled by the Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc. 

Takeda's shares slipped 0.2% ahead of the results versus a 3.1% slide in the market overall.

PARIS (Reuters) - A French court on Monday threw out a lawsuit by a French-Vietnamese woman against more than a dozen multinationals that produced and sold a toxic herbicide dubbed ""Agent Orange"", used by U.S. troops during the war in Vietnam.
Filed in 2014, the case has pitched Tran To Nga, a 79-year-old who claims she was a victim of Agent Orange, against 14 chemical firms, including U.S. companies Dow Chemical and  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON), now owned by Germany's Bayer (OTC:BAYRY).
Tran To Nga told Reuters the case had been thrown out but that she would appeal.
Tran, who worked as a journalist and activist in Vietnam in her 20s, has said she was suffering from effects including type 2 diabetes and a rare insulin allergy. 
U.S. warplanes dropped about 18 million gallons (68 million litres) of Agent Orange - so-called because it was stored in drums with orange bands - between the early 1960s and early 1970s to defoliate jungles and destroy Viet Cong crops.
MULTINATIONALS SAY NOT RESPONSIBLE
The multinationals had argued they could not be held responsible for use the U.S. military made of their product.
The court ruled it did not have jurisdiction to judge a case involving the U.S. government's wartime actions, Agence France Presse reported. Reuters could not immediately see the ruling.
One of Tran's lawyers, William Bourdon, said in a statement on Twitter that the court was applying an obsolete definition of the immunity of jurisdiction principle which contradicted modern principles of international and national law.
He said it was ""astounding"" that the court had backed the companies' contention that they were acting on orders when responding to U.S. government tenders for contracts.
In a statement, Bayer said it welcomed the court's decision while saying it had ""great sympathy for Ms. Tran To Nga and all those who suffered during the Vietnam war"".
But it said it had been ""well-established by courts for many years that wartime contractors like the nine former manufacturers, operating at the behest of the U.S. government, are not responsible for the alleged damage claims associated with the government's use of such product during wartime"".

So far, only military veterans from the United States and other countries involved in the war have won compensation over Agent Orange. In 2008, a U.S. federal appeals court upheld the dismissal of a civil lawsuit against major U.S. chemical companies brought by Vietnamese plaintiffs.
The United States has maintained there is no scientifically proven link between the wartime spraying and the claims of dioxin poisoning of many Vietnamese.

(Reuters) -Novavax Inc on Monday again delayed its timeline for ramping up COVID-19 vaccine production and said it does not expect to seek regulatory authorization for the shot in the United States, Britain and Europe until the third quarter of 2021, sending its shares tumbling. 
The Maryland-based company has repeatedly pushed back production forecasts and has struggled to access raw materials and equipment needed to make its vaccine.  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) shares fell more than 9% in extended trading after closing nearly 9% lower on Monday.
The pushback of regulatory filings ""to Q3 (from Q2) and a downward revision to time to full production to Q4 (from Q3), represent delays to prior timelines and difficulty in growing,"" said Kelechi Chikere, an equity analyst at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) in a Monday note. 
Novavax said it does not expect to hit its production target of 150 million shots per month until the fourth quarter of 2021, later than its previous forecast of sometime in the third quarter. It had also previously said it could see U.S. regulatory authorization as soon as May.
But on a call to discuss first-quarter results, Chief Executive Stanley Erck said major manufacturing hurdles have been cleared and that all of its facilities can now produce COVID-19 vaccine at commercial scale. 
""We know that we're delayed from where we thought we'd be at this point,"" Erck said. ""Now we're giving guidance that nearly all of the major challenges have been overcome and we can clearly see the light at the end of the tunnel.""
He said Novavax currently has about 30 million to 40 million doses on the shelves and its factories are making more each week.
While vaccine demand is declining in the United States, the Novavax shot is expected to play an important role in global inoculation efforts. Many countries such as India and much of South America still have low vaccination rates and are desperate for supplies.
""Unmet demand outside of the United States has resulted in continued demand for Novavax's vaccine,"" said Chief Commercial Officer John Trizzino. 
The company has promised to supply 200 million shots to countries around the globe, in addition to the 1.1 billion doses it has committed to the COVAX international vaccine sharing program, Trizzino said.
Novavax's shot has yet to be authorized in any country, but the company reported late-stage data from a UK trial that showed it to be highly effective against the original version of the coronavirus and a newer, more contagious variant first found in Britain. (https://refini.tv/3bfL38D)
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) started a rolling review of the shot in February.
A source familiar with the regulator's work told Reuters this month the company still needs to submit data about their large-scale production of the jab for commercial use, which must also be approved before the vaccine can be used.
""In June or July, they should send us the new data on the production of commercial batches,"" the official said, adding that no date was yet set for a decision on possible approval.
The EMA did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

Data from its pivotal U.S. and Mexico trial is expected to be released in the current quarter. 
Novavax reported a net loss for the first quarter of $223 million. It had $447 million in revenue, mostly payments from the U.S. government for its COVID-19 vaccine research, and spent $593 million on research and development.

798,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2021 04:36AM ET</span>",Exclusive-Foxconn's iPhone output in India down amid COVID surge-sources,"TAIPEI (Reuters) -Production of the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 12 at a Foxconn factory in India has slumped by more than 50% because workers infected with COVID-19 have had to leave their posts, two sources told Reuters. 
The Foxconn facility in the southern state of Tamil Nadu produces iPhones specifically for India, the world's No.2 smartphone market. 
Tamil Nadu is one of the worst hit states in the second coronavirus wave engulfing India. Officials imposed a full lockdown in the state from Monday, closing public transport and shuttering shops, to try slow surging infections. 
More than 100 Foxconn employees in the state have tested positive for COVID-19 and the company has enforced a no-entry ban at its factory in the capital of Chennai until late May, one of the sources said.
""Employees are only allowed to leave but not to enter the facility since yesterday,"" the person said. ""Only a small part of output is being kept.""
More than 50% of the plant's capacity had been cut, both sources said, declining to be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media. 
They did not specify the plant's capacity and it was unclear how many workers were at the facility, which provides dormitory accommodation for employees. 
Taipei-based Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker and a major supplier to Apple, said a small number of employees at one of its facilities in India tested positive for COVID-19 and the company was providing them with support, including medical assistance.
""Foxconn places the health and safety of our employees as our highest priority and that is why we have been working closely with local government and public health authorities in India to address the challenges that we and all companies are facing in dealing with the COVID-19 crisis,"" it said in a statement to Reuters. 
Foxconn declined to comment on factory output or specific staffing levels. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Foxconn's shares fell as much as 6.2% after the Reuters report. The stock closed down 5.31%, outpacing a 3.8% fall in the broader market on concerns about rising COVID-19 cases in Taiwan. 
India has benefited from Apple's move to shift some areas of production from China to other markets as it navigates a trade war between Washington and Beijing, with Apple announcing in March it had started the assembly of the iPhone 12 in India. 
While Apple's share of the budget phone-dominated India market is small, CEO Tim Cook said in January that India business doubled in the December quarter compared to the previous year, helped by an online store launch. 
Foxconn similarly said strong smartphone sales contributed to a stronger-than-expected performance in the fourth quarter amid the work-from-home trend.
Market research firm Canalys said that growth in India extended through the first quarter, with Apple shipping more than a million iPhones. Demand for the iPhone 12 was supported by local assembly and attractive finance offers, Canalys said.
COVID-19 CRISIS
However, the outlook has been dimmed by the coronavirus crisis engulfing India, where COVID-19 cases and deaths have surged at a record pace in recent weeks. The country has recorded around 22.66 million infections and more than 246,000 deaths, with experts saying the true figures could be far higher.
Foxconn is not the only producer affected. Nokia (NYSE:NOK) and Chinese smartphone maker OPPO last year suspended production at factories in India after workers tested positive for COVID-19.

Taipei-based tech research firm TrendForce on Monday trimmed its global smartphone production growth forecast to 8.5% from 9.4%, citing the coronavirus impact in India on major vendors including Samsung (KS:005930) and Apple. 
""Smartphone brands are therefore expected to closely monitor their inventories of whole devices and adjust their subsequent production plans accordingly,"" TrendForce said in a report, adding it could revise the forecast lower still if the outbreak continues to hit local production and sales in the second quarter.

But exports of its China-made electric cars were robust, an encouraging sign there’s increasing demand in Europe.
Tesla sold 25,845 locally made vehicles in April, down from 35,478 units in March, data from China’s Passenger Car Association released Tuesday show. Some 14,174 EVs were exported from the company’s Shanghai gigafactory, due in part to demand from the European market, PCA said. The car body didn’t release Tesla China export data for March or February, and the company only started shipping abroad late last year.

Tesla has faced a rocky few months in China, starting in March when its EVs were banned from some Chinese military complexes and housing compounds because of concerns about sensitive data being collected by cameras and sensors built into the vehicles.
Shortly after the military ban became public, Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk used a virtual appearance at a Chinese conference to stress that the automaker would never use a vehicle’s technology for spying, and would be closed down if it did.
China is now considering new regulations that would require data collected by intelligent cars to be stored in the country, a move triggered by the Tesla camera concerns.
In April, there was another upset after a highly public protest at the Shanghai Auto Show went viral. A customer who claimed the brakes failed in her Tesla, almost killing her father who was driving at the time, jumped on top of a display car, prompting a deeper investigation by a local market regulator and heated criticism of Tesla’s customer service.
PCA Secretary General Cui Dongshu on Tuesday said Tesla was an “excellent company” with a globally standardized product.
“If there is problem, it would be universal instead of just being in one country,” he said. “So far, problems with Tesla cars can still be seen as an incident instead of any serious defect with its products.”
Retail sales of passenger cars more generally in China rose 12.4% year-on-year in April to 1.64 million units. However sales were down 8.6% versus March. New-energy vehicle sales growth was much stronger, jumping 913% year-on-year to 163,000 units.

800,By Investing.com,"<span>May 11, 2021 04:08AM ET</span>",European Stocks Lower; Inflation Worries Pressure Tech Sector,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets traded sharply lower Tuesday, following the previous session’s tech-led selloff on Wall Street as investors increasingly turned their attention onto inflation data.
At 4:10 AM ET (0910 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.9% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 1.8%, and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 2.1%.
European tech shares tumbled to their lowest level since late March, while miners handed back some of their strong gains in the previous session.
Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) stock fell over 5% after the German conglomerate posted a second-quarter net loss but raised its full-year outlook for the second time in three months, boosted by a global economic recovery that drove demand for steel, car parts and materials.
E.ON (DE:EONGn) stock fell 1.1% despite Europe's largest energy networks operator posting a 14% rise in first-quarter operating earnings and confirming its outlook and dividend policy.
NatWest (LON:NWG) stock dropped 3.5% after the British government completed the sale of 1.1 billion pounds ($1.55 billion) in shares of the bank, lowering its stake to below 55% in the lender it bailed out over a decade ago.
This followed the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slumping 2.6% on Wall Street on Monday, with investors turning their backs on longer-duration growth stocks amid ongoing inflation pressures.
China's factory gate prices added to these concerns earlier Tuesday, as they rose at the fastest rate in three and a half years in April.
German inflation could climb above 3% as the economy recovers from the pandemic, according to ECB Executive Board member Isabel Schnabel in an interview Tuesday, but it won’t last and the European Central Bank will look beyond such volatility.
Italian industrial production data didn’t help the tone in Europe, with the March monthly figure falling 0.1%, compared with the expected gain on 0.4%. Germany’s ZEW survey of economic sentiment for May is due later in the session, and is expected to show an improvement in confidence in the Eurozone’s most important economy.
Oil prices slipped Tuesday, with the markets seemingly expecting only minor localized disruption to U.S. supplies from Friday’s cyber attack on a major pipeline operator.
Colonial Pipeline, the largest fuel pipeline in the United States, said Monday it expects to ""substantially"" restore operational service by the end of the week. Already segments of its Texas-to-New Jersey line are being brought back online, easing some of the most immediate concerns that the major population centers on the U.S. East Coast could be affected.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.1% lower at $64.19 a barrel, the Brent contract fell 1.1% to $67.58, while Gasoline futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange dropped 0.9% to $2.1140 a gallon.
Later in the session, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will publish its monthly oil market report, which will include April production numbers for the group, along with their latest outlook on the market. 
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,836.45/oz, just off a three-month high, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.2147.

The company stuck to its 2021 outlook, still expecting adjusted core profit (EBITDA) of 7.2 billion to 7.5 billion euros ($8.7-9.1 billion) and adjusted operating profit (EBIT) of 3.8 billion to 4 billion euros.
""We're off to a successful start in the new year. All our businesses delivered a strong operational performance in the first quarter,"" Chief Financial Officer Marc Spieker said. ""This gives us a lot of confidence for the remainder of the year.""
First-quarter adjusted EBIT at the group's closely-watched British retail, which includes the former npower unit it bought as part of the takeover of Innogy, came in at 84 million euros, compared with a 2 million loss in the same period last year.
E.ON said all npower customers had been migrated to its new digital customer platform, which apart from thousands of job cuts forms a key part of the division's restructuring.

On a group level, first-quarter adjusted EBIT rose 14% on the year to 1.7 billion euros, while adjusted net income was up 19% at 809 million euros.

802,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2021 03:50AM ET</span>",Britain lowers NatWest stake with $1.5 billion share sale,"LONDON (Reuters) -The British government has completed the sale of 1.1 billion pounds ($1.55 billion) in shares of NatWest, lowering its stake to below 55% in the lender it bailed out over a decade ago.
UK Government Investments (UKGI), the state-owned company that controls the shares, said the they were priced at 190 pence, 4% below Monday's closing price of 197 pence. 
NatWest has been majority state-owned following a 45 billion-pound bailout in 2008 during the financial crisis. The sale crystallises a further hefty loss of around 1.8 billion for taxpayers, with shares well below the 502 pence bailout level. 
The move edges the bank closer to private ownership, reducing the government's holding from 60% previously.
The government's last sale of stock to outside investors was in 2018, although NatWest directly bought back 1.1 billion pound of shares last month to reduce the state's holding from 62%. 
NatWest shares fell around 4% in early trading to around the latest sale price. They are also below the 2018 sale price of 271 pence a share.
The government said it continued to keep all options and timings under review for future sales.
NatWest's stock price has more than doubled since hitting a low of 90.5 pence in September, as optimism has built about prospects for Britain's economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
NatWest, formerly Royal Bank of Scotland (NYSE:RBS_old_old), has long argued it is unrealistic to expect a profit on the bank's rescue, which was needed to stabilise Britain's financial system.
The bookrunners on the sale were  Barclays  (LON:BARC),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS). Rothschild & Co is acting as adviser to UKGI.

Two months ago, Britain's financial regulator said it had started a criminal action against NatWest over allegations it failed to detect suspicious activity by a customer depositing nearly 400 million pounds over five years, mostly in cash.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen weakening at the open Tuesday, following the previous session’s tech-led selloff on Wall Street on increased inflation worries.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.4% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 1.1% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 1.1%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.1%, or 35 points, lower Monday, snapping a five-day win streak. The losses were more pronounced in the other indices, with the S&P 500 closing 1% lower and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite particularly hard hit, slumping 2.6%. 
Investors have turned their backs on longer-duration growth stocks as ongoing inflation pressures, with commodity prices surging, increased worries that the Federal Reserve will be forced to tighten its ultra-easy monetary policies earlier than it is currently guiding for.
Adding to the theme, China's factory gate prices rose at the fastest rate in three and a half years in April, data showed earlier Tuesday, with PPI rising 6.8% from a year earlier, ahead of a 4.4% rise in March, as the world's second-largest economy gathered momentum after strong growth in the first quarter.
These inflation concerns will mean the U.S. CPI report will be at the forefront of investors’ attention when it’s released on Wednesday.
Ahead of that, and back in Europe, the Germany’s ZEW survey of economic sentiment for May will be the main data release, and is expected to show an improvement in confidence in the Eurozone’s most important economy.
In corporate news, German conglomerate Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) raised its full-year outlook for the second time in three months, boosted by a global economic recovery that drove demand for steel, car parts and materials.

A surge in demand for electronic devices, coupled with U.S. sanctions against Chinese technology firms, has caused a dearth of the chips, crimping output of items ranging from cars to computers and smartphones.
""The shortage will probably continue for a few years,"" Michael Dell said in an interview published on Tuesday. ""Even if chip factories are built all over the world it takes time."" 
With an annual order volume of $70 billion, the firm is one of the most important customers of many semiconductor makers, but still had to pay a premium to secure supply, Dell added.

In particular, older and cheaper semiconductors are hard to get hold of, he said.
""We are talking, in particular, about components that are in the one-dollar range and are used practically everywhere,"" he said. ""But even newer technologies are not easy to come by.""

The U.S. company made the announcements to coincide with its annual Think Conference on Tuesday as it builds momentum following its $34 billion takeover of open-source software company Red Hat two years ago.
IBM, which last month reported its strongest quarterly sales growth in two years, has been restructuring since Arvind Krishna became chief executive a year ago to focus on cloud computing and AI. Last October, IBM announced its legacy IT infrastructure business would shift into a separate firm.
""This year, we are going to talk about progress - and we have made a lot of progress,"" President Jim Whitehurst told reporters ahead of its Think Conference.
Among product innovations it is rolling out on Tuesday are AI to help companies manage data in the cloud, a system dubbed Watson Orchestrate to help professionals automate tasks such as scheduling meetings and a program to let customers use quantum computers for projects too complex for traditional servers. 
Krishna declined to comment on the estimated revenue from the new offerings but told reporters he still expects overall sales to grow slightly in 2021 and by the mid-single digits percentage-wise ""over the medium term."" 
IBM will also unveil Project CodeNet, a large-scale open-source dataset comprising 14 million code samples, 500 million lines of code and 55 programming languages to enable AI to understand and translate code.

The innovations follow IBM's recent announcement of its own platform for 2 nanometer computer chips that are up to 45% faster and 75% more power-efficient than the 7 nm chips that run most smartphones today.
Whitehurst said the 2 nm chips were expected to enter production with IBM's manufacturing partners within ""a couple of years"".

810,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2021 11:15PM ET</span>",Top U.S. fuel pipeline remains days from reopening after cyberattack,"By Stephanie Kelly and Devika Krishna Kumar
NEW YORK (Reuters) -The biggest U.S. gasoline pipeline will not resume full operations for several more days due to a ransomware cyberattack blamed on a shadowy criminal network called DarkSide.
The attack on the Colonial Pipeline, which carries nearly half the fuel consumed along the U.S. East Coast, is one of the most disruptive digital ransom schemes ever reported. 
While the impact remains to be quantified, the pipeline shutdown will reduce fuel availability in the near term, push up prices and force refiners to cut production because they have no way to ship the gas. 
The privately owned company said on Monday it was working on restarting in phases with ""the goal of substantially restoring operational service by the end of the week.""
The FBI attributed the cyberattack to DarkSide, a group believed to be based in Russia or Eastern Europe. Its ransomware targets computers that do not use keyboards in the languages of former Soviet republics, cyber experts said. 
President Joe Biden said there was no evidence thus far that Russia's government was involved.
'GOAL IS TO MAKE MONEY'
A statement issued in the group's name on Monday said: ""Our goal is to make money, and not creating problems for society."" Its statement did not mention Colonial Pipeline by name.
Ransomware is a type of malware designed to lock computers by encrypting data. The hackers demand payment to let the owner regain access. It is unknown how much money the hackers are seeking, and Colonial has not commented on whether it would pay. 
Anne Neuberger, deputy national security adviser for cybersecurity, told reporters that the Biden administration is not offering advice on whether Colonial should pay the ransom. 
Colonial on Friday shut its 5,500-mile (8,850-km) pipeline network, which moves fuels including gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, to protect its systems. 
The episode laid bare the vulnerabilities of energy infrastructure to hackers. U.S. lawmakers responded with calls for stronger protections for critical energy infrastructure.
A spokesman for United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the attack showed that U.N. member states needed to combat cybercrime to avoid a ""devastating impact on the world that we all live in."" 
Colonial restarted some smaller lines on Sunday between fuel terminals and customer delivery points, releasing fuel stored locally to customers. On Monday, it also began manually operating its 700,000-barrel-per-day multi-product fuel line between Greensboro, North Carolina, and Maryland for a limited time while it has existing inventories.
But its main lines remained shut, and an alternative, smaller conduit operated by  Kinder Morgan  Inc (NYSE:KMI) serving the same region reached capacity. 
The outage hit ahead of the summer vacation season, when gasoline demand and airline travel tend to peak.
PAIN AT THE PUMP? 
Fearing shortages, consumers in the southeastern United States rushed to refuel. Gas stations in Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee were seeing some panic buying, said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy.
The American Automobile Association said the national average gasoline price climbed to $2.96 a gallon and could climb to its highest level since 2014.
In Georgia, trucking company owner Marcus Blash worried because his business cannot store fuel on site to hedge against price surges.
""We pay at the pump,"" he said. ""It hasn't hit us yet, but this is going to hurt big time.""
Florida resident Katina Willey went to several gas stations before she found one that had fuel available. ""There were lines at three of the five stations I tried,"" she said. 

If the disruption stretches on, fuel suppliers could ship by truck and rail instead. The Department of Transportation on Sunday lifted driver restrictions on fuel haulers in 17 states affected by the shutdown. 
U.S. fuel importers are booking tankers to bring gasoline from Europe. U.S. refiners including Motiva Enterprises and  Total  (PA:TOTF) cut output at Gulf Coast plants on Monday because of a lack of transport.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were down Tuesday morning, following a tech-led slide in U.S. counterparts as a surge in commodity prices increased inflation worries.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 1.07% by 10:30 PM ET (2:30 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component fell 1.19%. Inflation data for April released earlier in the day said that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) contracted 0.3% month-on-month but grew 0.9% year-on-year, both just missing expectations. The Producer Price Index (PPI) grew a better-than-expected 6.8% year-on-year.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 2.47%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 slid 2.89% even as data released earlier in the day said that March’s household spending grew at a better-than-expected 7.2% month-on-month and 6.2% year-on-year.
The yearly figure was also the biggest gain since September 2019 and the first growth in four months. However, with a state of emergency in Tokyo and the surrounding areas currently in place, and debate on whether to extend it to other areas reportedly underway, spending is likely to remain under pressure.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was down 1.31%. Investors await the federal budget, which will be handed down later in the day.
South Korea’s KOSPI fell 1.53%.
U.S. shares also closed on a down note over inflation concerns, with the Nasdaq 100 Index tumbling 2.6% and the benchmark S&P 500 Index falling from its recent record high.
On the crude oil front, Colonial Pipeline is targeting re-opening its key U.S. pipeline by the end of the week. Also on investors’ radars are the recent jumps in commodities such as copper and iron ore, with concerns over knock-on price pressures continuing to grow.
This led to a slight lift in Treasury yields, with the benchmark 10-year at 1.60%.
The jumps come ahead of the release of U.S. inflation data, including core CPI, on Wednesday. With investors concerned that inflation could force the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than expected, the data will be closely watched.
Some investors are already bracing for an upcoming period of volatility.
“We’re going to see volatility definitely over the next couple of months” given uncertainty over the path of growth, Citi Private Bank head of capital markets in the Americas Kristen Bitterly told Bloomberg.
“Cash and duration are punitive, so you need to make sure that where you have that yield is non-rates sensitive parts of the market,” she added.
On the central bank side, several Fed officials are due to speak throughout the week, including Governor Lael Brainard later in the day. In the U.K., Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey will speak on Wednesday."
813,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2021 09:55PM ET</span>","U.S. business lobby calls on China to play fair, warns of consumer boycott danger","BEIJING (Reuters) -China should implement its commitments to equal treatment for foreign business and abandon ""implicit"" guidance to replace foreign products with domestic alternatives, the American Chamber of Commerce in China said on Tuesday.
In an annual white paper, the chamber, also known as AmCham, which represents 900 companies, also called on the United States and China to communicate more and cooperate on climate change and public health.
The relationship between the world's two biggest economies deteriorated rapidly over the past few years over issues ranging from trade to China's response to COVID-19.
When ties worsen, U.S. firms see poorer implementation of regulations promising equal treatment for foreign business, affecting investment project approvals and market access, said Greg Gilligan, chairman of AmCham China.
""We feel that local officials are reacting to the levels of tension in the relationship and just taking the safer path which is to offer preference to domestic industry,"" he said, speaking at a news conference on Tuesday. 
American companies were also ""rightfully concerned"" about the possibility of consumer boycotts in China and needed to do scenario planning for it, he said. 
In March Sweden's H&M and other foreign brands met with a furious online backlash and boycotts after they raised concerns about forced labour in China's western Xinjiang region.
Foreign businesses in China have long complained about limited market access, opaque regulatory processes, the favouring of domestic champions and state-owned companies, and weakness in intellectual property protection.
Beijing has repeatedly said it treats foreign and domestic firms equally and welcomes foreign investment. The government is meanwhile also trying to spur domestic innovation and reduce reliance on foreign technology and markets.
Legislation promising equal treatment for foreign and domestic companies is only unevenly implemented, said the paper, which also called for emerging sectors like cloud computing to be opened up to foreign companies.
""The government should abandon the use of implicit, unpublished, or internal guidance to replace U.S. or other foreign-made products/services with domestically made equivalents,"" it said.
U.S. President Joe Biden says competition with China is the greatest foreign policy challenge the United States faces. Democrats and Republicans alike have moved toward a harder line on Beijing.
U.S.-China tensions were seen as a challenge to doing business in China for 78% of companies polled by AmCham, according to a survey released in March.
U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said last week she expected to engage ""in the near term"" with Chinese officials to assess their implementation of the Phase 1 trade deal between the two countries, with the outcome to influence the fate of Washington's punitive tariffs on Beijing.
Tai and other senior Biden administration officials are conducting a top-to-bottom review of U.S.-China trade policy. Trump launched a tariff war between the world's two largest economies in 2018. Washington and Beijing signed the Phase 1 trade deal in January 2020.

The pact, which expires at the end of 2021, called for China to boost purchases of U.S. exports by $200 billion over two years - a target that Beijing is far behind in meeting, partly due to the coronavirus pandemic.
China also pledged to toughen intellectual property protections, and improve agriculture biotechnology and financial services access for U.S. firms.

814,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2021 09:21PM ET</span>",Automated steering 'not available' on Texas road where Tesla crashed -NTSB,"By David Shepardson and Hyunjoo Jin
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. safety officials investigating the cause of a Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model S crash that killed two men in Texas last month said on Monday that testing suggested the vehicle's automated steering system was ""not available"" on the road where the accident occurred.
But the car's cruise-control function could still have been in operation, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said in its preliminary report.
The report drew no conclusions about the cause and circumstances of the fiery April 17 crash in a suburb of Houston. The NTSB and local police are still investigating.
Local police have said they believed the crash occurred with no one in the driver's seat, raising questions about Tesla's driver-assistance systems.
The NTSB said footage from the owner’s home security cameras showed the owner entering the driver’s seat and the passenger entering the front passenger seat.
The accident has raised fresh questions about the safety of Tesla Inc's ""Autopilot"" system. Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said last month Autopilot could not have been engaged in the vehicle involved in the Texas crash.
Tesla shares fell 6.4% to close at $629.04 on Monday.
The NTSB report makes clear that Autopilot is in fact two systems. One is a ""Traffic-Aware Cruise Control"" that controls the vehicle's speed and distance from vehicles up ahead. The second is ""Autosteer"" which governs lateral steering movements. Both must be engaged for Autopilot to be considered in operation.
NTSB said its tests of a similar car at the crash location showed that Traffic-Aware Cruise Control could be engaged but that Autosteer was ""not available on that part of the road.""
Autosteer assists within ""clearly marked lanes"" and is not always available. Tesla says on its website it plans an ""upcoming"" Autosteer release for use on city streets.
Tesla says Traffic-Aware Cruise Control matches a car's speed to that of surrounding traffic, while Autosteer assists in steering.
Tesla and police in Texas did not respond to a request for comment.
The electric car maker said during an April 27 conference call to discuss quarterly results that a study with investigators showed Autosteer ""did not and could not engage on the road condition"" during the Texas crash.
The crash in Spring, Texas, killed the 59-year-old owner, William Varner, an anesthesiologist, and the passenger, aged 69.
The Tesla traveled 550 feet (167.64 m) before departing the road on a curve, driving over the curb, and hitting a drainage culvert, a raised manhole, and a tree, the NTSB said.
It said the crash damaged the front of the car’s high-voltage lithium-ion battery case, where a massive fire started. The fire destroyed the car, including the onboard storage device, and NTSB released a photo of the charred remains of the vehicle.

The NTSB said the car’s restraint control module, which can record data associated with vehicle speed, belt status, acceleration, and airbag deployment, was recovered but sustained fire damage.
In addition to the NTSB, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is also investigating the crash. NHTSA, the federal agency responsible for vehicle safety, has opened 28 investigations into crashes of Tesla vehicles, 24 of which remain active. At least four, including the fatal Texas accident, have occurred since March.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - U.S. television network NBC on Monday dropped its broadcast of the Golden Globes ceremony in 2022 after a Hollywood backlash over the ethics of the group that hands out the annual awards for film and television and its lack of diversity.
Tom Cruise joined a revolt led by streaming platforms and studios, returning the three Golden Globe statuettes he won for his roles in ""Jerry Maguire,"" ""Magnolia"" and ""Born on the Fourth of July,"" Variety and Deadline Hollywood reported.
NBC's decision came even after the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), which hands out the awards, agreed to recruit more Black members and make other changes over the next 18 months. The network had initially welcomed the plan but later said it would wait to see if the reforms worked.
HFPA members have also been accused of making sexist and racist remarks and soliciting favors from celebrities and studios.
""Change of this magnitude takes time and work, and we feel strongly that the HFPA needs time to do it right. As such, NBC will not air the 2022 Golden Globes,"" NBC said in a statement.
""Assuming the organization executes on its plan, we are hopeful we will be in a position to air the show in January 2023,"" NBC added.
After NBC's announcement, the HFPA said implementing ""transformational change"" remained an urgent priority ""regardless of the next air date of the Golden Globes.""
In a statement, the HFPA reiterated its planned reforms and gave a detailed timetable. It said that by August 2021, it would hire a new chief executive, add 20 new members, approve a new code of conduct and provide diversity and sexual harassment training among other steps.
The annual Golden Globes ceremony, attended by A-list stars and industry executives, has become one of the biggest Hollywood awards shows in the run-up to the Oscars. But it has been under close scrutiny following an investigation published in February by the Los Angeles Times that showed the group of 87 journalists had no Black members.
On Saturday, Scarlett Johansson joined critics including Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Studios, WarnerMedia and dozens of Hollywood's top publicity companies, who said they would no longer work with the HFPA unless it made far-reaching changes.
WarnerMedia, which includes cable channel HBO and movie studio Warner Bros, said in letter to the HFPA that it was concerned about ""racially insensitive, sexist and homophobic questions"" at press conferences and events during the Golden Globe nominations and awards process.

""For far too long, demands for perks, special favors and unprofessional requests have been made to our teams and to others across the industry,"" the WarnerMedia letter said.
Johansson urged her fellow actors to ""take a step back from the HFPA"" and Golden Globe events. In a statement, she said that in the past ""this has often meant facing sexist questions and remarks by certain HFPA members that bordered on sexual harassment.""

(Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY) on Monday surpassed Wall Street expectations by reporting a smaller first-quarter loss than a year ago, boosted by earnings from chemicals and oil exports.
The company benefited from a rebound in oil prices, up about 23% during the first quarter, as fuel demand recovered after being decimated last year by lockdowns to curb the spread of COVID-19.
The oil and gas producer reported an adjusted loss of $136 million, or 15 cents per share, for the March quarter, compared with a loss of $467 million, or 52 cents per share, in the first quarter of 2020.
Analysts had expected a loss of 33 cents per share, according to Refinitiv.
Improved operating results in chemicals and marketing were overshadowed by costs relating to a dispute over Ecuador's seizure of an Occidental oil field in 2006. Occidental, which plans to appeal, recorded a $403 million after-tax loss contingency to cover an arbitration judgment against it. 
Occidental has struggled to pay down debt amassed in its $38 billion acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC) in 2019. It has sharply cut spending on production and put several assets on the market to generate cash. 
""Occidental is well positioned to continue to use excess cash flows, coupled with asset sales proceeds, to reduce debt,” Chief Executive Vicki Hollub said.
Its oil and gas business lost $62 million for the quarter compared with a pre-tax gain of $179 million the year before.
Chemicals posted income of $251 million, down from $186 million the year prior. Stronger pricing was partially offset by storm interruptions and cost rises, the company said.

Midstream and marketing income was $282 million, compared with last year's $1.3 billion loss on impairment charges. The business handles its crude oil exports.
The company will hold a call with analysts on Tuesday.

LONDON (Reuters) - Supercar maker the Gordon Murray Group said on Tuesday it plans a 300-million-pound ($420 million) expansion over the next five years, which includes developing electric SUVs and delivery vehicles for carmakers as it shifts towards an all-electric supercar by 2030.
""Electric is what we've been missing and that's where the future is,"" founder and chairman Gordon Murray, the Formula One design great who oversaw one of the sport's most successful cars to date, told Reuters. 
The company will produce its first supercar, the T50, with a powerful V12 engine, in 2022. 
The carmaker will make 100 of them next year, selling for around 2.4 million pounds each. They are already sold out.
The company will launch one more fossil-fuel supercar after the T50, followed by a hybrid model around 2026 and then a fully-electric supercar in 2029 or 2030.
The challenge for premium car firms like McLaren and Lotus, part-owned by Chinese company Geely, is that batteries are very heavy, making it hard to develop sports cars or supercars that perform like their fossil-fuel equivalents. 
Murray described the supercar as a ""brand building"" product at the upper end of his business ""while at the customer-facing end we'll focus on lightweighting and electric cars"".
The company does not just see itself as a carmaker, but as an auto supplier. It has been working on designs for a lightweight SUV and a delivery van, which it aims to sell to traditional manufacturers or startups. 
Over the next two and a half years the carmaker will develop a small test fleet of these vehicles to international standards. 

""We're hoping to pick up a customer or two along the way,"" Murray said. ""And it doesn't have to be a carmaker, it can be a post office, or a company like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).""

These figures support the strength in the market this year as the S&P 500 is up over 11% year to date.
While some of this growth can be attributed to last year's first quarter being hampered by the initial stages of the pandemic, much of it was driven by swift monetary and fiscal stimulus measures. But these measures won't be here forever, which means that not all companies will continue to generate this kind of growth.

Industrial and healthcare shares limited the Dow's decline but the blue-chip average reversed course late in the session to snap a three-day streak of record closing highs.
""The market leadership is not doing all that well this year,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. ""There's been a general rotation away from growth to other parts of the market.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. stocks fell on Monday and the Dow Jones Industrial Average snapped back from a record high, as worries about accelerating inflation dragged on shares and hobbled the dollar, which struggled at a 10-week low.
U.S. equities' losses deepened as the breakeven rates for U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, scaled multi-year highs, underscoring rising inflation expectations.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1% after rising to a record 35,091.56 points earlier in the day. The S&P 500 extended losses to 1%, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 2.55%. (N)
The stocks pullback was mirrored by a broad retreat in riskier assets such as oil and copper, as some investors grew nervous after recent hefty gains.
Indeed, copper prices had also shot to an all-time high earlier on Monday as investors piled in on bets of improved demand amid a tightening supply, and driven by the fear that they were missing out on a price rally. [MET/L]

""We see a high bar for the Fed to change its policy stance,"" Jean Boivin, head of BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Investment Institute, said, noting a ""disconnect"" between the market's pricing for rates to rise as early as next year, and the Fed's rate projection.
For now, Monday's jump in the breakeven rate for TIPS was the focus of some investors.
Speculation that growing price pressure would erode the dollar's value kept the U.S. currency near a 2-1/2-month low. By late Monday, the dollar index, which measures the greenback against six major currencies, had pared losses to stand at 90.302. [USD/]
A sluggish dollar helped sterling rally to $1.416, the highest since Feb. 25, despite Scotland's leader saying another referendum on independence was inevitable after her party's resounding election victory.
Rising inflation expectations lifted longer-dated U.S. Treasury yields. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes stood at 1.6038% after plunging to a two-month low of 1.469% on Friday.
Five-year TIPS rose to 2.72%, its highest since April 2011, following Friday's 2.681%.
The 10-year TIPS breakeven rate also rebounded after closing at 2.503% on Friday. It was last at 2.54%, its highest since April 2013, indicating the market sees inflation averaging 2.5% a year for the next decade.
Oil prices gave up earlier gains as concerns that rising COVID-19 cases in Asia will dampen demand outweighed expectations that a major U.S. fuel pipeline could restart within the week following a cyber attack. [O/R]
Brent crude was little changed at $68.31 per barrel and U.S. crude was also largely flat at $64.91 a barrel. 
A weaker dollar also helped to boost gold prices. Spot gold rose 0.3% to $1,835.44 per ounce, after touching its highest since Feb. 11 at $1,845.06. [GOL/]

The focus now shifts to U.S. consumer price data due on Wednesday, which will help investors determine whether to scale back inflation expectations even further. 
In the cryptocurrency market, ether pared earlier gains to trade under $4,000. Bigger rival bitcoin fell 4.6 % to $55,667.

Shares were last up 5% in choppy extended trading, set to add to the 42% gains following the debut in March.
The company, famous for its games ""Jailbreak"" and ""MeepCity"", reported a 161% jump in bookings to $652.3 million in the first quarter. Analysts had expected bookings - primarily the value of virtual currency that users purchased on the platform - of $504.6 million, according to Refinitiv IBES data. 
Roblox generates most of its booking from in-game purchases of ""Robux"" by kids, who then buy profiles, outfits and upgrades with the credits. 
Gaming companies emerged as pandemic winners as people turned to mobiles and consoles for entertainment as lockdowns shut down outdoor avenues and reduced social interactions. 
Roblox, among the world's most popular gaming sites for children, said gamers spent 9.7 billion hours on the platform in the quarter, with engagement more than doubling in markets outside of the United States and Canada. 
Users over the age of 13 accounted for just under half of all hours engaged in the period, as the company looks to make inroads with older users.
Roblox generated close to 39 million downloads worldwide from App Store and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Play during the first quarter, a 13% year-over-year rise, according to data from analytics firm SensorTower.

Still, Roblox warned it expects year-over-year growth rates in key metrics to decline as COVID-19 restrictions begin to lift around the world. 
Quarterly net loss attributable to common stockholders widened to $134.2 million, or 46 cents per share, from $74.4 million, or 44 cents per share, a year earlier.

829,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2021 04:46PM ET</span>",Don't count chickens before they hatch: Tyson bet on wrong rooster,"By Tom Polansek
CHICAGO (Reuters) -  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN) is laying off a certain type of rooster from its U.S. chicken business after a surprising discovery that eggs fertilized by the male bird hatch less often, resulting in fewer chickens.
The world's largest meat producer by sales will install a replacement across its breeding program by this fall to boost production, Donnie King, president of Tyson's poultry business, said on Monday.
The United States is hungry for more chicken, and supplies are lean as fast-food companies compete to sell chicken sandwiches and wings.
""We're changing out a male that quite frankly we made a bad decision on,"" King told analysts on a quarterly earnings call.
A company spokesman did not immediately respond to request for details about the variety and origins of the rooster type that is getting the boot.
Breeding companies provide hens and roosters to chicken producers, which then breed the birds and hatch their eggs to produce meat. Tyson owns one the of the nation's major breeding companies, Cobb-Vantress.
The unexpected decline in hatching hit Tyson in January, after it introduced the type of rooster that is now being fired, King said. The problem is half the reason why the company's chicken supplies are tight, he said.
""It's about a 50/50 split between the hatch issue for us and the strong demand,"" King told reporters after the earnings call. ""We'll get our supply sorted out.""
Reduced hatching, along with production disruptions related to severe winter weather and the COVID-19 pandemic, drove down Tyson's chicken sales 3.2% by volume in the quarter ended April 3, according to the company. Prices climbed 7.8%, pushing sales by value up 4.6% to $3.6 billion. 
To meet customers' needs, Tyson during the quarter bought more chicken from outside companies than it normally does, mainly breasts.
One customer, KFC, has a new chicken sandwich that is selling twice as much as a previous version, according to KFC owner Yum Brands.
""Our main challenge has been keeping up with that demand,"" Yum CEO David Gibbs said on an April 28 call.
Nationwide, 842 million chicks hatched during March that were bred for meat, down 2% from a year earlier, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. As of April 1, there were 717 million eggs in incubators, up 4% from a year ago. 

Once Tyson's new rooster type is in place, it will take a year before the company sees the full benefits from improved hatching, King said.
""That'll help us in supply,"" he said, ""supply that we quite frankly need today.""

And, as pandemic restrictions ease, job growth and direct recovery checks are likely to increase consumer spending over the coming months and help retail stocks gain momentum. So, we think L Brands, (NYSE:LB),  Crocs  (NASDAQ:CROX), and Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) are poised to make a strong comeback this summer.U.S. retail stores reported an 18.3% month-over-month rise in sales in May 2020 due to panic shopping but faced declining sales thereafter. Despite being overshadowed by soaring e-commerce sales over the past year, the retail industry demonstrated operational resiliency through rapid digitization and support from the $2 trillion-plus CARES Act in March 2020. This is evident in the SPDR S&P Retail ETF’s (XRT) 77.3% returns over the past six months versus SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 20.6% gains over this period.
Multiple direct recovery checks paid out by the federal government have been to the benefit of retailers through the increased consumer spending they have generated. Also, a declining unemployment rate is expected to boost consumer spending further in the near term. And, as more people are vaccinated, brick-and-mortar retailers are expected to witness increasing foot traffic. The National Retail Federation expects the retail sales to exceed $4.33 trillion in 2021.
Therefore, we think it is wise to invest in budding retail stocks L Brands, Inc. (LB), Crocs, Inc. (CROX) and Abercrombie & Fitch Company (ANF) because they are well-positioned to deliver solid returns this summer with their established retail chains and digital presence.

Also, we think the heightened demand for software solutions by industries such as healthcare and electric vehicles (EVs) positions Oracle (ORCL) and SS&C Technologies (SSNC) well for solid gains. So, let’s take a closer look at these two names.The digital transformation of most businesses has fueled the growth of the technology sector--especially the software industry--over the past year. This is evident in SPDR S&P Software & Services ETF’s (XSW) 58.2% gains over the past year compared to SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF's (SPY) 46.7% returns.
Driven by the high productivity rates and low overhead costs during the COVID-19 pandemic, most companies are expected to continue working remotely and be part of the adoption of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) trend. As a result, the global SaaS market is expected to grow at a 12.5% CAGR over the next five years to hit $436.90 billion by 2025.
In addition to cloud computing, electric vehicles (EVs), artificial intelligence (AI), and the healthcare industry should contribute to benefit from the heightened demand for software solutions.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A group of 40 state attorneys general on Monday urged Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg to abandon plans to launch a version of Instagram for children under the age of 13.
""Use of social media can be detrimental to the health and well-being of children, who are not equipped to navigate the challenges of having a social media account,"" the officials said in a letter.
""Further, Facebook has historically failed to protect the welfare of children on its platforms,"" they said.
The letter also signed by the attorneys general of the District of Columbia and three U.S. territories.
A Facebook spokesman said the company has ""just started exploring a version of Instagram for kids"" and said it was committing ""to not showing ads in any Instagram experience we develop for people under the age of 13"".
The company said it agreed any version of the photo-sharing app Instagram ""must prioritize their safety and privacy, and we will consult with experts in child development, child safety and mental health, and privacy advocates to inform it"".
The bipartisan letter, which was signed by the attorneys general of New York, Texas, California, Massachusetts, Nebraska, Michigan, Ohio, Utah, Vermont, Kentucky and others said ""it appears that Facebook is not responding to a need, but instead creating one"".
Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said on Twitter that a children's Instagram ""is a shameful attempt to exploit and profit off vulnerable people"".

The letter said media reports from 2019 showed that Facebook’s Messenger Kids app, intended for kids between the ages of six and 12, ""contained a significant design flaw that allowed children to circumvent restrictions on online interactions and join group chats with strangers that were not previously approved by the children’s parents"".
Last month, the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood also called on Zuckerberg not to create a kids version, saying it would put them at ""great risk.""

Subway said in a statement on Monday it was looking to hire 40,000 new employees in the United States in May. 
U.S. job growth unexpectedly slowed in April, even as the leisure and hospitality industry added 331,000 jobs. Hiring at restaurants and bars accounted for more than half of that.

Late last month his administration took the first step, signing an order to raise wages to $5 for federal workers. (https://reut.rs/3o5odW9)
Chipotle said it would offer a $200 employee referral bonus for crew members and $750 for apprentices or general managers.

The starting wage ranges from $11-$18 and the latest average hourly wage increase will be $2, the company said.

Investing.com – The Dow cut gains to snap five-day win streak Monday, as falling tech stocks dragged the broader market lower. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1%, or 35 points,  but was earlier up more than 300 points hitting an intraday record. The S&P 500 was down 1%, and the Nasdaq Composite slumped 2.6%.
The rotation from tech to economically sensitive cyclicals areas of the market continued as investors shun longer-duration growth stocks amid ongoing inflation pressures and worries about an eventual Federal Reserve.  
Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), were downgraded to neutral from buy by  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) on worries that ad-revenue growth is set to wane. 
""[A]d-growth will likely decelerate after 2Q21 (on tougher comps). Historically, that usually isn’t bullish for multiples. As such, we downgrade GOOGL and FB to neutral,"" Citigroup said.
But others on Wall Street are not so sure that big tech has had its day in the sun.
""With worries around peak tech earnings, it's as 'good as it gets philosophy,' macro inflation/rate jitters, and work from home tailing off as vaccine deployment looks to be hitting the masses, we are seeing multiples compress across the tech sector,"" Wedbush said.
""However massive growth (and further multiple expansion) is still on the horizon with tech stocks underestimating this surge of demand for the next 2-3 years,"" it added.
As the quarterly earnings season draws to a close, investors continued to digest quarterly earnings from corporates.
BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) reported better-than-expected profit and revenue in the first quarter, and said that there was no evidence to suggest that it would need to update its Covid-19 vaccine for emerging variants of the virus.
 Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN), reported first-quarter results on both the top and bottom lines, but flagged headwinds for its chicken business. Its shares were flat, after paring intraday losses.
Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) reported mixed first-quarter results as earnings beat, but revenue fell below expectations. The company did, however, tout optimism ahead, pointing to increased demand as the rollout of vaccines continues.
About 86% of S&P 500 companies that reported earnings through May 7 have beaten analysts’ estimates for earnings per share, and 76% have reported a positive revenue surprise, FactSet said.

Investing.com -- Cyclicals popped on Monday, with financials, industrials and energy stocks leading the Dow higher for most of the day until stocks lost all their steam at the close of trading.
The major indexes all ended in the red. Earlier, stocks were lifted by optimism for the economic recovery even after last week’s data on jobs fell far short of expectations. 
President Joe Biden pitched his jobs plan at a press conference on Monday, promising to make it easier for companies to hire workers and for people to accept work rather than live on unemployment insurance, which has been elevated since the pandemic. The president urged companies to make it easier for people to be vaccinated and to pay them more as an incentive to return.
Big tech fell as investors shied away from high growth stocks on fears the pace of inflation will eventually lead the Federal Reserve to raise rates.
Earnings season is winding down. Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Earnings
On Tuesday we get earnings from two companies that got a boost during the pandemic, when people hunkered down at home in comfy clothing playing video games. 
 Hanesbrands  Inc (NYSE:HBI) is expected to report earnings per share of 26 cents on revenue of $1.5 billion.  Electronic Arts Inc  (NASDAQ:EA) is seen with EPS of $1.05 on revenue of $1.4 billion.
2. Business optimism
Also on Tuesday, the National Federation of Independent Business will release the Small Business Optimism index for last month. Analysts expect a reading of 101, which would be up from the 98.2 recorded for March. That comes out at 6:00 AM ET (10:00 GMT), At 10:00 AM ET, the JOLTs job opening numbers are expected to show 7.5 million openings.
3. Rising gasoline prices?
Gasoline RBOB Futuresfutures are also in focus with the ongoing shutdown of much of the Colonial Pipeline's operations. The major artery from the Gulf Coast to the East Coast for gas, diesel and other oil products was shut down on Friday after a ransomware attack.
Analysts believe a prolonged closure could lift prices at the pump above $3 for the first time since 2014 just as Americans take to the road for the unofficial start of summer on Memorial Day weekend.

The significant gains by healthcare stocks have also been helping broader stock market indexes hover near their all-time highs lately. Also, patients are now expected to reschedule their deferred hospital visits as the fear of the spread of the virus diminishes. This suggests a forthcoming revenue boost to the healthcare sector. Healthcare spending is also expected to increase in the coming months to prevent such a deadly public health crisis in the future. According to a Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services report, national health spending is expected to hit $6.2 trillion by 2028.
With these factors in mind, we think it could be wise to bet on the shares of established healthcare companies Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH),  AbbVie Inc . (NYSE:ABBV), and Novartis AG (NVS). These companies have significant market dominance and are introducing new products at a rapid pace.

842,By Investing.com,"<span>May 10, 2021 03:22PM ET</span>","Dow Eases From Record Highs as Investors Back Cyclicals, Dump Tech","By Yasin Ebrahim
Investing.com – The Dow eased from intraday record highs Monday, as investors added to bets on economically sensitive cyclical stocks, but turned away from tech stocks on fears over the threat for inflation and rising rates.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.18%, or 62, but had hit an intraday high of 35,091.56 . The S&P 500 was down 0.8%, and the Nasdaq Composite slumped 2.3%.
Cyclicals made a strong start to the week, with financials, industrials and energy in the ascendency amid ongoing optimism the economic rebound will continue to gather pace despite last week's softer labor market report. 
Energy stocks, however, did lose some of their early steam, after oil prices cut gains despite ongoing supply disruptions following a cyberattack on the country’s largest fuel pipeline, Colonial Pipeline.
""With the capacity to transport 2.5 million barrels of gasoline and other oil products per day, the affected pipelines supply almost half of the fuel needed on the US East Coast,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said.
Big tech, meanwhile, was under pressure as investors shied away from high growth stocks on fears the pace of inflation is set to continue that will eventually force the Federal Reserve to tightened policy.
Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), were downgraded to neutral from buy by  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) on worries that ad-revenue growth is set to wane. 
""[A]d-growth will likely decelerate after 2Q21 (on tougher comps). Historically, that usually isn’t bullish for multiples. As such, we downgrade GOOGL and FB to neutral,"" Citigroup said.
But others on Wall Street are not so sure that big tech has had its day in the sun.
""With worries around peak tech earnings, it's as 'good as it gets philosophy,' macro inflation/rate jitters, and work from home tailing off as vaccine deployment looks to be hitting the masses, we are seeing multiples compress across the tech sector,"" Wedbush said.
""However massive growth (and further multiple expansion) is still on the horizon with tech stocks underestimating this surge of demand for the next 2-3 years,"" it added.
As the quarterly earnings season draws to a close, investors continued to cheer mostly bullish quarterly earnings from corporates.
BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) reported better-than-expected profit and revenue in the first quarter, and said that there was no evidence to suggest that it would need to update its Covid-19 vaccine for emerging variants of the virus.
 Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN), reported first-quarter results on both the top and bottom lines, but flagged headwinds for its chicken business. Its shares were flat, after paring intraday losses.
Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) reported mixed first-quarter results as earnings beat, but revenue fell below expectations. The company did, however, tout optimism ahead, pointing to increased demand as the rollout of vaccines continues.
About 86% of S&P 500 companies that reported earnings through May 7 have beaten analysts’ estimates for earnings per share, and 76% have reported a positive revenue surprise, FactSet said. "

Revlon on Monday replaced Citi with MidCap Financial, as part of an amendment to a 2016 loan agreement that extends its maturity nearly a year to May 7, 2024. This facility is different from the one that Citi repaid.
Citi assisted with the amendment to the loan facility and earned a fee for its work.
Administrative agents offer housekeeping services between borrowers and lenders, including sending interest payments and facilitating borrowings.
In August, Citi had intended to make a small interest payment on Revlon's behalf, but instead used its own money to repay the cosmetics company's loan in full.
While about $390 million was returned to Citi, a U.S. judge earlier this year ruled that 10 lenders need not repay the remainder. Citi is appealing the decision.
Revlon's shares fell 9% in afternoon trading after it reported lower quarterly revenue. 

The company said Citi remains a partner and it looks ""forward to continuing to work with them in a number of capacities"". 
Citi declined to comment on Monday's announcement from Revlon.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A disbarred American lawyer who spent more than two decades battling  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) over pollution in the Ecuadorian rainforest attempted on Monday to fend off criminal contempt charges stemming from a lawsuit against him by the energy company.
Steven Donziger is on trial in Manhattan federal court for failing to turn over his computer, phones and other electronic devices and refusing court orders to surrender his passport in the civil case brought by Chevron. 
U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska is presiding over the case with no jury.
In an opening statement, prosecuting attorney Rita Glavin said that Donziger had consciously chosen to disobey court orders to turn over his devices and documents.
""Choices have consequences,"" she said.
Martin Garbus, arguing for Donziger, painted a different picture, saying the court had not initially been clear about what it wanted the lawyer to hand over.
The case is the latest twist in a long-running battle stemming from Donziger's representation of villagers in Ecuador's Lago Agrio region who sought to hold Chevron liable for water and soil contamination in the jungle between 1964 and 1992. Chevron has said Texaco, which was acquired by Chevron, cleaned up the pollution, and that state-owned Petroecuador was mainly responsible for the contamination.
Donziger in 2011 won a $9.5 billion judgment against Chevron in an Ecuadorian court. Later that year, the U.S. company sued Donziger in Manhattan federal court, claiming he and his associates pressured the presiding judge in Ecuador.
U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in 2014 ruled in favor of Chevron, saying the Ecuadorian judgment had been secured through bribery, fraud and extortion. 
Chevron sought to recoup money Donziger reaped as a result of the judgment, and Donziger was ordered to turn over certain electronic devices to the company's forensic experts. When he refused, Kaplan charged him with criminal contempt.

Donziger has said the charges violate his rights to due process under the U.S. Constitution.
The Harvard-trained lawyer was disbarred by a state appeals court in New York last year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said on Monday it was opening a formal safety probe into more than 1.1 million Honda Motor Co Ltd Accord vehicles over sudden loss of steering control reports.
The agency said the engineering analysis covers 2013 through 2015 models and said ""under normal driving conditions, with no warning or input from the driver, the vehicle may veer or jerk out of its intended path of travel.""
Honda said it was aware of the investigation and ""takes all safety-related concerns seriously and will continue to cooperate with the NHTSA through the investigation process, as we also continue our own internal review of the available information.""
NHTSA said it has 107 complaints and two injury incidents related to the issue.
One consumer in Dunnellon, Florida, told NHTSA he was driving at 25 miles per hour (40 kph) and the ""steering wheel took over the wheel and he could not control vehicle."" The car went into the woods and hit some small trees. The vehicle was declared a total loss.
NHTSA received a petition asking for an investigation in October regarding an alleged defect in the steering system in 2013 Honda Accord vehicles.
The agency said the petition alleged Honda vehicles ""are experiencing a sudden loss of steering control as the vehicle veers from its intended path of travel.""
The petition said the ""deviation from the intended path of travel occurs without warning or driver input while operating the vehicle under normal driving condition,"" NHTSA added.
NHTSA opened a defect petition review and sent Honda two information requests on steering anomalies in Honda Accord vehicles.
The agency said it ""performed extensive analysis on the 
information obtained from Honda as well as information in NHTSA's databases.""

The engineering analysis will assess the scope, frequency and potential safety related consequences of the alleged 
defect.

But now that mines are gradually resuming operations, an increase in supply has been driving a decline in uranium prices lately. And because the industry is running into hurdles regarding environmental risks and a regulatory slowdown, uranium prices may continue to retreat. Considering this, we think Cameco (NYSE:CCJ), NexGen Energy (NYSE:NXE), Denison Mines (NYSE:DNN), and  Energy Fuels  (NYSE:UUUU), which are facing a plethora of uncertainties, are not safe bets right now. Read on.The COVID-19-pandemic-induced halt in the construction of new plants, a series of mine closures in Canada and dwindling secondary supplies fueled a spike in U308 prices in May 2020. However, as of March 31, 2021, the uranium spot price has declined 15.5% to $28.33 since May 31, 2020. With uranium companies reopening their primary mines, there could be a significant improvement in supply conditions this year. As such, uranium prices may slide further in the coming months.
However, with President Biden’s push to reduce carbon emissions and recent failures of traditional green-energy power systems driving investment in new nuclear plants, the uranium shortage seems less likely to occur. Hence, we think the short-term outlook for the metal is uncertain.
This year is expected to witness a reversal of 2020's gains as COVID-19 production issues end and supply returns to normal without a significant increase in demand. Against this backdrop, shares of The Cameco Corporation (CCJ), NexGen Energy Ltd. (NXE), Denison Mines Corp. (DNN), and Energy Fuels Inc. (UUUU) could experience a pullback. So, these stocks should be avoided now.

Amid the economy’s reopening, many fundamentally sound stocks that lost significant value last year have started rebounding. Furthermore, we think inflationary pressure in the United States and concerns over the market’s overvaluation call for investing in reasonably priced stocks. Hologic (NASDAQ:HOLX), AGCO Corporation (AGCO), Bausch Health Companies (NYSE:BHC), and United Therapeutics (NASDAQ:UTHR) are four names that are currently trading at reasonable valuations considering their fundamental strength and growth potential. So, they cry out for a closer look.2020 was largely dominated by growth stocks, with the tech sector at the forefront. However, with a mass inoculation drive and fiscal and monetary policy support, the economic landscape looks encouraging in the United States. This environment has motivated investors to rotate away from expensive growth stocks to quality value stocks.
As a result, value stocks are back in the limelight after underperforming the broader market last year. This is evidenced by the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Value ETF’s (SPYV) 14.2% returns over the past three months versus the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Growth ETF’s (SPYG) 4.1% gains. While the economy has begun to recover in the United States, the health crisis is far from over and there is still a sense of uncertainty in the markets. Experts also worry that another stock market correction could be in the offing. Therefore, picking fundamentally strong undervalued stocks could be a smart strategy at this juncture.
We believe Hologic, Inc. (HOLX), AGCO Corporation (AGCO), Bausch Health Companies Inc. (BHC), and United Therapeutics Corporation (UTHR) are solid value bets now.

Read on.Several sawmills were closed amid the COVID-19 pandemic as lockdown mandates and travel restrictions caused a labor shortage. The low supply and rising demand from the booming housing market have been driving rising lumber prices. Along with demand for the construction of new homes, home-renovation trends amid the pandemic have contributed to the increase in demand for lumber. Lumber prices have tripled over the past year and are expected to keep rising.
According to the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB), the surge in lumber prices in the past year has added $35,872 to the price of an average new single-family home and $12,966 to the market value of an average new multi-family home.

(Reuters) -Tyson Foods warned on Monday that rising costs will hit profits later this year even though the U.S. meatpacker raised its full-year revenue forecast on higher meat prices and improving demand from restaurants.
Increased costs for labor, transportation and raw materials like grain and packaging are squeezing a range of companies including Tyson, the biggest U.S. meat company by sales. 
Tyson's costs for feed ingredients rose $135 million from a year ago in the second quarter as corn and soybean prices soared on supply concerns. [GRA/]
The company also spent $60 million more buying chicken from other producers due to raw materials shortages, said Donnie King, president of the poultry unit.
Globally, food prices in April were at their highest level since May 2014.
Expectations for further cost increases pushed Tyson to lower its forecast for prepared foods sales to flat from last year.
""We're seeing substantial inflation across our supply chain, which will likely create margin pressure during the back half of the year,"" Chief Executive Dean Banks said.
Still, Tyson said it expects fiscal 2021 revenue to reach $44 billion to $46 billion, up from a previous forecast for revenue in the upper end of a $42 billion to $44 billion range.
Sales in the quarter ended April 3 rose about 4% to $11.30 billion from a year earlier, exceeding analysts' estimates for $11.19 billion, IBES data from Refinitiv showed.
Shares rose 2% in afternoon trading.
In beef, Tyson's largest business, sales rose 1.7% from a year ago to $4 billion, as prices climbed 7.5% and volumes fell 5.8%. 

Tyson said it will pass on increased costs to customers and now expects its beef division to post improved results compared to last year.
The company must also overcome labor hurdles. King said worker absences are up some 50% from before the pandemic and it now takes six days to do five days' worth of work in meat plants.

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus has appointed a senior internal supply chain executive to run its Canadian operation, with responsibility for trimming losses on the A220 jetliner series, in the latest in a series of management changes at the European aerospace group. 
Benoit Schultz, 48, will take over on Sept. 1 from Philippe Balducchi, a former finance executive who became the first head of the Canadian venture when Airbus bought the CSeries jet programme from Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF) in 2018 and renamed it A220. 
Schultz, who was part of the team that ran a ruler over Bombardier's supplier relationships when Airbus rescued it from cash shortages, is currently a senior vice president in the Airbus procurement office, which runs its global supply chain. 
He steps up as Balducchi plans to ""pursue opportunities"" outside the group after integrating the former Bombardier plants into Airbus and opening a new U.S. assembly line, Airbus said. The Canadian-designed A220, with 110-130 seats and a modern lightweight design, has seen a boost in sales under Airbus after its development took a heavy financial toll that triggered Bombardier's near-total exit from the aerospace market. 
It has notched up more net orders so far this year than any other Airbus model as airlines seek to reduce fuel costs and favour smaller aircraft in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. But while sales have benefited from the stronger Airbus marketing machine, industry sources say the European group has yet to secure low enough prices for many of the plane's components to push the A220 project convincingly into the black.
That creates a growing dilemma for Airbus as although new sales are good for the order book, producing those extra planes at costs that remain too high could simply deepen the losses. Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury has been seeking cuts of 20% in the cost of major components, industry sources say. One source said Airbus had obtained solid cuts from dominant suppliers Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) - which makes engines and avionics - and wingmaker Spirit Aero Systems but was still struggling to make a significant dent in most other costs.

Airbus could further reduce costs by redesigning parts and overhauling the production system for the A220, which competes with Embraer regional jets and smaller Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737s, but such spending is seen unlikely during the pandemic. 
Airbus had no immediate comment on cost-cutting efforts.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Lufthansa is working with  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) to sound out investors about a capital increase worth roughly 3 billion euros ($3.7 billion), possibly as soon as June, people close to the matter said.
The final size and timing of the rights issue to repay state aid Lufthansa received during the pandemic will be subject to market conditions and the German airline is expected to opt for a June/July or September/October window, the people said.
Lufthansa and the banks, the lead advisers on the deal, declined to comment.
Lufthansa shareholders this month approved a potential capital increase of up to 5.5 billion euros, though finance chief Remco Steenbergen has said that was just the sum of the two tranches of hybrid capital, dubbed silent participation, it received as part of a 2020 bailout.
""The actual increase will be lower than that and is really dependent on what we see the need to be at the moment we decide to issue,"" he has said.
Capital markets needed to be supportive and the airline's plans to divest units such as LSG, AirPlus and Lufthansa Technik also needed to be taken into account when determining the size of the capital increase, he has said.
The travel industry's hopes for a post-pandemic recovery have been hit by many false starts, beset by new restrictions, virus variant outbreaks and a sluggish European vaccine rollout. 
Lufthansa only expects to fly at about 40% of its pre-pandemic capacity in 2021, but it has raised its number of holiday destinations to over 100, banking on surging demand as vaccination campaigns reach a large number of people.

Lufthansa has already drawn on 1 billion euros of silent participation capital from the government and said earlier this month that it was considering using a further 1.5 billion euros to secure its liquidity position.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - The Indian government has told doctors to look out for signs of mucormycosis or ""black fungus"" in COVID-19 patients as hospitals report a rise in cases of the rare but potentially fatal infection. 
The state-run Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said at the weekend that doctors treating COVID-19 patients, diabetics and those with compromised immune systems should watch for early symptoms including sinus pain or nasal blockage on one side of the face, one-sided headache, swelling or numbness, toothache and loosening of teeth. 
The disease, which can lead to blackening or discolouration over the nose, blurred or double vision, chest pain, breathing difficulties and coughing blood, is strongly linked to diabetes. And diabetes can in turn be exacerbated by steroids such as dexamethasone, used to treat severe COVID-19.
""There have been cases reported in several other countries - including the UK, U.S., France, Austria, Brazil and Mexico, but the volume is much bigger in India,"" said David Denning, a professor at Britain's Manchester University and an expert at the Global Action Fund for Fungal Infections (GAFFI) charity.
""And one of the reasons is lots and lots of diabetes, and lots of poorly controlled diabetes.""
India has not published national data on mucormycosis but has said there is no major outbreak. Media reports have pointed to cases in Maharashtra and its capital Mumbai, and Gujarat.
Aparna Mukherjee, a scientist at ICMR, said: ""It's not something to panic about, but you have to be aware of when to seek consultation."" 
But it is a complication that India's overwhelmed hospitals, desperately short of beds as well as the oxygen needed for severely ill COVID-19 patients, could do without.
Arunaloke Chakrabarti, head of the Center of Advanced Research in Medical Mycology in the Indian city of Chandigarh and an adviser to GAFFI, said that even before COVID-19, mucormycosis was more common in India than in most countries, ""partly because of the millions who have diabetes"".
He said serious cases might require specific antifungal therapy and several operations.
P Suresh, head of opthalmology at  Fortis  (NYSE:FTS) Hospital in Mulund, Mumbai, said his hospital had treated at least 10 such patients in the past two weeks, roughly twice as many as in the entire year before the pandemic. 
All had been infected with COVID-19 and most were diabetic or had received immunosuppressant drugs. Some had died, and some had lost their eyesight, he said. Other doctors spoke of a similar surge in cases.

""Previously if I saw one patient a year, I now see about one a week,"" said Nishant Kumar, a consultant ophthalmologist at Hinduja hospital in Mumbai, noting the potential for contamination of oxygen pipes and humidifiers in hospitals.
Denning called it a ""triple whammy"". ""You've got a high rate of mucormycosis, you've got a lot of steroids - maybe too much - being used, and then you've got diabetes which is not being well controlled or managed.""

The company’s revenue declined in the fourth quarter (ended December 31, 2020) even though more than 1.5 billion consumers visited its page during a Black Friday event held in November 2020. It had also partnered with established companies including Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) and Samsung (KS:005930), but this has not helped it generate significant revenues.

With several challenges lying in wait for the company, can ACB report positive earnings and revenue growth this week? Read on to learn more.Headquartered in Edmonton, Canada, Aurora Cannabis Inc. (ACB) is a medical cannabis producer and distributor. ACB’s stock has gained only 6.9% over the past year. In fact, over the past three months it has declined 30.5%. Also, the stock is currently trading at $8.90, 54.8% below its $19.68 52-week high.
The company is expected to release its third quarter, fiscal year 2021 earnings report on May 13. ACB has missed consensus earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. As such, analysts have become bearish on its earnings prospects. Given that the company’s revenues have been negatively impacted by Canada’s restriction of retail sales to curbside pickup, its attempts to achieve more robust growth has yet to convince investors. 
Also, the budding cannabis industry has become crowded with new operators that are trying to grab market share from established players. Amid this environment, ACB’s failure to attain profitability and strong revenue growth could cause the stock to retreat in the near term.

Mainland China revenue reached 66% in March, almost the same as in March 2019, with demand seen from both international and business travelers. The U.S. has also seen a bump in demand as vaccine rollouts have accelerated, the company said in a statement.
“As vaccines roll out around the world and government restrictions ease, I am optimistic that demand will continue to strengthen,"" said Chief Executive Officer Tony Capuano in a statement. ""We have seen signs that there is a significant amount of pent-up demand, regardless of trip purpose, and we look forward to welcoming travelers in increasing numbers to our more than 7,600 properties around the world.” 
Like so many industries, the hotel sector saw demand plummet as travel screeched to a halt over a year ago when measures against COVID-19 kept us locked down at home. Shares of Marriott tumbled as a result, alongside earnings that are half of what they were a year ago.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Negotiations in Vienna between world powers and Iran are moving into a crucial stage and the next few weeks will be critical to saving their 2015 nuclear deal, the European Union's top diplomat said on Monday.
U.S. officials returned to Vienna last week for a fourth round of indirect talks with Iran on how to resume compliance with the deal, which former U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned in 2018, prompting Iran to begin violating its limits on uranium enrichment about a year later.
""I am optimistic, there is a window of opportunity that will stay open for a couple of weeks, (until) end of the month,"" EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell, who is chairing the talks, told a news conference in Brussels.
""But a lot of work is needed, time is limited and I hope that the negotiations will enter into a phase of nonstop (talks) in Vienna,"" he said following a meeting of EU foreign ministers.
The crux of the 2015 agreement was that Iran committed to rein in its uranium enrichment program to make it harder to obtain the fissile material for a nuclear weapon, in return for relief from U.S., EU and U.N. sanctions.
Tehran denies having nuclear weapons ambitions.

German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas described the negotiations as tough and laborious, but added that all participants were conducting them in a constructive atmosphere.
""However, time is running out. We aim for the full restoration of the Iran nuclear deal as this is the only way to guarantee that Iran will not be able to come into possession of nuclear weapons,"" Maas said in Brussels.

868,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2021 12:02PM ET</span>",BioNTech committed to deliver 1.8 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccine this year,"By Ludwig Burger
FRANKFURT (Reuters) -BioNTech SE said on Monday that its order backlog for delivery of COVID-19 vaccines this year together with partner  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) had grown to 1.8 billion doses, underscoring its role as a major global supplier of immunization shots.
That was up from 1.4 billion doses announced in March.
Based on these delivery contracts, the company said it expects about 12.4 billion euros ($15.1 billion) in revenue from the vaccine this year, including sales, milestone payments from partners and a share of gross profit in the partners’ territories, up from a previous forecast of 9.8 billion euros.
More than 450 million doses of the two-shot vaccine known as Comirnaty were supplied globally as of May 6, 2021. By contrast, AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN), which has pledged to deliver up to 3 billion vaccine doses this year, said on April 30 it had supplied more than 300 million doses so far. That includes production from partners such as the Serum Institute of India.
BioNTech and Pfizer, which have been spared the type of production setbacks that have hobbled AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) , have repeatedly lifted projected delivery volumes amid a global scramble to speed vaccination campaigns.
Earlier on Monday, BioNTech unveiled plans to set up a new factory in Singapore to produce several hundred million doses of its mRNA vaccines per year from 2023.
BioNTech's partner for China, Fosun Pharma , said on Sunday it would provide a factory with an annual capacity of up to 1 billion doses of the COVID-19 vaccine under a joint venture with BioNTech.
That followed a contract with the European Union for up to 1.8 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines for 2021-2023, to cover booster shots, donations and reselling of doses. 
BioNTech reported first-quarter total revenue of 2.05 billion euros, up from 27.7 million a year earlier, driven by vaccine sales, and including an estimated 1.75 billion euros from BioNTech’s share of gross profit from sales in Pfizer’s territories.
Quarterly net profit jumped to 1.13 billion euros, compared to a 53.4-million-euro loss in the year-earlier period.
The company said there was no evidence its current vaccine will need to be adapted to fight new virus variants, but added that it had developed strategies to address such variants should the need arise.
BioNTech reiterated that output capacity for the vaccine would reach 3 billion doses by the end of 2021, and more than 3 billion doses in 2022.

Pfizer last week said the pair was targeting production of as much as 4 billion doses of the shot next year, mostly for low- and middle-income countries.

The company saw its sales plummet last year, as stuck-at-home consumers found little use for makeup. Coty (NYSE:COTY) is now tapping into pent-up demand for luxury beauty products in China and the United States to offset the declines.
Sales at the company's Prestige unit that makes Gucci lipstick and Philosophy skincare rose 6.5% to $600.6 million, the first rise in over a year.
Still, restrictions in certain parts of Europe, including UK and France, imposed to curb surging virus cases hampered demand for the company's products in the third quarter. Sales for the region fell 7.8%, while the Asia Pacific region, which includes China, rose nearly 28%.
""We are starting to see some improvement in the UK ... seeing lockdowns being lifted will hopefully help us build in the fourth quarter,"" Chief Executive Officer Sue Nabi told Reuters.
Coty is also hoping to mirror its success in China in the United States, as the country begins to reopen helped by speedy vaccine distributions.
""In the U.S., part of the business is still a little bit under pressure due to the mass business, but Prestige is growing,"" Nabi added.
The New York-based company's shares, which have gained nearly 50% so far this year, were down about 5% at $9.84 in premarket trade.

Coty's net revenue fell about 3% to $1.03 billion, in line with expectations, while the company broke even on profit.
Net loss attributable to common stockholders was $18.5 million in the quarter ended March 31, compared with a loss of $271.6 million a year earlier.

Investing.com --   Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) slumped 7% after reports that it is unlikely to seek emergency use authorization for its Covid-19 vaccine in the U.S. until at least June.
In February, Novavax’s president of research and development, told a Washington Post Live audience that results from the trial were expected “right at the beginning, maybe” of the second quarter, but a regulatory manufacturing issue has hindered progress, The Washington Post reported, citing four people familiar with the situation. That could mean authorization won't come until ""well into summer."" 
Although the U.S. is overflowing with vaccines, countries around the world, including India and Argentina, are seeing their worst pandemic days yet, and the easy-to-store Novavax vaccine could help. Novavax received $1.6 billion in federal funding for the vaccine development. 
Novavax has a goal of producing 2 billion doses a year. It hasn't yet produced any viable vaccine.

So, let’s take a closer look.A closed-end fund raises a fixed amount of capital through an initial public offering, following which the shares are traded in secondary markets. These funds use the offering’s proceeds to invest in various securities, aligned with their long-term objectives. Closed-end funds are typically actively managed, with portfolio managers monitoring the markets closely to make changes in their holdings to maximize returns. These funds cannot administer secondary offerings to raise additional capital, or buyback existing shares floating in the markets. Shares of closed-end funds often trade at a premium or discount to their net asset value (NAV), and their holdings tend to be highly leveraged.
The high volatility in the stock markets as the United States’ recovery pace slows down with lower-than-expected jobs growth recently is motivating investors to turn again to fixed-income securities. As Dow futures turn negative following a disappointing April jobs report, popular Reddit forum Wallstreetbets (WSB) is showing interest in several closed-end mutual funds because they tend to generate higher returns than open-end funds.

A global semiconductor chip shortage has caused delays in manufacturing activity, and major automakers including Ford Motor (NYSE:F), Honda Motor, General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) were forced to hold back production even as car demand picked up during the COVID-19 pandemic.
""Bottlenecks within the global supply chain and offshore shipping delays of commodity raw materials and components as well as our initial stages of production limited our capacity to produce during the first quarter,"" Workhorse Chief Executive Officer Duane Hughes said.
Workhorse lowered its 2021 production forecast to 1,000 units, from the 1,800 vehicles it expected earlier. It reported quarterly revenue of $521,000, missing analysts' estimates of $2.6 million by a wide margin, according to Refinitiv IBES.
Adding to the grim results, the company said it took a loss of $136.6 million primarily due to the reduction in the fair value of its investment in electric pickup truck company Lordstown Motor Corp.
Shares of the Workhorse, which fell as much as 11.3%, had risen about 6% in premarket trading after it announced that it had entered a strategic partnership to make a delivery vehicle with commercial vehicle body solutions provider EAVX, a unit of J.B. Poindexter & Co.
With the deal, the electric truck maker will enter the EV delivery vehicle market, joining a parade of startups such as Arrival, Rivian and Canoo as well as established players including Ford, General Motors and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn).

The company will be able to pass on to clients most of the increases in raw material prices, including steel, iron ore materials and aluminium alloys, Matteo Tiraboschi told Reuters.
""Most of our contracts are indexed to raw materials,"" he said in a phone interview after presenting the company's results to analysts.
Tiraboschi said forecasts included the effect of raw material price increases and recently made acquisitions.
Brembo, which makes brakes for automakers including Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) as well as several Formula One teams, last month agreed to buy Spanish motorcycle brake maker J.Juan for around 70 million euros ($85 million) in cash.
""We always stand ready to pick M&A opportunities to support our growth, if they create value for the company,"" Tiraboschi said, adding, however, that no new deal was being considered at the moment.
Brembo's first-quarter earnings before interests, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) rose 33% to 135.6 million euros, helped by a robust recovery across its businesses and markets. Margins on EBITDA grew to 20.1% in the same period from 17.7% a year ago. 
Brembo said its ""order levels confirm that the year has begun on a positive note"", adding the impact of the chip shortage on its clients' supply chain was difficult to estimate at present.
""We've got enough inventories of the chips we use, so problems have been marginal for us so far. But the issue in the industry is getting more and more serious; we need to be cautious,"" Tiraboschi said.

By 1445 GMT shares were 1.1% higher, versus a 0.7% rise in Milan's All-Share index.

The billionaire has kept an extremely low profile since delivering a speech in October in Shanghai criticising China's financial regulators, which set off a chain of events that led to the shelving of what would have been a record $37 billion initial public offering of Alibaba's affiliate Ant Group.
On Monday, Ma was seen in an open-air campus shuttle bus with a number of Alibaba executives, according to a photograph taken by an employee at the event, viewed by Reuters. Wearing a blue T-shirt, white trousers and a pair of Chinese-style cloth shoes, Ma was smiling.
""It's so exciting to see Jack,"" said the employee, declining to be named. 
""It's a pity there was no chance to take a photo with him.""
China's most famous entrepreneur, Ma enjoyed cult-like status among staff even after stepping down as chairman in 2019.
Ma, who is based in Hangzhou, disappeared from public view for three months before surfacing in January, speaking to a group of teachers by video, which sent Alibaba shares surging, but has not made any other public appearances since then.

Last month, regulators imposed a sweeping restructuring on Ant Group, while Alibaba was hit with a record antitrust fine of 18.2 billion yuan ($2.84 billion) after an investigation found it abused its market dominance.

(Reuters) -Marriott reported lower-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue because of fewer bookings in its main U.S. market, but the business showed a sharp rebound in China, which is emerging from the coronavirus pandemic at a faster pace.
It is a long road to recovery for Marriott and its smaller rival Hilton, analysts have said, as the hotel operators rely heavily on business travel, which remains weak due to border curbs in many countries.
Marriott, which gets about three quarters of its revenue from the United States and Canada, said its RevPAR, a key measure for a hotel's top line performance, fell 46.3% in the region, sending its shares down as much as 3.8%.
Greater China was the only market that showed positive occupancy growth as RevPAR surged nearly 77%, while it plunged 80% in Europe, making the continent the worst performing region due to the fresh restrictions that have been imposed.
""While recovery trajectories vary from region to region, the resiliency of demand has been most keenly demonstrated in mainland China, where occupancy is near the pre-pandemic level,"" Chief Executive Officer Tony Capuano said.
""Given rising COVID cases and strict restrictions in many countries (in Europe), 25% of the region's hotels are currently closed,"" he told analysts.
Last week, rival Hilton had said Asia, including China, was its only market with positive quarterly occupancy rates and the smallest year-over-year fall in RevPAR.
Marriott, which owns the JW Marriott and Ritz-Carlton brands, said more than 95% of its hotels were open globally.

The hotel operator's adjusted profit fell 33% to $296 million in the first quarter, below market expectation of $305.6 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Total revenue halved to $2.32 billion and missed Wall Street estimate of $2.36 billion.

LONDON (Reuters) - BP (NYSE:BP) said on Monday it will remain a member of the American Petroleum Institute (API) after the largest U.S. oil and gas trade lobby group addressed some differences with the British energy company over climate change.
BP, which plans to sharply cut its oil output and boost its renewable energy capacity over the next decade, said in a report that despite ""uneven progress"", the API was ""heading in the right direction"". 
The API has faced growing pressure from member companies and activist groups to change its policies relating to climate change and drilling regulations. 
The trade group started to shift some of its positions as the climate-focused Biden administration came to power this year. In March it said it supports a carbon price as one measure to mitigate climate change risk.
BP said it was ""encouraged"" by the API's support for federal regulation on limiting emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas and its support for carbon pricing as well as improving its transparency.
""API's progress has been uneven at times but, on the whole, the organization has moved considerably over the past year and is heading in the right direction,"" BP said in the report. 
""We will continue to make our case – as members – to influence API on climate and many other areas relevant to our business in the US.""
London-based BP, led by CEO Bernard Looney, last year quit the main U.S. refining lobby and two other trade groups but stuck with the API despite saying it was only ""partially aligned"" with its policies.
BP will publish a comprehensive review of its membership of the API and other associations next year.
France's Total in January became the first major global energy company to quit the API due to disagreements over its climate policies and support for easing drilling rules, saying it would not renew its 2021 membership.
Total's stance put pressure on other European oil majors that have set out strategies to sharply reduce carbon emissions.
Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) also chose to extend its API membership despite ""some misalignment"" with its climate stance.

BP's interim report also reviewed its participation in four other associations which were partly aligned with its policies including the Australian Institute of Petroleum and the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.
BP said it was encouraged by progress made by all four groups over their climate stances.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's leading automobile dealers association on Monday said sales will take longer to recover than they did after the first wave of COVID-19 infections last year as the virus spreads to villages and smaller towns. 
Auto sales, especially cars and sport-utility vehicles (SUVs), bounced back strongly last year as buyers rushed to buy private vehicles to ensure safety and maintain social distance.
With infections now spreading to rural areas, a recovery is expected to take longer, the Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (FADA) said. The association said it expects sales to return to their peak levels of March 2019 only by fiscal year 2023 - about two years from now.
India's daily infections are close to record highs with the second wave of COVID-19 spreading from hard-hit cities like New Delhi and Mumbai to rural areas that are home to nearly 70% of the 1.3 billion population but where public healthcare is limited.
Many states have imposed strict lockdowns over the last month while other states have placed curbs on movement of people and shut cinemas, restaurants, pubs and shopping malls.
""India is currently facing one of its toughest times with the second wave of COVID creating a havoc in everyone's life,"" said FADA President Vinkesh Gulati. 
FADA said registrations of new vehicles, including cars, SUVs, motorbikes and trucks, for April were 28% lower than March, and sales would continue to remain sluggish in May with some lockdowns extended until the end of the month. 

Consumer sentiment in the first nine days of May was ""extremely weak"" with most of the country under partial or full lockdown, FADA said. The association said that even where car dealerships are open walk-in customer numbers have dropped to 30% of normal levels and many are delaying their purchase decision.
Most automakers, including Maruti Suzuki Ltd, India's top-selling carmaker, and Hero MotoCorp, the country's largest motorbike manufacturer, have extended plant shutdowns until May 16 due to a spike in cases.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Monday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average hitting a new record high. as problems with a major U.S. pipeline network forced energy prices and stocks higher. 
The Colonial Pipeline Company, which operates one of the biggest pipeline networks in the U.S., said on Sunday that its main lines that carry fuel from the Gulf to to the East Coast (as far up as New Jersey)  were still out of commission after a cyberattack on Friday. It's  not known how long the disruption of fuel supplies will last, but crude oil prices rose 0.5% in early trading on Monday.
 By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 184 points. or 0.5%, at 34,870, while the S&P 500 was down 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.2%.
 Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) stock rose 1.8% and  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock rose 1.7%. Cybersecurity stocks put in a mixed performance. however, despite the painful reminder of the need for strong cyber defenses. FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) stock rose 3.3% but CrowdStrike lost 2.9%, while Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) stock was up only 0.7%. SolarWinds (NYSE:SWI) stock was down 2.1%, while Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) stock was down 0.6%.
The market remains somewhat skittish after a weak jobs report on Friday that paradoxically prompted more buying, in anticipation of monetary policy staying supportive for longer. Such thoughts. and the awareness of more and more of the U.S. service sector reopening, have dominated any concerns about rising inflation. 
Inflation hedges were in vogue in early trading, however, with mining giant Freeport-McMoran (NYSE:FCX) rising 3.0% to a 10-year high as Copper Futures and Iron ore Futures raced higher in the Asian session. U.S.Steel (NYSE:X) stock also rose 7.3% while Vale (NYSE:VALE) ADRs rose 3.4%
Elsewhere, cryptocurrency-themed stocks struggled after Elon Musk, one of their highest-profile advocates, allowed himself to take part in a skit that appeared to mock DogeCoin on Saturday Night Live. DogeCoin itself lost over 30%, while Square (NYSE:SQ) - which derives much of its revenue from processing Bitcoin-related payments, fell 4.8%. Musk's carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) saw its stock slide over 3%, also hurt by signs of the global chip shortage forcing up its input costs. The company said it is raising prices for the Model Y and Model 3 accordingly.
Elsewhere, there were contrasting fortunes for biotech companies: BioNTech  (NASDAQ:BNTX) stock rose 2.9% after announcing it will set up a manufacturing facility in Singapore, while Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) fell 7.0% after The Washington Post reported that it's unlikely to file for emergency use authorization for its Covid-19 vaccine from the Food and Drug Administration before June at the earliest."

The trial, which enrolled about 400 participants aged 18 and above, helped the company confirm an appropriate dose for testing in a late-stage Phase 3 trial, Inovio said on Monday.
Inovio has lagged behind rivals in the race to develop a COVID-19 vaccine after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last year put the Phase 3 portion of its mid-to-late stage trial on hold for more information on the device used to deliver the vaccine candidate into skin cells.
Shots from  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc received U.S. emergency use authorization as early as late last year, and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) earlier this year.
Inovio said it plans to use data from the mid-stage trial to answer pending regulatory questions about its delivery device before beginning the Phase 3 portion of the study, on partial hold, after FDA's approval to proceed.
Last month, the company said the U.S. government pulled the funding for a late-stage study testing its vaccine candidate, citing increasing availability of authorized COVID-19 vaccines, and it would now conduct the trial largely outside the country.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific has raised $650 million in its first U.S. dollar bond in 25 years, a term sheet seen by Reuters showed on Monday.
The deal consisted of 5.25-year senior unsecured notes priced with at 4.875%, the term sheet showed.
The final pricing was 32.5 basis points cheaper than indicated by the deal's book runners when launched earlier in Asia on Monday.
Cathay did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.
The airline will use the proceeds to bolster its working capital levels and fund general corporate purposes, the term sheet said.
A U.S. dollar bond will be the pandemic-hit carrier's first since 1996 as it primarily has issued its debt in Hong Kong dollars.
Cathay issued HK$6.74 billion ($869.51 million) of convertible bonds in Hong Kong dollars in January to shore up liquidity, prompting its shares to record their worst daily decline in more than 12 years.
The carrier's shares were up 1.8% on Monday.
Cathay said in March it was focused on preserving cash after posting a record annual loss of HK$21.65 billion, caused by a travel downturn, restructuring costs and fleet writedowns.

Passenger numbers fell by 98.7% compared with a year earlier, though cargo carriage was down by a smaller 32.3%.
Cathay had planned a U.S dollar bond issuance in 2019 at the peak of the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong but pulled the transaction because of the price demanded by investors.

MADRID/LONDON (Reuters) - As its vaccination drive reaches a third of adults and COVID-19 infections ease, Europe is starting to reopen cities and beaches, raising hopes that this summer's holiday season can be saved before it is too late.
Exhilarated Spaniards chanting ""freedom"" danced in the streets as a COVID-19 curfew ended in most of the country at the weekend, while Greece reopened public beaches - with deckchairs safely spaced.
With 200 million vaccine doses delivered, the European Union is on track to achieve its goal of inoculating 70% of its adult population by summer, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted on Sunday.
And, in Germany, a first weekend of summer sun lifted spirits after Health Minister Jens Spahn declared the third wave of the pandemic finally broken.
Yet, Spahn warned: ""The mood is better than the reality.""
The national seven-day incidence of COVID-19 cases remains high at 119 per 100,000 people, he said. ""That makes it all the more important to keep up the speed of the vaccination campaign."" 
Across the EU, the seven-day incidence of COVID-19 is 185, according to Our World in Data. That is far higher than in countries such as Israel with 6, Britain (31), or the United States (123), all of which made quicker early progress in their vaccination drives.
HEAD START
In Britain, early orders and approval of vaccines and a decision to give first doses to as many people as possible have driven down infections and fatalities far more quickly.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson was expected to set out the next phase of lockdown easing in England, giving the green light to ""cautious hugging"" and allowing pubs to serve customers pints inside after months of strict measures.
""The data reflects what we already knew - we are not going to let this virus beat us,"" Johnson said ahead of an official announcement later on Monday. 
Vaccine deliveries were slower initially in the EU under its centralised procurement strategy.
Now, with shots from BioNTech/Pfizer and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) relatively plentiful, vaccinations as a share of the population in Europe are growing while countries that made early advances see slowdowns as they encounter hesitancy among the unvaccinated. 
Some 31.6% of adults in 30 European countries have received a first dose and 12% a full two-shot regime, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control's COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker https://vaccinetracker.ecdc.europa.eu/public/extensions/COVID-19/vaccine-tracker.html#uptake-tab showed.
France expects to give 20 million first injections by mid-May, and hit 30 million by mid-June. 
With infection rates falling and occupancy in hospital intensive care units declining, France plans to start relaxing its curfew and allow cafes, bars and restaurants to offer outdoor service from May 19.
PICKING AND CHOOSING
Improving supply has given countries greater freedom to adapt their strategies following reports of very rare, but sometimes fatal, blood clotting in people who received shots from AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).
Germany has decided to make the two vaccines available to anyone who wants them, as long as they have been advised by a doctor - an offer aimed at younger adults who would have to wait their turn otherwise.
Norway's vaccine commission made a similar call on Monday, saying the AstraZeneca and J&J shots should be made available to volunteers. Some Italian regions are also offering both shots to people under 60.
With some governments shortening the gaps between doses, and plans for an EU digital ""green pass"" scheme in June for travellers to provide proof of vaccination or immunity, people cooped up for months are finally daring to make holiday plans.

""We're pinning our hopes on tourism,"" said Nikos Venieris, who manages a beach in Alimos, an Athens suburb.
Tourism accounts for about a fifth of Greece's economy and jobs, and the country can ill afford another lost summer. Greece is lifting restrictions on vaccinated foreigners from May 15.

AstraZeneca developed one of the first vaccines to tackle the novel coronavirus but the Anglo-Swedish company has suffered a series of setbacks, with disputes over supplies to the European Union and concerns over the risk of rare blood clots.
Frenchman Soriot, who has been in charge of AstraZeneca since 2012, received a total pay package worth 15.4 million pounds ($21.7 million) last year. Most of that comprised bonuses and long-term share awards on top of a base salary of 1.3 million pounds.
Under the new proposals, Soriot's maximum annual bonus will increase to 250% of base salary from 200%, and he will be entitled to long-term share awards worth up to 650% of his salary, an increase from the current 550%.
Investor advisory groups ISS, Glass Lewis and PIRC all recommended that shareholders vote against the increases on the grounds that the potential rewards were excessive.
AstraZeneca said the company's strong performance in recent years justified the rewards.
""This has resulted in AstraZeneca delivering a Total Shareholder Return of close to 300% over the last eight years, significantly ahead of our global pharmaceutical and FTSE 100 peers (at 183% and 44% TSR respectively),"" a company spokesman said.
""The board wants to ensure that our remuneration policy keeps driving a performance in line with the ambitious expectations of our shareholders and other stakeholders,"" he added.
Chairman Leif Johansson will also be standing for re-election at the annual general meeting (AGM). 
Johansson acknowledged in a letter to shareholders that he might be expected to stand down after nine years in the role but said the board had asked him to stay on to help oversee the completion of the planned takeover of U.S. group Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:ALXN).
AstraZeneca agreed to buy Alexion last December for $39 billion in its largest ever deal, diversifying away from its fast-growing cancer business in a bet on rare-disease and immunology drugs.

Shareholders will vote on the Alexion deal in a separate meeting on Tuesday.

(Reuters) - Self-driving tech company Pony.ai, backed by  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, said on Monday its next-generation technology for robotaxis will be using lidars made by Luminar Technologies, Inc.
Lidars are laser-based sensors that are a key component to many autonomous vehicle technologies and help them perceive the environment around the cars.
James Peng, Pony.ai CEO said the startup chose Luminar's Iris lidar for its performance but also as it can be integrated into the car better than traditional lidars.
""It's actually starting to blur the line between what you see as a very well designed passenger vehicle and the monstrosities that have been on top of some of the AV test vehicles,"" said Austin Russell, founder and CEO of Luminar.
Luminar's Iris lidar is about 10 centimeters high and Peng said four of them will be mounted on top of the car for 360 degree views. He said Pony.ai is aiming for automotive-grade production of autonomous fleets in 2023 globally. 
Pony.ai has Robotaxi services in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Beijing, and Irvine and Fremont in California with a fleet of about 200 autonomous vehicles. Late last year, the startup raised $267 million at a valuation of $5.3 billion.

In addition to Pony.ai, Luminar earlier this year announced a partnership with SAIC Motor Corp, China's largest automaker and a deal with the self-driving software subsidiary of Volvo Cars, owned by China's Geely Automobile Holdings (OTC:GELYF).
Luminar, founded in 2012, is one of several U.S. lidar manufacturers in the past year to go public via reverse mergers with blank-check companies.

899,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2021 07:10AM ET</span>",BioNTech to build mRNA vaccine manufacturing site in Singapore,"By Ludwig Burger and Caroline Copley
BERLIN (Reuters) -BioNTech plans to set up a regional centre and a new factory in Singapore for its vaccines, it said on Monday, boosting its presence in Asia as a debate over patents rages and pressure grows on drugmakers to raise output of COVID-19 shots.
Governments are looking to build up local vaccine production to secure access to supplies after manufacturing setbacks have slowed the rollout of COVID-19 doses in some countries. 
The Singapore facility will ""address potential pandemic threats"" in southeast Asia and will increase BioNTech's global supply capacity of product candidates - also beyond vaccines - based on messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, BionTech said.
MRNA vaccines, like BionTech and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s COVID-19 shot, prompt the human body to make a protein that is part of the virus, triggering an immune response. 
The German biotech company said the Singapore factory will have an estimated annual capacity of several hundred million doses of its mRNA vaccines depending on the specific type, once it is operational in 2023.
""Having multiple nodes in our production network is an important strategic step in building out our global footprint and capabilities,"" said Ugur Sahin, CEO and co-founder of BioNTech.
He told a press conference that the investment amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars, declining to be more specific.
BioNTech Chief Strategy Officer Ryan Richardson said there were ongoing discussions with countries around the world about more production sites but added the Singapore decision was exceptional.
""We made a unique long-term commitment to Singapore,"" following more than a year of talks with the country, he added.
CHINA VENTURE
Leading vaccine makers have come under growing pressure to free up their COVID-19 vaccine patents to aid poor countries. BioNTech and other vaccine makers have said they were already transferring vital production knowledge to other parts of the world.
BioNTech and Pfizer are jointly commercializing the vaccine worldwide, excluding China, Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan, which are covered by BioNTech’s collaboration with Fosun Pharma.
BioNTech and Fosun Pharma have done clinical trials in China but Fosun had not started producing the vaccine, which has yet to be granted approval there.
Fosun said on Sunday it would provide a factory with an annual capacity to make up to 1 billion doses of the COVID-19 vaccine under a joint venture with BioNTech.
This marks a step closer for China to have localized manufacturing capability for the German firm's vaccine. Five domestically-developed COVID-19 vaccines are being used in the country, while no foreign ones have gained regulatory approval.
BioNTech plans to open the Singapore office in 2021 and expects the manufacturing site to be operational by 2023, creating up to 80 jobs in Singapore.

The establishment of a southeast Asia regional hub, which is supported by the Singapore Economic Development Board, comes after BioNTech, based in Mainz, Germany, set up a U.S. headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 2020.
BioNTech has said it and Pfizer would have capacity to produce up to 3 billion doses in 2021. Pfizer said last week the pair was targeting production of 4 billion doses next year, mostly for low- and middle-income countries.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening mixed Monday, while crude prices rise in the wake of a cyber attack on the largest U.S. gasoline pipeline.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 105 points, or 0.3%, S&P 500 Futures traded 3 points, or 0.1%, higher, but Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 36 points, or 0.3%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 closed at record highs Friday, and these indices are expected to open higher Monday as investors seek out value stocks following Friday’s unexpectedly weak April jobs report, which cooled fears the Federal Reserve may be forced to tighten policy to curb an overheating economy.
However, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is seen opening lower, with the megacap tech stocks struggling to move higher from already advanced levels despite generally strong quarterly earnings. 
Additionally, the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield edged up toward 1.60% as traders brace for a busy week of auctions.  
Elsewhere, oil prices strengthened and gasoline futures hit a near three-year high Monday after a ransomware attack caused Colonial Pipeline, which provides nearly half of the U.S. east coast's fuel supply, to shut down its entire system on Friday, stoking expectations of gasoline shortages along the U.S. East Coast.
Some smaller lines were restarted Sunday, but Colonial has given no timeline for the restart of its main pipelines.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% higher at $65.22 a barrel, the Brent contract rose 0.6% to $68.69, while gasoline futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 1.4% to $2.1562 a gallon, climbing to the highest level since May 2018 before paring gains.
The surge in energy prices is sure to add to the inflation debate, with the April CPI report due on Wednesday. This is forecast to show prices posting more gains, with the annual figure seen rising 3.6% on the year, a sharp jump from March’s 2.6%, and considerably above the 2% level the Federal Reserve usually seeks to limit price rises to.
In the corporate sector, the generally successful first-quarter earnings season is gradually winding down, but there will still be updates Monday from  Duke Energy  (NYSE:DUK), Air Products (NYSE:APD) and Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR), the last of which posted a loss for the quarter as the pandemic again hit bookings.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) could also be in focus following reports that the U.S. Department of Defense is rethinking its $10 billion ‘JEDI’ contract for Cloud hosting, the implementation of which is being delayed by litigation from Amazon.
Cybersecurity stocks, such as FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) and SolarWinds (NYSE:SWI), are also in demand on the back of the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.5% to $1,839.45/oz, while EUR/USD traded flat at 1.2163.

The Japanese maker of items from bicycles to hair dryers is looking to tap growing demand for electric car batteries in key markets such as the United States and China through a decade-old partnership with Tesla Inc that is finally making money. 
Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) this business year expects its automotive unit to post 50 billion yen in operating profit, the company's CFO Hirokazu Umeda told a press briefing. 
""The automotive batteries, which are nearly all Tesla account for around 40%,"" Umeda said. 
Panasonic forecast overall operating profit to rise 27.6% to 330 billion yen ($3 billion). The figure is slightly higher than an average forecast of 327.56 billion based on estimates from 16 analysts, Refinitiv data shows.
Panasonic this business year, will also begin a test line in Japan to make large cylindrical 4680 format battery cells, Umeda added. 
Tesla says that format, which is 46 millimetres wide and 80 millimetres tall, will store more energy, halve battery costs and help ramp up battery production 100-fold by 2030.
The Japanese company is also investing heavily in new production chain management services as companies strengthen supply chains following pandemic disruptions. 
Panasonic Corp said last month it would acquire the shares of U.S. supply-chain software company Blue Yonder that it does not already own, in a $7.1 billion deal, its biggest in a decade.
The U.S. company uses machine learning to help firms manage supply chains linking factories to warehouses and retailers. 
For the quarter that ended on March 31, the Japanese industrial conglomerate posted operating profit of 31.8 billion yen ($292.09 million), down 40% from a year ago as weaker earnings from its life solutions unit, which sells lighting, equipment and materials for buildings, offset rising income from automotive components.

That result was better than an estimated average profit of 20.99 billion yen from five analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.

906,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2021 06:25AM ET</span>",Investors chide Toyota's Toyoda for questioning combustion car ban,"By Aaron Sheldrick
TOKYO (Reuters) - Some  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) shareholders have criticized its President Akio Toyoda for questioning Japan's plans to ban conventional cars only days after the firm said it was reviewing its climate lobbying and aimed for carbon neutrality by 2050. 
The five investors, who collectively have around $500 billion in assets under management and spoke exclusively to Reuters, said the carmaker risks falling behind competitors that are rolling out electric vehicles, while giving cover for other companies seeking to avoid big changes to meet climate goals.
Japan's Toyota signalled a shift in its climate change stance last month when it said it would review its lobbying and be more transparent on what steps it was taking as it responded to increased activist and investor pressure.
Three days later though, in his capacity as head of the Japanese automobile Manufacturers Association, Toyoda questioned the country's decision to ban new internal combustion engined vehicles by 2035 in its quest for carbon neutrality. 
""What Japan needs to do now is to expand its options for technology. I think regulations and legislations should follow after,"" Toyoda said.
""Policy that bans gasoline-powered or diesel cars from the very beginning would limit such options, and could also cause Japan to lose its strengths,"" he added.
Investors who had welcomed the earlier Toyota statement on lobbying said they were worried that Toyoda may not be on board with the plans.
""We're genuinely concerned that Mr. Toyoda does not seem to realize what is at stake here,"" said Jens Munch Holst, CEO of AkademikerPension.
The Danish fund told Reuters last month that it would consider a shareholder resolution or sell its holding in Toyota if there was no change after ""intense"" engagement with the company.
A Toyota spokeswoman told Reuters the company could not immediately comment on the investors' criticism but would be addressing climate issues later in the week when it announces earnings.
The company in recent years has said that electric vehicles will play a greater role in reducing emissions but other solutions should be used, like its successful hybrid or slow-selling hydrogen vehicles. 
With pressure growing on carmakers to slash emissions, Toyota is scrambling to produce electric vehicles that can compete with models from the likes of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), General Motors (NYSE:GM) and  Renault  (PA:RENA), plus Chinese startups like Nio (NYSE:NIO) and Xpeng.
The five investors who spoke about Toyoda's comments - also including Norway's Storebrand Asset Management, Nordic investor Nordea Asset Management, the Church of England Pensions Board and KLP, Norway's biggest pension fund - said Toyota was in danger of blunting its competitiveness.

""As a shareholder in Toyota, we actively engaged with the company and received reassurances that all of its lobbying activities, including with industry associations, would be reviewed and reported on this year,"" said Jan Erik Saugestad, CEO of Storebrand Asset Management.
""Full electrification of transport is vital if we are to meet our climate targets and Toyota should be leading the charge on this rather than prolonging the production of new combustion engines and giving away their market share to other companies,"" he added.

907,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2021 05:40AM ET</span>",UK airline stocks cushioned by hopes for big June travel restart,"LONDON (Reuters) - British airline stocks lost ground on Monday after the government set out a limited reopening of travel, but losses were cushioned by hopes that a bigger take-off would be on the cards for June. 
British Airways-owner IAG (LON:ICAG), easyJet (LON:EZJ), Jet2 and TUI were all down between 2-3% as they traded for the first time since Britain said on Friday that travel could restart but only to a handful of places, including Portugal, Israel and Iceland.
The top four destinations for British travellers - Spain, France, Italy and the United States - were left off the country's travel ""green list"", but confidence in the industry is growing that by June those countries will make it. 
""We expect the number of countries on the green list to grow next month to include many of our popular summer destinations,"" easyJet Chief Executive Johan Lundgren said in a statement.
Britain has said it will review every three weeks the green list - places for which quarantine on return is not required - giving two more chances for Britain's main summer holiday destinations to make it before peak season starts in July. 
Goodbody analysts said that Spain, Italy, France and the United States should make the grade by the time of the next review. 
""We see expectations of a significant shift in bookings starting in June as these changes occur, barring of course the emergence of any new variants in these countries in the meantime,"" Goodbody's Mark Simpson said. 
Davy analyst Stephen Furlong said that while the initial list was ""a bit of a damp squib"", airlines were preparing for a late summer. 
""Rather than you know May to September, I think we're probably talking about July to October,"" he said, representing a shift in the peak season to accommodate the expected loosening in COVID restrictions. 
Crude prices rose on Monday, which Furlong said would also be weighing on airline stocks.
Expectations that unrestricted travel will be possible later this year due to the roll-out of the vaccine have lifted airline shares this year, with IAG up 31% and easyJet up 28% since the beginning of January. 

Flights website Skyscanner told the BBC that bookings to Portugal from the United Kingdom saw a 660% increase on Friday compared to the previous day. 
""There's very strong demand out there and as the capacity fills, it's pure supply and demand, so we have seen those prices increase,"" said Hugh Aitken, the company's flights chief.

Europe's drug regulator backed J&J's vaccine last month after examining cases of a rare blood clotting issue in U.S. adults who received a dose. But it left it up to the European Union's member states to decide how to use it.
Germany's move to offer the J&J single-dose vaccine widely follows the lifting of restrictions last week on the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) vaccine.
The AstraZeneca shot had been earmarked for people aged over 60 following similar reports of very rare but sometimes fatal clotting events in younger people, with women disproportionately affected.
The decisions reflect Germany's progress in vaccinating its seniors, Spahn said, adding he expected everyone aged 60 and above who wanted to be vaccinated to be offered a shot by late May or early June.

With millions of J&J doses due to arrive later in the second quarter of this year, it made sense to make the shot more widely available, he added.
Spahn forecast that 10 million doses of the J&J shot were expected to arrive in Germany by the end of the second quarter.

(Reuters) - Analysts in April hiked 12-month earnings estimates for Asian companies by the largest amount in five months, data showed, as manufacturing activity and demand for the region's exports rose.
Analysts lifted forward 12-month earnings by 3.2% in April, the highest since December, according to Refinitiv data.
The big upgrades came as regional economies such as South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam saw an increase in factory output and shipments thanks to a rise in demand from developed economies which are making a fast recovery from the coronavirus crisis.

""Stronger consumption and investment demand in the developed economies have boosted commodity prices and the revenues of the North Asian exporters,"" Raychaudhuri said.
Taiwan and South Korea saw earnings upgrades of 8.6% and 6.9% respectively in the past month, while Australia and China saw upgrades of 4.3% and 1.4%.

But Asian nations that have seen a recent surge in coronavirus cases such as India, Indonesia and Philippine saw their earnings downgraded during April.
MSCI's Asia-Pacific index gained 1.4% in April, but the forward 12-month price to earnings ratio dropped to a six-month low of 16.51 at the end of April, reflecting the rise in earnings estimates.
The index gained more than 0.5% on Monday on hopes that interest rates will remain low due to receding inflationary pressures in the United States.

At 3:50 AM ET (0850 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.2% lower, the CAC 40 in France fell 0.1%, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.2%, to a 52-week high. 
The large cap miners have pushed higher Monday, boosting the FTSE 100 index, as metals prices rise, helped by the recovery of the U.S. and Chinese economies, the two largest in the world, while stimulus plans target infrastructure and renewable energy in both countries.
Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) stock rose 3.1%, climbing to an all-time high, while  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) stock climbed 1.3% and BHP Billiton (NYSE:BBL) stock rose 3.2%, both to 52-week highs.
On the flip side, the airlines sector weakened, with easyJet (LON:EZJ) stock falling 2.6%, Ryanair (LON:RYA) stock dropping 1% and British Airways-owner IAG (LON:ICAG) down 1.6%, despite the U.K. allowing international travel to resume from May 17, as only 12 countries made its approved list.
Elsewhere, German biotech company BioNTech (DE:22UAy) stock surged 9.5% after revealing plans to build a new manufacturing site for its vaccines in Singapore.
U.S. nonfarm payrolls data on Friday showed jobs growth unexpectedly slowed in April, while in Europe, Phillip Lane, the ECB’s chief economist, told French newspaper Le Monde that the unemployment rate in the bloc wouldn’t return to its 2019 level before 2023 and the Eurozone's gross domestic product will not return to its 2019 level before spring next year.
Elsewhere, oil prices strengthened and gasoline futures hit a near three-year high after a cyber attack on a U.S. pipeline operator resulted in a major disruption to U.S. supplies.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% higher at $65.34 a barrel, the Brent contract rose 0.7% to $68.73, while gasoline futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 1.4% to $2.1568 a gallon, climbing to the highest level since May 2018 before paring gains.
The ransomware attack caused Colonial Pipeline, which provides nearly half of the U.S. east coast's fuel supply, to shut down its entire system on Friday. Some smaller lines were restarted Sunday, but uncertainty remains over when its main pipelines can resume working.

913,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2021 02:56AM ET</span>","Australia's Star eyes Crown in $7 billion play, vies with private equity","By Byron Kaye
SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australian casino operator Star Entertainment Group on Monday proposed an all-stock buyout of larger rival Crown Resorts Ltd that it valued at A$9 billion ($7 billion), taking on two private equity giants for control of the troubled company.
Three months after Crown was declared unfit for a gambling licence at its new Sydney resort tower, Star said the share-swap takeover approach would create ""one of the largest and most attractive integrated resort operators in the Asia Pacific region"".
The move presents Crown shareholders with a third option after buyout giant Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) earlier upped its all-cash indicative bid to A$8.4 billion, while Oaktree Capital Group has proposed to bankroll a A$3 billion buyback of Crown's founder's stake, removing a regulatory concern.
Star's approach reflects the intense interest in Crown, which has prized tourism and real estate assets in three of Australia's four biggest cities but whose profits and share price have been hit by coronavirus-related border closures and regulatory woes.
If the deal goes ahead, Star said it would pursue a sale and leaseback of the companies' combined property portfolio covering dozens of hectares of sought-after waterfront land, generating ""significant value"".
Shares of both companies touched their highest intraday levels since before the pandemic, giving them a combined market capitalisation of A$13 billion by the close, as investors warmed to the longer term benefits that Star said were built into its proposal.
Star's proposal ""has the synergies, and then the sale-and-leaseback provides the firepower to do buybacks to realise full value for both sets of shareholders,"" said John Ayoub, portfolio manager of Wilson Asset Management which has shares in both.
An inquiry in February found Crown had enabled money laundering on its premises, knowingly dealt with tour operators linked to organised crime and disregarded the safety of staff in China who were jailed in 2016 for breaching its gambling ban. It cited the influence of founder and 37% owner James Packer over the Crown board as a governance problem.
Crown, which lost its CEO in the inquiry fallout, said on Monday said it had appointed Steve McCann, the head of property developer Lendlease Group, to the role. Crown said it was considering the Star proposal, along with the others.
Following the inquiry Packer pulled his representatives from the Crown board and said he would defer to the company's leadership about its future. Since stepping back from running the company in an official capacity in recent years, Packer has tried several times to sell down or exit his stake.
A Packer spokesman was not immediately available for comment on Monday.
'ANTITRUST'
While the Star proposal would not require clearance from foreign takeover regulators, as Blackstone's would, it may attract antitrust scrutiny since it would create a single gambling behemoth in Australia without a competitor.
When the New South Wales state government approved Crown's Sydney asset in 2013, it cited the need for competition for Star as a reason.
An Australian Competition and Consumer Commission spokesperson said Star had made an approach about its proposal but ""we will wait for a submission and commence a public review after that, if the matter progresses"".
Star CEO Matt Bekier said there was a small overlap of the two companies' businesses, which would compete only in Sydney once Crown was allowed to run its casino, and ""we would position the brands at the ends of the consumer spectrum, rather than letting both brands drift into the centre"".
Unlike Star, which operates slot machines and mass entertainment, Crown, which is not allowed to run slot machines in Sydney, was positioned as an upmarket participant, Bekier noted.
""In an ordinary market, a two-to-one merger would not be something that would be easy to approve at all,"" said Yane Svetiev, an associate professor at University of Sydney Law School who specialises in competition law.
""(But) I can see somebody making an argument that perhaps it doesn't matter that much because the market is already heavily regulated anyway,"" he added.
Star's intraday peak of A$4.30 would value the Crown purchase at A$7.8 billion. Star said it estimated its shares would be worth more than A$5 each if the bid were to proceed. The jump in Crown shares gave it a market capitalisation of A$8.8 billion.

Representatives of Blackstone and Oaktree declined to comment.

914,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2021 02:31AM ET</span>",Eli Lilly signs deals to boost supply of COVID-19 treatment in India,"BENGALURU (Reuters) -Eli Lilly and Co said on Monday it had signed licensing agreements with three Indian generic drugmakers to expand the availability of its arthritis drug baricitinib in the country for treating COVID-19 patients.
The agreements will bolster India's arsenal of drugs to battle its catastrophic second wave of the pandemic, which has led to an acute shortage of coronavirus medicines including remdesivir and tocilizumab.
The three Indian drugmakers - Cipla Ltd, Lupin Ltd and Sun Pharma - will collaborate with U.S.-based Lilly to help make and sell baricitinib in India. 
Baricitinib has been given restricted emergency use approval by India's drug regulator for use in combination with remdesivir for the treatment of hospitalised COVID-19 adult patients requiring supplemental oxygen, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) said in an emailed statement.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration initially gave Lilly an emergency use approval in November for baricitinib in combination with remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients.
""More licenses to additional Indian generic manufacturers are expected to be announced soon,"" said Luca Visini, managing director at Lilly India, without elaborating further.
Last week, Lilly said it would donate 400,000 tablets of baricitinib, to be used with remdesivir, to the Indian government.
These agreements would expand the portfolio of COVID-19 drugs offered by the country's drugmakers. All three companies offer antiviral drug favipiravir, used to treat patients with moderate to mild COVID-19.
Cipla, which also offers remdesivir and tocilizumab, said last week it would be the local distribution partner for a COVID-19 antibody drug cocktail developed by Roche and Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN), after the therapy got domestic emergency use approval.

Separately, smaller Indian drugmaker Natco Pharma said https:// earlier this month it would request a compulsory license based on emergency approval for its own generic version of baricitinib.
India reported 366,161 new infections and 3,754 deaths on Monday, dipping from recent peaks, while calls grew for a nationwide lockdown.

915,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2021 02:30AM ET</span>",Take Five: Spring is (finally) in the air,"(Reuters) - 
1/ THE GREAT REOPENING 
After weeks of COVID-19 lockdowns, a reopening of European economies is close, and boosting sentiment. Tuesday's German ZEW sentiment survey could confirm a brightening outlook. 
Germany eases curbs on those fully vaccinated or recovered from COVID-19. France starts relaxing a night curfew and allowing restaurants to offer outside service from May 19.
After a slow start, the EU is expected to meet its target of delivering first vaccine doses to 70% of adults by end-summer, the euro zone should get to 50% in June. That's good news for tourism-dependent economies. Brussels' recommendation to ease restrictions on some countries and travellers is putting a spring in the step of British airline stocks too.
Britain will allow international travel to resume from May 17 after months of banning most trips abroad, but nearly all major destinations were left off its list of countries open for quarantine-free holidays.
-UPDATE 4-Britain to reopen foreign holidays to just a handful of countries
- EU aims to open up to foreign tourists this summer amidst COVID-19 
(Graphic: Airline stocks pin hopes on great reopening: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qmyvmenejvr/theme0605.png)
2/ SELL IN MAY 
Global equities are down after three months of gains. But markets aren't far off record highs and price falls may reflect a setback for tech mega-caps rather than a wholesale exit from stocks. And with real bond yields deeply negative, a selloff should be short-lived. 
Yet tailwinds are weakening. The first quarter likely marked the peak of the U.S. growth and earnings rebound.  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) predicts a 10% correction in stocks, saying markets fall each time the ISM survey retreats from a peak - which it has just done. 
The liquidity tide too is ebbing. Most central banks are not yet unwinding money-printing or raising rates but money supply growth has shrunk. And just how transitory will inflation be? As May progresses, these questions won't go away.

3/ BORROWED TIME?
Investors will watch the U.S. Treasury's debt auctions for signs that demand remains steady after a yield surge roiled markets in the first quarter and fanned concerns that higher borrowing costs could hurt stocks, particularly growth sectors like technology.
The Treasury will auction $58 billion of three-year notes on Tuesday and $41 billion of 10-year notes on Wednesday, followed by $27 billion of 30-year bonds on Thursday.
The Federal Reserve's asset purchase schedule too is due on May 13. The Fed kept Treasury purchases unchanged at $80 billion per month for mid-April to mid-May period.

4/ CHINESE DEBT BRAKE? 
While global investors focus on inflation, in China it's credit that's the most likely source of pressure for policymakers. Data on both due in coming days could shape Beijing's outlook, with inflation seen pretty subdued while loan growth will probably chug along.
    The politburo recently emphasised steady-as-she-goes policy, but made notable mention of the need to dampen housing speculation and of the government's role in managing financial risks - possibly clues as to areas that might see reform or tightening.
    That comes after a wobbly few months in its debt markets, with defaults at state-owned firms in November and trouble at bad-loan giant Huarong rattling confidence in recent weeks. There's no sense yet of a 2018-style de-leveraging push, but authorities might be looking to tap the brakes if loans leap.

5/ COINING IT
Bitcoin hogged the crypto-currency limelight earlier this year, doubling in price before recently losing steam. Now it's the turn of smaller rivals - the ""altcoins"" - to have their moment in the sun.
The second-largest coin, ethereum, hit a record $3,560 recently fuelled by its use in a bond issue and the booming NFT sector. Meme-based digital coin Dogecoin, originally intended as a satire on the cryptocurrency boom, also hit an all-time high. Their rise knocked bitcoin's share of the $2.4 trillion crypto market to a near-two year low. 
Meanwhile Dogecoin lost more than a third of its price on Sunday, after Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) chief and cryptocurrency supporter Elon Musk called it a ""hustle"" during his guest-host spot on the ""Saturday Night Live"" comedy sketch TV show.

916,By Investing.com,"<span>May 10, 2021 02:01AM ET</span>",European Stock Futures Higher; Pressure on Fed Eases After Payrolls,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening higher Monday, following the global trend, with investors sanguine about the economic recovery despite Friday’s disappointing U.S. employment report.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.2% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.3% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.3%. 
Last week’s trading ended on an upbeat note on Wall Street, with the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average and the broad-based S&P 500 hitting all-time highs. This positive tone has largely continued in Asia, and Europe is expected to see the benefit Monday.
This comes despite U.S. nonfarm payrolls data on Friday showing jobs growth unexpectedly slowed in April, as the disappointing release raised expectations that U.S. interest rates would remain low for some time to come..
Recent strong U.S. economic data had started to force investors to consider that the Federal Reserve would be pushed into raising interest rates earlier than the central bank had previously outlined.
That said, gains aren’t likely to be substantial after the European Central Bank’s chief economist stated that the road to recovery from the coronavirus would be long for the Eurozone. 
Philip Lane told French newspaper Le Monde that the unemployment rate in the bloc wouldn’t return to its 2019 level before 2023, while the Eurozone's gross domestic product will not return to its 2019 level before spring next year.
Elsewhere, oil prices strengthened and gasoline futures hit a near three-year high after a cyber attack on a U.S. pipeline operator resulted in a major disruption to U.S. supplies.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% higher at $65.37 a barrel, the Brent contract rose 0.8% to $68.80, while gasoline futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 1.7% to $2.1629 a gallon, climbing to the highest level since May 2018 before paring gains.
The ransomware attack caused Colonial Pipeline, which provides nearly half of the U.S. east coast's fuel supply, to shut down its entire system on Friday. Some smaller lines were restarted Sunday, but uncertainty remains over when its main pipelines can resume working.
Back in Europe, the earnings season has slowed a little, although AngloGold Ashanti (JO:ANGJ) Monday reported an improved profit for the first quarter of the year with higher prices compensating for lower gold production and sales.
Stock exchange operator  Euronext  (PA:ENX) is also expected to release an update Monday.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.4% to $1,838.55/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.2152.

917,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2021 01:46AM ET</span>",Underwriters puzzle over how to make pandemics insurable again,"By Carolyn Cohn
LONDON (Reuters) - When much of the global economy locked down last year, insurers, facing estimated losses of more than $100 billion globally, reached straight for their red pens to strike pandemic cover from all new business policies. 
Denis Kessler, chairman and CEO of French reinsurer SCOR, summed it up when he told a recent conference that pandemic risk was like war. 
""We exclude war - it's not insurable,"" he said. 
But as industries spanning travel and hospitality to construction and manufacturing revert to a new normal, huge demand is causing insurers to figure out how they can put pandemic risk back in policies without making them prohibitively expensive.  
One example is the film and television industry. 
U.S. company SpottedRisk has devised a model built on years of data on the political and economic environment of film locations in 150 countries, as well as a year's COVID-19 shutdown data, to come up with a pricing mechanism to cover the risk of production stopping due to the pandemic.
""I had been told by 20-plus industry insiders that it was going to be impossible, but we found a way,"" said SpottedRisk chief executive Janet Comenos.
The company, which declined to name its clients, said its insurance policy has enabled 19 independent film and TV productions with budgets of between $1 and $85 million to film at locations across the globe.
The SpottedRisk policy, which typically costs between $50,000 and $80,000 for $1 million of cover, helps to fill a gap in Hollywood where independent filmmakers have bemoaned the lack of cover, and contrasts with Britain, where a government scheme to enable film and TV production to go ahead has no insurer involvement.
While the film industry's risks are relatively contained over finite time periods, industries such as airlines have much higher potential losses and may prove harder to insure, with many insurers saying extensive cover can only come back if governments provide the same kind of backstop they offer for floods or terror attacks in some countries.
REMODELLING
Insurers do not want to be caught out again, having failed to predict the extent to which economies around the world would lock up in order to suppress the virus and keep juddering health systems afloat.
""Our modelling does capture infections and mortality,"" said Robert Muir-Wood, chief research officer at risk modelling firm RMS. 
""It didn't capture all the subtlety of how governments respond, driven by the number of vacant ICU (intensive care unit) beds."" RMS is now factoring those in. 
Government responses meant that, surprisingly, claims on trade credit, event cancellation and business interruption insurance were higher than for life insurance, industry sources said, because many of those who died may not have held life insurance due to their age.
""A year ago, on the non-life side we had essentially no pandemic modelling skills,"" said Iwan Stalder, head of accumulation management at insurer Zurich, who has since been engaged in broader scenario modelling for pandemics.
Few have returned to offering pandemic cover for non-life policies, except where events have been scheduled long in advance and insurance bought years ago, such as the Olympics. 
Cancellation of the Olympics would result in a ""mind-blowingly"" large loss of $2-3 billion, insurance sources say. 
Instead, insurers have asked governments for help.
Britain, the European Union and the United States are all looking at arrangements in which cover from commercial insurers would be backed by government reinsurance schemes. Such schemes could be less costly than business bailouts but the process of developing them is slow, as governments grapple with the problems at hand.
CREATIVE SOLUTIONS
Some say commercial insurers are capable of doing more.
""The private market has the ability to create solutions,"" said Rod Fox, CEO of broker TigerRisk Partners, which helped SpottedRisk find underwriters for its film and TV policy.
Another way to cover COVID-19 could be to repackage pandemic risk as debt through so-called insurance-linked securities (ILS), sharing that risk with investors such as pension funds. 
""It became clear to us early in the pandemic that the models which were appropriate prior to Covid were no longer appropriate,"" said Scott Mitchell, portfolio manager for life ILS at fund manager  Schroders  (LON:SDR).
""Covid-specific aspects simply weren’t captured...the characteristics of the disease and the response by governments, and political factors that were involved in that.”
Schroders has developed new types of life ILS which take account of factors beyond mortality rates.
Insurers are also working on so-called parametric policies. These automatically pay out a specified amount when a certain trigger is reached, such as a government shutdown.
""If you put a boundary around it, you can price the risk,"" said Greg Medcraft, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s director for financial and enterprise affairs.
""For low probability, high impact events like climate change, cyber, pandemics - you have to have a new way of thinking.""
While pandemics as a whole are hard to cover, some insurers have managed to slice out small parts of the risk, for instance providing travel insurance for short periods, or extra medical insurance for coronavirus patients after they leave hospital.
But policyholders may have to accept more expense in future.
Businesses will likely need to show insurers they are minimising their risks, for instance by requiring a negative COVID-19 test for spectators at live events, said Paula Jarzabkowski, professor of strategic management at City University of London.

And to enable insurers to bring in enough premium to cover pandemic risk, businesses interruption insurance may need to be mandatory, like motor insurance, she added.
""That does ensure that everybody who is prone to the possible risk takes some level of responsibility towards it.""

918,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2021 12:06AM ET</span>",Chip shortage in focus as Japan automakers ready to report profit drop,"TOKYO (Reuters) - While Japan's biggest automakers report what analysts expect to be depressed earnings this week, investors looking for trading cues will be tuned into any assessment of the future impact of a global chip shortage that has forced a shake-up in production.
Automakers worldwide have had to adjust or suspend production in the past few months as factors including a surge in demand for electronic devices plus U.S. sanctions against Chinese technology firms led to a dearth of semiconductors.
Blackouts in Texas where a number of chipmakers have factories and a fire at Renesas Electronics Corp's chip plant in Japan have exacerbated the supply crunch.
""The big question will be by how much automakers reduce earnings forecasts due to the slowdown in production and, consequently, lower sales,"" said analyst Julie Boote at Pelham Smithers Associates.
""What should be an otherwise strong (post-pandemic) recovery year could be somewhat dampened by the supply predicament.""
Still, tighter supplies yet robust auto demand is pushing up vehicle prices, particularly in the United States, providing a buffer to automakers' earnings, analysts said.
For the year ended March 31,  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp - the world's largest automaker by vehicle sales last year - is set to report a 12.5% drop in operating profit at 2.1 trillion yen ($19.30 billion), showed Refinitiv SmartEstimate based on 24 analyst estimates.
Profit is likely to rebound to 2.6 trillion yen in the current fiscal year started April 1, Refinitiv SmartEstimate showed.
While many global rivals were forced to slash production due to the chip shortage, Toyota has so far been largely unscathed, likely due to its chip stockpiling policy, analysts said.
Honda Motor Co Ltd will likely report an 11% fall in profit at 560 billion yen, while Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co Ltd is set to report a loss of 142 billion yen, widening from a 40.5 billion yen loss a year prior, Refinitiv SmartEstimate showed.
Honda's profit is likely to reach 791 billion yen in the current business year, and Nissan is likely to swing to a profit of 141 billion yen, according to Refinitiv SmartEstimate.

Nissan is scheduled to report earnings on Tuesday, followed by Toyota on Wednesday and Honda on Friday.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were up Monday morning over mounting expectations that interest rates will remain low, thanks to inflationary pressure. Meanwhile, a cyber-attack on a U.S. pipeline operator caused oil and gas prices to jump.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained 0.80% by 10:49 PM ET (2:49 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI jumped 1.37%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 rose 1.02%. Data released earlier in the day said that the National Australia Bank (NAB) Business Confidence Index rose to a better-than-expected 26 in April, but retail sales grew 1.3% month-on-month in March, slightly below expectations. Meanwhile, a lockdown in Sydney to curb the latest COVID-19 outbreak was extended until May 17.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.59%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.25% and the Shenzhen Component edged up 0.11% ahead of Chinese inflation data due on Tuesday.
Treasury yields edged up to about 1.60% ahead of a busy week of auctions.
Colonial Pipeline was forced to shut down on Friday following a ransomware attack, and still does not have a timetable for a re-start. Investors now look to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)’s monthly Oil Market Report, which will be published on Tuesday.
Investors are also awaiting U.S. inflation data, including the Core Consumer Price Index, due later in the week. Investors are also looking to speeches by a slew of U.S. Federal Reserve officials during the week for clues about the central bank’s next step.
Chicago Fed President Charles Evans will speak on the economic outlook later in the day and U.S. Fed Governor Lael Brainard on Tuesday.
“At the moment the view is very much that inflation is transitory... the Fed having experimented for the last ten years is trying to keep on running it hot, but at the end of the day the disinflationary forces are still very strong in the economy,”  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) Global Markets head of Asia trading strategy Mo Apabhai told Bloomberg.
Across the Atlantic, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey is due to speak on Wednesday.
On the data front, Friday’s U.S. employment report for April also disappointed, with non-farm payrolls only rising by 266,000 during the month, well below the 978,000-rise in forecasts prepared by Investing.com. April’s unemployment rate was also a higher-than-expected 6.1%.
The data suggests that the Fed will continue to stick to its dovish stance, with U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen saying that the report “underscores the long-haul climb back to recovery.” However, Yellen reiterated that she expects a return to full employment in 2022.
""It certainly pushes back the timetable for Fed tapering, perhaps to December from the prior expectations of the Jackson Hole Symposium in late August... a softer payrolls is good for the reflation trade,"" Pepperstone head of research Chris Weston said in a note."

The companies involved have been told that their applications will be granted, port spokesman Sjaak Poppe told Reuters, confirming an earlier report by Dutch public broadcaster NOS.
This clears the most important hurdle for the project, which is set to become operational in 2024 and is expected to reduce emissions in the industrial cluster surrounding Europe's largest sea port by around 10%.
Economy ministry spokesman Dion Huidekooper declined to comment on the reports on Sunday evening.
Details of the subsidies would be made public after decisions had been taken on all applications for this year, he said, which was expected to happen later this month. 
The government has said it will grant a total of 5 billion euros in subsidies in 2021 for technologies that will help it achieve its climate goals.
It received applications for a total sum of 6.4 billion euros. 
The CCS subsidies are meant to compensate the companies for the extra costs of capturing the greenhouse gasses instead of emitting them, while the port will provide the necessary infrastructure to transport the carbon dioxide to the empty offshore gas fields.
Home to many large industries and Europe's main seaport, the Netherlands is among the countries with the highest emissions of greenhouse gasses per capita in Europe.

It aims to lower emissions by 55% relative to 1990 levels by 2030. Emissions were down 24.5% from 1990 levels last year.

""SpaceX launching satellite Doge-1 to the moon next year – Mission paid for in Doge – 1st crypto in space – 1st meme in space"", Musk said in a tweet https:// Geometric Energy Corporation announced the dogecoin-funded mission earlier on Sunday, with the statement not disclosing the mission's financial value.  ""This mission will demonstrate the application of cryptocurrency beyond Earth orbit and set the foundation for interplanetary commerce"", SpaceX Vice President of Commercial Sales Tom Ochinero was quoted as saying in the statement released by Geometric Energy. Musk said on Twitter in April that SpaceX was going to put a ""literal Dogecoin on the literal moon"". Dogecoin lost more than a third of its price on Sunday, after Musk called it a 'hustle' during his guest-host spot on the ""Saturday Night Live"" comedy sketch TV show. Musk's tweets this year turned the once-obscure digital currency, which began as a social media joke, into a speculator's dream. 
On crypto data tracker CoinGecko.com, dogecoin has jumped more than 800% over the last month and is now the fourth-largest digital currency, with a market capitalization of $73 billion. It hit a record high Thursday above $0.73. Electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, where Musk is CEO, said in February it bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin and would soon accept it as a form of payment for its electric cars, a large stride toward mainstream acceptance that sent bitcoin soaring to a record high of nearly $62,000.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Ford Motor Co is recalling 661,000 Explorer sport utility vehicles in North America at the request of U.S. regulators because retention pins could loosen and allow roof rail covers to detach from the vehicle.
The recall covers 2016 through 2019 model year vehicles. Dealers will install push-pins and replace any damaged rail clips and roof rail covers.
The second-largest U.S. automaker said in documents https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2021/RMISC-21V316-0418.pdf posted Sunday that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration first inquired about the issue in early 2020 following 11 reports of roof rail cover detachment. In April, it requested Ford issue a recall, which the carmaker had initially said was not necessary because the low likelihood of a roof rail detaching, its small weight and the fact drivers would likely detect a loose roof rail cover, according to the documents.
Ford in November said it would extend its warranty to cover the issue for 10 years or 150,000 miles before agreeing to the recall on April 30.
A Ford spokeswoman said Sunday the automaker is not aware of any accidents or injuries related to this condition.

The vehicles covered by the recall have roof rail covers that are painted silver, black or absolute black. Customer notifications will begin the week of June 28.
The recall includes 620,483 vehicles in the United States, 36,419 in Canada and 4,260 in Mexico.

924,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2021 12:40PM ET</span>","Musk boosts his brand, and NBCUniversal's, on 'Saturday Night Live'","By Joseph White
DETROIT (Reuters) - Billionaire Elon Musk dropped a surprise early in his hotly anticipated turn as host of ""Saturday Night Live,"" saying in his monologue that he ""is the first person with Asperger's"" to host the show, before clowning through skits for the first global livestream of the NBCUniversal comedy show.
Musk, one of the world's richest individuals, opened his monologue by telling an audience in more than 100 countries he is ""the first person with Asperger's to host SNL. At least the first to admit it."" The billionaire made light of his tendency to speak in a monotone, adding ""I'm pretty good at running human in emulation mode.""
Asperger syndrome is a condition on the autism spectrum that is associated with difficulty in social interaction, and sometimes is referred to as high functioning autism. 
Comedian and Saturday Night Live alumni Dan Aykroyd has spoken in interviews about being diagnosed with a mild form of Asperger's. He hosted Saturday Night Live in 2003.
Many had wondered how Musk would handle himself during a live comedy show. The answer was that he, and the show's writers, sought to soften the rough edges of Musk's public persona. Throughout the show, Musk gently poked fun at himself, including his penchant for provocative tweets and the time he smoked a joint on a podcast.
""To anyone I’ve offended I just want to say, I reinvented electric cars and I'm sending people to Mars on a rocket ship. Did you think I would be a chill, normal dude?""
Musk's mother, Maye, joined him on stage and the two made a joke about Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency Musk has touted. Cryptocurrency jokes popped up throughout the show. In one sketch, Musk was cast as a bow-tie wearing cryptocurrency expert on the show's Weekend Update segment. Dogecoin and other digital currencies had surged in price ahead of Musk's SNL appearance.
Dogecoin fell during the show and was last down about 12% from late Friday at around $0.53. It hit a record high Thursday above $0.73.
Musk was most convincing playing a version of himself as head of SpaceX dealing with an emergency on a Martian colony. The crisis had a happy ending, until it didn't.
In the end, Musk will keep his day jobs. Still, the ""Saturday Night Live"" appearance offered plenty of synergies with his real gigs as ""technoking"" and Chief Executive of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, head of rocket launch company SpaceX and even chief of the Boring Company, a tunnel construction venture. 
Musk got days of attention across all forms of media ahead of the show, and shared the spotlight with a prototype of Tesla's futuristic Cybertruck that Tesla brought to Manhattan on Friday. Video of the hulking, angular pickup prowling Manhattan streets blew up on social media. 
During the show, a Tesla supercharger made an incongruous cameo appearance in a skit set in an old West saloon. Musk played a gunslinger who had developed an electric horse, and advocated tunneling through the earth to escape a shootout. 
Musk often boasts that Tesla doesn't spend billions on advertising the way established automakers do. He doesn't have to so long as he has access to platforms like Twitter or ""Saturday Night Live."" 

Musk's appearance also boosted NBCUniversal. The media company used Musk's global celebrity - and the controversy surrounding his appearance on a stage normally reserved for film stars or professional comedians - to get attention for launching the ""Saturday Night Live"" franchise beyond the confines of broadcast television. The company said Saturday's show was streamed live via Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's YouTube to more than 100 countries.

The app, which spiked in popularity early this year after celebrity billionaire Elon Musk and others appeared in audio chats, has sparked copy cats from startups and larger rivals including  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR). 
It has been available only to users of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) devices and by invitation. In some markets such as China, invitations were so sought after some were auctioned on online marketplaces.
But downloads of the app, one measure of popularity, have significantly fallen. 
After peaking in February with 9.6 million downloads, that number fell to 2.7 million in March and then 900,000 downloads in April, according to Sensor Tower. 
The drop has sparked questions about its long term viability and whether its success was owed in part to people spending more time at home during the pandemic.
The long anticipated Android launch is expected to reach more new users globally. The Android version will reach other English-speaking markets and then the rest of the globe days and weeks after the U.S. market beta launch.

Clubhouse, which created the category, now faces the likes of Facebook, whose CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced in April a slew of audio products, including Clubhouse-style live audio rooms and a way for users to find and play podcasts.
In January, Twitter Inc said that it will introduce a new feature to let users charge admission to their live audio chat rooms in its ""Spaces"" feature, as the company seeks to court more content creators. It has been available to Android users since March.

(Reuters) - The Biden administration is examining ways to ensure that a waiver of COVID-19 vaccine patents to aid poor countries will not hand sensitive U.S. biopharmaceutical technology to China and Russia, responding to a chorus of concerns, U.S. and industry officials say.
President Joe Biden on Wednesday backed the U.S. entering negotiations at the World Trade Organization for the waiver of intellectual property rights as a means to boost vaccine supplies by allowing poorer countries to make their own.
So far, vaccines have gone overwhelmingly to richer nations, which scooped up contracts for them earlier this year. [L1N2KP178] COVID-19 infection rates in wealthy countries have dropped as vaccination rates increased this year, but infections are still rising in 36 countries, with India's daily cases skyrocketing to nearly 400,000 a day.
Western pharmaceutical companies, many of which have received government support to develop vaccines, strongly oppose the transfer of intellectual property to make them. They say poorer countries will be slow to set up manufacturing capacity and compete for scarce supplies, hitting production.
Albert Bourla, CEO of  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE), said https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/today-i-sent-letter-have-candid-conversation-our-drivers-bourla/?trackingId=p8C%2Fu3lALltT9tyeCAaSzA%3D%3D on Friday that the proposed waiver would disrupt progress made so far in boosting vaccine supplies. ""It will unleash a scramble for the critical inputs we require in order to make a safe and effective vaccine. Entities with little or no experience in manufacturing vaccines are likely to chase the very raw materials we require to scale our production, putting the safety and security of all at risk."" 
Many companies and now some U.S. officials fear the move would allow China to leapfrog years of research and erode the U.S. advantage in biopharmaceuticals.
A senior Biden administration official said that while the priority is saving lives, the United States ""would want to examine the effect of a waiver on China and Russia before it went into effect to ensure that it's fit for purpose.""
A question and answer document produced by the administration and shared with industry representatives also acknowledges concerns that intellectual property sharing could damage the United State's competitive advantage over China, an industry source familiar with the discussions told Reuters.
The contents of the document read to a Reuters reporter by an industry representative said the Biden administration believes it can address those concerns through the WTO negotiations, but did not specify how. The source added that some agencies in the Biden administration have conflicting views of how to address the concerns in negotiations that are expected to take months.
Spokespersons at the White House and U.S. Trade Representative's office had no immediate comment on the matter.
Pfizer and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) spokespersons did not respond to requests for comment on technology transfer concerns, while a  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) spokesperson referred Reuters to the company's statement https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-statement-opposition-wto-trips-waiver opposing the waiver on Friday, which said proposals to ""weaken intellectual property protections would not achieve equitable vaccine access.""
Enforcing limits on use of the technology could be very difficult, once handed over, some analysts say. Messenger RNA, used in COVID-19 vaccines by leaders Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, is a newly developed biotechnology that holds promise for treatments far beyond vaccines. 
China and Russia have their own vaccines that do not use this biotechnology. 
""It took Pfizer and Moderna years and years of research to develop these vaccines,"" said Gary Locke a former U.S. ambassador to China and U.S. Commerce Secretary. ""China, Russia, India, South Africa and others want to gain access. Their intention is to get the underlying know-how so they can use it to develop further vaccines,"" Locke said. 
China's Fosun Pharma has struck a deal with BioNTech on COVID-19 vaccine product development, which would potentially give it access to some of the technology.
China has high ambitions for its pharma industry and already is developing its own mRNA vaccine.
Patents themselves are publicly accessible, noted James Pooley, intellectual property attorney and former deputy director general of the United Nations' World Intellectual Property Organization. But trade secrets developed by Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and others, ""cook books"" of manufacturing processes such as temperature and growing conditions, have not been made public. That may ultimately be a dual problem for negotiators. Before they protect the knowledge, U.S. officials would have to ensure access to it.

Those companies would need to be persuaded to come to the bargaining table to give up such trade secrets. 
""What happens when it turns out that the U.S. can’t actually deliver the information that is critically important to implementing the inventions?"" Pooley asked. ""This will be seen as another failure by the U.S. and other rich countries to keep their promises.""

Mexico's plan to phase out weed-killer glyphosate amid concerns the pesticide causes cancer has seen it clash with Bayer and the U.S. government, which is opposing the ban.
Bayer, the German pharmaceutical and crop science company that acquired  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) in 2018, is one of the world's leading makers of glyphosate as part of its Roundup brand weed-killer.
Last month, a Mexican court gave Bayer a temporary relief from a looming ban on the widely used herbicide.
Mexico's Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources on Friday in a statement said the Collegiate Court, in a decision dated May 3, had ""revoked"" the provisional suspension. 
Bayer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador issued a decree late last year that seeks to ban the herbicide completely by 2024, joining several other governments that have sought to restrict its use, including Germany. He has described the chemical as toxic.
Bayer has defended the safety record of glyphosate.

931,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2021 07:14PM ET</span>","Analysis: Fund managers see value, cyclical stocks running further despite slow U.S. jobs recovery","By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - While some technology stocks got a boost Friday after a disappointing U.S. jobs report, some portfolio managers say that blow-out earnings from several large technology companies over the last few weeks are not enough to keep making outsized bets on the sector. 
Instead, those fund managers say that they are continuing to rotate into value and cyclical stocks - whose fortunes are closely tied to economic conditions - in anticipation that the economic recovery will be longer and more gradual than originally anticipated. 
The notion that the U.S. jobs recovery has not yet peaked was reinforced by data from the Labor Department on Friday that showed U.S. employers hired far fewer workers than anticipated. The lower-than-expected job gains are likely to keep the Federal Reserve's accommodative measures in place for an extended period, economists said. 
The transition between the stay-at-home economy and a full reopening will likely take at least a year, leaving value stocks more attractive than technology shares over that time, said Barry James, a portfolio manager at James Investment Research, who remains underweight in technology.
""In the short run, it may bounce back and forth but we think we are in for at least another year or more of this transition,"" he said.
Large technology stocks rallied Friday after the jobs report tampered concerns about inflation and pushed the yield of the 10-year Treasury near a 2-month low, but the direction of the economy regains intact and should continue to favor cyclical stocks over defensive stocks, said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute.
""We would not read too much into any one jobs report, and continue to think the labor market remains on track and will be more than enough to underpin consumer confidence and consumption,"" he said. 
Despite Friday's gains, large-cap technology companies continue to lag the broad market. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is down nearly 2% for the year-to-date, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is up less than 2%, and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) is down 6.5%. Overall, the technology sector is up 6.8% for the year-to-date, about half of the 12.6% gain in the broad S&P 500. 
Instead, value companies in such cyclical areas such as financials, energy, and consumer discretionary are surging. The Russell 1000 Value index is up 18% for the year to date, including a 0.7% gain Friday, while the Russell 1000 Growth index is up 6.3%, and gained 0.6% Friday. 
""You had some people saying, that is as good as it gets across the board. Peak momentum, peak growth, peak earnings, but the market is misperceiving the backdrop here. You are going to end up with robust levels of growth for the remainder of this year,"" said Jack Janasiewicz, portfolio strategist and portfolio manager at Natixis Advisors. 
Funds that have remained heavy in growth stocks jumped Friday, with the ARK Innovation ETF adding 1.4% by mid-afternoon. Yet the fund remains down more than 10% for the year. 
At the same time, the stretched valuation of large technology companies makes them less attractive than cyclical stocks that will most likely see the greatest economic boost over the next year, said George Young, a portfolio manager at Villere & Co. 
The S&P 500 technology sector, for example, trades at 33.8 times trailing earnings, more than double that of the S&P 500 financial sector, which trades at 16.2 times trailing earnings. 

Young has been adding to his position in cyclical companies like casino company Caesars (NASDAQ:CZR) Entertainment Inc, a position he called ""the opposite of the stay-at-home trade.""
""People are turning the corner and saying 'We can see the light at the end of the tunnel and we don't have to say at home anymore,' so investors are looking for what's the next thing,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Dow and S&P 500 hit record closing highs on Friday while registering gains for the week, and the Nasdaq recovered after U.S. jobs data eased concerns over prospects for rising rates.
U.S. job growth unexpectedly slowed in April, likely restrained by shortages of workers, the Labor Department report showed.
The report alleviated some concerns about rising inflation and potentially higher U.S. interest rates, which some investors worry would hurt growth companies with high valuations.
""Growth names that were taken to the woodshed are getting another chance, because they will be perceived to be less risky in an environment where there is a slower recovery, and that's really what the jobs data is indicating"", said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments.

But gains were broad-based, with all major S&P 500 sectors ending in the green and energy and real estate leading the advance. Energy and materials both hit fresh highs. 
The Dow rose 229.23 points, or 0.66%, to 34,777.76, the S&P 500 gained 30.98 points, or 0.74%, to 4,232.6 and the Nasdaq Composite added 119.40 points, or 0.88%, to 13,752.24.
For the week, the Dow rose 2.7%, its biggest weekly percentage gain since March. The S&P 500 gained 1.2%, its best week since mid-April, while the Nasdaq shed 1.5%.
""The anticipation and confirmation of (Federal Reserve) policy staying the same and continued economic recovery with vaccines rollout have fueled these all-time highs, but we do believe the volatility is going to be tightened in the short term,"" said Greg Bassuk, chief executive at Axs Investments.
A raft of upbeat earnings also helped stocks, and S&P 500 earnings are now estimated to have increased 50.4% in the first quarter from a year ago, which would be the highest growth rate since the first quarter of 2010, according to Refinitiv data. 
Payments firm  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ) rose 4.2% after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit, as surging demand for bitcoin fueled a jump in cryptocurrency transactions on its application.
Streaming device maker  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) Inc jumped 11.5%following an upbeat revenue outlook, while fitness equipment maker Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) Inc gained as it laid out steps to improve the safety of its equipment.
 Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE) Group Inc shares rose 5.2% as analysts raised price targets following the company's upbeat results. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.27-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.12-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 164 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 164 new highs and 64 new lows.

When investors learned of the efficacy of the coronavirus vaccines at the end of the year, a rotation out of growth stocks took place in the market, as a rapidly improving economy benefits more cyclical and value names.
But it appears growth stocks are back in favor as the SPGY gained 6.8% last month. The value trade is taking a breather as improving economic conditions look already priced in. With many of the top growth stocks seeing their shares pullback in the winter, now is a great time to invest in growth at a lower valuation. This way, we get the best of both worlds.
So, I ran a screen for top undervalued growth stocks in our POWR Rating system for Buy-rated stocks with a Growth Grade of A or B and a Value Grade of A or B. This makes sure we see the best growth stocks at low valuations, and why I am recommending investors consider Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), Dell Technologies Inc (DELL), Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A), and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc. (NYSE:GS) for the second quarter.

When combined with qualitative and fundamental research, we can find great stocks poised to move higher in the months ahead. That's why David Cohne is recommending Starbucks (SBUX), Sherwin-Williams (SHW), and  Stryker  (SYK).One of the many benefits of our proprietary POWR Ratings system is the upgrades page. This page shows us which companies are improving from a growth and quality standpoint. This is reflected in higher grades in our ratings system. While we recommend investors only buy stocks that are rated a Buy or Strong Buy, picking up a recently upgraded Buy stock allows investors to get ahead of the game.
Many stocks get upgraded daily, which is why it's important to focus on stocks with the best prospects. That's why I like to take a qualitative approach to find catalysts that will drive shares up. One feature that I'm particularly keen on is a company that is a leader in its industry. These types of companies are typically one of, if not the largest, and most recognized brands in their space.
So, I ran a screen to find recently Buy-rated upgraded stocks that were leaders in their industry and offered the potential for growth in the months ahead, and these three top stocks were leading the pack: Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW), and Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK).

CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Airlines said on Friday it is temporarily pausing service between Chicago and New Delhi in June and delaying the planned launch of flights between San Francisco and Bangalore as a catastrophic explosion of COVID-19 cases hits demand.
India reported another record daily rise in coronavirus infections on Friday, bringing total new cases for the week to 1.57 million, as its vaccination rate falls dramatically due to a lack of supplies and transport problems.
Until the Chicago-Delhi route is halted on May 31, United said will use its larger Boeing (NYSE:BA) 777-300ER jets on seven roundtrip flights to accelerate the repatriation of citizens between the two countries and the delivery of vital medical supplies. It was previously using the Boeing 787-9.
United, the only U.S. carrier flying to India, said it will continue its daily flights to Delhi from Newark and San Francisco and to Mumbai from Newark.
However, it will ""continue to monitor customer demand to determine if any additional changes to its schedule are necessary,"" it said.

As of now it expects to resume the Chicago-Delhi flights, which it launched in December, in July and kick off its San Francisco-Bangalore service on August 1 versus previous plans for a May 27 launch. 
Rival American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) plans to launch flights from Seattle to Bangalore, known as the Silicon Valley of India, later this year.

In separate announcements earlier on Friday, China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) Ltd; China Unicom (NYSE:CHU) and China Telecom (NYSE:CHA) Corp said they expect the NYSE to notify regulators of their delistings after the companies unsuccessfully appealed the move.
A NYSE spokesman declined to comment. 

The delistings stem from investment restrictions put in place by former U.S. President Donald Trump targeting Chinese technology firms. President Joe Biden has left the rules in place amid continuing tensions between the world's two largest economies, despite objections from businesses.
The companies said their delistings will be effective 10 days after the exchange files a Form 25 to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Authentic and SPARC Group LLC, a venture backed by brand manager Authentic and Simon, are buying Eddie Bauer from a unit of Golden Gate Capital 12 years after the private equity firm acquired the outdoor lifestyle gear maker out of bankruptcy.
The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. 
Authentic Brands said it will own the clothing brand's intellectual property and Eddie Bauer will become a part of SPARC's portfolio of brands following the deal's expected close by June.
Eddie Bauer has 300 stores across the United States and Canada, but nearly half of its retail sales last year came through e-commerce as COVID-19 accelerated a shift to online shopping.
""The global outdoor market opportunity has grown exponentially over the last year and we are ready to hit the ground running,"" said Authentic Brands Chief Executive Officer Jamie Salter. 

Eddie Bauer is expected to diversify ABG's portfolio of brands which include entertainment, media and fashion.

CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) -TC Energy Corp swung to a loss in the first quarter, hit by C$2.2 billion ($1.81 billion) impairment charges related to the suspension of its Keystone XL project, the Canadian pipeline operator said on Friday.
The KXL pipeline was planned to carry 830,000 barrels per day of heavy crude across the border from Alberta to Nebraska, but U.S. President Joe Biden revoked a key permit for the project on his first day in office.
TC Energy (NYSE:TRP) said the impairment charge was related to halting work on KXL and a reassessment of related projects like the Heartland Pipeline.
""We were very disappointed with the decision in January to revoke the presidential permit,"" Chief Executive Francois Poirier said on an earnings call, adding the company was ""opportunity-rich"" in other parts of its business.
Calgary-based TC Energy owns the largest network of natural gas pipelines in North America as well as the existing Keystone oil pipeline and power and storage assets.
The company posted a C$2.51 billion loss from its oil pipelines, of which Keystone is the biggest contributor, compared with a C$411 million profit in the same period last year.
It reported net loss attributable to shareholders of C$1.1 billion, or C$1.11 per share, in the three months ended March 31 compared with a profit of C$1.1 billion a year earlier.
Excluding items, the company earned C$1.16 per share, slightly better than analysts' average estimate of C$1.10, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

TC Energy shares closed up 0.2% on the Toronto Stock Exchange at C$61.94.

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Commodity prices jumped, the dollar slid to a two-month low and major global equity indexes scaled record peaks on Friday after weak U.S. jobs data for April tamped down fears that a booming economy would spark inflation and higher interest rates.
The data eased worries the Federal Reserve would reduce its massive stimulus program anytime soon and was seen as helping President Joe Biden push through his plans for trillions of dollars in new spending on infrastructure and education.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note slid to a two-month low of 1.469% before rebounding. Gold posted its biggest weekly gain - about 3.5% - since early November and copper shot to a new high, past a record set a decade ago.
Nonfarm payrolls increased by only 266,000 jobs last month.Data for March was revised down to show 770,000 jobs addedinstead of 916,000 as previously reported. Economists polled byReuters had forecast payrolls would advance by 978,000 jobs. 
A slower hiring pace doused fears a U.S. economy poised to roar on pent-up consumer demand would spur inflation and force interest rates higher. 
""Anybody who thought the Fed is going to be tapering sooner than later, that's not happening,"" said Joseph LaVorgna, chief economist for the Americas at Natixis in New York. 
""There is no inflation coming on the labor side. The economy is booming, and the labor market recovery is still ongoing.""

The German DAX rose 1.3%, inching closer to its lifetime high, while France's CAC 40 ended at its highest level since November 2000 and the UK's FTSE 100 breached the 7,100 mark for the first time since February 2020.

For the week, the Dow rose 2.65%, the S&P500 1.23% and the Nasdaq slipped 1.51%.
The tech-rich Nasdaq, which has struggled recently after leading the rally in equities since last year, rose more than the Dow and S&P 500, as low rates benefit high-growth firms.
""In this type of environment, where growth is slightly slower than anticipated in the short term, (tech stocks) can start to get bid over the summer when they had been left for dead,"" said Thomas Hayes, chairman and managing member at hedge fund Great Hill Capital LLC.

""The market expectation of super-high rates and a squeeze on inflation is going to go down by the wayside, and that obviously means more liquidity from the Fed,"" said Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management. 
""U.S. interest rates will stay at ultra-low levels for quite a while and that is going to keep the pressure on the dollar.""

Higher-rated euro zone bond yields dipped after the U.S. employment data missed expectations. Euro area benchmark German 10-year yields reversed earlier gains and were trading flat at -0.218%.
The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rebounded after an initial plunge, up 1.3 basis points at 1.5735%.

However, now that the economy is reopening on the back of accelerating vaccine rollouts, online platforms are seeing reduced traffic. This, along with investors’ rotation away from pandemic winners and toward cyclical stocks, could drive a further retreat by the weaker e-commerce players. As such, analysts have recently downgraded eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY) because their near-term prospects look bleak. Let’s take a closer look.E-commerce platforms got a big boost from the COVID-19 pandemic. The public health crisis triggered the rapid digitization of commerce and trade. Nationwide shutdowns forced people to stay home and rely on online platforms for their shopping needs. 
However, rapid progress on the vaccination front around the globe has led to much subdued performance by the online commerce sector so far this year. There are also rising fears of a post-pandemic slowdown of the e-commerce industry.
This, combined with investors’ rotation to cyclical stocks amid the economic recovery, could drive a greater pullback by fundamentally weak e-commerce stocks. Analysts have recently downgraded eBay Inc. (EBAY) and Etsy, Inc. (ETSY) given their bleak growth prospects. So, we think it could be wise to avoid these stocks now.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada is ready to discuss an intellectual property rights (IP) waiver for COVID-19 vaccines and will not block one even though it stresses the importance of protecting patents, officials said on Friday.
U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday threw his support behind waiving IP rights for COVID-19 vaccines. Any such waiver would have to be negotiated through the World Trade Organization (WTO).
""We've been working with partners at the WTO to find a consensus-based solution and are ready to discuss proposals, in particular for COVID-19 vaccines,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters.
Biden's proposal angered pharmaceutical companies. Firms working on vaccines have reported sharp revenue and profit gains during the crisis. 
Canadian International Trade Minister Mary Ng earlier said that Ottawa firmly believed in the importance of protecting IP.
""I can assure you Canada is not interfering or blocking. Canada is very much working to find a solution,"" said Trudeau, who did not give details of the Canadian negotiating stance.
Ng said Ottawa recognized how much the pharmaceutical industry had done to innovate COVID-19 vaccines, adding that many barriers to access were unrelated to IP, such as supply-chain constraints.
Canada is trying to quell a third wave of the coronavirus pandemic that is pushing some healthcare systems to breaking points, particularly in the western provinces of Alberta and Manitoba.
Manitoba officials said they were postponing some non-urgent surgeries to open space for COVID-19 patients and planned to announce tougher public health restrictions as daily cases soared to a near-record high.
The U.S. state of Montana will offer vaccines to around 2,000 Alberta truckers who regularly cross the border, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney said.

Truckers will get vaccinated at a post being set up just south of the border, using Montana's surplus Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) vaccines. 
The scheme mirrors an agreement that Saskatchewan and Manitoba reached with North Dakota.

Speaking for the union, Richard Rouco opposed giving a witness list in advance. ""Protecting and guarding the identity of witnesses, employee witnesses in particular, until the moment that they're prepared to testify is something that's very important,"" he said. 
Hearing officer Kerstin Meyers denied Amazon's request but indicated that she would accept a briefing on the matter. The hearing is expected to continue at least another week.

So, we think it is wise to avoid Enphase (ENPH) and First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) because they reported weak financials in the last quarter and are expected to experience a further decline.Because governments across the world have been taking steps to transition their countries to a renewable energy driven future, it’s no surprise that solar energy stocks have been at the forefront of the revolution given declining storage costs. However, the industry has been witnessing a sell-off lately as investors ponder whether the Federal Reserve will increase benchmark interest rates. Given solar projects’ large upfront costs, the industry is very dependent on debt financing. So, rising interest rates usually negatively affect solar companies. Furthermore, the solar industry is facing supply chain constraints and witnessing higher shipping costs.
Investors’ pessimism over the industry’s near-term prospects is evident in the Invesco Solar ETF’s (TAN) 16.6% loss over the past month compared to SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust’s (SPY) 3.2% gains.
Amid this environment, we think it is wise to avoid solar stocks Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) and First Solar, Inc. (FSLR). These companies reported weak financials in their last quarterly releases and analysts expect their financials to weaken further.

(Reuters) -U.S. auto parts suppliers warned of more production cuts at major automakers as a global semiconductor chip shortage worsens before easing in the second half of the year and aiding in a partial recovery of lost sales.
The chip shortage came at an inopportune time for automakers as demand rebounded from pandemic lows due to low interest rates and consumers' preference for personal transport amid the health crisis.
""We've embedded a 3% reduction in industry production to factor in what we're anticipating and expecting as further announced downtime that hasn't been publicly announced at this point,""  Lear  (NYSE:LEA) Corp Chief Financial Officer Jason Cardew said on Friday. 
""We have line of sight on a more meaningful reduction (in production) in the second quarter than IHS Markit and others are projecting,"" Cardew said.
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, a major customer for Lear and peers including BorgWarner (NYSE:BWA) and  Magna International  (NYSE:MGA), has said the chip shortage would halve its vehicle output in the second quarter.
Europe's Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), another customer for the three suppliers, has said it is in ""crisis mode"" over the lack of badly needed automotive chips, with the shortage intensifying and hitting its profits in the second quarter.
Lear, which makes automotive seating, cut its global vehicle production forecast to a 9% rise, from up to 12% it had predicted at the beginning of the year, while also expecting second-quarter revenue to fall 9% from the first.
Auto suppliers also cautioned that the pain from the shortage could linger at least until the next year.
""We don't expect the supply/demand imbalance to fully recover to normalized levels until 2022,"" said Joseph Massaro, chief financial officer of Aptiv (NYSE:APTV), a maker of advanced driver assistance systems, vehicle computers and high-voltage cabling.
Auto suppliers are also grappling with pressure on their margins from rising costs of key inputs such as steel and copper. 
However, many expect to offset some of those costs as automaker customers focus on building higher margin, more profitable pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles.
""On the biggest raw material purchases, we have about 60% pass through with our customers,"" BorgWarner Chief Executive Officer Frederic Lissalde said.
Still, most suppliers have raised or reaffirmed their full-year financial outlooks, thanks to the better-than-expected performance in the first quarter. 

Analysts highlighted risks associated with the production outlooks from some suppliers as chip demand rises from other sectors such as enterprise, cloud and consumer electronics following speedy COVID-19 vaccinations and economies reopening.
""The question in my mind is can this (production loss) be made up later on in the year. And that's really an unknown,"" Magna Chief Financial Officer Vincent Galifi said.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Elon Musk's turn as host of this week's ""Saturday Night Live"" television program will be a light-hearted, brand-building break from the pressures of running Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and SpaceX - or land the billionaire in another bucket of hot water.
That uncertainty appears to be the point for both Musk and NBCUniversal's (O:CMCSA) venerable comedy sketch show.
Musk has been encouraging fans and detractors to anticipate shenanigans, potentially involving the Dogecoin cryptocurrency. Musk has touted Dogecoin on his Twitter account, and the cryptocurrency's value has soared ahead of his appearance.
""I'm a wild card, no telling what I might do,"" Musk, wearing a black bandana, joked in a brief promotional video for the show alongside Saturday's musical guest, Miley Cyrus.
""Same here,"" Cyrus said. ""Rules? No thanks.""
Musk has been in New York this week preparing for the appearance. A photo posted to the ""Saturday Night Live"" Twitter account on Wednesday showed him hunched over papers, wearing a ""Nuke Mars"" T-shirt. Musk has mused about using nuclear weapons to reshape the Red Planet for human habitation.
Some ""SNL"" cast members have expressed displeasure at the show's decision to give its platform to one of the world's richest people. Musk's appearance has drawn comparisons to the show's controversial decision in 2015 to invite Donald Trump to host as he was preparing for his presidential run. 
Although it is rare for a business executive to host ""SNL,"" South Africa-born Musk, 49, is no stranger to pop culture or comedy. 
He has appeared on ""The Simpsons,"" ""Rick and Morty,"" and ""South Park,"" and dates a pop star, Canadian singer Grimes. Musk's persona helped inspire Robert Downey Jr's portrayal of superhero Iron Man in a series of Marvel films. 
His humor also shows in the names of Tesla car models S, 3, X and Y (""sexy""). He once built and sold flamethrowers to promote his tunnel venture, the Boring Company. In 2018, Musk smoked marijuana on a live web show, and later offered $420 a share - a drug reference - to take Tesla private.

While Musk has been getting ready for the cameras, Tesla has been in a rough patch. 
Longtime major shareholder Baillie Gifford disclosed it had sold 41% of its Tesla shares. Police in California are investigating a fatal accident in which a Tesla crashed into an overturned truck. Documents prepared by California regulators said Tesla executives do not believe Tesla can deliver the ""Full Self Driving"" autonomous vehicle technology this year, contradicting Musk's statements.

PARIS (Reuters) -Airbus delivered 45 jets in April, bringing its total so far this year to 170 - up 25% from the same period of 2020 when airlines were reeling from the first shock of COVID-19.
April deliveries trebled compared to the same period a year earlier, but slipped from 72 in March, company data showed.
U.S. and Chinese domestic markets have seen a surge in travel as vaccinations widen and Britain said on Friday it would cautiously allow international travel to resume.
But a humanitarian crisis in India caused by a surge of coronavirus infections has caused air travel in another key Airbus market to plummet even as some deliveries continue.
Airbus plans to increase production of medium-haul jets from the third quarter, partially restoring cuts sparked by COVID-19.
While deliveries have recovered faster than some experts anticipated, they have not kept pace with Airbus' current production rates of just over 50 aircraft a month, suggesting additions to an end-year surplus of almost 100 undelivered jets.
Airbus may be storing jets in anticipation of higher deliveries this year, Agency Partners analyst Sash Tusa wrote.
An Airbus spokesman noted that it had stated that its deliveries would not be linear, but had kept targets unchanged.
The planemaker also said it had won 48 orders in April - led by a previously reported order for 25 A321neo jets from Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) - and taken 22 new cancellations.
So far this year Airbus has won 87 orders while seeing the net total drop below zero, to minus 35, after cancellations which exceeded the number of new orders.
Detailed April data pointed to a reshuffling of 22 orders within the Avolon leasing group, with the only significant net new order coming from Delta - a deal nonetheless seen as putting pressure on Boeing (NYSE:BA) in a crucial race for large single-aisles.

Airbus also attributed names to a handful of orders, mainly from Chinese airlines, that had previously been unidentified.
Boeing has said it delivered 77 airplanes in the first quarter and won 282 new orders, or 69 after cancellations.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The New York Stock Exchange will allow more traders to return to its 11 Wall Street trading floor, based on vaccination rates, and ease restrictions for people who have had a shot, its President Stacey Cunningham said on Friday.
The NYSE, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) Inc, said trading firms with 100% of their floor staff vaccinated can increase headcount at their booths, and while vaccinated traders still have to socially distance, they can remove their masks when seated. 
""Given the fact that so many more people are vaccinated now, we can start to ease off on some of the restrictions that we've had in place since we reopened,"" Cunningham told CNBC.
The NYSE floor is the last physical U.S. stock trading venue, as a slew of all-electronic competitors have emerged and eaten away at the Big Board's once dominant market share.
Futures exchange operator CME Group Inc (NASDAQ:CME) said on Tuesday it would permanently shutter the physical trading pits it closed last March due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The 144-year-old London Metal Exchange said last month it will announce around June 8 whether it will reopen its open outcry trading ring or permanently shut the only such floor in Europe.
The NYSE closed its trading floor in March 2020 and moved to electronic trading for the first time in 228 years after several traders contracted the coronavirus. 

The exchange reopened the floor, which it also uses for its opening and closing bell ceremonies, to tout initial public offerings, and as a backdrop for several television news programs, in May 2020 with reduced capacity and extra safety measures.
Cunningham said the NYSE floor is currently at around 50% of its pre-COVID capacity.

TOKYO (Reuters) -More than 230,000 people have signed a Japanese petition calling for the Tokyo Olympics to be cancelled in the two days since it was launched online, as public concerns mount over holding the showpiece event during a pandemic.
With 11 weeks to go before the start of the Games, already postponed from 2020 due to the coronavirus, questions remain over how Tokyo can host the global gathering while keeping volunteers, athletes, officials and the Japanese public safe from COVID-19.
Organised by Kenji Utsunomiya, a lawyer who has run several times for Tokyo governor, the ""Stop Tokyo Olympics"" petition https://www.change.org/p/cancel-the-tokyo-olympics-to-protect-our-lives-stoptokyoolympic has gathered more than 230,000 signatures.
""Japanese people tend to not voice our opinions but there are many people now speaking up. Together with voices from overseas, I hope the Olympics will be cancelled for now,"" he told Reuters.
Games organisers and the Japanese government have repeatedly said the event needs to go ahead, in part as a symbol of the world's triumph over the pandemic, and detailed COVID-19 protocols have been unveiled for participants.
But with a fourth wave heaping pressure on Japan's medical system amid a sluggish vaccination rate, Utsunomiya said he had received a call from an exhausted hospital worker on Friday morning, thanking him for pushing back against the Games. 
PUBLIC SCEPTICISM
Opinion polls have found a majority of the Japanese public is opposed to the Games, which are due to open on July 23, and many in Tokyo were on Friday sceptical about whether they should go ahead, and wary about foreign visitors.
""It's absurd that we are holding the Olympics under the COVID pandemic,"" Katsumi Abiko, the 79-year-old owner of a kimono shop, told Reuters.
""If we make the decision now to cancel it, Japan will be praised for making the right decision and be remembered by history.""
The government has extended a state of emergency in the capital and three other areas until the end of May.
Several other Tokyo residents shared Abiko's concerns, including 84-year-old Yoshihiro Nagao, though he believes that, on balance, the Olympics should go ahead.

""It's safer not to do it, but since we've come this far, we all want to work hand in hand and succeed,"" he said.
In that spirit of cooperation,  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and its German partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) said on Thursday they had agreed to donate their vaccine to inoculate participants.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - United Steelworkers union negotiators bargaining for a new contract at an  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) Texas refinery offered a six-year deal with no pay raise in the first year, people familiar with the talks said, shortly before 650 workers were locked out of their jobs.
The Local 13-243 proposal would match raises in the second through sixth years to those set by national labor negotiations that have yet to be held, the people said. The two sides have not swapped new proposals since the May 1 lockout, the people said.
The Beaumont plant's union workers were ushered out after Local 13-243 officials refused Exxon's call for a vote on the company's April 20 labor proposal, details of which have not been disclosed. 
The 2,700-acre Beaumont complex is Exxon's third-largest U.S. refinery and produces gasoline and Mobil 1 motor oil. It continues to operate with managers and replacement workers on site. 
""The provisions being sought by the company are not new or unique to the industry or ExxonMobil. Many provisions sought by the union are not part of other existing contracts we have with the USW,"" said Exxon spokeswoman Julie King. 
The two sides ""remain far apart on many important items,"" she added.
The USW local wants to maintain four 10-hour work days, job bidding, grievance and arbitration procedures. Its proposal offered to extend a probationary period for new workers to 18 months from six, the people said. 
Hoot Landry, a staff representative for the USW, declined to discuss the union proposal. 

Exxon told union negotiators it expected no layoffs of hourly workers at the site, they said. The firm is in the midst of an expansion program that would double the plant's processing capacity. 
The two sides have not met since April 30, but another meeting has been discussed, one of the people said.

Considerations are in very early stages, they said. One of the sources said it was clear the Swiss bank was not interested in selling the unit, at least for the time being. 
In a statement released by the Brazilian operation of Credit Suisse, the Swiss bank ""categorically denied"" it was talking to any group about the matter. XP declined to comment.
A deal could double XP's asset management business. With 109 billion reais ($20.9 billion) under management in Brazil, Credit Suisse is the country's 14th-largest asset manager, according to industry group Anbima. XP has 105 billion reais in its funds.
Shares of XP on the Nasdaq rose more than 5% on the news of the broker's interest, first reported by business news website Brazil Journal.
One of the sources said a potential deal could include both shares and cash.
Credit Suisse is reeling from its exposure to the collapse first of Greensill Capital and then Archegos Capital Management.

By Marcelo Rochabrun
SAO PAULO (Reuters) -Volkswagen AG has finalized a commitment to launch a new investment cycle in Brazil, the continent's top auto producer, its chief executive for South America told Reuters in an interview on Friday. 
""We have defined (the investment) and we already stopped production at our factory in Taubate to prepare the new platform,"" said Pablo Di Si, Volkswagen's CEO for South America. 
Di Si declined to go into specifics such as the size of the investment, which will replace the current investment cycle that was announced in 2016 with a commitment of 7 billion reais ($1.34 billion). 
That cycle was originally scheduled to end last year but the timeline was stretched out when the coronavirus pandemic hit. 
So far this year, Volkswagen has become Brazil's best-selling brand, displacing General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) after many years, in part because GM's production in Brazil has been more disrupted than Volkswagen's by a global chips shortage. 
Di Si said the details of the investment will be disclosed by global CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars Ralf Brandstätter in a trip to Brazil later in the year, although the exact timing depends on how the pandemic evolves. 
The factory in Taubate currently produces two compact cars, the Sedan Voyage and the hatchback Gol. Di Si did not specify what will happen to those models, whether they will be upgraded or replaced. 
""The investment will reinforce our product portfolio as one of the most important brands in terms of market share,"" he said.
Volkswagen, like its peers around the world, has been focusing more and more on developing larger cars, such as SUVs and pickup trucks at the expense of compact cars, both because of the higher profitability of larger vehicles and because consumers are seeking those products more and more as well. 

""It's a trend that will only accelerate,"" Di Si said. ""It's not that the entry-level segment will disappear, but one sees how the segment is becoming drastically smaller.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The New York hedge fund founder who predicted he might ""go to jail"" for corrupting the sale of some assets during the bankruptcy of Neiman Marcus was sentenced on Friday to six months in prison.
Daniel Kamensky, 48, of Roslyn, New York, had pleaded guilty in February to bankruptcy fraud for pressuring Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) Financial Group not to bid for securities belonging to the luxury retailer's creditors so his now-closed Marble Ridge Capital LP could buy them at a lower price.
U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in Manhattan said she found Kamensky ""deeply remorseful,"" but said he ""came undone"" from the pressures of running Marble Ridge.
""He betrayed his profession, his duty to others, his relationships,"" she said. ""He broke the law.""
Kamensky, who has also worked as a bankruptcy lawyer, had specialized at Marble Ridge in ""distressed"" investing, and once had $1.2 billion of assets under management.
According to prosecutors, Kamensky exploited his role as co-chair of a Neiman creditors committee last July 31 to block Jefferies from bidding 30 cents per share for securities he wanted to buy for 20 cents per share. 
Prosecutors said Kamensky threatened to stop doing business with Jefferies if it pursued its bid, and asked an employee there to lie about what he had done.
""Do you understand... I can go to jail,"" prosecutors quoted Kamensky as saying. ""They're going to say that I abused my position as a fiduciary, which I probably did, right?""
Prosecutors had sought 12 to 18 months in prison, while Kamensky requested probation. The defendant was also sentenced to six months of home confinement and to pay a $55,000 fine.
""There is no excuse for my behavior, and I am deeply regretful and embarrassed for my conduct,"" Kamensky said before being sentenced.
More than 100 people sent letters supporting leniency.

Neiman filed for Chapter 11 protection last May and emerged in September under new owners. A bankruptcy judge in December approved a settlement of Neiman's own claims against Kamensky.
The case is U.S. v. Kamensky, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 21-cr-00067.

PARIS (Reuters) - L'Oreal's make-up sales are set to bounce back to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels, the French group's new chief executive said on Friday, with women opting for brighter colours in their post-crisis makeovers.
Cosmetics groups were hit by shop closures and consumers shunning make-up during pandemic lockdowns, with many people spending online instead on items including premium skincare. 
Nicolas Hieronimus, a L'Oreal veteran has become CEO just as vaccinations alter the landscape again, prompting not only a return of products like mascaras but other changes the firm may have to adapt to as people try to break with the crisis. 
Women have recently been opting for bolder shades of hair dyes such as blue, Hieronimus told Reuters, a potential sign that brighter make-up colours could also be on the cards. 
""It's a clear indicator people want to indulge themselves, they want to have fun, and express their differences and their individuality,"" Hierominus said. ""It's a good omen.""
Make-up sales in countries such as China and Israel, where shops are open and COVID-19 constraints have largely lifted, have yet to reach 2019 levels but could do so this year, Hieronimus added in an interview. 
""We're monitoring online and social network conversation topics, and in the United States recently the volume of conversations around make-up reached an all-time high."" 
The cosmetics slump hit 2020 revenues at L'Oreal and its consumer products division, home to brands like Maybelline, with group sales falling 6.3% to 28 billion euros ($34 billion), although they began to pick up in the second half.
The world's largest beauty company will try and maximise the bounce-back with product launches, including a planned cosmetics range for Italian luxury label Valentino, Hieronomus said. 
Some brands also shook up product development mid-pandemic. 
Nyx's ""Shine Loud"" lip gloss, rolled out earlier this year, was designed as non-transferable onto surfaces such as clothing, but face masks were also taken into account in marketing campaigns, Hieronimus said. 
BEAUTY TECH
Hieronimus, 57, who started out at the Garnier shampoo brand and has run L'Oreal in Mexico and later its luxury products, faces other challenges, including rising demand for natural ingredients in beauty products.
L'Oreal is also investing heavily in ""beauty tech"", which ranges from platforms allowing customers to try on looks virtually, shopping models where hairdressers or dermatologists connect with consumers online, channelling data to predict trends, and using tech to shorten research timeframes.
""It will be an accelerator for the development of formulas,"" Hieronimus said, citing the way artificial intelligence will help sift through stored data on ingredients and textures. 
L'Oreal and other major cosmetics groups such as  Estee Lauder  (NYSE:EL) face competition from small brands that have succeeded in recent years with attention-grabbing product changes and nifty social media campaigns. 

E-commerce, at just under 30% of L'Oreal's revenues, is likely to reach half of sales before the decade is out, the group has said, or within three years Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) estimates. 
This milestone has already been achieved in China, but will require investment in the group's supply chain, Hieronimus said.

The country’s fintech industry is one of the most advanced compared to the rest of the world, with comprehensive regulations to prevent regulatory arbitrage and unfair competition. 
Given the increasing number of financial meltdowns caused by lack of oversight on the biggest financial institutions in the world, China’s aggressive monitoring approach is expected to mitigate excessive risks. The country is currently overseeing the restructuring of the highly controversial Ant Financial Services Group, following which the Ant IPO is expected to be scheduled. This should bolster the country’s fintech industry, owing to the Alibaba-backed company’s global market reach.

Investing.com -- Bitcoin helped Square publish jaw-dropping results for the first quarter, pushing shares up almost 7%.
Bitcoin revenue made up about 70% of the $5.06 billion total, which itself dwarfed the analyst average estimate of $3.32 billion, according to data compiled by Investing.com. Profit of 41 cents a share beat expectations of 17 cents. 
Of that $3.51 billion in bitcoin revenue, Square captured $75 million in gross profit during the first quarter of 2021, up approximately 11 times year-over-year. Bitcoin revenue and gross profit benefited from a year-over-year increase in the price of bitcoin, bitcoin actives, and growth in customer demand. ""In future quarters, we recognize that bitcoin revenue may fluctuate as a result of changes in customer demand or the market price of bitcoin,"" the company said in a statement. 
Square invested $220 million between the fourth quarter of 2020 and first quarter of 2021 in bitcoin, and noted a bitcoin impairment loss of $20 million on the investment for the first quarter. As of March 31, the fair value of the bitcoin investment was $472 million based on market prices, $272 million greater than the carrying value of the investment, Square said.

European technology stocks were the best performers for the day, rising 2.2% as they recovered from a rout seen earlier in the week. The sector ended the week largely unchanged. 
Basic resource stocks were the best weekly performers, adding 7.2% for the week and ending at over a decade-high as optimism over recovering global demand pushed up base metal and iron ore prices. 
The German DAX rose 1.3%, inching closer to its lifetime high, while France's CAC 40 ended at its highest level since November 2000 and UK's FTSE 100 breached the 7,100 mark for the first time since February 2020. 
Data showed German companies increased their exports for the eleventh month in a row in March, with growth coming in at 1.2%, twice the rate economists had forecast.
A swathe of positive earnings and data has helped European stocks rally to record highs this year, amid growing optimism over COVID-19 vaccine programs spurring a return to normalcy.

972,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2021 12:01PM ET</span>",How the U.S. locked up vaccine materials other nations urgently need,"By Allison Martell and Euan Rocha
(Reuters) - To fight the pandemic at home, the United States gave its own vaccine manufacturers priority access to American-made materials needed to make the shots.
As a result, the U.S. government laid claim not only to vast quantities of finished COVID-19 vaccines but also to vaccine components and equipment all along the supply chain, according to a Reuters review of more than a dozen contracts involving some major suppliers. 
That has left some countries desperately in need of those supplies to scramble for substitutes, exacerbating international disparities in vaccine access, according to interviews with suppliers, foreign manufacturers and vaccine market experts.
On Wednesday, President Joe Biden threw his support behind waiving patents for COVID-19 vaccines, thrilling those who have been pressuring his administration to help speed production of doses worldwide. If adopted by the World Trade Organization, the move would let other countries make their own copies of the much-coveted shots.
But the waiver would not address a less conspicuous but equally pressing problem: the growing worldwide shortage of vaccine ingredients and manufacturing equipment. The United States has a tight grip on a significant amount of those materials, such as filters, tubing and specialized disposable bags essential to making vaccines.
Countries ravaged by the virus - including India, where a catastrophic explosion of cases has filled hospitals and morgues - cannot make vaccines without such supplies, even with access to manufacturers' cookbooks.
The problem stems from the U.S. reliance on a law dating to the Korean War in the 1950s, called the Defense Production Act (DPA), which gives federal agencies the power to prioritize procurement orders related to national defense. For decades, the law was used to supply the military as well as respond to everything from natural disasters to roadblocks in the decennial U.S. census.
The administration of former President Donald Trump invoked the act to put the U.S. government first in line to buy American-made vaccines as well as other products needed to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. In turn, vaccine makers have priority access to any supplies needed to fill U.S. orders.
Gavi - a vaccine alliance comprising international organizations, governments, drug companies and others - lauded the Biden administration’s moves to increase global access to vaccines. Among other things, it cited the country's $4 billion commitment to COVAX, a global vaccine buying consortium Gavi co-leads with the World Health Organization.
But in response to questions about the DPA, Gavi said: “The greatest challenge to COVAX’s goal of equitable access to vaccines is constrained global supply. Export controls on raw materials is a considerable contributor to this and ultimately only serve to prolong the pandemic.”
A senior Biden administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there is no export ban, and all U.S.-based suppliers continue to ship products abroad after giving priority to U.S. manufacturers. The official said the DPA has not caused the global shortages of vaccine materials, and the problems stem instead from overwhelming demand.
""There's just not enough to go around,"" the official said, noting that the administration is investing in increased raw material production.
On Wednesday, Katherine Tai, the U.S. trade representative, briefly mentioned in her statement about Biden’s patent decision that the administration would “work to increase the raw materials needed” to make vaccines. She did not elaborate.
A PLEA FROM INDIA
Vaccine components are produced all over the globe - in countries including the United Kingdom and China. But some leading suppliers, including Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc (NYSE:TMO), and the Danaher Corp (NYSE:DHR) units Cytiva and Pall, are based in the United States. Reuters could not determine precisely what share of vaccine materials and equipment are made in America.
The DPA has helped the United States build a huge vaccine production system, ensuring reliable access to finished doses for Americans, and driving up revenue for U.S. pharmaceutical companies. 
About 45% of the U.S. population has received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Dozens of other countries, from South Africa, to Guatemala, to Thailand, have vaccinated about 1% or less of their populations, according to data collected at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom.
The DPA has drawn criticism from vaccine makers around the world, including the Serum Institute of India, the largest manufacturer globally.
On Twitter in late April, chief executive Adar Poonawalla requested “on behalf of the vaccine industry outside the United States” that America lift its hold on raw materials “if we are to truly unite in beating this virus.”
Starting this month, the company had planned to produce a billion doses annually of a vaccine developed by U.S.-based  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) Inc. But that output will be more than halved without American raw materials, according to a source familiar with the company’s plans, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Serum is also manufacturing COVISHIELD, a licensed version of the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc vaccine.
After weeks of public appeals from the Serum, the United States last month offered India filters needed to produce COVISHIELD. But India’s need for vaccines and supplies remains vast. Serum is also meant to be a top supplier to other low- and middle-income countries. COVISHIELD and the Novavax shot form the backbone of the COVAX program. 
Serum, which declined to discuss the raw materials issue with Reuters, is not the only vaccine maker in need.
The South African vaccine maker Biovac Institute also relies on a U.S. company for bioreactor bags, needed for cell cultures. Biovac has been warned by its U.S. supplier that the usual lead time for bags may more than double to 14 months because of the U.S. DPA, chief executive Morena Makhoana told Reuters.
Manufacturers in some other countries say they are in better shape. Brazil’s Butantan Institute has been able to buy supplies from both the United States and Europe, an executive told Reuters.
For instance, an order for supplies to make AstraZeneca’s vaccine in the United States would be prioritized, even though the shot is not yet approved for use in the country. That could delay materials being sent to Serum, which is making the same vaccine for use in India and many other countries.
For now, three manufacturers’ COVID-19 vaccines -  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE),  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) - are approved for emergency use in the United States.
Asked about the global consequences of getting priority on U.S. supplies, AstraZeneca did not comment and Moderna and J&J declined to comment. Pfizer did not directly address the U.S. DPA but said “we have gone to enormous efforts … as we seek to serve populations all over the world.”
‘UNPRECEDENTED DEMAND’
Some suppliers say the industry would do a better job than governments at managing limited resources to maximize access globally.
“If the end goal is, let's produce vaccines, then we're big believers that you need to let the industry connect the relevant parts so that we can deliver the end product,” Thermo Fisher executive vice president Michel Lagarde told Reuters.
The Biden administration official said experts from various federal agencies discuss the use of the priority system during daily operations calls. Sometimes officials can change U.S. delivery dates to avoid disrupting other vaccine projects abroad.
But suppliers are planning to get ahead of demand. Leading purveyors Cytiva, Pall and Thermo Fisher are expanding manufacturing space in the United States and abroad. Thermo Fisher has nudged customers to clarify which needs are urgent and which can wait days or weeks, and the company tries to find time to fill orders even if they are not rated as priorities, Lagarde said.

Cytiva said in a statement that it is expanding production, but is itself limited by some raw materials shortages.
“The world is experiencing an unprecedented demand for biopharmaceutical products, technologies, and solutions,” Cytiva said.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Commerzbank Chief Executive Manfred Knof has struck a deal with employees over a job reduction plan, paving the way for the German bank to cut 10,000 jobs globally. 
The agreement, announced by the bank and union officials on Friday, is central to Knof's effort to streamline the country's second-biggest listed lender and return it to profitability.
""Today, we have taken a major step towards achieving our sustainable cost targets - and towards our goal of making Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) sustainably profitable,"" the CEO told Reuters. 
Commerzbank hopes the revamp will revive its fortunes as a standalone bank as it tries to turn a new leaf after management reshuffles and strategy flip-flops. It has never fully recovered after a state bailout during the last financial crisis more than a decade ago and lost 2.9 billion euros in 2020. 
Weeks after becoming Commerzbank CEO at the start of the year, Knof announced plans to cut 10,000 jobs and close hundreds of branches in a 1.8 billion euro ($2.2 billion) restructuring. The bank on Friday said that the restructuring bill would be higher than initially envisaged at slightly more than 2 billion euros.
Knof told employees in January that cuts were a necessary ""bitter pill"", and over recent months, management has negotiated the reductions with labour representatives, hoping to clinch a deal before the bank's annual shareholder meeting in May. 
The job agreement includes early retirement and reduced hours for older employees. It also includes severance packages and retraining programmes. 
Christoph Schmitz, an official with the Verdi union, said the agreement would effectively prevent forced redundancies and slow departures so that the remaining workforce was not overburdened.
Knof, who trained as a lawyer, spent the bulk of his career at insurance group Allianz (DE:ALVG) before a 2019 move to  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), where he was head of retail operations in Germany. He joined Commerzbank at the start of 2021.
Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank abandoned talks to merge in 2019, but speculation about possible M&A activity has not gone away.

""My goal is to ensure Commerzbank's independence as a profitable, high-performing bank,"" Knof told Reuters.

Let’s discuss this.Growing investor excitement about the automotive sector going electric was reflected in electric vehicle (EV) stocks’ impressive rally in 2020. Improved automotive performance, government subsidies, and cost-efficiencies have been motivating consumers to switch to EVs. As a result, the booming EV space has been birthing many new companies, arguably overcrowding the industry.
But not all the players in this booming market possess sound fundamentals. In fact, many EV players have been witnessing corrections this year due to investor concern over the industry’s overvaluation, and production delays due to a global semiconductor shortage. Investors’ bearish outlooks are often manifested in their short-selling activity as they bet against stocks that they believe have become overvalued relative to the fundamentals and are due for a pullback. Short percentage of float is one of the commonly used metrics for understanding how aggressive a stock's short sellers have been. Thanks to the actions of Reddit's WallStreetBets forum, many investors have lately been introduced to the short squeeze. Experts believe that this bullish market may keep the trend going and many highly shorted stocks could get caught up in this short squeeze frenzy.
Nikola Corp. (NKLA), Blink Charging Co. (NASDAQ:BLNK), and Workhorse Group, Inc. (WKHS) are three EV players in the EV market that have been aggressively shorted by investors. Their weak fundamentals and other recent developments are raising red flags and, hence, we think it could be wise to avoid these stocks now.

Patrick Ryan gives his take on why investors in these stocks should be cautious.
Consumer goods stocks are worth a closer look now that prices are rising across the board. Consumers have a record amount of savings, meaning they are that much more likely to spend as the economy gradually reopens.
Economists agree our current inflationary environment is likely to continue well beyond the current quarter. As a result, businesses that provide consumer goods will increase their prices to offset rising supply costs and add to the bottom line.
These three consumer goods stocks are likely to benefit from rising costs: Kimberly-Clark Corporation (KMB), Proctor & Gamble (PG), and The Clorox Company (CLX).

And intense competition in the streaming space could make matters worse for the two stocks. So, let’s evaluate if either of these two stocks is a buy now.Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) are dominant players in the streaming space. Evolving from a DVD rental business to a streaming giant, NFLX has transformed its business and diversified its service offerings to capitalize on the home entertainment trend. In comparison, media and entertainment conglomerate DIS’ launch of its streaming service Disney+ represents a strategic pivot for the company.
As the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the growth of the home-entertainment market, streaming stocks saw spectacular gains last year. However, because more people are embracing outdoor activities again amid a speedy vaccination drive, there has been a significant decline in the subscription growth rates of streaming companies lately. In short, now that the pandemic has eased somewhat, consumers are choosing to discontinue their video-streaming subscriptions. This could negatively impact NFLX’s and DIS’ businesses. In fact, given the competitive streaming landscape, a decline in customer loyalty and content production delays could cloud their near-term prospects.
Over the past month, NFLX has lost 8.3%, while DIS has declined 3.7%. In terms of past year performance, NFLX has gained 16.8%, while DIS returned 79.6%. Let’s find out if any of these stocks is a good pick now.

(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) has appointed James Reid as chief information officer for a new unit focused on developing and modernising technology used by the bank's 250,000 employees, an internal memo sent on Friday and seen by Reuters showed. 
Reid, who was most recently head of corporate technology's engineering and architecture team, becomes the bank's first Black CIO and the first Black member of its technology leadership team. 
JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, has also appointed company-wide chief data officer Melissa Goldman as chief information officer for the renamed Finance, Risk, Data and Controls technology unit, the memo said. 
In her role, Goldman will continue to lead a team developing technology for risk, compliance, finance, liquidity, controls and data functions.
Many banks are seeking to modernise their systems, as more customers seek to interact with them digitally, and employees work and collaborate remotely.
The appointments also follow a renewed commitment by JPMorgan late last year to improve the diversity of its workforce and increase racial and gender diversity in its most senior ranks. 
As CIO for Employee Experience and Corporate Technology, Reid will report to the banking group's CIO Lori Beer and lead a team that builds and maintains systems used across the bank's corporate functions, such as HR, legal and audit, tax and robotics, the memo said.

Reid is a Distinguished Engineer, a title given to a select group of JPMorgan's technologists who drive the firm's technology strategy, as well as a member of the Cloud Design Council, and a leader of diversity and inclusion initiatives at the company. 
Prior to joining JPMorgan in 2019, Reid worked at Equifax (NYSE:EFX) for 17 years, where he was senior vice president of core software engineering.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) said it screened 1.64 million passengers on Thursday at U.S. airports, the highest number since March 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic slashed travel demand.
The number of U.S. air travelers is still about 35% lower than the same date in 2019, down nearly 1 million travelers, TSA said. U.S. airlines have been adding more flights, anticipating rising summer travel demand.
U.S. airline stocks rose Friday on optimism about travel demand, with United Airlines up 2.3%, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) up 2% and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) up 2.3%.
This is the second new post March 2020 high set this week. TSA said it had screened nearly 1.63 million passengers on Sunday at U.S. airports. Thursday's figure was up about 17,000 over Sunday.
By comparison, just 190,000 people were screened at U.S. airports on the same day in May 2020. U.S. airlines have been adding more flights, anticipating rising summer travel demand.
Last month, United Airlines said it was adding more than 480 daily flights to its U.S. schedule in June to meet summer travel demand that is expected to rise as more people receive COVID-19 vaccines.

American Airlines said in April it expects to fly more than 90% of its domestic seat capacity compared with summer 2019 and 80% of its international seat capacity compared with 2019, and it will operate more than 150 new routes this summer. 
Airlines are seeing an uptick in bookings as accelerated vaccination efforts encourage leisure travel with friends and family after months of pandemic-linked restrictions.

(Reuters) - U.S. support for waiving intellectual property rights on COVID-19 vaccines could be a tactic to convince drugmakers to back less drastic steps like sharing technology and expanding joint ventures to quickly boost global production, lawyers said on Thursday.
""I think the end result that most players are looking for here is not IP waiver in particular, it’s expanded global access to the vaccines,"" said Professor Lisa Ouellette of Stanford Law School. 
President Joe Biden on Wednesday supported a proposal to waive World Trade Organization intellectual property (IP) rules, which would allow poorer countries to produce vaccine for themselves. So far COVID-19 vaccines have been distributed primarily to the wealthy countries that developed them, while the pandemic sweeps through poorer ones, like India.
The real goal, though, is expanded vaccine distribution.
""If it is possible to increase the rate of scaling up production, this potentially would give the manufacturers a greater incentive to come to an agreement to make that happen,” Ouellette said.
Vaccine makers like  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA),  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTEch have argued that patents have not been a limiting factor in supply. New technology and global limits on supplies are frequently cited as challenges, and both Moderna and Pfizer nevertheless have steadily boosted supply forecasts.
""There is no mRNA in manufacturing capacity in the world,"" Moderna Chief Executive Stephane Bancel said on a conference call with investors on Thursday, referring to the messenger RNA technology behind both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccine. 
""This is a new technology. You cannot go hire people who know how to make the mRNA. Those people don't exist. And then even if all those things were available, whoever wants to do mRNA vaccines will have to buy the machine, invent the manufacturing process, invent verification processes and analytical processes.""
To increase vaccine production capacity significantly within two years, the Biden administration would need to do much more than waive patents, including providing funding to find and build new manufacturing sites, and backing technology and expertise transfer to the new manufacturers, said drug supply chain expert Prashant Yadav.
Moreover, the U.S. government must guard against allowing foreign companies to use COVID-19 vaccine makers’ technology to compete in areas outside of COVID-19, which are likely to be more lucrative in the long term, said Thomas Kowalski, an attorney at Duane Morris who specializes in intellectual property. Once a competitor has the technology, restrictions on use are difficult to enforce, he said.
Professor Sarah Rajec of William & Mary Law School said she did not think a waiver itself would do as much as the signal from the United States, a stronger supporter of corporate intellectual property, that patent rights take a backseat to the urgent needs of the world population during the pandemic.
Rajec said Biden’s support for a waiver ""pushes the drug companies to be more open to partnerships, and other licensing on favorable terms, in a way that perhaps they otherwise wouldn’t be.""
Drugmakers argue that they have already struck significant partnerships, sharing technology with competitors who they might not have linked up with if not for the pandemic.
“Our position is very clear: this decision will further complicate our efforts to get vaccines to people around the world, address emerging variants and save lives,"" Brian Newell, spokesman for pharmaceutical industry group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America said in a statement.

European patent attorney Micaela Modiano said that even if the waiver is adopted, vaccine makers are likely to negotiate for some payment, if less than what is generally paid in licensing arrangements. Her firm Modiano & Parners represents Pfizer but has not worked on any COVID-19 related matters. 
""I would imagine that the pharmaceutical companies are already and will continue to lobby significantly to make sure that if this waiver proposal passes, that it just doesn't pass as such, but that they receive some sort of financial compensation,"" she said.

LONDON (Reuters) -BMW remains on course to meet its profit targets for 2021 despite rising raw material costs, though the global chip shortage will worsen and may hit production in the second quarter, the German carmaker said on Friday.
Most of the auto industry has been hit by a global semiconductor chip shortage, forcing many assembly plants to shut, driving down inventories and pushing up prices for both new and used vehicles. 
""We cannot assume that we will emerge from the second quarter unscathed,"" Chief Executive Officer Oliver Zipse said.
Zipse said, however, that he did not expect the shortage to have a major impact on production and the company would respond by prioritising production of cars with higher profit margins.
BMW said sales of its electrified vehicles more than doubled in the first quarter, when it also benefited from higher prices and strong demand in China, where sales almost doubled in the first quarter from last year.
The carmaker said it expected to have 2 million fully-electric cars on the road by 2025. 
BMW has so far largely steered clear of the semiconductor chip shortage battering rivals such as Europe's biggest carmaker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p).
Volkswagen boss Herbert Diess said on Thursday that it was in ""crisis mode"" over the chip shortage and it would hit profits in the second quarter, while Ford said last week that the lack of chips could halve its second-quarter vehicle production.
BMW is known for its strong relations with suppliers and has been working with them to avoid disruptions. Aside from temporary shutdowns of MINI production in the United Kingdom and at a plant in Germany, the carmaker has not been affected.
GREEN CARS
Chief Financial Officer Nicolas Peter also said during a conference call that BMW expected raw material prices to rise, especially for rhodium and palladium and steel. 
BMW had already reported a 370% jump in pre-tax profit as it bounced back more strongly than expected from a pandemic-ravaged first quarter last year.
Rebounding demand from consumers in China in the second half of last year helped BMW and its German rivals Volkswagen and Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) post solid profits for 2020 despite the coronavirus pandemic.
BMW reported solid first-quarter growth in other regions too, including a 17.4% jump in sales in North America, driven by strong demand from U.S. drivers.
The German carmaker said its first-quarter results also received a boost from the sale of previously leased vehicles, in particular in the U.S. market.
BMW said it expected the pre-tax margin for its core autos business to come in at the upper end of its previous forecast of between 6% and 8%.

As part of its drive to use more environmentally sustainable raw materials, BMW said it would source half of the aluminium used at its foundry in Bavaria from Emirates Global Aluminium, which makes the metal using solar power.
""Our ambition is clear: The greenest electric car will be a BMW,"" CEO Zipse told a conference call.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's largest and most powerful union IG Metall has set its sights firmly on setting up a works council at Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s gigafactory near Berlin, which is scheduled to open later this year, its head Joerg Hofmann said.
The U.S. electric carmaker is hiring for the site in Gruenheide, whose opening was pushed back in April due to red tape as well as a decision to include a battery cell manufacturing plant.
Organised labour will be an issue for the group in Germany, not only home to some of the world's biggest and most famous carmakers but also to powerful unions that command significant say over strategic matters.
Tesla was not immediately available for comment.
""So far I have not been in contact with (Tesla CEO) Elon Musk. Why should I be, or he? Tesla is now hiring in Gruenheide, in the land of co-determination and collective bargaining agreements. Tesla's management knows this,"" Hofmann told Reuters.
""If the team for Gruenheide is on board we will establish a works council with the employees and organise them.""
Hofmann's comments, coming shortly after a report in Business Insider saying that German authorities are probing possible violations of labour laws at the Gruenheide site, suggest Tesla will have a tough time avoiding organised labour in Europe's top economy.
Hofmann said that while meaningful talks with Tesla in Germany were not easy due to numerous leadership changes that have taken place at the carmaker, IG Metall welcomed Tesla's decision to establish itself in Germany.
In October, Tesla's executive overseeing construction of the Gruenheide factory left his position, a source familiar with the matter said at the time, following the departure of Jochen Rudat, head of Germany, a year earlier.
""It's the first big investment in a new factory in the automotive sector since the turn of the millennium,"" Hofmann said.

He said that finding skilled workers in Germany would be a challenge, adding Tesla will have to adhere to the standards of the local labour market.
Hofmann a day earlier had warned that Germany's car industry was facing an ""employment fiasco"" unless it gets badly needed investment in new technologies, especially in batteries.

American Homes (NYSE:AMH) 4 Rent, which owns 54,000 houses, increased rents 11% on vacant properties in April, according to a statement Thursday. Invitation Homes (NYSE:INVH) Inc., the largest landlord in the industry, boosted rents by similar amount, an executive said on a recent conference call.
Housing costs are jumping across the U.S. as vaccines fuel optimism about a rebound from the pandemic. With homeownership out of reach for many Americans, rents are also climbing. The increases may add to concerns about inflation pressures as the economy recovers.
“Companies are trying to figure out how hard they can push before they start losing people,” said Jeffrey Langbaum, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “And they seem to be of the opinion they can push as far as they want.”

In the early months of the pandemic, the big single-family rental companies slowed rent hikes, preferring to maximize occupancy during an uncertain time for the economy. Now, low vacancies are giving them pricing power.
Invitation Homes reported an occupancy rate of more than 98% during the first quarter, freeing the company to raise prices by more than 10% on vacant houses in April. Invitation Homes is targeting increases of as much as 8% for tenants seeking to renew leases in coming months, an executive said on a recent conference call.
Single-family landlords have had the upper hand over apartment owners in the age of remote work, but those advantages might dissipate as employers summon workers back to the office.
“How much of the demand is temporary?” said Langbaum. “I do believe some component of it will revert back to urban markets.”

The supply chain finance firm, which lent money to firms by buying their invoices at a discount, collapsed in March 2021 after insurers pulled their cover.
Creditors of Greensill Capital Pty, the Australian parent of the British company, voted in April to liquidate that company.
Among the investors burnt in the widespread fallout from Greensill's collapse were clients of Swiss banking giant  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), steel magnate Sanjeev Gupta's GFG Alliance and some 26 German towns.
A British parliamentary committee said on Friday that former Prime Minister David Cameron - who lobbied for Greensill - and the company's founder Lex Greensill would be questioned by lawmakers next week over the failure of the firm.
Grant Thornton, Greensill UK's administrators, proposed in a statement filed with Companies House late on Thursday that the administration would end with the voluntary liquidation or dissolution of Greensill Capital UK and Greensill Capital Management UK, after a sale attempt fell through earlier this year. 

Some of Greensill's assets were backed by insurance and Grant Thornton said investors may be able to recover some funds through insurance claims. It has appointed law firm Herbert Smith Freehills for trade credit insurance issues. 
Grant Thornton estimates it will be able to recover just $275 million to repay claims from unsecured creditors worth nearly $1.5 billion.

994,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2021 09:47AM ET</span>","Analysis-Indian airlines risk consolidation, plane repossessions amid COVID-19 surge","By Aditi Shah and Jamie Freed
NEW DELHI (Reuters) -India's airlines are under renewed pressure to raise cash or face the risk of having to downsize, consolidate or have their planes repossessed by lessors as a surge of COVID-19 infections roils travel.
Passenger traffic fell by nearly 30% in April from a month before and has halved again so far in May, forcing even the country's biggest and most cashed-up carrier, IndiGo, to act.
IndiGo's parent, Interglobe Aviation, met on Friday to consider an equity raising, just months after it abandoned plans to raise up to 40 billion rupees ($543 million) in January in response to a speedy recovery in travel.
InterGlobe's board has decided to continue exploring all options to increase liquidity, including by way of a share sale to institutional investors, the company told the stock exchange.
With traffic plummeting, according to aviation ministry data, IndiGo's cash burn is expected to rise to $3.4 million a day - a level last seen in September - from $2 million a day at the end of 2020, an analyst who tracks the company said.
This means IndiGo, which has more than a 50% share of the market, may look to raise $543 million to $679 million amounting to at least two quarters of cash burn, said the analyst, who declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak publicly. 
While IndiGo is seen as a survivor, the situation is worse for smaller carriers, particularly those without large backers, some of which were struggling before the novel coronavirus hit, analysts say.
""India hasn't provided much government assistance or support so the private airlines will need to turn to the private sector,"" independent aviation analyst Brendan Sobie said.
The cash call comes as Indian carriers are expected to report total losses of $4-$4.5 billion in the fiscal year that ended on March 31 and will lose a similar amount this year, aviation consultancy CAPA India said in a note this week.
With more people losing loved ones and the outlook on the economy, jobs and incomes turning down, a recovery in domestic travel, which had been expected by the end of 2021, may not come until at least the first quarter of 2022, analysts estimate. 
To make matters worse, several countries, including Britain and the United States, with which India has had bilateral arrangements to operate charter flights have restricted arrivals because of high infection rates.
The charters offered a lucrative revenue stream for local carriers after the Indian government shut down regular international flights when the pandemic hit. A recovery in international traffic to pre-COVID levels is expected only by 2024, CAPA says. 
LESSORS LESS FORGIVING
Smaller carriers, such as SpiceJet Ltd and privately owned GoAir, could come under pressure to reduce capacity, find partners or consolidate, analysts say, particularly as aircraft lessors take a harder line.
SpiceJet said its passenger and cargo businesses have generated adequate cash flows to cover the cost of operations. 
The airline is in talks with lenders for debt and private investors for further capitalisation, the airline's spokesman said, adding that it also expects the compensation due from Boeing (NYSE:BA) for the 737-MAX aircraft to bolster its finances.
CAPA expects 250-300 planes to be grounded in the first half of the current fiscal year, while lessors may not be as patient as last year in allowing delayed repayments now air travel is resuming in places such as the United States and China.
""There is now more demand for aircraft, and they would rather have the asset back than let airlines use it for free and depreciate it,"" said Sanjiv Kapoor, former chief commercial officer of Indian airline Vistara.
Debt forgiveness is also unlikely.
""Lessors are united in not writing off airline debts and that won't change, as some are also under severe threat of bankruptcy,"" said Shukor Yusof, head of aviation consultancy Endau Analytics.
GoAir plans to raise up to 25 billion rupees through an initial public offering, local media reported in March, though as the COVID-19 situation worsens the attraction for investors becomes less clear.
GoAir did not respond to a request for comment. 
While IndiGo, which took delivery of 44 new planes from Airbus last year, has not delayed lease payments, SpiceJet had missed payments even before COVID-19 hit, according to leasing industry sources, and its financial accounts state it has delayed payments during the crisis.
Payments to lessors have always been made on agreed terms before COVID and at present, the SpiceJet spokesman said, adding that any aircraft being returned is either planned or mutually agreed upon based on the market outlook. 

Any carriers that have planes repossessed could struggle once the market picks up. While CAPA says consolidation is inevitable, potentially leading to a two-to-three airline system, other analysts say it is still too early to predict an outcome.
""This hopefully will be a temporary setback for all airlines. We will have to see if all the players will be able to weather the storm,"" said Sobie.

AIG (NYSE:AIG) weighed interest from competitors, but ""at this time, we believe an IPO remains the optimal path forward to maximize value for our stakeholders and to position the business for additional value creation as a stand-alone company,"" Zaffino said in a conference call with analysts, his first as CEO of the company. 
""An IPO allows AIG to retain maximum flexibility regarding the operations of the business as well as the separation process.""
Zaffino said AIG is working with ""urgency"" to complete the separation this year but that the timing could slip into the first quarter of 2022.
The life and retirement unit, which sells insurance and annuities, reported $941 million in adjusted pre-tax income in the first quarter, up 57% from a year ago, AIG said on Thursday. But premiums fell by 53% to $600 million.

Zaffino said AIG's general insurance business, which reported a 6% increase in gross premium revenue to $10.7 billion in the quarter, would continue to see revenue growth at that level in the remainder of 2021. 
AIG, which began to retool its underwriting to make its core business more profitable after Zaffino and former CEO Brian Duperreault arrived in 2017, said that process is largely complete and it is now ""pivoting"" to focus on growth.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mostly higher on Friday thanks to the ""bad news is good news principle"", as a shock shortfall in job creating reassured market participants that the Federal Reserve will not withdraw any monetary stimulus for the foreseeable future. 
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was effectively unchanged on 34,552 points, underperforming as the government's labor market report suggested that only a slow pickup in employment despite the broad reopening of the economy. The S&P 500 was up 0.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite, many of whose components are highly sensitive to expectations of future interest rates, was up 0.8%.
Earlier, the Bureau of Labor Statistics had said that the U.S. economy created only 266,000 nonfarm jobs in the month through mid-April, well short of the 978,000 expected and also well short of the 742,000 gain in private payrolls reported earlier this week by ADP. To make matters worse, the government also revised down its March number by nearly 150,000 to 770,000. The one bright spot was a sign of people re-entering the workforce as the service sector started to reopen after a winter spent locked down. The labor participation rate rose to 61.7% of the working-age population, from 61.5% in March.
Among individual stocks, Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) was an early and sharp gainer,. after the maker of streaming devices posted strong quarterly results on Thursday evening. After losing 40% from its peak in February, the stock rebounded by 15% after the company said advertising revenue grew 79% in the first quarter, giving the company its strongest overall revenue growth since it went public.
Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) stock rose 4.6% after the maker of high-end exercise bikes said the recall of its treadmills due to safety concerns would cost it only $165 million. The stock has been hammered this week by the recall news, which came after the company initially refused to acknowledge a problem with the equipment.
Elsewhere, Square (NYSE:SQ) stock rose 7.6% after disclosing a sharp rise in the proportion of its revenues tied to processing Bitcoin-related payments. The news attracted inflows from people seeking an equity market proxy for the growing interest in crypto assets.  Coinbase Global  (NASDAQ:COIN), the digital asset exchange group seen by some as the closest proxy for that trend,. bounced 2.0% after finding support just above the reference price at which it went public last month."

Hopes of a faster recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic lifted inflows into value funds to $1.72 billion during the period. 
Inflows into growth stocks were $4.92 billion on concerns over a rise in interest rates. Higher rates lower the present value of future cash flows of growth stocks, making them less attractive.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Tegna shareholders re-elected all 12 directors to the U.S. regional TV station operator's board, handing victory to management and rebuffing hedge fund Standard General after it tried for a second time to add new directors.
Preliminary vote counts showed that all 12 directors were re-elected, the company said in a statement on Friday.
""We are deeply gratified by this clear vote of confidence from our shareholders, and we continue to benefit from the input we received from the many shareholders we engaged with,"" board chairman Howard Elias said in a statement.
The result marks the second consecutive loss for Standard General, which had nominated three directors this year. The fund also lost in 2020 when it had nominated four directors, including its founder Soohyung Kim.
The hedge fund, which owns 7% of Tegna's stock, had asked the company to review operations with an eye to improving performance.
The company, which is valued at $2.6 billion, has seen its stock price climb 42% since January.
Proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services, whose recommendations are widely followed on corporate votes, recommended that investors re-elect all company directors.
The vote at Tegna is one of the few proxy contest that has proceeded to a vote this year as other campaigns have been settled between the activist and company.

(Reuters) - U.S. health insurer  Cigna Corp  (NYSE:CI) on Friday raised its full-year profit and revenue targets after first-quarter profit topped estimates, as it bet on its health services unit that includes its pharmacy benefits management business, to drive growth.
Cigna's shares were up over 1% before the bell and its forecast raise follows rivals UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) and Anthem Inc that last month increased their adjusted profit targets for the year.
For 2021, Cigna said it expects adjusted earnings per share from operations of at least $20.20, up from $20 forecast earlier.
It now sees adjusted revenue of at least $166 billion, up from its earlier forecast of at least $165 billion. 
""While the EPS outlook was raised moderately, we see this as prudent since the health insurers still face important unknowns at this point around how quickly health care utilization will further recover in 2021,"" Stephens analyst Scott Fidel said. 
Health insurers have been facing several challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including direct costs related to testing, treatment and vaccinations as well as higher disenrollment in employer-sponsored plans due to the pandemic's economic impact.
Demand for non-COVID-19 healthcare services, which were deferred last year, is also expected to rebound as more people get vaccinated and feel safe to return to doctors' offices, potentially driving up health insurers' costs. 
Cigna reiterated that it anticipates a negative earnings impact of about $1.25 per share this year from COVID-19. 
However, Cigna's health services unit, which was rebranded last September to Evernorth, has shown resilient growth in the last few quarters. 
For a graphic on Cigna's Evernorth unit spearheads growth:

Evernorth's adjusted revenue rose nearly 13% from a year earlier.
Excluding items, Cigna earned $4.73 per share in the first-quarter, beating analysts' estimates of $4.38, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

Gary Gensler, who took over as the regulator's chairman last month, told CNBC in an interview that while investors can take risks more protections are needed amid the rise in ""crypto tokens"" and fierce stock rallies driven by online posts.
""We need to update and freshen our rules,"" he said, adding that such protections help economic growth and capital formation by boosting confidence in the markets and making risks transparent.

Crypto tokens, or cryptocurrencies, were especially ripe for regulation to help tamp out fraud, manipulation and bad actors, he said.

The electric drive units will be developed by American Axle in Detroit and prototypes will be delivered by the end of the year. Further terms of the deal were not disclosed.

BERLIN (Reuters) -German sportswear company Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) sees only a short-term impact from Chinese calls in March for a boycott of its products, raising its 2021 sales forecast on Friday as it expects a resumption of big sporting events to drive demand.
Adidas now sees sales growing at a high-teens percentage rate in 2021, compared with a March forecast for mid-to-high teens growth, with a jump of around 50% expected in the second quarter.
It said the acceleration would be driven by new products such as Ultraboost running shoes that are designed to be recycled, as well as big events like the European soccer championship, the Copa America and the Tokyo Olympics.
Shares in Adidas, which had fallen in recent weeks on concerns about sales in China, were up 8.2% at 0907 GMT, the biggest gain on the German blue-chip index. Shares in rival Puma were also up 2%.
Western brands including Adidas,  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and Puma faced online attacks in China in late March over past statements saying they would not source cotton from Xinjiang after reports of human rights abuses against Uyghur Muslims. Beijing denies any such abuses.
Adidas initially saw a steep drop in demand but sales have since recovered slowly but steadily, Chief Executive Kasper Rorsted told journalists: ""We are still very confident that we will have a very good year in China.""
Before the boycott call, sales jumped 156% in greater China in the first quarter, a year after the coronavirus pandemic hit there, to account for more than a quarter of total sales.
The row over Xinjiang could impact the sale by Adidas of its Reebok brand, as it could hit the appeal of the company to potential Chinese buyers, three sources told Reuters this week.
But finance chief Harm Ohlmeyer said the sale process was well on track and Adidas was talking to several interested parties and hoped to complete a deal by the end of the year.
Adidas said the more upbeat outlook took into account problems with freight transport due to congestion at U.S. ports and the recent blockage of the Suez canal, as well as ongoing lockdowns in Europe, with 91% of stores now reopened globally.
Puma said last month it expected the consumer backlash against brands in China and congestion at ports to hit its sales, though it gave an upbeat outlook for 2021.

Adidas said first-quarter sales rose 20% to 5.268 billion euros ($6.35 billion), ahead analysts' average forecast of 5 billion, while net income from continuing operations jumped to 502 million euros.

1004,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2021 07:31AM ET</span>","Investors eye inflation, seasonally weaker market stretch as tech stocks wobble","By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - As U.S. stocks head into a seasonally rocky stretch, investors are gauging to what extent markets have anticipated a number of factors that could sway asset prices, from massive government stimulus to looming inflation.
Though equities remain near all-time highs, some sectors have gotten off to an uneven start this month, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite down more than 2% so far this week while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose to a record on Thursday.
Recent data have also offered a mixed picture of what investors see ahead. While retail investors have been net buyers of stocks for 10 straight weeks, hedge funds have been sellers, client data from BofA Global Research showed, with the four-week average of net sales of equities by hedge funds hitting their highest levels since the firm began tracking the data in 2008. 
""A lot of the good news is priced in,” said Deepak Puri, chief investment officer, Americas, at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Wealth Management. “We are due for a little bit of fatigue.” 
And while investors may not choose to actually follow the adage to “sell in May and go away,” the next six months have historically been a more challenging time for stocks. Since 1946, the S&P 500 has risen an average of 1.6% from May through October, compared with a 6.8% average rise for the other six-month period of the year, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.
Investors next week will be watching quarterly results from companies such as Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co, Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) and  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN), as a first-quarter reporting season in which corporate profits have come in far higher than expected draws to a close.
April's Consumer Price Index, a closely watched indicator for inflation set to be released on Wednesday, will be another point of focus. Some investors have become skeptical of the Federal Reserve’s assurances that any inflation resulting from the government’s massive economic stimulus programs will be transitory, with prices for everything for raw materials to real estate already showing big gains.
""We see near-term volatility in inflation as the economic restart progresses, and believe markets underappreciate potential for medium-term price pressures,"" strategists at BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), the world’s largest asset manager, said earlier this week.
High inflation brings the risk of an earlier than anticipated scaling back of monetary support by central banks, while also potentially squeezing corporate profit margins and threatening to erode the purchasing power of longer-dated bonds.
Analysts at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) said worries over rising inflation are weighing on high-growth areas of the market, including Cathie Wood's ARK Innovation ETF, which has wobbled in recent weeks after beating all other U.S. equity funds in 2020.
The S&P 500 tech sector has fallen 1.3% so far this week, while the Russell 1000 growth index has pulled back 1.8%.
""The fear of inflation is palpable in the equity market, where the high-growth areas ... are really underperforming because of higher rate expectations,"" Societe Generale said in a recent report. 
Others, like  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute, expect a continuation of the powerful rally in cyclical stocks - shares of financials, industrials and other companies that can benefit most from an economic rebound - that has helped boost markets since late last year.
The firm is recommending that Wells’ financial advisers use volatility as an opportunity to buy for their clients, said Chris Haverland, global equity strategist at the Wells investment institute.
""We believe we are still early in the cycle,"" Haverland said. With the economic and earnings growth that is expected in the next six to 12 months, he said, ""we think that is going to support equity prices.""
Some market participants are saying the next few months may bring in to favor so-called defensive stocks - which are often expected to hold up better during periods of uncertainty. The S&P 500 healthcare and consumer staples sectors, generally considered more defensive groups, rose an average of 4.6% in the May-October period since 1990, compared with a 2.2% rise for the overall S&P 500, according to Stovall. 
For a graphic on Comparing seasons for stocks:
https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/WEEKAHEAD/yxmvjmklrpr/chart.png 
Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG, recently upgraded his rating on the staples sector to ""neutral"" from ""underweight,"" citing the group's strong dividends among other factors.

Puri, of Deutsche Bank Wealth Management, is betting the best approach is a mix of growth stocks, including those in the technology sector, along with shares in the financial and industrial sectors.
While Puri believes stocks may be due for a pullback, “when you compare to the other relative propositions that are out there ... equities still look reasonably attractive,” he said.

Thursday’s gains came after a better than expected reading of the weekly jobless claims, and this puts the focus firmly on the more comprehensive nonfarm payrolls report, due at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), for clues on the strength of the labor market and potentially the U.S. Federal Reserve's stance on monetary policy. 
The April U.S. employment report should show another solid month of job gains as the economy continues to recover from the pandemic, with economists predicting the addition of around one million jobs and the unemployment rate falling to 5.8% from 6%.

Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) stock rose 6.7% premarket after the exercise bike company reported a small loss, with connected fitness subscriptions growing 135% in the quarter. The company added the recall of treadmills due to safety concerns would cost just $165 million in its fourth quarter. 
Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK) stock fell 8% premarket after the burger chain’s first-quarter revenue disappointed, a sign that restaurants without a significant online presence are still suffering as consumers stay away from city centers.
Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) will also be in the spotlight, with its stock down almost 7% premarket, after the plant-based meat maker reported a wider quarterly loss than expected, as higher freight costs and pandemic-related restaurant closures hit sales.
Earnings are also scheduled from health insurer Cigna (NYSE:CI), hydrogen fuel cell developer  Plug Power  (NASDAQ:PLUG) and sports betting operator DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG).
Oil prices edged lower Friday, as India posted a new record high of new cases of Covid-19, but are still heading for another weekly gain on growing confidence of a global economic recovery. 
Later in the session, CFTC’s weekly report on commitments of traders and the Baker Hughes oil rig count are due.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% lower at $64.66 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.1% to $68064. Both contracts are up more than 2% this week, heading for their first back-to-back weekly increases since early March.

Lear's results come a day after rival  Magna International  (NYSE:MGA) Inc also beat estimates for quarterly results, driven by strong China demand.
Even as the health crisis has boosted demand for personal transport, a severe chip shortage has led car companies to cut production, capping sales growth at auto parts makers.
Lear said it now expects full-year sales between $20.35 billion and $21.15 billion, up from its prior forecast of $19.8 billion to $20.8 billion.
Lear, which counts General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Ford among its top customers, makes automotive seating and electrical distribution systems that manage electrical power within a vehicle.
The company also raised its 2021 adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization forecast to a range of $1.70 billion to $1.87 billion, from prior range of $1.69 billion to $1.86 billion.

1008,By Investing.com,"<span>May 07, 2021 06:38AM ET</span>","Fed Risk Warning, Payrolls, Energy Transfer Windfall - What's Moving Markets","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The Federal Reserve starts to get nervous about high asset prices and leverage, nonfarm payrolls are expected to hit nearly 1 million in April, and strong Chinese trade data lift copper and iron ore to new records. Plus Angela Merkel pushes back against an IP waiver for vaccines - and  Energy Transfer  (NYSE:ET) reveals just how much it made from the big freeze in Texas and the rest of the south in February. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Friday. May 7th.
1. Fed warns about asset prices, leverage
Sky-high asset prices are posing increasing threats to the financial system, the Federal Reserve warned in its half-yearly Financial Stability Report, published on Thursday, in the first clear acknowledgement of what many see as a side-effect of its massive monetary stimulus over the last year.
“Asset prices may be vulnerable to significant declines should risk appetite fall,” Governor Lael Brainard, one of the most influential members of the Fed’s board, said in the report. She highlighted the issue of hidden leverage among non-banks, only weeks after the family office of former fund manager Bill Hwang blew up, causing its lenders billions of dollars of losses.
There’s plenty of leverage in the system that isn’t at all hidden: gross margin debt as recorded by FINRA rose to a record $822 billion in March, up 72% from a year earlier and up 5.6% in the last three months alone.
2. Nonfarm payrolls expected to hit nearly 1 million
The U.S. economy is expected to have added nearly 1 million jobs in the month through mid-April, up from 916,000 in March.
The quickening pace of the labor market recovery has already been evident this week in ADP’s estimate of 742,000 private-sector jobs being gained in the month, while initial jobless claims fell below 500,000 for the first time since the start of the pandemic, according to data released on Thursday.
Despite increasingly rapid gains, the numbers appear unlikely to change the Fed’s view for monetary policy, given that there are still some 8 million jobs to be recovered before employment reaches its pre-pandemic level. According to Bloomberg data, the ratio of employment to total population in the U.S. is still below its low point during the 2009 crisis.
3. Stocks set to open higher. Energy Transfer gets windfall from winter storms
U.S. stocks are poised to end the week on a positive note, on course for a weekly gain of over 1% despite some wobbles as a result of earnings season.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), Dow Jones futures were up 67 points, or 0.2%, while S&P 500 futures and NASDAQ Futures were up in parallel.
Stocks likely to be in focus later include vaccine makers, after German Chancellor Angela Merkel pushed back against loosening intellectual property protection for Covid-19 drugs. The topic is set to be discussed at an EU leaders’ summit later Friday.
Also in focus will be  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU), which appeared to stop the rot in its share price with strong quarterly results after the bell, and pipeline operator Energy Transfer (NYSE:ET), whose earnings settled the debate about who really won from the great freeze in Texas in February. Cigna (NYSE:CI) results also came out early, some 12% ahead of expectations.
4. Report hits China stocks...
China’s stock markets ended the week heading in the other direction. After a Bloomberg report suggesting that Beijing is looking at further restrictions on companies that list overseas. That puts a question mark over their access to the U.S. pool of capital, which would undercut many companies’ valuations.
The main Chinese indices all fell by over 1% in response to the news, which came at the end of a week of negative newsflow regarding China’s economic and financial relationships with the rest of the world. The Biden administration said on Thursday that it won’t reverse Trump-era rules restricting U.S. investment in a handful of Chinese companies.  
There was better news from Chinese data, which showed massive year-on-year increases in both imports and exports, albeit from a very low base.
5. ...But China's trade data lifts commodities
The Chinese trade data underpinned further rises in industrial commodities, with Iron ore Futures trading over $200 a ton for the first time and copper futures breaking clearly above $10,000.  Zinc, Aluminum and Nickel Futures all also gained 1% in London trading overnight.
Oil prices lagged, however, again hit by negative newsflow from India, which again posted a new record high of new cases of Covid-19 on Friday at nearly  413,000, with 3,980 deaths also reported.
By 6:30 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were down 0.1% at $64.63 a barrel, while Brent futures were down 0.1% at $68.02.
The rally in commodities will make the CFTC’s weekly report on commitments of traders interesting later on, while Baker Hughes' oil rig count is also due.

1009,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2021 06:06AM ET</span>",Military coup puts Telenor's future in Myanmar on the line,"By Victoria Klesty, Gwladys Fouche and John Geddie
OSLO (Reuters) -Since Myanmar's military ordered telecoms operators to shut their networks in an effort to end protests against its February coup, Telenor's business there has been in limbo.
As one of the few Western companies to bet on the South East Asian country after it emerged from military dictatorship a decade ago, the return to army rule led to a $783 million write-off this week for Norway's Telenor.
The Norwegian state-controlled firm, one of the biggest foreign investors in Myanmar, must now decide whether to ride out the turmoil, or withdraw from a market which last year contributed 7% of its earnings.
""We are facing many dilemmas,"" Telenor Chief Executive Sigve Brekke told Reuters this week, highlighting the stark problems facing international firms under increased scrutiny over their exposure in Myanmar, where hundreds have been killed in protests against the Feb. 1 coup.
While Telenor plans to stay for now, the future is uncertain, Brekke said in a video interview. 
Although Telenor had won praise for supporting what at the time was a fledgling democracy, activist groups have long voiced concerns about business ties to the military, which have intensified since the army retook control of the country.
Chris Sidoti, a United Nations expert on Myanmar, said Telenor should avoid payments such as taxes or licence fees that could fund the military directly or indirectly, and that if it cannot be independently determined that Telenor is ""doing more good than harm"" in Myanmar, then it should withdraw.
However, Espen Barth Eide, who was Norway's foreign minister at the time Telenor gained a licence in Myanmar in 2013, told Reuters that Telenor should stay and use its position as a well-established foreign firm to be a vocal critic of the military.
A spokeswoman for Norway's Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries, which represents the Norwegian government as a shareholder, said on Thursday that ""under the current circumstances Telenor faces several dilemmas in Myanmar"".
""From a corporate governance perspective the investment in Myanmar is a responsibility of the company's Board and Management. Within this framework the Ministry as a shareholder keep a good dialogue with Telenor regarding the situation,"" the spokeswoman added in an emailed response to Reuters. 
The Myanmar junta, which has said it seized power because its repeated complaints of fraud in last year's election were ignored by the election commission, has blamed protesters and the former ruling party for instigating violence. 
And it said on March 23 that it had no plans to lift network restrictions. It has not commented on the curbs since and did not answer Reuters calls on Thursday.
NEW MARKET
Telenor is no stranger to operating under military rule in both Pakistan and Thailand, where it challenged the Thai junta over what it said was an order to block social media access.
At around the same time, Telenor was signing up its first customers in Myanmar. 
Its then-CEO, Jon Fredrik Baksaas, told Reuters that Telenor had thought ""a lot"" about the risk that Myanmar's experiment with democracy might not last.
""But we argued at that time that, when we get in a western company that delivers telecommunication in a country, we stand also with some responsibility, and a bit of a guarantee that things are done correctly,"" Baksaas said.
Its position had support internationally at the time after Barack Obama became the first U.S. President to visit Myanmar in 2012, the year after a military junta was officially dissolved and a quasi-civilian government installed.
For its part, the Norwegian government, which owns a majority of Telenor, had long supported democracy in Myanmar, hosting radio and TV stations reporting on it under military rule. 
And in 1991, the Norwegian Nobel Committee gave the Nobel Peace Prize to Aung San Suu Kyi, who spent 15 years under house arrest in Myanmar before leading a civilian government which retained power in last year's election.
Suu Kyi was detained after the coup and charged with offences that her lawyers say are trumped up. 
While Norway was supportive of Telenor's Myanmar venture, the government also warned of the risks, Barth Eide, Norway's foreign minister at the time, said.
""We told them that it's a complicated country which had a harsh military dictatorship. Telenor was very much aware of it ... It's not like they were novices,"" he added.
Telenor was one of two foreign operators granted licences in 2013, alongside Qatar's Ooredoo. The other operators in Myanmar are state-backed MPT and Mytel, which is part-owned by a military-linked company.
About 95% of Telenor's 187 million customers worldwide are in Asia and it has around 18 million customers in Myanmar, serving a third of its 54 million population. 
'NO DIRECT LINKS'
For Telenor, doing business in Myanmar had its challenges, including trying to avoid commercial ties to the military. 
Former CEO Baksaas said for the first couple of weeks after it began operations in Myanmar, staff had to sit on the office floor because Telenor refused to pay bribes to customs officials for furniture which it had imported.
He also said they had to navigate corruption risks when acquiring land to build mobile towers.
Then there was dealing with the military, whose economic interests range from land to firms involved in mining and banking. The military has faced allegations of human rights abuses including persecuting minorities and violently suppressing protests going back decades. It has repeatedly denied such allegations.
Activist group Justice for Myanmar said in a 2020 report that Telenor had shown ""an alarming failure"" in its human rights due diligence over a deal struck in 2015 to build mobile towers that involved a military contractor. 
Another report by the United Nations in 2019 said Telenor was renting offices in a building built on military-owned land.
The report said firms in Myanmar should end all ties with the military due to human rights abuses. 
A Telenor spokesperson said in an email on April 9 responding to Reuters questions that it had addressed the matter of the 2015 deal, without elaborating, and that its choice of office was ""the only viable option"" given factors like safety. 
""Telenor Myanmar has been focused on having minimal exposure to the military and have no direct links to military-controlled entities,"" the spokesperson said. 
Since the coup, Telenor has cut ties with three suppliers after finding links to the military, the spokesperson added. 
BALANCING ACT 
On the day of the coup, the military ordered Telenor and other operators to shut down networks. Telenor criticised the move but complied. Services were allowed to resume but there have been intermittent requests to close since, and the mobile internet has been shut since March 15.
Ooredoo has also said it ""regretfully complied"" with directives to restrict mobile and wireless broadband in Myanmar, which hit its first quarter earnings. It declined further comment on the outlook for its Myanmar business.
Like other operators, Telenor paid license fees to the now military-controlled government in March, which critics argue may help it finance repression of public protest.
Telenor said in the emailed response to Reuters that it made the payment ""under strong protest against recent developments"".
One of its major shareholders, Norway's KLP, said it had been in a dialogue with Telenor after the coup to ensure it was identifying the human rights risks.
""It is a challenging situation because Telenor cannot choose what it can and can't do. They get their directives from the authorities,"" said Kiran Aziz, senior analyst for responsible investments at KLP. ""It is difficult to assess how positive Telenor's contribution can be in this context.""
Weighing up human rights is just one of the dilemmas Telenor now faces, said CEO Brekke, alongside safely serving its customers and maintaining network access for them.
""We work on that balance every single day,"" he said. 

And although that balance, for now, is tilted to Telenor staying in the country, it is not a given. 
""We make a difference like we have done since we arrived. But with the situation being this unpredictable, it is impossible in many ways to speculate about the future and how this will develop,"" Brekke added.

In its report, German daily Die Welt said the reason for Paris' hesitation was unclear, but diplomats had speculated that it might want French companies to play a bigger part in vaccine production.
At recent meetings of European Union ministers about vaccine orders, French representatives held up decision-making by posing technical questions and requests for clarifications, Die Welt reported.
Asked about the report, a spokesman for France's Industry Ministry told Reuters: ""Contrary to what has been reported, France has officially backed the (vaccine) contract within the formal European Commission framework.""
""We are asking common sense questions with regard to the public health challenges we are facing.""
Due to massive global demand for booster doses as well as vaccines for young people, EU governments fear that they may be too late and lose out on the order.

""That would be a disaster for which France would be responsible,"" Die Welt quoted one diplomat as saying.
The EU has lagged countries such as Britain and the United States in getting its citizens vaccinated against COVID-19, causing tensions within the 27-nation bloc and prompting criticism of political leaders.

1011,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2021 05:50AM ET</span>","Activist Bramson abandons tussle with Barclays, selling stake","By John O'Donnell, Iain Withers and Carolyn Cohn
LONDON (Reuters) - Activist investor Edward Bramson has sold his firm's 6% stake in  Barclays  (LON:BARC), disbanding a three-year effort to overhaul the British bank and ending a stand-off with chief executive Jes Staley. 
Bramson's fund, Sherborne Investors, had pressured Staley since 2018 to scale back investment banking and demanded his removal over his links to U.S. financier and registered sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, but Bramson struggled to gain much traction.
The value of the Sherborne vehicle dedicated to the Barclays stake has fallen by around 150 million pounds ($209 million) compared to the 700 million pounds it raised when it was formed in 2017.
The fund, in which UK asset managers  Aviva  (LON:AV) and  Schroders  (LON:SDR) have stakes, said it had identified another company to invest in and has begun building a position in that firm, which it did not name.
Barclays declined to comment. 
""Business is not a science and so people of goodwill may, therefore, sometimes differ. In that spirit, Sherborne Investors expresses its most sincere wish that things will turn out well for Barclays, its employees, and its investors,"" Sherborne Investors Management said in a statement. 
One top 20 investor in Barclays, who declined to be named, said a recent rally in Barclays' shares on investor bets of a strong recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic had provided Bramson with an exit route and predicted he would opt for a less complex next target. 
Barclays shares have fallen roughly 15% since Sherbone first declared its stake in Barclays in March 2018.
The stock was up 2% on Friday.
'THE WAR IS OVER'
When Sherborne first invested, Barclays had been under pressure to bolster profits after Staley's aggressive push in investment banking since he joined in 2015 failed to significantly lift returns.
Barclays was Bramson's largest target to date. He engineered turnarounds at smaller firms including British private equity firm Electra after forcing his way onto the board. But a bid by Bramson for a board seat at Barclays was emphatically rejected by shareholders in 2019.
A strong showing by the investment bank helped it weather the COVID-19 pandemic, bolstering Staley's argument that it needed a diversified business to cope in a recession.
""The war is over,"" wrote Ian Gordon, a banking analyst at Investec. 
""We sense that investor appetite for a further round of heavy restructuring charges to execute such a repositioning of the group was limited"". 
Bramson also urged Barclays' board to replace Staley after the UK regulator said it was examining his links with Jeffrey Epstein, but failed to win support.
Staley has said he regrets having a professional relationship with Epstein, who killed himself while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.

Sherborne initially invested 580 million pounds in Barclays' shares and derivatives but the investment did little to lift its fortunes. 
The net asset value of the Sherborne fund is currently 79 pence per share, it said, compared to 99 pence in December 2017 before it made the Barclays investment.

LONDON (Reuters) -British Airways owner IAG (LON:ICAG) is confident travel will recover from July onwards after forecasting only a minimal increase in its capacity to 25% for the April to June quarter. 
IAG, which also owns Iberia and Vueling in Spain and Aer Lingus in Ireland, declined to forecast how much it would fly from July but said the recovery would be properly underway by then after more than a year of pandemic restrictions.
""We consider in the second half that we are going to be flying and we are prepared for that,"" IAG Chief Executive Luis Gallego told reporters on Friday after the company posted a loss of 1.14 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in the first quarter.
Before July, however, Gallego said government action was needed on some issues, such as opening travel corridors between countries with high vaccination rates, including the United Kingdom and the United States. 
The rise to 25% of pre-pandemic capacity puts IAG's plans behind those of rival airlines, and is only a marginal increase from the 19.6% it flew in the first three months of 2021.
Britain, which along with Spain is one of IAG's main markets, is set to publish later on Friday its ""green list"" of low risk places where people can travel without needing to quarantine on their return.
Gallego said IAG was expecting only a small list of countries initially with more being added from June onwards.
""Part of the reason we're not giving guidance (for third-quarter capacity) is simply because we don't know what's on the green list yet,"" Chief Financial Officer Steve Gunning said. 
Air France-KLM expects to operate 50% of its pre-pandemic flight capacity in the second quarter, picking up to 55% to 65% in July-September. Lufthansa expects to fly at about 40% of its pre-pandemic capacity for 2021 as a whole.
IAG's first-quarter operating loss before exceptional items of 1.14 billion euros was slightly better than the 1.17 billion euro loss forecast by analysts. 
Shares in the company, which have risen 30% since the beginning of the year, traded up 0.7%. 
""The company delivered a solid set of results and is pointing to the start of the recovery into the summer,"" Goodbody analyst Mark Simpson said.

Given the ongoing uncertainty over COVID-19, IAG said it could not provide a profit outlook for 2021.

(Reuters) -Holiday Inn owner IHG said on Friday demand was coming back strongly and forecast a busy U.S. summer season as travellers take advantage of an easing of coronavirus lockdowns. 
COVID-19 vaccinations and the relaxing of restrictions in regions including the United States, IHG's biggest market, have offered respite after a painful 2020, as has a trend to holiday closer to home in some of the company's largest locations. 
""There is clear evidence from forward-bookings data of further improvement as we look to the months ahead,"" Chief Executive Keith Barr said. 
IHG, which also owns the Crowne Plaza brand, said there was a notable pick-up in March, particularly in the United States and China, which had carried on into April. 
While revenue per available room (RevPAR), a key performance indicator, was down 50.6% in the first quarter, it was up 20.8% in March, with the Greater China region seeing a jump of 288.6%.
Shares in the UK blue-chip company, which have more than doubled since pandemic lows last year, were up 0.3% at 0810 GMT. 
FED UP OF BEING COOPED UP
IHG's UK rival  Whitbread  (LON:WTB) also forecast last month a significant bounce in demand this summer as more Britons holiday closer to home. 
""In resort locations, all of our hotels are very busy"", IHG finance chief Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson told a media call. 
""People are fed up with being cooped up, people want to travel."" 
He forecast demand for rooms in some U.S. locations would be greater than the availability this summer. 
IHG, which had called 2020 the most challenging year in its 200 year history, said the risk of volatility remained.
""The situation in India is a reminder for everybody that the pandemic is not over,"" Edgecliffe-Johnson said. 

IHG said it had repaid 600 million pounds ($834 million) it had taken under a UK government lending scheme introduced last year to help businesses cope with the pandemic.

Investing.com -- European stock markets traded higher Friday, helped by strong earnings from blue-chip companies ahead of the key monthly U.S. employment report.
At 3:45 AM ET (0845 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.7% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.1%, and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.3%, the latter two indices at 52-week highs, while the pan-Europe STOXX 600 gained 0.3%, climbing to a all-time high.
Robust corporate earnings have helped the European indices post gains Friday, as companies recover from the damage caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.
Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) stock rose 7.6% after the German sportswear company raised its 2021 sales outlook on Friday, saying it expects strong demand driven by new products as well as big sports events like the European soccer championship and the Copa America.
 Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) stock rose 2.7% after the German industrial giant raised its full year guidance for the second time this year as its net profit soared for the second quarter of fiscal 2021, helped by the sale of its mechanical-drives business Flender.
BMW (DE:BMWG) stock rose 0.2% after the German carmaker reiterated its full-year profit margin outlook, but it also warned that rising raw material costs could hurt earnings moving forward.
BioNTech (DE:22UAy) stock rose 4.2%, rebounding after Thursday’s sharp losses, after German Chancellor Angela Merkel rejected a U.S. proposal to waive patent protections for coronavirus shots, a move which would have hit the German drugmaker’s bottom line.
On the flip side, Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) stock fell 0.7% despite the French bank posting a sharp increase in net profit for the first quarter, but expectations were sky high after previous strong results from its peers. In the U.K.,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) stock rose 2.1% after activist investor Edward Bramson sold his stake, abandoning his attempt - funded by Barclays' competitors on Wall Street - to get rid of its investment bank.
The focus now shifts to the release of the U.S. nonfarm payrolls report later Friday, with this release closely watched given the Federal Reserve has made it clear that the strength of the labor market recovery is key in deciding its course for monetary policy.
Expectations are running high, maybe to the tune of one million jobs being added, after a release Thursday showed the number of Americans filing new claims last week for unemployment benefits fell to its lowest level since the pandemic started.
Back in Europe, German industrial production rose 2.5% in March, above expectations, while the equivalent French number fell 0.8%, pointing to an uneven recovery throughout the Eurozone.
Oil prices headed higher Friday, heading for another weekly gain as robust trade data from China, released earlier Friday, highlighted the global economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. 
U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% higher at $64.79 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.2% to $68.19. Both contracts are up more than 2% this week, heading for their first back-to-back weekly increases since early March.

1015,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 07, 2021 03:45AM ET</span>",China Considers Tighter Rules for Firms Listing Overseas,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s securities regulator is weighing tighter rules for companies seeking to list in Hong Kong or overseas, a move that could hit technology firms already smarting from months of clampdowns, according to people familiar with the matter.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission is considering proposals that would require firms seeking initial public offerings outside mainland China to submit listing documents to ensure they’re compliant with local laws and regulations, the people said. The scrutiny would also seek to prevent any leaks of sensitive data that might be of national security interest, the people added, requesting they not be identified as the matter is private. The discussions are preliminary and could be subject to change.
The CSRC didn’t immediately respond to a fax requesting comment.
The heightened regulatory concerns come as the U.S. tightens restrictions on Chinese firms listed on its exchanges, with legislation that requires the companies to allow inspectors to review their financial audits. China has long refused to let the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board examine audits of firms whose shares trade in America, citing national security interests.
The measures, if rolled out, could have far-reaching implications for a raft of upstarts that are on the verge of going public. Among them are Bytedance Ltd., which is said to be weighing a listing of some of its China units, and ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing, people familiar have said. The changes could also ensnare Chinese firms that already trade in foreign markets, requiring them to submit filings to regulators as well, one of the people said.
China’s current rules require all locally registered companies and some firms with offshore registrations to seek approval from the securities watchdog when they list in Hong Kong or outside the country. However, many internet stars like Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd., registered in places like Cayman Islands or the British Virgin Islands, fall outside the scope of the current regulations. The new rules would seek to lay out more specific reporting guidelines and standardize them across firms, one of the people said.
It is unclear what impact any news rules may have for companies that operate a so-called Variable Interest Entity -- a vehicle through which virtually every major Chinese internet company attracts foreign investment and lists overseas.
Regulators have issued a slew of measures placing greater scrutiny on the nation’s tech giants, curtailing their operations on everything from data collection and monopolistic practices. Among the orders issued by financial regulators in April were new guidelines on securitizing assets and seeking overseas listings.
China has already tightened measures for listings on domestic exchanges including Shanghai’s Nasdaq-style Star board. It’s restricted listings of fintech companies, and banned IPOs by firms that operate mainly in real estate and sectors related to financial investment.
The clampdown on tech firms led to the postponement of a $35 billion IPO by Jack Ma’s Ant Group Co. in November. On orders from regulators, Ant must drastically revamp its business and will be supervised more like a bank, a move with far-reaching implications for its growth.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's Biological E. Ltd will soon start Phase III trials of its COVID-19 vaccine and plans producing 75 million to 80 million doses a month from August, its managing director told Reuters on Friday.
The company has developed the vaccine with Baylor College of Medicine in Houston and Dynavax (NASDAQ:DVAX) Technologies Corp. Late last month it received approval from India's drug regulator to conduct a Phase III clinical trial, which Managing Director Mahima Datla said would begin soon.
Government officials have said the vaccine, which uses the recombinant-protein technology in which a harmless agent is used to stimulate an immune response in cells, could be rolled out in the country from August.
Datla said Biological E. would apply for emergency use authorisation (EUA) for the drug based on government advice.
Production ""from August but EUA depends on the government. Will follow their advice and directives,"" she said in a text message. ""75-80 million doses a month from the time of launch.""
Datla declined to comment on any firm deal to contract-manufacture the Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) vaccine. She told Reuters in February that Biological E. was looking to make about 600 million doses of the J&J vaccine annually.
J&J said last month it was in talks with India's government to begin a clinical trial of its single-dose shot.
India, battling the world's worst jump in coronavirus infections, has partially or fully immunized only about 10% of its 1.35 billion people. It has administered a total of 163 million doses of the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) shot and a domestically made one called Covaxin.
The country has also received doses of the Sputnik V vaccine from Russia though it has not been launched yet in the country. India has also urged Pfizer/BioNTech and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) to sell their shots to the country.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen edging higher at the open Friday, boosted by strong trade data out of China but with investors cautious ahead of the key monthly U.S. employment report.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.1% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.2%. 
Stock markets have climbed to record levels of late--the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at an all-time high on Wall Street on Thursday--as economic data has pointed to a strong global recovery.
This continued Friday as China posted an impressive trade performance in April, with exports surging 32.3% from a year ago as global demand for Chinese goods remained elevated as countries emerged from the restrictions put in place to combat the coronavirus pandemic.
The focus now shifts to the release of the U.S. nonfarm payrolls report later for another illustration of the economic bounce. Expectations are running high, maybe to the tune of one million jobs being added, after a release Thursday showed the number of Americans filing new claims last week for unemployment benefits fell to its lowest level since the pandemic started.
Friday’s report is widely watched as the Federal Reserve has made it clear that the strength of the labor market recovery is key in deciding its course for monetary policy.
Back in Europe, German industrial production rose 2.5% in March, above expectations, while eyes will also be on the equivalent French number as well as the U.K. April construction PMI reading.
It’s also another busy day for earnings, with Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) likely to be in focus after France’s second-largest bank by assets posted a sharp increase in net profit for the first quarter, as revenue rose and provisions for potential credit losses fell.
German industrial giant  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) raised its full year guidance for the second time this year as its net profit soared for the second quarter of fiscal 2021, helped by the sale of its mechanical-drives business Flender.
BMW (DE:BMWG) reiterated its full-year profit margin outlook Friday, but the German carmaker said that it expected the rest of the year to remain volatile and that rising raw material costs could hurt earnings moving forward.
The pharmaceutical sector could stay in the spotlight Friday following the news Thursday that the European Union backed talks over waiving patent protections for Covid-19 vaccines, following a U.S. proposal.
Oil prices headed higher Friday, heading for another weekly gain as the robust trade data from China highlighted the global economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. 
U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% higher at $65.02 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.5% to $68.44. Both contracts are up more than 2% this week, heading for their first back-to-back weekly increases since early March.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,820.55/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.2061.

(Reuters) -  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) suspended several accounts this week that were set up to share statements from a new part of former U.S. President Donald Trump's website, saying they broke its rules against evading an account ban.
Trump was banned from Twitter, where he had more than 88 million followers, and multiple other social media platforms following the deadly Jan. 6 siege of the U.S. Capitol by his supporters. 
On Tuesday, a page was added to Trump's site, dubbed ""From the Desk of Donald J. Trump,"" where he posts messages that can be shared by his audience to both Twitter and Facebook.
""As stated in our ban evasion policy, we'll take enforcement action on accounts whose apparent intent is to replace or promote content affiliated with a suspended account,"" a Twitter spokesman said in a statement.
A Trump representative said they had nothing to do with the suspended accounts, which included @DJTDesk, @DJTrumpDesk, @DeskofDJT and @DeskOfTrump1.
Twitter, which has said that its ban on Trump is permanent even if he runs for office again, has said users can share content from the Trump page as long as it does not fall foul of its ban evasion rules.

On Wednesday,  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)'s oversight board upheld Facebook's suspension of Trump but said the company should not have made it indefinite. The board gave Facebook six months to decide a proportionate response.
Trump plans to launch his own social media platform, an adviser has said.

BERKELEY, CALIFORNIA (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc told a California regulator that it may not achieve full self-driving technology by the end of this year, a memo by the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) showed.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk said during an earnings conference call in January that he was ""highly confident the car will be able to drive itself with reliability in excess of human this year.""
Tesla has also rolled out what it describes as a ""beta"" version of its ""full self-driving"" (FSD) program to a limited number of employees and customers since October, and Musk has touted the capability on Twitter. 
""Elon's tweet does not match engineering reality per CJ. Tesla is at Level 2 currently,"" the California DMV said in a memo about its March 9 conference call with Tesla representatives, including autopilot engineer CJ Moore. Level 2 technology refers to a semi-automated driving system, which requires supervision by a human driver. 
The memo was released by legal transparency group PlainSite, which obtained it under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). 
""Tesla indicated that Elon is extrapolating on the rates of improvement when speaking about L5 capabilities. Tesla couldn’t say if the rate of improvement would make it to L5 by end of calendar year,"" the memo said, referring to level 5 full autonomous technology. 
The California DMV, Tesla and Moore were not immediately available for comment. 
""Tesla indicated that they are still firmly in L2,"" California DMV said in the memo. ""As Tesla is aware, the public’s misunderstanding about the limits of the technology and its misuse can have tragic consequences."" 

The California Highway Patrol is investigating why a Tesla vehicle crashed into an overturned truck on a highway near Fontana, California, on Wednesday, killing the Tesla’s driver. The patrol did not say whether the Tesla was operating on Autopilot or not.
Federal highway safety regulators are investigating more than 20 accidents involving Tesla vehicles.

1022,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2021 12:10AM ET</span>","U.S. SEC chair tells Congress he plans new rules on climate risk, trading","By Katanga Johnson and Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The new chair of the U.S. securities regulator told lawmakers on Thursday the agency was considering new trading rules to address issues raised by this year's  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) trading saga and the meltdown of private fund Archegos Capital.
Gary Gensler also told the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, just three weeks after being sworn in as Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair, that he expected to propose new rules on corporate climate risk disclosures in the second half of 2021.
Democrats are pressing Gensler to take a tough stance on Wall Street after GameStop's fierce rally in January, fueled by bullish online posts on Reddit, and the March implosion of New York-based family office Archegos, exposed gaps in the SEC's rules.
They also want the SEC to implement President Joe Biden's agenda to incorporate the physical and business risks posed by climate change into financial rules. 
""It is critical for our cops on the block at the SEC to protect investors and ensure our markets are transparent and fair,"" said Maxine Waters (NYSE:WAT), the committee's Democratic chair.
Gensler said in prepared testimony that new rules being considered included: greater disclosure on short selling, a strategy used to bet a stock will fall; more transparency for securities lending, which underpins short-selling; and new reporting rules for the complex equity swaps that felled Archegos.
Gensler said he had also asked SEC staff to draft a request for public input on potential new rules to rein-in so-called ""gamification,"" whereby trading apps entice retail customers with game-like features such as points and competitions. 
Shares of GameStop soared in January after retail investors gathering on Reddit and trading on low-cost brokerage platforms bought the video game retailer's shares, causing big losses for hedge funds that were short sellers of the stock. 
As volatility soared, retail broker Robinhood curbed buying in GameStop and other stocks because it could not provide the cash its clearinghouse required to guarantee trades during the two-day trade settlement period.
Gensler, who developed a reputation for being tough on Wall Street when he ran the derivatives regulator from 2009 to 2014, said the incident was ""not good for millions of investors.""
He said the agency would review whether there was sufficient competition in the retail market, while SEC staff were also working on a proposal to expedite the two-day settlement process to reduce system risks. 
Republicans warned against over-reacting to the incident by restricting Americans' access to the market. ""We should not punish everyday American investors with...fewer investment options,"" said Patrick McHenry, the panel's top Republican. 
ARCHEGOS RISK
The GameStop episode was followed in March by the meltdown of Archegos, whose stock bets turned sour and left the fund and banks that financed its trades with about $10 billion in losses.
That incident highlighted the ""systemic"" risks posed by securities-based swaps which were not captured by new derivative market transparency rules introduced following the 2007-2009 financial crisis, said Gensler. SEC staff are preparing recommendations on how to fix that, he said. 

Gensler also said the agency was gathering feedback from investors on new rules for corporate climate risk disclosures, adding that any regulatory changes would likely require a lengthy rule-making process. A formal climate risk disclosure proposal would likely be published later in the year, he said. 
""Investors do want to bring some consistency and comparability to climate disclosure,"" he told lawmakers.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up Friday morning after U.S. shares closed at a record high on the back of positive economic data.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.27% by 10:58 PM ET (2:58 AM GMT) while the Shenzhen Component inched down 0.08%. The Caixin Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for April was 56.3. Trade data for April was also better than expected, with exports growing 32.3% year-on-year, imports growing 43.1% year-on-year and the trade balance at $42.86 billion.
U.S.-China tensions are also on investors’ radars after reports that U.S President Joe Biden’s administration will maintain the current limits on U.S. investments in certain Chinese companies.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 0.90%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 edged up 0.17%, with April’s services PMI coming in at a better-than-expected 49.5 earlier in the day.
Meanwhile, the COVID-19 vaccines developed by AstraZeneca PLC (LON:AZN) and  Moderna  Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) could reportedly be approved as soon as May 20, with officials from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare due to convene around that time.
South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.69% and in Australia, the ASX 200 rose 0.34%.
Treasuries were steady on Friday, with the benchmark 10-year yield near the 1.57% level which is well below recently hit highs.
Global shares were also boosted by positive employment data from the U.S., with Thursday’s initial jobless claims figure coming in at 498,000. The figure, below both the 540,000 claims in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the 590,000 claims filed during the previous week, is the lowest since mid-March 2020 when COVID-19 was declared a pandemic.
Separately, nonfarm productivity also rose a better-than-expected 5.4% quarter-on-quarter during the first quarter of 2021.
Investors are now turning their attention to the U.S. employment report for April, including non-farm payrolls, due later in the day.
“With jobless claims hitting a pandemic-era low, anticipation for the full jobs picture tomorrow mounts... today’s read is another proof point that we’re one step closer to full economic recovery,” E*Trade Financial (NASDAQ:ETFC) managing director of investment strategy Mike Loewengart told Bloomberg.
While the positive data boosted investor sentiment as the outlook for the U.S. economic recovery improved, concerns lingered over the implications of a faster-than-expected recovery on government and central bank stimulus measures.
The U.S. Federal Reserve continues to maintain a dovish policy. Various officials, including Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, have insisted throughout the week that it is too soon to talk about tapering. However, it is increasingly likely that a pullback could take place in the second half of 2021 as concerns over runaway inflation also mount.
“As we see some serious momentum building on the jobs front, all eyes will be on how these play into action taken by the Fed,” said E*Trade Financial’s Loewengart.
Concerns are also mounting that any excessive risk-taking could prompt the Fed to adjust its monetary policy even further. The central bank’s semi-annual Financial Stability Report, released on Thursday, said increasing risk appetite across a variety of asset markets is stretching valuations and creating vulnerabilities in the U.S. financial system."

The People’s Bank of China released a detailed set of instructions for public comment late Thursday, posting a May 21 deadline for feedback.
As revealed earlier by Hong Kong authorities, the program for individual investors will have a 150 billion yuan ($23 billion) cap in each direction, according to the draft rules. Mainland investors with at least 2 years investment experience and with more than 1 million yuan in net household financial assets in most recent three months will be qualified.
The announcement “marks another encouraging step towards the opening of mainland China’s capital markets and reinforcing Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre,” Daniel Chan, the head of Greater Bay Area at  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA)., in a statement.
HSBC and rivals have been beefing up their presence in anticipation of the plan, one of the building blocks in strengthening the Greater Bay Area, a region including Hong Kong and Macau and nine other cities that has more than 70 million people. The long-awaited program was announced without details in June last year, just before China also unveiled a sweeping security law in the city to crack down on anti-government dissent.
The authorities aim to roll out the program in the early part of the second half this year, Hong Kong Monetary Authority Chief Executive Eddie Yue said earlier this week.
Hong Kong has sought to reassure investors it will remain a stable place, with Chief Executive Carrie Lam lobbying for more financial integration to build the city’s presence as a hub for private wealth and as a prominent offshore renminbi center.

The Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT) said the request was made by Disney and Fox and that the deadline for the sale is May 7.
The deadline had been previously postponed for selling the Fox Sports channels because of the difficulty of completing the sale during the coronavirus pandemic.

The IFT said that the ""conditions prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which previously affected the sale process, today are different ... so extending the suspension period for the sale is not justified.""
The IFT in 2019 approved Disney's $71 billion purchase of Fox's film and television assets, subject to the sale of Fox Sports channels, due to the ""considerable"" accumulation of market power the acquisition would create.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - LATAM Airlines (OTC:LTMAQ) Group, the region's largest carrier, said on Thursday that it is seeing increased demand from South Americans seeking to travel to the United States to get vaccinated against the coronavirus. 
""The past few weeks we have seen an increase in that demand and in the occupancy of those planes, but we continue with a capacity that is infinitely lower than pre-pandemic,"" Ramiro Alfonsin, LATAM's chief financial officer, said. 
Chile-based LATAM on Thursday reported a net loss of $431 million in the first three months of the year, which executives said reflected the crushing second pandemic wave that hit the region. 
Latin America has been ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic, which has overwhelmed its weak health infrastructure while governments have struggled to secure coveted vaccines partly because of the higher purchase power of developed nations. 
As a result, some wealthier Latin Americans have been seeking vaccination in the United States, especially in recent weeks when the vaccines have become more widely available there. 
Alfonsin told reporters that LATAM passengers from Peru, Colombia and Ecuador are flying directly to the United States, while those from Argentina are flying via Santiago or Lima. 

Most travelers coming from Brazil, however, are not allowed into the U.S. because of fears that they will spread a local variant of the virus that experts say is more contagious. 
LATAM, which filed for bankruptcy restructuring last year because of the pandemic's effect on travel, expects to exit its Chapter 11 process in the United States by the end of the year, Alfonsin added.

Canadian Pacific (CP) had earlier agreed in its talks with U.S. railroad Kansas City Southern (KCS) to bear most of the risk of the merger deal not going through. It was going to buy KCS shares and place them in an independent voting trust, insulating the acquisition target from its control until the STB, which oversees freight rail, clears the deal.
""In order to close into voting trust, the transaction requires approval from shareholders of both companies along with satisfaction of customary closing conditions,"" CP said in a statement on Thursday. 
""CP would then acquire KCS shares and place them into the voting trust, at which point KCS shareholders will receive their consideration"", Canadian Pacific said.
CP and its larger rival Canadian National are in race to take over KCS, which would create the first direct railway linking Canada, U.S. and Mexico.
CN said on Thursday that it was encouraged by the STB's decision to approve the voting trust and maintained that it had presented a better bid. 

Last month, the U.S. STB granted a waiver to CP's $25 billion agreed bid for Kansas City Southern, which means the deal would not be subjected to the tougher railroad merger rules the regulator put in place in 2001.
CN said on April 20 it had offered to buy KCS railroad for about $33.7 billion.

(Reuters) -Peloton Interactive Inc on Thursday estimated an about $165 million hit to current-quarter revenue from a recall of its treadmills as the company laid out steps to improve the safety of the equipment.
Shares of the interactive fitness equipment maker reversed course to be up 5.9% at $88.73 in extended trading. They tumbled about 15% on Wednesday after the company announced the recall following reports of multiple injuries and the death of a child in an accident.
On a post-earnings call after the company beat estimates on demand for its flagship exercise bikes from stuck-at-home fitness enthusiasts, Chief Executive Officer John Foley said Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) would postpone the U.S. launch of Tread that was scheduled for May 27. 
The company is working with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to build an extra layer of safety features for the Tread+, including a digital pass code to protect against unauthorized use. 
Peloton, which has stopped sales of its treadmills in all markets, also flagged some issues with the new Tread such as reports of screws loosening and causing the touchscreen to detach from the unit. Tread sales are expected to begin after the CPSC completes its review, the company said.
The company will offer a full refund on returns of its Tread+ and Tread treadmills and waive monthly all-access subscriptions for both for three months. 
Peloton said it expects fourth-quarter sales of about $915 million, compared with estimates of $1.17 billion, while annual revenue forecast of $4 billion came in slightly below estimates and prior company outlook.
The recalls, along with the loss of revenue from subscription waivers, will impact fourth-quarter adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) by about $16 million, the company said.
RIDING HIGH
Meanwhile, revenue more than doubled to $1.26 billion in the third quarter, beating estimates of $1.11 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
Peloton emerged as a pandemic winner as home workouts become all the rage during prolonged lockdowns, with investors now focused on how demand will holdup as vaccine rollouts in key markets allow fitness centers to reopen and enthusiasts to train outside. 

Subscriptions at Connected Fitness, which includes interactive videos that stream live classes, more than doubled to about 2.08 million in the quarter.
Net loss attributable to Class A and Class B shareholders narrowed to $8.6 million, or 3 cents per share, from $55.6 million, or 20 cents per share, a year earlier.

While the Fed continues to call rising inflationary pressures “transitory,” the price action in markets across all asset classes points to a more severe condition. As such, the Aberdeen Standard Physical Precious Metals Basket Shares ETF (GLTR) is a product that could be a growth stock over the coming months and perhaps years because it holds long positions in gold, silver, platinum, and palladium, and precious metals remain in bull markets. Read on.
In the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, the Fed and other world central banks slashed interest rates to historically low levels. They rolled out quantitative easing to push rates lower further out along the yield curve. The price tag was a rise in many commodity prices to multi-year or all-time highs by 2011 and 2012. The central banks used the same tools in 2020 as the global pandemic threatened stability in the worldwide financial system. The only difference has been that in 2020 the amounts were far higher than in 2008.
Albert Einstein once defined insanity as doing the same thing and expecting a different result. Commodity prices have already begun reflecting the same price action that followed the 2008 stimulus. Precious metals can act as inflation barometers. While gold and silver prices have pulled back over the past months, platinum broke above a long-term technical resistance level in 2021, and palladium made new all-time highs last week. As inflationary pressures mount, the prospects for higher precious metals prices are rising. The Aberdeen Standard Physical Precious Metals Basket Shares ETF (GLTR) holds long physical gold, silver, platinum, and palladium positions. So rising inflation could make GLTR a growth stock over the coming months and years.

1034,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2021 07:06PM ET</span>","Beyond Meat loss exceeds forecasts on higher costs, slow restaurant sales","By Nivedita Balu and Hilary Russ
(Reuters) - Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) Inc on Thursday reported a wider quarterly loss than expected, as the plant-based meat maker incurred higher freight costs, spent heavily on testing new product launches, and sold less to pandemic-hit restaurants.
Shares of the California-based company fell nearly 7% in extended trading.
The company, which sells faux meat in over 100,000 outlets worldwide, last year benefited from consumers stockpiling their freezers with bulk packages of its ""burgers"" during stay-at-home orders across the United States. 
However, sales to restaurants took a hit as many closed. Chief Executive Officer Ethan Brown said during a call with analysts that he was seeing a ""slow thaw"" of that trend.
Even so, Beyond Meat expects the recovery in its food service business to lag the broader restaurant sector because it sells in many places where capacity is recovering more slowly, including sports venues.
As restaurant sales fell, the company accumulated more pea protein, leading to higher costs for warehousing, it said.
RIVALS CHOMPING
Competition is rising among plant-based protein makers. In 2020, U.S. plant-based retail sales reached $7 billion, up 27% year on year, according to the Good Food Institute and the Plant-Based Foods Association (PBFA).
Impossible Foods Inc, Beyond Meat's biggest rival, is preparing for a public listing which could value the company at around $10 billion or more, Reuters reported in April.
Brown said Beyond Meat's ""main competitor"" was discounting two-thirds of its sales and said he was ""not going to react and get into some sort of discounting war with them.""
Beyond Meat expects second-quarter revenue in the range of $135 million to $150 million, a rise of 19% to 32%. Analysts had forecast revenue of $142.8 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
In the first quarter ended April 3, net revenue rose about 11% to $108.2 million, missing estimates of $113.7 million.

Excluding one-time items, it lost 42 cents per share - wider than analysts' expectations of 19 cents.
Its bottom line swung to a net loss of $26.8 million from a profit of $1.8 million a year ago.

(Reuters) - The governor of Texas in an unusual move on Thursday asked the state's Supreme Court to accept an  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) petition seeking to reverse a state court decision in a climate change case. 
California municipal officials sued Exxon and other energy companies in 2017 seeking damages for rising sea levels they blamed on fossil fuel emissions, prompting a countersuit from the oil major in Texas. A Texas appeals court rejected Exxon's effort to depose California officials, leading to the oil company's state Supreme court petition. 
Texas Governor Greg Abbott in a friend of the court filing urged the state justices to accept Exxon's petition in a case with ""major implications for the energy industry in Texas."" 
Abbott, who as the state's attorney general sued the federal government 31 times, said the state appeals court decision contradicts federal rulings. 
""No Texan voted for any of these meddling California officials,"" wrote Abbott, adding the officials ""should mind their own business in California if they want to stay out of court in Texas."" 
Exxon declined to comment on the governor's letter. 

The oil company has been a frequent target of lawsuits filed by U.S. states and cities that have turned to courts to address climate-change issues. It had asked a Texas court for permission to depose California officials to expose what it claimed was a conspiracy to stifle its free speech. 
In the latest example of such lawsuits, New York City sued Exxon and others arguing they falsely sold gasoline as ""cleaner"" and advertised themselves as leaders in fighting climate change.

(Reuters) -Payments firm  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ) handily beat Wall Street expectations for quarterly profit on Thursday, as surging demand for bitcoin fueled a jump in cryptocurrency transactions on its peer-to-peer payment service Cash App.
Stripping out one-time costs, the payments firm, led by  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) top boss Jack Dorsey, earned 41 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected 16 cents per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Cash App generated $3.51 billion in bitcoin revenue, up eleven times from a year earlier, in a quarter when the most popular cryptocurrency hit $1 trillion in market capitalization for the first time.
Dorsey told analysts on a post-earnings call that the company views bitcoin as ""the internet's potential to have a native currency."" 
""This is going to be a long-term focus, enabling bitcoin to be a native currency. It removes a bunch of friction for our business, and we believe fully that it creates more opportunities for economic empowerment around the world,"" he said. 
Bitcoin has surged in value this year as the backing of top-tier companies including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc power its march to the mainstream. 
San Francisco-based Square said in February it had invested $170 million in bitcoin, raising its wager from the $50 million it had invested in the fourth quarter of 2020.
The company's top line was also strengthened by the shift to digital transactions, spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic that forced people to stay at home and shop online.

Gross payment volumes, a measure of the transactions processed on Square's platform, rose 29% in the first quarter to $33.1 billion.
Total net revenue jumped nearly four-fold to $5.06 billion.

(Reuters) - An investor group on Thursday called on  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM)'s board to recruit directors and senior executives with energy and clean fuels experience, echoing calls at the center of an ongoing proxy fight.
The Coalition for a Responsible Exxon (CURE), which includes Seattle City Employees Retirement System, Dana Investment Advisors and Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, called on the oil company to tie executive pay more closely to financial performance and greenhouse gas reduction, according to a draft seen by Reuters.
Exxon shareholders on May 26 are set to vote on the biggest corporate battle to be decided on environmental, social and governance criteria. Pitted against Exxon is a tiny hedge fund, Engine No. 1, that has nominated four directors. 
A spokesperson for CURE declined to say how many shares of Exxon its 135 members hold. Overall, the group represents $2.5 trillion in assets, it said. 
CURE proposes broadening board and management experience, and splitting the Exxon chairman and chief executive roles. Current outside directors include only one member with energy industry experience and overall the board does not have the ""confidence or expertise to challenge a powerful CEO/Chairman,"" it wrote. 
The combined CEO/chairman benefits shareholders and executive pay is determined by a committee of non-employee directors and gear to provide long-term shareholder returns, Exxon spokesman Casey Norton said.

The group's report did not recommend votes for or against existing Exxon directors. Its members do plan to vote for new board leadership, the report said.
Citing what it said was the lack of an energy transition strategy, it called for new hires with experience ""in the energy and climate sectors"" that could direct investments toward ""the energy transition and a decarbonizing global energy economy.""

(Reuters) - For decades, each generation of computer chips got faster and more power-efficient because their most basic building blocks, called transistors, got smaller.
The pace of those improvements has slowed, but International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) Corp on Thursday said that silicon has at least one more generational advance in store.
 IBM  introduced what it says is the world's first 2-nanometer chipmaking technology. The technology could be as much as 45% faster than the mainstream 7-nanometer chips in many of today's laptops and phones and up to 75% more power efficient, the company said. 
The technology likely will take several years to come to market. Once a major manufacturer of chips, IBM now outsources its high-volume chip production to Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd but maintains a chip manufacturing research center in Albany, New York that produces test runs of chips and has joint technology development deals with Samsung (KS:005930) and  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) to use IBM's chipmaking technology. 
The 2-nanometer chips will be smaller and faster than today's leading edge 5-nanonmeter chips, which are just now showing up in premium smartphones like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s iPhone 12 models, and the 3-nanometer chips expected to come after 5-nanometer.
The technology IBM showed Thursday is the most basic building block of a chip: a transistor, which acts like an electrical on-off switch to form the 1s and 0s of binary digits at that foundation of all modern computing. 
Making the switches very tiny makes them faster and more power efficient, but it also creates problems with electrons leaking when the switches are supposed to be off. Darío Gil, senior vice president and director of IBM Research, told Reuters in an interview that scientists were able to drape sheets of insulating material just a few nanometers thick to stop leaks.

""In the end, there's transistors, and everything else (in computing) relies on whether that transistor gets better or not. And it's not a guarantee that there will be a transistor advance generation to generation anymore. So it's a big deal every time we get a chance to say there will be another,"" Gil said.

Read on for an explanation.The digital transformation by businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic powered the tech sector to a rocket-like rally last year. This is evidenced by iShares Global Tech ETF’s (IXN) 41.8% returns in 2020. However, the economic recovery this year has motivated investors to bail out of expensive tech stocks in favor of potential post-pandemic winners. This has resulted in a selloff of tech stocks.
However, the adoption of hybrid working models by many companies during the pandemic, combined with huge demand for cloud services, cybersecurity and connected devices and sensors, and rising interest and investments in the 5G technology and artificial intelligence (AI), make analysts predict the global information technology market will hit $11.87 trillion by 2025, representing a 9% CAGR.

1046,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2021 05:16PM ET</span>",Texas freeze delivers billions in profits to gas and power sellers,"By Devika Krishna Kumar, Scott DiSavino and Jessica Resnick-Ault
(Reuters) - Natural gas suppliers, pipeline companies and banks that trade commodities have emerged as the biggest market winners from February's U.S. winter blast that roiled gas and power markets, according to more than two dozen interviews and quarterly earnings reports.
The deep freeze caught Texas's utilities off-guard, killed more than 100 people and left 4.5 million without power. Demand for heat pushed wholesale power costs to 400 times the usual amount and propelled natural gas prices to record highs, forcing utilities and consumers to pay exorbitant bills. 
After the storm, few companies wanted to talk about their financial gains, unwilling to be seen as profiting off others' hardships. But a clearer picture is emerging from quarterly earnings and as utility companies smarting from big bills sue to recoup their losses. 
The biggest winners were companies with access to supplies, including leading energy trader Vitol, gas suppliers  Kinder Morgan  (NYSE:KMI), Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD) and  Energy Transfer  (NYSE:ET), oil giant  BP  plc (LON:BP), and banks Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) (BofA) and Macquarie Group (OTC:MQBKY). 
The firms combined stand to reap billions of dollars in profits by selling gas and power during the storm, according to interviews and reviews of public documents. It is possible that some companies may never collect on those sales due to ongoing litigation, however. 
Losers include producers that could not deliver oil and gas due to frozen wellheads, gathering systems and processing stations. The week-long output loss cost shale producer  Pioneer Natural Resources  (NYSE:PXD) $80 million,  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) about $300 million, and  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) $800 million. 
Utilities are complaining of price gouging and of unwarranted supply cancellations. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is reviewing gas and power markets for potential market manipulation.
Goldman Sachs and Vitol did not comment. BofA did not respond to a request for comment.
'MAXIMUM WITHDRAWAL'
Energy Transfer appears to have been the biggest winner, saying in its quarterly results it expects gains of about $2.4 billion for the year from the storm. The pipeline giant made most of its money from trading and from selling what it had in storage during the period when prices skyrocketed.
Energy Transfer did not comment for this story. 
Rival Enterprise Products Partners said the storm led to gains of about $250 million in the first quarter.
Kinder Morgan, another gas storage and pipeline operator, earned about $1 billion during the storm, the vast majority from higher gas prices and sales. Anticipating high demand, Kinder Morgan said it dispatched workers and backup generators ahead of the storm to its gas storage and pipeline facilities.
A source close to BP (NYSE:BP) said gas trading contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to the company's first quarter results. Chief Executive Bernard Looney said he wanted to ""deftly avoid"" giving an exact number for the trading division's results. 
Graphic: Texas gas prices soars during February freeze - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/jznvnreddvl/Pasted%20image%201620219759793.png 
At the beginning of February, gas prices ranged from $2.50 to $3 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) at hubs from Houston to Tulsa, Oklahoma. Prices began climbing on Feb. 11 into the hundreds of dollars, with Tulsa's hub surging to a record $1,192.86 on Feb. 17, according to government data.
""That's what happens when you go from a very well supplied market to a very tight market, and in this case a catastrophically tight market,"" said one natural gas trader. ""That was very localized pain, and it really surprised a lot of people.""
Energy traders with three Texas electric cooperatives told Reuters they paid as much as $400 per mmBtu during a four-day stretch that began Valentine's Day weekend. They requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the crisis. San Antonio's municipal utility CPS Energy said its gas bill for the week was about $700 million. 
""I've been tracking natural gas markets for 20 years. I've never seen price increases like we saw,"" said Tyson Slocum, an energy and environmental advisory committee member at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and a director at Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy organization.
WINNING AND LOSING 
Australia's Macquarie, the second-largest marketer of U.S. natural gas, said its trading around the storm boosted its overall profit outlook for the year by about 10%, which analysts estimated at about A$400 million ($317 million).
Ahead of the storm, Macquarie traders researched how previous cold fronts disrupted infrastructure to prepare a plan, said sources within the firm, who requested anonymity. The company did not comment for this story. 
Texas's grid operator ERCOT canceled $1 billion in service charges and state officials are considering securitizing unpaid ERCOT bills from electric companies that defaulted. 
Many of the firms that profited from trading, such as Goldman Sachs and BofA, are also facing losses from their exposure to utilities and electric co-operatives that have declared bankruptcy, according to court filings.
BofA made hundreds of millions via its trading arm, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter, but it is owed nearly $480 million by Brazos Electric Power Cooperative, which filed for bankruptcy. 
Disputes over price gouging and reneged contracts have also emerged after some suppliers declared the freeze was a force majeure event that allowed them to suspend contracts.

Macquarie was sued by Exxon seeking to void an $11 million gas bill. CPS Energy sued BP, Chevron, Energy Transfer and others for submitting bills that ran into the hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Texas wind farm operators also have filed lawsuits against trading arms of  JP Morgan Chase  (NYSE:JPM) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), maintaining the cold snap was an extreme event that overrode contracts for power generation and delivery.

(Reuters) - Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings Ltd said its plans for resuming mid-summer U.S. sailings could be in jeopardy, a day after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) laid out new technical instructions for the cruise industry.
The health agency, which recently said it was ""committed"" to the resumption of passenger operations, on Wednesday issued requirements for starting simulated trips and applying for a COVID-19 conditional sailing certificate to begin sailing with restricted passenger voyages.
The new guidance also includes CDC cruise ship inspections during simulated and restricted passenger voyages.
""Our team is working through the new guidance, but at first glance, however, it appears the path forward is a bit rockier and a bit steeper than originally expected,"" Norwegian Cruise Chief Executive Officer Frank Del Rio said on an earnings call on Thursday.
Norwegian Cruise's shares declined 5% after it said the lead time needed to ready its ships could delay the restart.
Truist Securities analysts have estimated it takes about 60 days to get a ship ready, noting a July U.S. restart is not a sure thing.
""We're perplexed. We're flabbergasted. We're outraged,"" CEO Del Rio said, when asked about CDC's treatment of the cruise industry.

The parent of Oceania Cruises, however, reiterated its plans to resume U.S. sailings in July.
Norwegian Cruise also said bookings for the first half of 2022 was ahead of pre-pandemic levels even as its revenue slumped more than 99% to $3.1 million in the first quarter ended March 31.

The company posted an underwriting income of $73 million in its general insurance business in the quarter, compared with a loss of $87 million a year earlier, when it booked large losses related to the pandemic.
AIG, one of the largest U.S. insurers, said it had set aside $422 million for catastrophe losses in the unit, primarily related to winter storms, but estimated no COVID-19-related losses.
Global insurers last year faced a sharp rise in payouts related to the health crisis at a time when investments they rely on to pay claims unraveled.
Investment returns have now recovered and many insurers have seen a fall in coronavirus-related claims as vaccine rollouts help more economies to reopen. 
Adjusted after-tax income attributable to AIG common shareholders rose to $923 million in the quarter ended March 31, from $105 million a year earlier.
Excluding items, AIG earned a profit of $1.05 per share, exceeding analysts' estimates of 97 cents, according to Refinitiv IBES. 
The insurer's general insurance accident year combined ratio - which excludes catastrophe losses - was 92.4 for the quarter, compared with 95.5 a year earlier.
A ratio below 100 means the insurer earns more in premiums than it pays out in claims.
Gross premiums written rose 6% to $10.73 billion in the general insurance business, driven by the insurer's North America and international commercial lines.

AIG's life and retirement unit posted a 57% jump in adjusted pre-tax income to $941 million, driven partly by higher private equity returns.
The life insurance business, however, booked an adjusted pre-tax loss of $40 million, largely reflecting more deaths from the virus outbreak.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile's lower house of Congress approved on Thursday an opposition-led bill that would slap a progressive royalty on sales of copper as prices rise, sharply hiking taxes on the sprawling industry to pay for social programs during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The legislation, which passed following a heated, hours-long debate, now heads to the country's Senate where it is likely to face several more procedural votes. 
Proponents say proceeds will fund development and infrastructure in mining regions and underwrite social programs vital to Chileans suffering from the COVID-19 pandemic. But the country's copper industry fears it could chill investment in world top copper producer Chile and drag on global supply.
The bill proposes a base rate royalty of 3% on copper and lithium sales, as well as other metals. 
But in the case of copper, as prices soar, so too would the tax, with marginal rates beginning at 15% of sales for prices between $2.00-$2.50 per pound and cresting at 75% of additional income at prices of over $4.00/lb. Lawmakers have yet to define a sliding scale on other metals.
On Wednesday, copper hit $10,040 a tonne, its highest since February 2011.
Most large copper miners in Chile currently pay a flat, or invariable rate regardless of the price of the red metal, under agreements that run through 2023, according to Chile's mining ministry. Official government statistics show miners currently pay 27% of pre-tax profits, in addition to other levies.
Chile's National Mining Society (SONAMI), which encompasses all of the country's top miners, labeled the latest proposal a death knell ""akin to expropriation.""
SONAMI president Diego Hernandez said Thursday there had yet to be a serious debate over the bill's impact, and called the current iteration a vote in favor of ""no more mining in Chile.""
Daniel Nunez, a communist party lawmaker and outspoken advocate of the bill, said miners should ""quit their crying.""

""The big miners in Chile should pay more when they earn more,"" he said, emphasizing the needs of Chileans at a time when company profits from the sale of copper are soaring.
Chile currently churns out 28% of the world's copper but has for more than a decade lost market share, hobbled by declining ore grades and ageing projects.

MONTREAL (Reuters) -The United States has joined an international investigation into suspected bribery related to decade-old sales of Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF) jets to Garuda Indonesia, the Canadian planemaker said on Thursday.
Bombardier, the latest aerospace group to face scrutiny over middlemen in past jet deals, said the U.S. Department of Justice requested documents and information in February relating to the acquisition and lease of its CRJ1000 aircraft to the Indonesian airline between 2011 and 2012.
A Bombardier spokesman said the company was cooperating fully.
In November, Britain's Serious Fraud Office said it was investigating Bombardier over suspected bribery in the transactions.
Authorities in Britain, France and the United States struck a record $4 billion bribery settlement with Europe's Airbus last year, as well as an $800 million plea deal with British engine maker Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY) in 2017.
Both settlements covered sales of planes or engines to several airlines including Garuda.
Garuda could not be reached for comment outside business hours.
In May 2020, an Indonesian court handed Emirsyah Satar, Garuda chief executive from 2005 to 2014, an eight-year jail sentence for bribery and money-laundering related to the procurement of planes and engines from Airbus and Rolls-Royce.
In November, after Britain's SFO announced its investigation into Bombardier, Garuda's current CEO and the Indonesia government pledged to cooperate with relevant authorities.
NO 'SELF REPORT'
Bombardier has undergone several changes of leadership since the deals and has sold most aerospace activities, including the CRJ regional jets.
Its new management now faces parallel probes that can take years, according to lawyers familiar with similar cases, and can also require the company to dive deep into its records using outside lawyers.
Under deferred prosecution agreements used in past aerospace corruption probes in Britain, the United States and elsewhere, companies suspected of corruption can avoid corporate criminal charges by paying fines and making sweeping internal changes.
Fines can be reduced if a company takes any suspicions it may have about its conduct directly to prosecutors, a process known as ""self-reporting,"" before being approached by them.
Airbus last year won a discounted fine for such early disclosure, but only after cooperation that included mounting its own four-year investigation spanning 60 million documents held by 800 people, forensic data firm FRA told the BBC.
Bombardier says its own sequence of events was different.
""When the SFO reached out we knew nothing about this. And then yes we started our own investigation internally,"" Chief Executive Eric Martel told reporters.
""So far we’ve been looking at it since the SFO reached out and now the DOJ is reaching out but you know on our side we haven’t found anything. But we will definitely continue to collaborate.""

Britain's Rolls-Royce failed to approach the SFO first but still avoided a larger fine by later showing what a British judge termed ""extraordinary"" cooperation.
This week, the SFO ended a separate criminal investigation into individuals associated with Airbus, according sources familiar with the investigation.

1053,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2021 04:41PM ET</span>","Stocks gain, commodities rise on inflation worries","By Herbert Lash
NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar fell and a gauge of global equity markets rose on Thursday as surging commodity prices spurred the prospect of rising inflation and led investors into economically-sensitive stocks on the reflation trade.
Aluminum prices approached levels last seen in 2018 and copper prices flirted with 10-year peaks. Gold jumped more than 1% as the weaker dollar and easing Treasury yields propelled the precious metal, an inflation hedge, above the key $1,800 an ounce psychological level.
Treasury yields moved in a narrow range as bond traders largely shrugged off better-than-expected initial U.S. jobless claims data and waited for Friday's April non-farm payrolls report for market direction.
Investors fear inflation may be more prolonged than what the Federal Reserve has conveyed, said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. 
""The spike in commodity prices in particular, the shortage of semiconductors and shipping resources, for example, is worrying the market,"" Ghriskey said. ""It's a value day or cyclical day in the (equity) market."" 
The Russell 1000 Value index gained 0.8%, outpacing the Russell 1000 Growth index, which rose 0.5%. Advancing shares outnumbered decliners on Wall Street, where a late-day rally reversed that order.
MSCI's benchmark for global equity markets, which tracks stocks in 50 countries, rose 0.64% to close at 704.14. The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.1%. 
The travel and leisure sector was the worst performer in Europe, falling 1.7% after UK rail operator Trainline reported an annual loss.
Heavyweight oil stocks fell in Europe but rose on Wall Street as the rally turned energy positive. Healthcare was the only S&P 500 sector to close in the red.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.93%, the S&P 500 gained 0.82% and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.37%.
Healthcare took a hit as vaccine makers fell after President Joe Biden backed plans for patent waivers on COVID-19 shots, but losses were capped by the upbeat jobless claims report.
 Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) fell 1.0% and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc 1.4%. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) rose 0.4% and  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) Inc 0.5%. All are involved in the making of COVID-19 vaccines.
In Asia, Japan's Nikkei jumped 1.8% as it reopened after a five-day holiday. Chinese shares also resumed trade for the first time since last week and wobbled as the CSI300 fell 1.2%, led by falls in biotech firms.
The Canadian dollar hit a three-and-a-half year high versus the greenback, helped by oil price gains and the Bank of Canada's recent shift to more hawkish guidance. The Australian dollar fell sharply overnight when China said it would stop its economic dialogue with Australia, but the currency later recovered to trade about 0.3% higher.
The Treasuries yield curve flattened for a fifth session, as yields on the long end stalled amid increased investor demand and as the Fed repeatedly affirmed its dovish stance. The spread between U.S. 2-year and 10-year yields slid to 140.8 basis points.
The 10-year note fell 1.3 basis points to yield 1.5714%. ""We're stuck in a battle,"" said Ellis Phifer, managing director in fixed income research at Raymond James in Memphis, Tennessee. ""The growth story is leading to inflation, while the Federal Reserve is jawboning, trying to keep expectations down, which I think is the right thing to do."" U.S. yields briefly inched higher after data showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits totaled a seasonally adjusted 498,000 for the week ended May 1, compared to 590,000 in the prior week.
The dollar index fell 0.377%, with the euro up 0.45% to $1.2059. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.11% versus the greenback at 109.07 per dollar.
Investors drew comfort from the latest economic data and forecasts in Europe, which pointed to a recovery still on track.
Retail sales in the euro zone beat expectations with a 2.7% rise in March as curbs on shoppers eased. 
The Bank of England increased its forecast for Britain's economic growth this year after its coronavirus slump.
Gold settled above $1,800 an ounce for the first time in 10 weeks.
U.S. gold futures settled 1.8% higher at $1,815.70. 

Oil prices gave up initial gains despite crude stockpiles in the United States, the world's largest oil consumer, falling more sharply than expected.
Brent crude futures fell 87 cents to settle at $68.09 a barrel. U.S. crude futures settled down 92 cents at $64.71 a barrel.

Because energy usage is expected to regain pre-pandemic levels soon, master limited partnership Sunoco (SUN) could witness solid improvement in its financials. Thus, we think the stock could be a good bet now. Read on.Sunoco L.P. (SUN) is a retail motor fuel distributor across the U.S. The company operates as a Master Limited Partnership (MLP), a structure that is a hybrid of a limited partnership and public corporation. MLP companies resemble a limited partnership company, but their shares are traded on stock exchanges. Thus, SUN operates as a public limited company, but it is taxed as a partnership. This is immensely beneficial because MLPs are not required to pay corporate taxes on their operating profits.
Shares of SUN have gained 46.6% over the past year and 27.3% year-to-date. In addition, the stock gained 6.3% over the past five days.
As the economy regains pre-pandemic levels on a fast-paced vaccination program and federal rescue spending, demand for motor fuel is expected to rise substantially.

Read on for such an evaluation.Castor Maritime Inc. (CTRM) and Matson, Inc. (MATX) are two established players in the shipping industry. They provide ocean transportation services. Based in Cyprus, CTRM provides seaborne transportation services for dry bulk cargo, including iron ore, coal, grains, steel products, fertilizers, cement, bauxite, sugar, and scrap metals. MATX, headquartered in Hawaii, operates through two segments: Ocean Transportation and Logistics.
Shipping companies were hit severely by the COVID-19 pandemic owing to global travel restrictions and and industrial production slowdown. But many of them appear to now be on a path of recovery this year. According to Statista, roughly 80% of the goods are transported by ships. Because the industry is expected to benefit from the recovery of international trade this year, we think it could be wise for investors to investigate the prospects of CTRM and MATX.
While MATX has returned 76.8% over the past nine months, CTRM has gained 127.5%. In terms of past six-month performance, CTRM is a clear winner with 274.5% returns versus MATX’s 18.4%. But which of these two stocks is a better pick now? Let's find out.

Chief Executive Éric Martel told analysts that aircraft pricing would be in line with what was expected or even slightly better. A rebound in U.S. business aviation traffic to pre-pandemic levels is expected to bolster higher-margin aftermarket services as planes fly more.
Montreal-based Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF) reported a 43% increase in quarterly adjusted profit and used less free cash, helped by a recovery in business aviation, as rising COVID-19 vaccinations encourage travel.
The company pre-flagged earnings on Monday while disclosing it was seeking bondholders' consent to amend terms on eight bond issues. The move followed claims by a bondholder that recent sales of non-core assets breached the terms of certain notes. 
Martel told reporters ""we feel pretty good about the preliminary discussions"" with the bondholders, adding the results of the vote will come out next Tuesday.
Bombardier also disclosed that the United States has joined an ongoing investigation into its sales of jets to Garuda Indonesia a decade ago.
Bombardier has emerged as a pure-play business jet maker after divesting assets, including its rail business to  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) in January.
Free cash flow usage, a metric closely watched by investors, improved by $357 million year-over-year, Bombardier said. The first quarter book-to-bill, which measures orders to deliveries, was greater than 1.0 on strong sales activity, which is expected to continue into the second quarter, it said.

Bombardier's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) jumped 43% to $123 million in the first quarter, from a year earlier. Business jet revenue increased by 18% to $1.3 billion in the quarter.
It expects to deliver between 110 and 120 business aircraft in 2021 after full-year deliveries fell 20% to 114 jets in 2020.

1068,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2021 02:56PM ET</span>","Massachusetts sues Publicis over ties to Purdue Pharma, opioids","By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) -Massachusetts sued a unit of French advertising company  Publicis Groupe  SA (PA:PUBP) on Thursday, accusing it of fueling the U.S. opioid crisis by using unfair and deceptive marketing to help drugmaker Purdue Pharma sell more OxyContin.
The state attorney general Maura Healey said Publicis Health created a public nuisance from 2010 to 2019 through its work for drugmakers on campaigns to persuade doctors to prescribe more opioids, including to patients who did not need them.
Purdue alone paid Publicis more than $50 million for its work, which continued even after Publicis proposed in 2016 that Purdue shut down its sales force to ""fully embrace a deeper-held responsibility"" the drugmaker owed the public, Healey said.
""They knew what they were doing was wrong, they made the opioid crisis worse, and they kept cashing Purdue's checks,"" Healey told reporters in a Zoom meeting. ""What they did was wrong. It hurt people. It killed people.""
A Publicis Health spokesman said there was no legal basis for the lawsuit, and that the statute of limitations had run out. He also said the company's work was ""completely lawful,"" and limited to implementing Purdue's advertising plan and buying ad space.
The advertising agencies Leo Burnett and Saatchi & Saatchi are among Publicis' other businesses.
Healey's lawsuit filed in a state court in Boston seeks civil penalties and restitution to victims.
It followed agreements this year by the consulting firm McKinsey & Co to pay $641 million to resolve lawsuits by all 50 U.S. states, Washington, D.C., and five U.S. territories over its role in the opioid epidemic.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said nearly 500,000 people died from opioid overdoses from 1999 to 2019.
Purdue is operating in bankruptcy. In March, it proposed a restructuring plan that would steer profits to opioid victims, and require members of the Sackler family who own the company to contribute nearly $4.3 billion.

(Reuters) -A top fund industry leader on Thursday urged U.S. regulators to adopt only voluntary climate-related disclosure standards for public companies rather than the stricter rules sought by some activists and investment firms.
Eric Pan, CEO of the Investment Company Institute, which represents asset managers and other big U.S. investors, said the softer approach would give companies time to adjust to new technologies and scientific evidence, during his speech at the trade group's virtual conference on Thursday.
Pan said companies should ""not be hampered by prescriptive, 'hard-wired' disclosure requirements - which would be nearly impossible to set today to successfully govern disclosure between now and 2050,"" the date set by U.S. President Joe Biden for the nation to reach net-zero emissions.
Leaders of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are taking public input on how they might direct companies to report more about the environmental and social impact of their operations. 
Investors have poured money into funds using sustainability criteria, allowing portfolio managers to push companies to take steps like disclosing more about their emissions. Larry Fink, CEO of top fund firm BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), last month called for mandatory disclosures for both public and private companies worldwide.
The head of JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), Jamie Dimon, who also spoke at the conference, said required disclosures could be onerous, expensive and would not help fight climate change. 
""Reporting won't solve the problem,"" Dimon said, adding he is concerned about multiple agencies proposing different disclosure requirements. ""If we just impose rule after rule, we’re going to not accomplish anything (and it will come) at a huge cost.""
Currently many large U.S. companies produce ""sustainability reports"" but using a dizzying array of non-common standards, making them hard to prepare and to compare. 
On April 21 the European Union said it plans to raise the number of companies required to report ESG data amid criticism the current rules are ineffective.

Pan noted his trade group's board has previously backed two widely used voluntary disclosure standards, those of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures and from the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board. 
The SEC should encourage the use of both standards, Pan said, and work toward getting companies to provide detailed climate risk information rather than ""bland, boilerplate disclosure that is geared mainly at minimizing legal liability.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Nasdaq Inc has withdrawn a decision to delist the shares of Luokung Technology Corp, the Chinese mapping technology company said on Thursday, after a U.S. judge suspended an imminent investment ban imposed under the former Trump administration.
The ruling and listing news sent shares of the company nearly 20% higher. Luokung, in a news release on Thursday, said Nasdaq had notified the company that it has withdrawn its delisting letter and shares would continue to trade on the market, and would not be suspended on May 7. A Nasdaq spokesman declined to comment.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Luokung is the second company on a U.S. list of alleged Communist Chinese military companies subject to an investment ban to win a preliminary injunction halting the designation.  
U.S. District Court Judge Rudolph Contreras in Washington issued a similar order in March in favor of Beijing-based smartphone maker Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) Corp.
In granting an injunction in the case brought by Luokung's challenge of the ban, Contreras said the Department of Defense's designation process was flawed.
“Many of the associations the Department of Defense seemed most troubled by - such as Luokung’s purported forays into space systems or its potential future contracts with the Chinese National Geospatial Information Center ... do not appear to have materialized, nor are they likely to bear fruit before this case can be decided on the merits,” Contreras wrote in his decision. 
He added the government has not identified a single technology transfer from Luokung to the People's Republic of China. 

In the Xiaomi case, the U.S. acting solicitor general decided that the government would not appeal the preliminary injunction, according to an April 27 filing. Given that decision, the U.S. said it was still deciding the path forward and whether the case could be resolved. A new status report is due May 11.
More than 40 companies were added to a U.S. Department of Defense list of alleged Chinese military-controlled companies in the waning days of the Trump administration, making them subject to an executive order barring Americans from buying securities in such companies.

1071,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2021 02:40PM ET</span>",COVID-19 vaccine maker shares sink as governments mull patent waiver,"By Ankur Banerjee, Lewis Krauskopf and Julien Ponthus
(Reuters) - Shares of COVID-19 vaccine makers fell on Thursday as governments debated plans to waive patent protection for the shots, with analysts saying the move could rattle investor sentiment or weigh on longer-term business prospects.
The declines came even as some analysts raised doubts about any near-term pressure on COVID-19 vaccine sales from discussions of waiving intellectual property rights, given the manufacturing complexity and scarcity of raw materials.
Combined,  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc have forecast a total of over $45 billion in sales this year for their COVID-19 vaccines.
Among companies with COVID-19 vaccines, shares of Pfizer fell 1.7% and were among the biggest weights on the benchmark S&P 500 index, while U.S. shares of its German partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) shed 0.6% after falling as much as 15% earlier.
Moderna was off 1.3%, recovering after being down nearly 12%, while Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc were little changed, as the broad S&P 500 rose 0.2%.
""This measure is a potential risk to the long-term tail for the vaccine players – though we remind investors that the Street and share prices were already skeptical on the longer-term sustainability of these businesses,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts said in a note.
Shares were initially rattled late on Wednesday after U.S. President Joe Biden backed a proposed waiver for intellectual property rights.
The Biden administration move was welcomed by patent activists and the World Health Organization as it could increase availability of vaccines to poorer nations including India, which has become the latest epicenter of the pandemic with its hospitals overwhelmed and shortages of oxygen and medicines.
The stocks pared steeper earlier losses on Thursday after a German government spokeswoman said the U.S. proposal would have significant implications for production. Despite Biden's backing, it could take months for the World Trade Organization (WTO) to hammer out any deal.
Shares of other U.S. companies developing COVID-19 vaccines were shaken.  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) Inc, whose vaccine has yet to be authorized by any country but is gearing up for deliveries later this year, fell nearly 10% initially but were up 1.6% in afternoon trade.
Vaccine maker shares lost ground elsewhere, with Germany's Curevac NV, which has sought approval for its COVID-19 vaccine, tumbling 18%. 
Shares of China's CanSino Biologics Inc, which makes a single-dose COVID-19 vaccine, were off 15%. 
The slide in stocks was understandable given patent headlines, but is likely an over-reaction, said Zhiqiang Shu, biotechnology analyst at Berenberg in New York.
""The production of mRNA vaccines is not just about intellectual property,"" he said of the technology used to make the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech shots. ""A lot of other things are in play, such as manufacturing know-how and capacity. Other companies or countries are unlikely to produce mRNA shots quickly.""
Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Michael Yee said while the proposal was not a good ""headline"" for biotech and could weigh on valuations, ""the bottleneck is neither access nor patents (or price) but simply that there aren't enough vials, raw materials, etc to manufacture it regardless of patents.""
Moderna said on Thursday it believes countries around the globe would continue buying its COVID-19 vaccine for years even if its patents are waived, noting that rivals would face significant hurdles in scaling up manufacturing.

 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Matthew Harrison said he did not see significant practical implications for Moderna from this news.
""We do not believe the WTO has any mechanism to force management to teach other manufacturers how to make their vaccine,"" he said, adding that it could take six to nine months to scale production.

In a pre-trial hearing on Thursday, Mark Lanier, arguing for Texas and the other states, said the burden was on them to prove the case against Google and that they could be ready quickly. ""We're able to put focused people on this to make this their reason for living,"" Lanier told the judge.
The Texas lawsuit accuses Google of violating the law in how it dominates the process of placing ads online. Website publishers complain that one result has been lower revenues.
Google denies any wrongdoing. 
Speaking for Google, Paul Yetter said it had recently received 1.1 terabytes of data comprising more than a million documents from the states regarding the complicated, multi-pronged lawsuit and that it needed time to get up to speed.
""I think we all would agree that if you have a big head start you want a short race. And they do have a big head start,"" Yetter said.

Judge Sean Jordan of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, who is hearing the case, did not set a trial date during the hearing. He is also expected to respond to a motion by Google to move the trial to California, where the company is fighting other, similar cases.
The case being considered in Texas is one of three big antitrust lawsuits filed against Google last year.

So, let’s look closer at these names.The U.S. economy continues to recover thanks to a fast-paced, nationwide vaccination program, impressive fiscal stimulus, and monetary policy support. However, rising concerns about the potential for inflation, President Biden’s tax proposal, and the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in several countries, are driving significant market volatility.

Consequently, all the three major indexes are hitting new highs each week. And although investors continue to be concerned about rising Treasury yields and inflationary pressures, they appear pleased with the government’s stimulus measures and improving employment data. As such, we think  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) (DDAIF (OTC:DDAIF)), Hologic (NASDAQ:HOLX), Getinge AB (GNGBY), and Hill-Rom Holdings (NYSE:HRC) are well positioned to benefit in current market conditions. Let’s review these names.The COVID-19 pandemic precipitated the biggest economic crisis of the century. However, the stock market has recovered and galloped ahead since its major correction in March 2020. The broader market hit several new highs last year and that momentum has been continuing so far this year. The S&P 500 has returned more than 45% over the past year. In fact, during Wednesday’s trading session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a new intraday record, rising nearly 200 points at one point, and ending at a new closing high.
There are several factors that are influencing the market’s run. The most prominent of them is investors' growing optimism about a solid economic recovery this year. Also, the Biden administration has been making proactive economic decisions to help the country to recover quickly from the pandemic’s ravages. Following a $1.9 trillion rescue package, President Biden now aims to inject billions of dollars more into the economy through a sweeping infrastructure bill.
Because the Federal Reserve is maintaining its accommodative stance, consumer spending is steadily returning to pre-pandemic levels. Job growth has also been coming on strong over the past three months. Together with better-than-expected progress on the mass vaccination program, indicators of a solid economic recovery this year are strong. However, one fly in the ointment that is of concern to investors is the potential for inflation. Notably, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.6%, year-over-year, in March this year--its highest level since 2018.

(Reuters) -Moderna Inc on Thursday said it believes countries around the globe would continue buying its COVID-19 vaccine for years even if patents on the shots are waived, noting that rivals would face significant hurdles in scaling up manufacturing. 
The comments come a day after the United States said it would support waiving intellectual property rights for COVID-19 vaccines in order to help speed an end to the pandemic, paving the way for what could be months of negotiations to hammer out a specific waiver plan.
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) shares were off 7.5% after falling as much as nearly 12% earlier. Shares of other COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers like  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) were also down on the patent news.
""While this is a negative headline,"" said  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts in a research note, there is no mechanism ""to force management to teach other manufacturers how to make their vaccine, suggesting no change to the status quo."" 
Moderna, which said in October it would not enforce patents on its vaccine during the pandemic, noted the lack of companies able to rapidly scale up complex manufacturing of a similar vaccine to meet surging global demand. 
""They will have to go run a clinical trial, get the data, get the product approved and scale manufacturing. This does not happen in 6 or 12 or 18 months,"" Moderna Chief Executive Stephane Bancel said on a post-earnings conference call.
Moderna has faced its own hurdles scaling up production with some shortfalls in the manufacturing supply chain, which includes Swiss contract manufacturer Lonza Group, leading to delivery delays in Europe.
Bancel said he has had to tell some countries, ""we're very sorry. We have no more supply for you in 2021.""
Still, the company said it expects to produce between 800 million to 1 billion doses this year.
Moderna raised its 2021 sales forecast for its COVID-19 shot by 4.3% to $19.2 billion on Thursday, two days after Pfizer increased its full-year COVID-19 vaccine sales forecast more than 70% to $26 billion.
Moderna expects vaccine output could increase to 3 billion doses in 2022 to meet demand from nations looking to stock up supplies and sign up deals for ""booster"" doses.
Early clinical trial data released on Wednesday showed that a third dose of either Moderna's current shot or an experimental new vaccine increases immunity against the more easily transmissible virus variants first found in Brazil and South Africa.

Moderna, which is seeking to expand authorization of its vaccine to children and adolescents, on Thursday said an initial analysis of a study in those aged 12 to 17 showed an efficacy rate of 96%.
The company also reported its first-ever quarterly profit on sales of the vaccine.

It’s been a volatile year thus far for the precious metals, and fortunately, for the bulls, the volatility is finally showing up to the upside.

1083,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2021 12:25PM ET</span>",Exclusive: UK court to reconsider $6.9 billion Brazil dam lawsuit against BHP,"By Kirstin Ridley
LONDON (Reuters) - London's Court of Appeal will hear a request to revive a 5 billion pound ($6.95 billion) lawsuit against Anglo-Australian mining group BHP over a 2015 dam failure in Brazil, a court order showed.
Judge Nicholas Underhill has agreed to an oral hearing that could help to overturn a previous Court of Appeal decision which denied a 200,000-strong Brazilian claimant group permission to appeal against a judgment to strike out the landmark case.
""I am satisfied that, exceptionally, an oral hearing is appropriate in this case,"" the judge said in the order, which was signed on May 4 and seen by Reuters on Thursday.
No further details were immediately available.
The order comes less than two months after the Court of Appeal refused permission for a lawsuit over Brazil's worst environmental disaster to proceed in English courts.
The Court of Appeal said in March it agreed with a lower court that the case was an abuse of process, that claimants could - and were - making reparation claims in Brazil and that the lawsuit would be ""irredeemably unmanageable"".
The collapse of the Fundao dam, owned by the Samarco venture between BHP and Brazilian iron ore mining giant Vale, killed 19 and sent a flood of mining waste into communities, the Doce river and the Atlantic Ocean, 650 km (400 miles) away.
Samarco has since filed for bankruptcy protection. 
PGMBM, the law firm representing the Brazilian claimants, said it had been contacted by many clients to ""express their gratitude in respect of the consideration being given by the Court of Appeal to their application.""
BHP, the world's largest miner by market value, said it was aware of the application.
""Previous (court) rulings ... have supported our position that the civil claim proceedings were unnecessary as they duplicated matters already covered by the existing and ongoing work of the Renova Foundation and are, or have been, the subject of ongoing legal proceedings in Brazil,"" a BHP spokesman said.
The Renova Foundation is a redress scheme established in 2016 by BHP's Brazilian division, Samarco and Vale.

The case is the latest battle to establish whether multinationals can be held liable for the conduct of subsidiaries abroad.
The UK Supreme Court in 2019 allowed Zambian villagers to sue miner Vedanta (NYSE:VEDL) in England for alleged pollution in Africa and in February permitted Nigerian farmers and fishermen to pursue Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) over oil spills in the Niger Delta.

1085,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2021 12:15PM ET</span>","Gases firm Linde boosted by healthcare, ramps up oxygen production","By Sarah Morland and Veronica Snoj
(Reuters) -Linde, the world's largest industrial gases company, hiked its 2021 earnings outlook on Thursday, as a strong performance in its healthcare business helped it beat first quarter forecasts.
The U.S.-German company, which supplies gases such as oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen to factories and hospitals, now expects adjusted earnings per share to rise 17-19% year-on-year - compared with its previous forecast for 11-13% growth. 
Higher prices and growing demand in the healthcare sector - where Linde (NYSE:LIN) supplies equipment and medical gases including oxygen for COVID-19 patients - helped its sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa jump 10% in the first quarter. 
The pandemic has driven up demand for medical oxygen, particularly in India, where severe shortages and logistics problems have seen dozens of hospitals run short in recent weeks. 
Chief Operating Officer Sanjiv Lamba said that teams in India were now producing more than 3,000 tonnes of medical oxygen daily, nearly ten-fold the figure four weeks ago.
""We've deployed about 1,200 drivers on the road, serving about 1,000 hospitals in the country,"" he added.
Linde, India's biggest oxygen producer, and other suppliers are ramping up production to more than 9,000 tonnes per day by mid-May, an executive told Reuters last week.
Lamba noted similar challenges in Mexico, Brazil and other Latin American countries - where infections continue to spread, filling up intensive care units, even as restrictions ease.

Linde's overall earnings per share for January-March rose 32% to $2.49, beating analysts' average estimate of $2.26 and its own guidance. 
Linde's biggest competitor, Air Liquide (OTC:AIQUY), also beat analysts' forecasts last month, driven by strong demand for medical oxygen and an industrial rebound in China.

Investing.com -- It's a tale of two online retailers. 
Wayfair (NYSE:W) forecasts a second quarter even better than the first, which blasted expectations, while Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) expects sales to decelerate. The furniture retailer rose almost 5% and the crafter's platform fell 14%.
Home sales, though they have slowed recently on a shortage of inventory, have soared throughout the pandemic on low interest rates and an exodus from urban lifestyles. That -- alongside homeowners who are upgrading their spaces -- has helped demand for Wayfair products jump. 
Our free time in which to craft items and sell and buy them, however, is shifting to the outside world as we get jabs against Covid-19 and look to spend our pent-up savings on beach holidays rather than trinkets. That's bad news for Etsy, which has seen revenue and profit over the past 12 months higher than ever. 
""We currently expect Q2 2021 [gross merchandise sales] to decelerate along with the rest of e-commerce as we lap the tremendous 2020 growth rates,"" Etsy Chief Executive Officer Josh Silverman said in a statement. 
Meanwhile, Wayfair Chief Financial Officer Michael Fleisher had a different message for investors.
""Q2 should clearly demonstrate our ability to remain strongly profitable even while continuing our ongoing ambitious investments and while comparing against an extraordinary period last year,"" Fleisher said on an earnings call today. ""We believe Q2 net revenue will be higher than Q1 net revenue and Q2 adjusted EBITDA will be at or above Q1 levels. And we expect to be strongly profitable every quarter of 2021.""
Stifel analyst Scott W. Devitt lowered the price target on Etsy noting that ""the company now has to execute against a more challenging backdrop given difficult compares (146% y/y GMS (NYSE:GMS) growth in 2Q:20), declining mask sales (14% of 2Q:20 GMS), and expectations for normalizing consumer behavior as vaccination rates rise in the company’s key markets,"" according to StreetInsider.

Also, the federal government’s decarbonization initiatives should result in higher investments in energy storage installations, thereby benefiting energy infrastructure providers Enbridge (NYSE:ENB) and  Kinder Morgan  (NYSE:KMI). But let’s find out which of these stocks is a better buy now. Enbridge Inc.  (ENB) and Kinder Morgan, Inc. (KMI) are two leading energy infrastructure companies engaged in the transportation of oil and natural gas. Based in Canada, ENB operates through Liquids Pipelines, Gas Transmission and Midstream, Gas Distribution and Storage, Renewable Power Generation, and Energy Services segments. KMI operates through four segments: Natural Gas Pipelines, Products Pipelines, Terminals, and CO2 segments.
According to the United States Energy Information Administration, crude oil and natural gas production will increase this year because of increased drilling. An increase in production should lead to higher storage and transportation volumes. Furthermore, the Biden administration’s proposal to build sustainable energy infrastructure should position energy pipeline companies such as ENB and KMI as facilitators of renewable energy and a cleaner power grid. The push towards decarbonization and renewable energy integration should further boost these companies’ growth.
While ENB has gained 21.9% year-to-date, KMI has returned 25.6% over the same period. In terms of past three month’s performance, KMI is the clear winner with 22.4% in gains versus ENB’s 10.5% returns. But which of these stocks is a better pick now? Let’s find out.

Fresh curbs in several parts of the world, including France, the United Kingdom and parts of Asia early this year have also helped demand as consumers stuck at home indulged in snacks.
Sales grew 10% in Europe and about 2% in North America, its biggest market, sending shares of Kellogg (NYSE:K) up 7%.
The company's forecast raise came at a time when its peers including Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) and  Mondelez International Inc  (NASDAQ:MDLZ) have flagged a hit to earnings from higher costs for sugar, wheat and soy as well as freight.
Kellogg said its increased forecast takes into account the higher costs, mainly thanks to better pricing of its products.
Known for its Corn Flakes and Honey Loops cereals, Kellogg projected full-year organic net sales to be nearly flat, compared to prior estimate of about 1% decline.
It also expects adjusted full-year profit per share on a currency-neutral basis to rise by about 1% to 2%, compared to its previous projection of about 1% rise.
""We're expecting growth in emerging markets to sustain, maybe not at the double-digit rates that we saw in quarter 1,"" Chief Financial Officer Amit Banati told investors.

Net sales rose to $3.58 billion in the quarter ended April 3 from $3.41 billion a year earlier. Analysts were expecting sales of $3.38 billion, according to IBES Refinitiv.

(Reuters) -Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday and said it expects demand for its COVID-19 antibody therapy to hold up even as vaccination efforts across the United States intensify.
The comments were in contrast to those by rival Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co, which last month trimmed its 2021 profit target as demand for Lilly's COVID-19 antibody therapies took a hit due to vaccinations.
Lilly's antibody therapies and Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN)'s REGEN-COV have been authorized in the U.S. for treating non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and the companies have signed supply agreements with the U.S. government worth millions.
Demand for these therapies, however, has been lackluster due to the complexities involved in their administration.
Still, Regeneron said its therapy brought in U.S. sales of $262 million in the first quarter, ahead of estimates of $255 million, according to brokerage Piper Sandler.
""Despite high rates of vaccination, it's estimated that tens of millions will remain unvaccinated in the U.S. alone,"" Regeneron Chief Executive Officer Leonard Schleifer said.
Regeneron is also pursuing U.S. authorization of a lower dose of its antibody cocktail and for its use as a preventive medicine. It has reported positive data for both from clinical studies.
The drugmaker said it expects a decision from the U.S. health regulator on the authorization of the lower 1.2 g dose over the next several weeks.

Given the success of the lower dose based on trial data, REGEN-COV's sales will remain strong even during the second half of 2021, after Regeneron's supply contract with the United States is filled in the second quarter, Cowen analyst Yaron Werber said.
Regeneron's shares rose 2% to $490.90 after it beat estimates for first-quarter profit, helped in part by a recovery in demand for its physician-administered eye drug Eylea.

BOSTON (Reuters) -David Swensen, who spent more than three decades managing one of the world's best performing college endowments as Yale University's chief investment officer, has died of cancer, the university said. 
""David served our university with distinction. He was an exceptional colleague, a dear friend, and a beloved mentor to many in our community. Future generations will benefit from his dedication, brilliance, and generosity,"" Yale President Peter Salovey said in a statement.
He was 67 and was first diagnosed with cancer in 2012.
Over three decades Swensen helped the university's endowment grow to $31.2 billion, making Yale one of the world's richest universities. The endowment helps fund salaries and financial aid.
Salovey said Swensen ""revolutionized"" institutional investing by shifting the university's money into less liquid asset classes and helped prepare a new generation of investors who have gone on to lead other large endowments.
Swensen, who earned a Ph.D. in economics from Yale, returned to his alma mater in 1985 after having worked on Wall Street for several years. He took a significant pay cut to lead the investment office and found an endowment valued at $1 billion.
By focusing on a longtime horizon, Swensen pioneered investments in hedge funds, private equity and real estate, creating an investment model now known as the ""Yale Model.""
His record is one of the most admired in the industry. Yale returned 9.9% a year over the 20 years ending June 30, 2020, while other college and university endowments earned an average 5.6% return. In 2000, when the tech bubble burst, Yale's endowment posted a 41% return, thanks largely to a hedge to dampen its exposure to technology investments.
Swensen also trained a new generation of investors in his classes at Yale and in the investment office who went on to lead endowments at Princeton, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford.

""In addition to his transformational impact, David was generous in sharing insights and guidance,"" Mohamed El-Erian, who once ran Harvard University's endowment, wrote on Twitter.
On Monday, Swensen and his long-time colleague Dean Takahashi taught the last class of the term for ""Investment Analysis"", a seminar they taught for 35 years, Yale's Salovey said in the statement.

The luxury industry took a major hit from pandemic lockdowns last year but is making a comeback as easing curbs and vaccinations make people more confident about venturing out and spending on high-end brands.
Tapestry (NYSE:TPR)'s estimate-beating third-quarter results mirrored European luxury names Louis Vuitton owner LVMH and  Kering  (PA:PRTP)'s Gucci, which also reported better-than-expected sales last month.
""We've seen vaccination efforts progressing, resulting in increasing consumer confidence... and improving in-store traffic trends,"" Tapestry Chief Executive Officer Joanne Crevoiserat said.
Tapestry, which also owns Kate Spade, said sales in North America returned to pre-pandemic levels, while revenue from Mainland China soared about 175% compared to a year ago and was 40% above 2019.
The New York-based company forecast full-year sales to rise by a mid-teens percent, above analysts' estimate of a 10% rise, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. It also forecast full-year earnings above 2019 levels.
However, Tapestry said it is experiencing shipping delays that are causing delays in products moving from design boards to shelves. The blockage in the Suez Canal earlier this year will have a modest impact on current quarter results, Tapestry said.

The company's shares, which have risen nearly 56% this year, fell 2%.
Tapestry's third-quarter net sales rose 19% to $1.27 billion beating analysts' expectations of $1.22 billion, while its adjusted profit of 51 cents per share, was above estimates of 31 cents.

(Reuters) -Auto technology supplier Aptiv (NYSE:APTV) Plc on Thursday reported better-than-expected quarterly profits, and Chief Executive Kevin Clark said the company will benefit from a surge in new electric vehicle projects at major auto manufacturers.
""We are seeing tremendous acceleration in demand for battery electric and plug-in hybrids,"" Clark told Reuters. Aptiv's revenues from high voltage vehicle electrification increased by 126% in the first quarter, and the company expects 50% growth in that category for the full year, Clark said.
""For us it's great,"" Clark said. Aptiv can generate twice the revenue from technology it supplies to a battery electric vehicle as an internal combustion one, he said. 
A recent global shortage of semiconductor chips, used in cars for everything from power steering and brake sensors to entertainment systems, has led to a curtailment of production at car companies, which is denting sales growth at auto parts makers including Aptiv.
Clark said vehicle production during the second quarter will be volatile, but automakers are planning to try to recover some lost production during the second half of the year.
Aptiv, which counts Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co among its top customers, reaffirmed its full-year financial outlook.
Increased demand for trucks and sport utility vehicles in North America will help Aptiv offset costs related to supply chain problems, which go beyond semiconductors to certain raw materials, such as copper, and freight capacity, Clark said. U.S. consumers are buying trucks and larger SUVs at high prices, loaded with electronic features that Aptiv supplies.
Other auto parts makers such as BorgWarner (NYSE:BWA) and  Magna International  (NYSE:MGA) Inc, which also cater to Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Ford, have raised their full-year forecasts, after reporting strong results, even as the automakers shut factories due to the chip shortage.
Aptiv makes products including advanced driver assistance systems, vehicle computers and high-voltage cabling. 
Excluding items, Aptiv earned $1.06 per share in the first quarter, beating analysts' average estimate of 78 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Net sales rose 25% to $4.02 billion, topping Wall Street's estimate of $3.62 billion.

Investing.com --  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), BioNTech and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) took the brunt of the news that the U.S. is supporting waiving intellectual property protections for Covid-19 vaccines to end the global pandemic.
“The Administration believes strongly in intellectual property protections, but in service of ending this pandemic, supports the waiver of those protections for COVID-19 vaccines,"" said U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai in a statement on Wednesday. ""We will actively participate in text-based negotiations at the World Trade Organization (WTO) needed to make that happen."" 
Moderna, which just reported its first profit ever, fell 8%, and BioNTech dropped 9%. Pfizer dropped almost 2%, while AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s American Depository Receipts and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) traded slightly lower. 
While the U.S. has seen cases slow dramatically since vaccinations have spread, countries like India, Brazil and Argentina are seeing unrelenting deaths from the virus. Vaccinations have been slow to reach those countries, whose economies have been upended by the pandemic.
In response Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) Chief Executive Officer Stephen J. Ubl said: “In the midst of a deadly pandemic, the Biden Administration has taken an unprecedented step that will undermine our global response to the pandemic and compromise safety. This decision will sow confusion between public and private partners, further weaken already strained supply chains and foster the proliferation of counterfeit vaccines.""
Ubl accused Biden of reversing course on his policy to build up infrastructure and create jobs ""by handing over American innovations to countries looking to undermine our leadership in biomedical discovery."" 
Moderna today reported earnings per share of $2.84 on its best sales yet of $1.94 billion, though that was lower than the expected $2.23 billion, according to data compiled by Investing.com.
“Based on these first quarter accomplishments and our current manufacturing scale-up trajectory, we were pleased to again increase our base plan for 2021 to 800 million doses. The Moderna team and our manufacturing partners are working hard to get as close to 1 billion doses in 2021 as we can,"" Moderna Chief Executive Officer Stephane Bancel said in a statement. ""The feedback from governments around the world requesting high-efficacy mRNA vaccines and variant boosters is overwhelming."" 
The company said it will make additional investments to increase global supply for the Covid-19 vaccine to up to 3 billion doses in 2022.
Tai defended the move, saying ""the administration’s aim is to get as many safe and effective vaccines to as many people as fast as possible.""

1102,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2021 10:21AM ET</span>",Germany's IG Metall warns of car jobs fiasco without investment,"By Ilona Wissenbach and Jan Schwartz
FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Germany's car industry is facing an ""employment fiasco"" unless it gets badly needed investment in new technologies, especially batteries, the country's top labour leader said.
The warning came after a survey by the Ifo institute showed that the transition to electric vehicles (EVs) could cost the industry some 100,000 jobs in combustion engine production by 2025 if companies fail to beef up efforts to reskill workers.
""Whoever takes the view that the loss of jobs could be fully offset is creating false hopes,"" Joerg Hofmann, president of IG Metall, Germany's most powerful union, told Reuters.
As battery-powered cars need less assembly than combustion engine vehicles, the EV boom means carmakers and their suppliers must address the risks of unemployment due to skill mismatches by retraining employees.
IG Metall's Hofmann said tens of thousands of jobs were at risk out of the 260,000 in Germany's car industry that are directly tied to combustion engine technology.
""Even if there is investment in areas, for example battery technology, it is a huge challenge. But without investment and industrialisation in Germany we are facing an employment fiasco,"" Hofmann said.
Germany now plans to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 65% by 2030, and the car industry is due to get tougher new CO2 targets, he said, adding that this would equate to 14 to 16 million EVs on German roads by the end of the decade, up from 7 to 10 million expected under previous emissions goals.
""We expect that at that stage at least two out of three new cars will be fully electric or hybrid. And every additional electric car is one combustion engine-based vehicle less.""
Ifo President Clemens Fuest said the transition to e-mobility was posing a major challenge, especially for the hundreds of small, highly specialised suppliers.
It was key to develop highly qualified jobs in the remaining combustion engine industry and the nascent e-car sector without stopping structural change, he said.
The expected shifts in employment will not be fully absorbed by the retirement of baby boomers, the survey by the Ifo Institute for Economic Research showed.

It estimated that at least 175,000 car jobs would be at risk by 2025 and only 73,000 workers in combustion engine production would have retired by then. That meant about 100,000 workers could face unemployment if they don't obtain new skills.
The Ifo survey, which was commissioned by the German VDA car association, did not take into account the potential creation of new jobs in EV manufacturing or battery cell production.

(Reuters) -ViacomCBS Inc on Thursday beat Wall Street quarterly revenue estimates, driven by strong streaming revenue and advertising growth following the March launch of its rebranded Paramount+ service.
The company has 36 million global streaming subscribers after adding 6 million in the first quarter. Streaming revenue rose 65% year-on-year. 
“We’re clearly seeing the benefit of putting the full power of ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) behind Paramount+,” said ViacomCBS President and Chief Executive Officer Bob Bakish on an earnings call on Thursday. 
Advertising revenue jumped 21% to $2.68 billion, driven by CBS’ broadcasts of Super Bowl LV and NCAA basketball tournament games.
The company said it expects “strong double-digit advertising growth” in the second quarter. 
It plans to use the $2.7 billion in cash it raised in March to develop more original series and movies, especially for streaming; accelerate international launches; pursue incremental streaming sports rights, and reduce the amount of content it licenses to third-party streamers, preserving more of that content for its own streaming services.
The bulk of that investment will happen over many years, the company said Thursday. It expects streaming content spending for 2021 to more than double from 2020. 
Revenue rose 14% to $7.41 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $7.31 billion, IBES data from Refinitiv showed.
Net earnings attributable rose to $899 million, or $1.42 per share, from $501 million, or 81 cents per share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, the company posted a profit of $1.52, topping estimates of $1.22.

Shares were up 2% at $44 in early trading.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Twenty U.S. senators from both parties wrote a letter to the heads of the Appropriations and Armed Services committees supporting  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT)'s F-35 jet, which has suffered from cost overruns and delays.
In the May 5 letter, seen by Reuters, the senators urged funding of modernization and sustainment plans for the jet, which has struggled to meet targeted cost-per-flying-hour goals as well as mission capability rates. 
The letter comes ahead of the release of the detailed version of the Pentagon's 2022 budget request in the coming weeks and follows a similar letter signed by 132 members of the U.S. House of Representatives from April 28.
Pentagon officials, executives from Lockheed, the jet's prime contractor, and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Corp's Pratt and Whitney division, which makes the F-35 engine, testified before the House Armed Services Committee on April 20 about the jet's strengths and weaknesses. 
During the testimony the executives said they were working to rectify deficiencies in the program that ran the gambit from slow software updates for the jet and its systems, to early deterioration of parts like fan blades and the pilot's canopy.
Lockheed plans to deliver between 133 and 139 of the jets this year.

The senators noted, ""near-peer adversaries like China and Russia continue to advance their air defense systems, develop their own 5th generation fighters, and invest heavily in emerging technologies that threaten America's military edge.""
The jet has a network of more than 1,800 suppliers that has been strained during the pandemic.

This will be followed by a factory in Spain, France or Portugal in 2026 and a site in Poland, Slovakia or the Czech Republic by 2027. Two more plants will be set up by 2030.

""And I hope that within the next couple of months, we are able to announce the next sites and the next partnerships, even I wouldn't exclude IPOing some of the activities,"" Diess said.

The company said it expects global steel demand to grow by between 4.5% and 5.5% this year, with inventories low after prolonged destocking, capacity utilisation rising and steel spreads healthy. Excluding China, that growth would be 8.5% to 9.5%, with a strong rebound expected in India.

(Reuters) - North American companies boosted spending on industrial robots in the first quarter as they scrambled to keep up with surging demand in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Companies ordered 9,098 robots in the first quarter, a 19.6% increase over a year ago, according to the Association for Advancing Automation, an industry group based in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The orders were valued at over $466 million in total.
Robots were once concentrated in the auto industry but are now moving into more corners of the economy, from ecommerce warehouses to food processing plants. For the first time last year, most of the robots ordered by companies in North America weren’t destined for auto factories or their parts suppliers.
The strongest growth in the latest quarter was to metal producers, where orders surged 86%. Orders to life science, pharmaceutical and biomedical companies rose 72%, while orders to consumer goods companies increased 32%.
“The strong economy obviously helps,” said Jeff Burnstein, president of the Association for Advancing Automation, “It gives companies the confidence to invest in more things -- including in more automation.”
Burnstein said the pandemic froze many businesses, as operations shut down to protect human health. “But ultimately it accelerated the adoption of automation, because companies recognized if they were going to do it, now would be the time.”
 Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN), the U.S. meat company, is among those looking to use more robots on its production lines. In 2019, the company opened a 26,000 square foot automation research center near its headquarters in Springdale, Arkansas.

“For the most part, it’s still too soon for some of the really innovative and proprietary systems we’re developing,” said Marty Linn, the center’s director of engineering. Automating jobs such as deboning chickens is extremely difficult, he noted, because the size and shape of each chicken can vary greatly. Robots work best when they can handle uniform items.
With that in mind, Linn said, Tyson has already started installing at its plants robots that sit at the end of production lines and automatically stack and wrap boxes on pallets - a process that involves standard shapes and the repetition of precise movements.

The company, which makes sunglasses and spectacle frames for brands such as Chanel, Prada (OTC:PRDSY) and Versace, usually benefits from the rising need for prescription glasses in aging population and from more time spent on screens. But demand from sunglasses in particular was knocked last year by coronavirus lockdowns and travel curbs.
Sales in the first quarter jumped 14.3% at constant currencies from a year earlier to 4.06 billion euros ($4.9 billion).
The company confirmed its target to return to pre-pandemic levels this year, adding it was aiming to reach ""at least"" those levels compared to its previous guidance, specifying that the 2021 target included revenue and adjusted operating margin.

First-quarter results were on track towards that goal as sales in the first quarter grew 1.9% over 2019 at constant currencies.

1116,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2021 07:48AM ET</span>",Explainer: COVID-19 vaccine patent waiver talks could still take months,"By Philip Blenkinsop
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - President Joe Biden threw his support behind waiving intellectual property rights for COVID-19 vaccines in a sharp U.S. reversal, but it could take months for the World Trade Organization (WTO) to hammer out any deal.
Before Biden's announcement on Wednesday, India and South Africa confirmed their intention to draft a new waiver proposal at a WTO General Council meeting, prompting the body's new Director General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala to express hope for ""a pragmatic solution"".
The two countries want to ease rules of the WTO's Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS) agreement. WTO decisions are based on consensus, so all 164 members must agree. 
WHERE ARE THE TALKS NOW?
Ten WTO meetings in seven months have failed to produce a breakthrough, with 60 proposal sponsors from emerging economies, backed by a chorus of campaign groups, Nobel laureates and former world leaders. They are pitted against richer developed countries, such as Switzerland and members of the European Union, where many pharmaceutical companies are based.
After the 10th round on April 30, India and South Africa said they would revise their text from October in time for the next TRIPS council meeting in the second half of May before further discussion on June 8-9.
U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said on Wednesday she would pursue ""text-based negotiations"" on the WTO waiver, the standard but tedious process for trade deal talks.
Negotiators trade texts with their preferred wording, then try to find common ground, sometimes leaving blank spaces for thorny differences to be settled by politicians.
Not only are the negotiations expected to be lengthy, they are also likely to result in a waiver that is significantly narrower in scope and shorter in duration than the one initially proposed by India and South Africa, trade experts said.
All 164 WTO member countries must reach consent on such decisions, with any one member able to veto them, so there could be a lot of red pencils out. Negotiations are likely to be held in a mixture of virtual and in-person meetings.
World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Monday the process needed to be completed as soon as possible. The WHO said in April that of 700 million vaccines globally administered, only 0.2% had been in low-income countries.
THE PROPONENTS' ARGUMENT
The Indian/South African proposal in October says property rights such as patents, industrial designs, copyright and protection of undisclosed information hinder timely access to affordable vaccines and medicines essential to combat COVID-19.
They say the waiver should last for an unspecified time period, with an annual review until it terminates, and call for unhindered global sharing of technology and know-how.
They say there cannot be a repeat of the early years of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, when a lack of access to life-saving medicines cost millions of African lives. In 2020, over half of all people living with HIV were in South and East Africa, according to UNAIDS.
The WHO head and 375 civil society and campaign groups such as Doctors Without Borders back the proposal. Former leaders from Britain's Gordon Brown to the former Soviet Union's Mikhail Gorbachev had jointly written to Biden urging him to support it. 
THE COUNTER VIEW
Big drug companies generally oppose waiving rights to their intellectual property. The main Western producers are  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and jointly  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech. In October, Moderna did though say it would not enforce its COVID-19 vaccine patents during the pandemic.
Big Pharma says vaccine development is unpredictable and costly and that strong intellectual property protection helped provide the incentive for the development of vaccines in record time and will do so again in work on tackling new variants or in a future pandemic.
Proponents counter that some of the money was public funds.
Big Pharma also says vaccine-making is difficult - witness the production problems non-specialist AstraZeneca has faced - so suspending patents alone will not bring more shots.

Complex vaccines require deep cooperation between developers and manufacturers. Any failure to make them properly could undermine public confidence in safety, the companies say.
They also point to over 260 partnership agreements already in place for production and distribution and comment that, under the existing TRIPS agreement, governments can allow producers to make a patented product without the consent of the patent owner. Developing countries have such ""compulsory licences"" to push down prices for HIV/AIDS medication from 2002 to 2007.

1118,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2021 07:36AM ET</span>",Rio Tinto shareholders reject executives' pay in caves blast backlash,"By Sonali Paul
MELBOURNE (Reuters) -A majority of Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO)'s shareholders rejected the global miner's executive pay packages on Thursday, in a backlash over its destruction last year of ancient rock shelters in Western Australia.
Rio Tinto blasted 46,000-year-old rock shelters at Juukan Gorge last May to expand an iron ore mine, sparking condemnation from investors, politicians, its own staff and the wider community.
Following the company's Australian annual meeting, Rio Tinto said more than 60% of votes cast by investors in the Anglo-Australian dual-listed company were against its remuneration report.
Although shareholders rejected the proposed payouts, the vote was advisory only, and will not impact the $55 million earmarked in salary and bonuses for the company's top 14 executives, as booked in the company's annual report. 
""This constitutes a 'first strike',"" the company said.
In Australia, if a company's executive pay package is rejected two years in a row, the board could face a vote to be removed.
""The Board acknowledges that the executive pay outcomes in relation to the tragic events at Juukan Gorge are sensitive and contentious issues,"" it said in a statement with the vote results.
Widespread anger at the destruction of the caves cost the jobs of its chief executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques and two other senior leaders and led Chairman Simon Thompson to flag he would step down in 2022.
Proxy advisers CGI Glass Lewis, Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), and the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors (ACSI) recommended voting against the pay report, all raising concern about the long-term incentives Jacques was allowed to hold on to after the caves destruction.
Jacques kept 5.7 million pounds of his long-term incentive award, losing only 1 million pounds as a result of the cave blasts.
CGI Glass Lewis said it had ""severe reservations with the size of the awards vesting"" for Jacques under his 2016 long-term incentives plan.
Rio Chairman Thompson told shareholders the company had withheld as much as the board considered ""legally defensible"" under the terms in place in 2016 when the incentives were set and also took into account that Jacques was losing his job.

Investors overwhelmingly approved a new policy which allows directors to claw back long-term awards for a situation like the Juukan Gorge disaster, where actions were not illegal or fraudulent but damaged the company's reputation and its social licence.
In a further sign of shareholder discontent, 26% of votes were against the re-election of Megan Clark, who heads the board's sustainability committee. That compared with less than 5% opposition to other directors' re-election.

1119,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2021 07:27AM ET</span>","Lufthansa unit Swiss International to cut jobs, planes and flights","ZURICH (Reuters) - Lufthansa subsidiary Swiss is cutting its fleet by 15% and its workforce by up to 780 more people, the airline said on Thursday, as it responds to the collapse in passenger numbers caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
The airline, which received loan guarantees from the Swiss government worth 1.275 billion Swiss francs ($1.40 billion) last year, said it expects a 20% decrease in demand over the medium term, making restructuring unavoidable.
It saw its passenger numbers plunge 90% in the first quarter of 2021, pushing it into a operating loss of 201 million Swiss francs.
Under the restructuring, Swiss will reduce its fleet of 90 planes which it operates under its own name and the Helvetic brand by 15% from 2019 levels, it said. 
Its short- and medium-haul fleet is being cut to 59 from 69 aircraft through the withdrawal of Airbus A320-family jets and a reduction in leasing, while long-haul aircraft will be cut to 26 from 31 by withdrawing five Airbus planes. Services and flight frequencies will be reduced as well.
Swiss had already planned to reduce its workforce of 9,500 by 1,000 by the end of 2021 through voluntary redundancies and natural staff turnover. 
But now further cuts of up to 780 employees - in both ground and flying crews - could be necessary, it said.
""It has grown increasingly clear that our market is undergoing structural change, and that despite the actions which we were swift to take in response, a restructuring of our company now sadly seems unavoidable,"" Chief Executive Dieter Vranckx said.

Cabin crew union Kapers said it ""deeply regretted"" the move, and asked management to keep job cuts to a minimum.
Parent company Lufthansa last month lowered its forecast for flights this year, saying it expected to fly at only 40% of its pre-pandemic capacity.

Aeva makes a lidar sensor that helps cars gain a three-dimensional map of the road and can also detect the motion of distant objects, helping distinguish between non-moving objects like trees and pedestrians or cyclists. Aeva has deals with automotive suppliers Denso Corp and ZF Friedrichshafen AG for mass production of its sensors.
The detection range of lidar sensors is a key metric for automakers because longer-detection ranges mean a self-driving vehicle has more time to make a decision, especially at higher speeds.
Other companies such as Aeye Inc, which German automotive supplier Continental AG (OTC:CTTAY) bought a stake in last year https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-selfdriving-continental-lidar/continental-buys-stake-in-lidar-startup-aeye-idUSKBN27C1JK, have said they can detect other vehicles at 300 meters. 
Lidars send out laser beams and detect their reflections when they bounce back off their surroundings to generate an image. A key challenge is detecting dark objects that do not reflect much light.

Aeva said a proprietary chip it has developed allows its sensors to detect objects with below 10% reflectivity at long ranges.
""We aim to offer a combination of performance and scalability that we believe to be unmatched in the industry,"" Mina Rezk, co-founder and chief technology officer of Aeva, said in a statement.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen edging higher at the open Thursday, posting new highs as the generally positive first-quarter earnings season continues ahead of key employment data.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow futures contract was up 25 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 futures traded 4 points, or 0.1%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 24 points, or 0.2%.
The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.3% on Wednesday, posting a record closing high. The S&P 500 rose 0.1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.4%, its fourth straight negative session and longest daily losing streak since October. 
This has been the busiest week of earnings this quarter, and more companies are lining up to release updates Thursday in what has generally been a positive first quarter.
Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN), ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC) and Kellogg (NYSE:K) are among the names scheduled to report before the opening bell, while  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE),  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU), Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND), Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK) and Square (NYSE:SQ) will report after the market closes.
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) also reports first-quarter earnings early Thursday, but the drugmaker could also be in focus after the European Commission said it was willing to discuss a plan, first mooted by U.S. presidential trade adviser Katharine Tai, to waive intellectual property rights for Covid-19 treatments while the pandemic lasts.
Uber (NYSE:UBER) will also be in the spotlight after the ride-hailing company disclosed a $600 million charge to provide its U.K. drivers with benefits, while the Biden administration also canceled a Trump-era rule that made it easier for companies not to classify gig workers as employees, suggesting costs will rise.
The main economic release Thursday will be the weekly jobless claims data, coming a day after the ADP’s private payroll report for April showed jobs rose 742,000, the most in seven months. 
This has raised expectations for Friday’s monthly official jobs report, but ahead of that initial jobless claims are expected to come in around 540,000 and continuing claims around 3.62 million, when they are released at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).
Oil prices edged lower Thursday despite a huge fall in U.S. crude stockpiles as the recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic remains uneven. 
Government data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration late Wednesday showed crude stockpiles contracted by nearly 8 million barrels last week, falling to their lowest level since late February.
That said, the EIA also detailed a larger-than-expected 737,000-barrel build in gasoline inventories, rising for the fifth straight week. 
U.S. crude futures traded 0.6% lower at $65.22 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.6% to $68.58. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,790.25/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% higher at 1.2040.

1122,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2021 06:52AM ET</span>",Chip crisis to eat into Volkswagen's second quarter profits,"By Christoph Steitz and Jan Schwartz
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) boss Herbert Diess said Europe's top carmaker was in ""crisis mode"" over an ongoing lack of badly needed automotive chips, adding the impact of the shortage would intensify and hit profits in the second quarter.
Speaking after bumper results for the first three months of the year, during which operating profits increased more than five fold, Diess said the bottleneck would ""substantially burden earnings"" in the quarter to June.
The shortage has been caused by a mix of factors, including the car industry's sharper than expected rebound from the coronavirus crisis and a fire at key automotive chip maker Renesas Electronics Corp.
Snow storms in Texas earlier this year have made the situation worse, hurting local production of chipmakers such as Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF), Infineon (OTC:IFNNY) and  NXP Semiconductors  (NASDAQ:NXPI).
""We will do everything to offset a significant amount of the lost cars in the second half of the year,"" Diess told journalists. ""But the incidents in the U.S. and in Japan will hurt us definitely.""
Diess said while the problem had cut production by around 100,000 cars in the first quarter, there was more to come.
""We're still tasking our supply chain people to recover the losses of quarter two, which we expect,"" he said.
Volkswagen shares were down 2.8%.
To secure supplies over the longer-term, the German group is talking directly to chipmakers including NXP Semiconductors and Infineon, as well as foundries such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, Diess said.
""We are, for sure, in crisis mode,"" he said.
Despite the crunch, Volkswagen raised its operating margin target for this year after strong demand for Audis and Porsches in the first quarter.
It now expects an operating profit margin of 5.5-7%, up from a previous forecast of 5.0-6.5%.
During the first quarter, deliveries of Porsches and Audis both rose by about a third year on year, Volkswagen has said. Sales of electric vehicles more than doubled to 133,300 vehicles.
Stronger demand for high-margin cars echoed similar comments from General Motors (NYSE:GM), Daimler (OTC:DDAIF), Ford and Stellantis.
Volkswagen, the world's second largest carmaker by vehicle sales, cheered investors earlier this year when it provided more detail about its electric vehicle strategy, including higher sales targets and plans to build six battery factories in Europe.

Volkswagen's operating profit came in at 4.8 billion euros ($5.8 billion) in January-March, helped by cost cuts and higher sales, versus 900 million euros in the same period last year, which was hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.

BEIJING (Reuters) -U.S. electric-vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc said on Thursday it was developing a platform for car owners in China that will allow them to access data generated by their vehicles.
Tesla, which makes Model 3 sedans and Model Y sport-utility vehicles at its Shanghai factory, aims to launch the data platform this year, it said in a statement.
This is the first time an automaker has announced plans to allow customers access car data in China, the world's biggest car market.
Automakers for the past several years have been equipping more vehicles with cameras and sensors to capture images of a car's surroundings. Control of use, sending and storage of these images is a fast-emerging challenge for the industry and regulators worldwide.
China last month published draft rules to ensure the security of data generated by smart cars. Data collected from Tesla electric cars in China is stored in the country, a company executive said last month.

Tesla in April was targeted by state media and regulators after a customer, angry over the handling of her complaint about malfunctioning brakes, climbed on top of a Tesla car in protest at the Shanghai auto show. Videos of the incident went viral.
Tesla provided the data related to the brake incident to the customer complying with the local authorities' order.

LONDON (Reuters) - Electric truck startup Volta Trucks said on Thursday it will add three new models for inner city zero-emissions deliveries to businesses and raised its sales forecast to 27,000 units annually by 2025.
Company founder Carl-Magnus Norden told Reuters the expanded model range - trucks in the 7.5-tonne, 12-tonne, 16-tonne and 19-tonne weight categories - is based on customer demands to add to its first model, the Volta Zero.
""Customers have been coming to us asking for"" different sized vehicles, Norden said, ""so we have an opportunity to be much more ambitious.""
The company had previously announced a production forecast of 5,000 units per year by 2025.
Norden said the company should announce large new orders in the coming months and launch another funding round this year. Earlier this year, the company announced $20 million in funding from investors, including investment firm Luxor Capital.
Stockholm-based Volta Trucks, which also operates in the UK, plans to start production of the Volta Zero, a 16-tonne electric truck, in 2022.
The company currently has an order book of $260 million and its biggest public order to date is for 1,000 trucks from French refrigerated truck firm Petit Forestier.
Norden said the largest new truck model should start production in 2023, with the two smaller models likely coming in 2024. He said apart from looking at major European markets, the company will take its demo model Volta Zero to the United States this summer.
Tightening CO2 emissions targets in Europe and China have combined with improving battery technology to provide greater range at lower costs, making commercial electric vehicles more attractive.
Volta Trucks has picked U.S. electric bus maker Proterra to provide its batteries.
Proterra is going public through a merger with ArcLight Clean Transition Corp, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC).

The CSI 300 Index dropped 1.2%, while the Shanghai Composite Index slipped 0.2% at close. The tech-heavy ChiNext Index fell 2.5%. The health-care subgauge was the worst performer on the benchmark CSI 300, while Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group Co. dropped by as much as 26% in Hong Kong on the prospect of increased global supply.
Tourism stocks also fell despite the increased number of travelers over the break from a year earlier. Songcheng Performance Development Co. closed 5.4% lower, while China Tourism Group Duty Free Corp. lost 5.2%. Even with domestic travel recovering, spending still lags,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). analysts including Lydia Ling wrote in a note.
Adding to the bearish sentiment was a statement from China saying the nation was suspending ministerial economic talks with Australia, a largely symbolic move showing Beijing’s growing frustration with Canberra. Rising geopolitical tensions between China and some western countries are also weighing on the market, with the European Union increasingly taking a tougher stance on Beijing.
“It’s unclear what the actual impact of halting the dialogue will be on trade and markets,” said Wu Xuan, chief strategist at Tebon Fund. “It does cast doubt and uncertainty towards the safety of investments of Chinese firms overseas, especially in areas where the geopolitical conditions are not so friendly toward China.”
While growth continues in the world’s second-largest economy, traders say the recent economic signals offer few catalysts to push the key benchmark away from its recent narrow band. The best quarterly earnings since 2010 were met with range-bound trading, a wave of new pandemic cases in developing countries is weighing on markets, a supercharged commodities boom may spur inflation and the Communist Party’s Politburo meeting last week called for a continuation of macro policies.
“The mainland market lacks upside catalyst,” said Castor Pang, head of research at Core Pacific Yamaichi. “The Politburo meeting offered nothing that excite the investors, as there is no additional incentives to boost the economy. The virus situation is worrying and the relationship with the U.S. is relatively sour.”
Traders were jittery about Thursday’s open as they recalled their return from the last national holiday in February when a rally that pushed the CSI 300 past its 2007 peak fizzled on the back of a renewed deleveraging campaign by Beijing. The gauge is down 12% since that year-to-date high before Thursday.
That’s not to say there aren’t drivers that could give the market a lift out of the doldrums. The end of the holidays will mean retail investors could return en masse, having piled into Chinese equity exchange-traded funds ahead of the break. Both  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG) strategists believe the recent decline has made Chinese stocks relatively attractive, as the benchmarks are trading at undemanding price-to-earnings multiples.

1129,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 06, 2021 06:09AM ET</span>",‘Frothy’ Stock Prices Pose Quandary for Powell in Mapping Policy,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has called the risks emanating from “frothy” stock prices and other potential financial imbalances “manageable.” Some current and former central bankers are not so sure.
They worry that the Fed’s rock-bottom interest rates and massive bond buying might lead to asset price bubbles, and excessive risk-taking and leverage that could come back to haunt the economy.
“We’re now at a point where I’m observing excesses and imbalances in financial markets,” Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Robert Kaplan said on April 30. “I’m very attentive to that, and that’s why I do think at the earliest opportunity I think it will be appropriate for us to start talking about adjusting those purchases.”
Powell, for his part, has shown no inclination to pull back on the Fed’s support for the pandemic-damaged, yet recovering, U.S. economy. But he’s lately sounded a bit more wary about potential dangers to financial stability.
Investors will get further insight into Powell’s thinking when the Fed releases its semi-annual Financial Stability Report at 4 p.m. Washington time on Thursday. The report is a product of the Fed board in Washington and won’t reflect the views of regional central bank presidents like Kaplan.
After avoiding calling asset prices elevated earlier this year, Powell surprised investors by using the “f” word to describe the markets when speaking to reporters on April 28.
‘Bit Frothy’
“You are seeing things in the capital markets that are a bit frothy,” he said, after a two-day meeting at which the Fed opted to maintain its ultra-accommodative monetary posture. “Some of the asset prices are high.”But he argued that a growing number of vaccinations and a faster economic reopening were the main forces driving prices higher, not Fed policy.
Powell also pointed out that some of the other factors the Fed looks at to assess financial stability risks are not flashing red. Household balance sheets are in good shape, leverage in the financial system is not high and banks are well-capitalized.
“The overall financial stability picture is mixed but on balance, it’s manageable,” he said.
Powell is far from alone in sounding wary about exuberance in financial markets.
“Asset bubbles are a hot topic these days for the somewhat obvious reasons that so many markets are on fire,” JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) Head of Cross-Asset Fundamental Strategy John Normand said in an April 30 note.
Financial Conditions
The Fed chief faces a quandary when it comes to the markets. He wants financial conditions to be easy to help the economy and the jobs market recover from the devastation of the pandemic.
But he’s also aware that bursting asset bubbles can lead to economic recessions, as occurred in 2001 when high-flying technology company shares crashed, and in 2007 when housing prices crumbled.
To help limit the financial fallout from an eventual step-back in Fed support, former Bank for International Settlements Economic Advisor Stephen Cecchetti said policy makers should give investors a clearer idea of how they will adjust bond purchases in response to different economic scenarios.
The central bank is currently buying $120 billion of assets per month and has pledged to keep up that pace “until substantial further progress” has been made toward its goals of maximum employment and 2% average inflation.
Communicating Shift
Powell has repeatedly declined to be more specific, except to say that it will likely be some time before such progress is achieved.
He has though promised to give investors ample warning of a coming shift in the Fed’s plans.
That might not be enough to prevent a swoon in a stock market that’s become dependent on the Fed’s largesse.
“Speculative markets are tricky,” former Fed Governor Jeremy Stein said. “They’re hard to manage.”
That could be especially the case if investors become fixated on the risk of faster inflation.
“There’s been some dry kindling for a while (for a steep market decline) but now you can imagine what a spark might be,” Harvard University professor Stein added.
More Resilient
Former Bank of England policy maker Adam Posen said the Fed and other regulators should act to make the financial system more resilient and thus better able to handle an eventual increase in interest rates.
“There are things they can do now to reduce the likelihood that bad things will happen when they’re forced to raise rates in early 2023,” sooner than they’re currently expecting, said Posen, who’s now president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.
Kaplan is not the only Fed president who has flagged possible financial risks. Boston’s Eric Rosengren has as well.
But unlike Kaplan, he has said it’s premature to talk about tapering bond purchases, though he’s added that it’s “quite possible” that the conditions for scaling back buying might be met toward the end of this year.
While asset prices are not yet “unusually buoyant,” Rosengren suggested on a webinar on Wednesday that the Fed’s very patient approach to reducing stimulus could result in them becoming so.
“If we get down to full employment by the end of next year with interest rates still quite low, I am going to be highly attuned to what’s happening in financial markets,” he said.

1130,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2021 06:01AM ET</span>",Trading rebound boosts earnings at France's SocGen,"By Matthieu Protard and Marc Angrand
PARIS (Reuters) -Societe Generale will press ahead with an overhaul of its investment bank after its equities division posted its best performance in six years in the first quarter, the French bank said on Thursday.
Revenue from share trading surged to 851 million euros from just 9 million a year ago, helping SocGen post a better than expected net profit of 814 million euros ($977 million) after a loss of 326 million euros in the first quarter of 2020.
Shares in France's third-biggest bank leapt as much as 6.6% to their highest since March 2020 and were up 3% at 0926 GMT, outperforming a 0.46% drop in the Stoxx Europe 600 Banks Index. 
""The equity businesses enjoyed their best quarter since 2015,"" SocGen said in a statement.
Under pressure to boost profitability, SocGen Chief Executive Frederic Oudea has accelerated an overhaul of its businesses underway since 2018 to reinforce its balance sheet. 
It has sold divisions in Eastern and Central European countries such as Poland, Serbia and Bulgaria and also either quit or cut back some corporate and investment banking (CIB) activities, such as commodities trading.
SocGen's head of global banking and investor solutions, Slawomir Krupa, said the equity trading rebound would not change the CIB review due to be unveiled on May 10 as the lender wants to lower the risk profile of its structured products. 
Last year, SocGen was hit by losses from complex derivative products and the bank said it would drop some business lines. 
Krupa told reporters that activity over the last three quarters was supporting the bank's thoughts about the investment banking review, without elaborating.
SocGen's shares have rallied 43% since the start of the year after slumping 45% in 2020, while the Stoxx Europe 600 Banks Index has climbed 25% this year, hitting its highest level since Feb. 26, 2020 on Thursday.
""The strong recovery in equities and the resilient top line performance in French retail is reassuring and consensus has to upgrade estimates given the turnaround in global markets and lower cost of risk guidance"", analysts at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said.
LOCKDOWNS WEIGH
Other European banks have also been able to rely on bumper trading volumes and lower credit risk provisions in early 2021 to compensate for low margins on lending.
UniCredit and ING beat profit expectations on Thursday, as did Italy's largest bank Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) on Wednesday.
SocGen's earnings per share jumped to 0.79 euro, above an average forecast for 0.23 euro, according to Refinitiv data.
Revenue from fixed income and currency trading rose 2.63%, outperforming some European rivals such as BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) but still lagging U.S. investment banks. 
However, European banks are still grappling with thin margins due to record low interest rates and COVID-19 restrictions, meaning the resilience of their first-quarter rebounds is likely to be tested if trading volumes wane. 
In its French retail business, SocGen reported a 1.8% drop in revenue in the first quarter as lockdowns weighed on business but it said activity was gradually improving. 
Revenue is expected to be between -1% and +1% this year, the head of retail networks Sebastien Proto told reporters. 
SocGen also confirmed that provisions for loan losses due to the pandemic would fall this year from 2020 levels.
The bank now sees its cost of risk, which reflects provisions against bad loans, to be between 30 and 35 basis points in 2021, down from 64 basis points last year.
As part of further initiatives to enhance returns, SocGen entered exclusive talks last month to sell most of its asset management arm Lyxor to Amundi for 825 million euros.

The lender also said last year it would merge its two retail banking networks in France, with the closure of 600 of its nearly 2,100 branches by 2025.

1132,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2021 04:56AM ET</span>",Britain's Next cautions post-lockdown sales surge won't last,"By James Davey
LONDON (Reuters) -British fashion retailer Next raised its full-year profit guidance for the second time in two months as it reported better than expected first-quarter trading, but cautioned it did not expect a post-lockdown surge in sales to endure.
Next, which trades from about 500 stores as well as online, said on Thursday full price sales in the 13 weeks to May 1 fell 1.5% compared with the same period two years ago - before the COVID-19 pandemic started to disrupt trading last year.
The group's previous guidance assumed first-quarter sales would tumble 10% from the same period in fiscal 2019-20. It said it had beaten this forecast by 75 million pounds ($104 million).
Full price sales in the three weeks to May 1 were up 19% versus two years ago, partly reflecting the reopening of the majority of stores on April 12 after over three months of lockdowns.
""We're not getting too excited about that because after each of the last lockdowns we did see a spike in demand that petered away after a few weeks,"" CEO Simon Wolfson told Reuters.
""What we're seeing at the moment is pent-up demand that I don't think is necessarily indicative of what is to come.""
As a result Next did not raise its sales guidance for the rest of the year, which it kept at up 3% versus two years ago.
But it did raise its central guidance for 2021-22 pretax profit to 720 million pounds, up from the 700 million pounds forecast in April. It made 342 million pounds in 2020-21. 
Shares in Next were up 2.7% at 0819 GMT, extending year-on-year gains to 80%.
Next has shown resilience during the pandemic, benefiting from its long-established online operations.
Rivals with weaker or no online business, notably Primark, have seen far larger falls in sales. Others, such as Topshop-owner Arcadia, and Debenhams have gone out of business.
Next said first-quarter sales from its stores were down 76% on two years ago, reflecting lockdowns, while online sales increased 65%.
Wolfson said the mix of products sold had started to change in recent weeks as restrictions were loosened.
He said Next had seen a significant recovery in sales of adult clothing, particularly womens' casual wear.

But sales of warm weather holiday wear, such as swimwear, remained at much lower levels that two years ago.

1133,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2021 04:45AM ET</span>",Air France-KLM operating loss widens as European recovery lags,"By Laurence Frost
PARIS (Reuters) - Air France-KLM sales are showing little sign so far of a travel upturn it still hopes to see by summer, the airline group said on Thursday, as it posted a wider first-quarter operating loss.
Air France-KLM said it expects to operate 50% of its pre-pandemic flight capacity in the second quarter under way, ramping up to 55% to 65% in July-September.
""We're waiting to see the first effects of vaccination,"" Chief Financial Officer Frederic Gagey said. Demand is showing ""no noticeable improvement so far"", he added, with customers often waiting to book at the last minute.
While rebounding U.S. and Chinese domestic markets are already benefiting airlines there, carriers in Europe are stuck waiting for the region's slower vaccine rollouts to give way to looser curbs and an anticipated recovery.
Lufthansa cut its 2021 capacity forecast last week while narrowing its first-quarter loss with a workforce reduction of 19%. British Airways parent IAG (LON:ICAG) posts quarterly earnings on Friday.
Air France-KLM's operating loss increased to 1.18 billion euros ($1.42 billion) from 815 million in the first quarter of 2020, which was only partially affected by the onset of the pandemic. Revenue fell 57% to 2.16 billion euros.
The group, which took a 10.4-billion-euro government-backed bailout last year, raised 1 billion euros in an April share issue that saw the French state double its holding to 28.6%.
Air France-KLM is seeking shareholder approval this month to raise more equity and hybrid capital, in a process its CFO said would see debt and state support ""gradually transformed into market-credible products"" as the outlook improves.
Gagey, 64, is due to retire at the end of June and will be replaced in the group role by current Air France finance chief Steven Zaat, the company said on Thursday.
The quarterly numbers beat the 2.07 billion in revenue and 1.31-billion-euro operating loss expected by analysts, according to the median of 12 estimates in a company poll.

The net loss narrowed to 1.48 billion euros from 1.8 billion a year earlier - which included a large fuel-hedging deficit as traffic collapsed.
Air France-KLM said net debt rose by 1.5 billion euros over the quarter to 12.5 billion at March 31, when it held 8.5 billion euros in liquidity and available credit.

The Hong Kong-listed Asia arm of Anheuser-Busch InBev reported a 63.7% rise in first-quarter revenue, with total volume up 64.6%, driven by strong consumption over the Lunar New Year holiday and a low base for comparison due to the COVID-19 outbreak early last year. 
Budweiser APAC shares surged more than 8% on Thursday after posting its results. 
Revenue doubled in China from the same period last year and grew by double digits compared to the first quarter of 2019. Revenue generated from premium brands increased by high double digits year on year, it said. 
""Premium and super premium beers continue to be our growth engine,"" Jan Craps, co-chair and chief executive of Budweiser APAC, said in an interview. 
China's growing middle class and the proliferation and needs of different drinking occasions was driving the company to broaden its product portfolio, he said. 
""We know that as a country and as more people get into the middle class and higher class in terms of disposable income, the drinking occasions, differences and the needs are getting more complex, so we need to offer a broader portfolio to fulfil what the consumer is looking for,"" he said. 

Last year, the company launched Mike's Hard Lemonade, a vodka-based sparkling beverage, in China, and tested Budweiser ME3, a fruity version of its flagship beer. 
In China, eateries and bars have been re-opened since the second quarter of 2020, with post-pandemic consumer traffic recovering strongly.

1135,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2021 04:06AM ET</span>",AB InBev 'architect' Brito to hand over to N.America boss,"By Philip Blenkinsop
BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Carlos Brito, who built Anheuser-Busch InBev into the world's biggest brewer during 15 years at the helm, will step down as CEO in July to be replaced by the group's North America boss as it shifts focus from acquisitions to boosting sales. 
The brewer of Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois lagers said on Thursday its board had unanimously elected Michel Doukeris, the former head of sales, to succeed fellow Brazilian Brito, from July 1. 
Chairman Martin Barrington said Doukeris' expertise in brands, consumers and innovation meant the 48-year-old was ideally suited for the company's next phase. 
That phase could be more focused on boosting sales of over 500 brands than on acquisitions in an already concentrated brewing market.
""This should not come as a shock to investors.... Michel was the clear lead internal candidate,"" said Trevor Stirling, beverage analyst at Bernstein Securities, adding Doukeris had an impressive track record, notably in China and Asia-Pacific. 
AB InBev shares rose around 4% in early trading.
Brito, 61 today, arrived when the brewer was called InBev, the result of a 2004 merger between Belgium's Interbrew and Brazil's AmBev, which he headed. 
During his tenure, the company took over Anheuser-Busch in 2008, added Mexico's Grupo Modelo and in 2016 spent over $100 billion on SABMiller (LON:SAB), then the world's second largest brewer.
The acquisition brought more Latin American markets and saw it enter Africa for the first time. 
However, the purchase also saw AB InBev's net debt jump to $82.7 billion as of the end of 2020, some 4.8 times core earnings (EBITDA). 
Its share are now less than half their late 2015 peak, with craft beer eating into its U.S. sales and difficulties in Brazil and South Africa.
""Brito was the architect who led and built AB InBev into the world’s leading beer company and a leading global consumer packaged goods company by masterfully integrating the many businesses that comprise AB InBev today,"" Barrington said.
STRONG REBOUND AT START OF 2021 
The company separately reported first-quarter earnings ahead of expectations, even with lockdowns closing hospitality in much of Europe and a one-month alcohol sales ban in South Africa.
Sales of beer surged 64% in Asia-Pacific, a year on from the initial coronavirus lockdown in China, a major AB InBev market.
They rose by more than 10% in Latin America, outperforming industry growth in two of its top markets, Brazil and Mexico. In Europe, sales of its own beers were flat. 

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 14.2% on a like-for-like basis and removing the impact of currency translation to $4.27 billion, beating the 6.6% average forecast in a company-compiled poll.
This figure should increase by between 8% and 12% in 2021, with revenue growth greater than that, based on higher beer sales, price hikes and a shift in consumer taste to premium brands, AB InBev said.

At 3:40 AM ET (0840 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.6% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.5% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.3%, rising to a new 52-week high.
It has been another busy day for corporate earnings in Europe, with the banking sector leading the way.
Societe Generale stock rose 5.9% after the French banking giant handily beat expectations in its first quarter, boosted by a strong performance in its global markets division. Unicredit stock also rose 4.4% after the Italian bank also posted a respectable rebound, amassing its biggest ever cushion for payments to shareholders. 
Elsewhere, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) stock rose 1% after Europe's largest carmaker raised its operating margin target for 2021, pointing to stronger demand for more profitable cars during the first three months of the year. 
EssilorLuxottica (PA:ESLX) stock rose 1.5% after the maker of Oakley and Ray-Ban glasses said its first-quarter sales were boosted by a strong rebound in China and the United States, while  Next  (LON:NXT) stock rose 2% after the U.K. fashion retailer raised its full-year profit guidance for the second time in two months. Elsewhere in fashion, German online chain Zalando (DE:ZALG) also raised its outlook for the year. Zalando's upgrade is particularly notable, given that it had been a relative winner from lockdowns last year.
On the flip side, ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT) stock fell 1.3%, slipping from a 52-week high, despite the world's largest steelmaker reporting strong first-quarter earnings, and Air France KLM (OTC:AFLYY) stock dropped 1.5% after the airline group posted a wider first-quarter operating loss and said it was looking at issuing equity-like instruments to strengthen its balance sheet.
The morning's biggest loser however was BioNTech, which fell 13.5% after the European Commission said it was ready to discuss  U.S. plans for a temporary waiver of intellectual property rights on Covid-19 vaccines to accelerate the global vaccination campaign. 
The major European indices closed substantially higher Wednesday, with the DAX gaining 2.1%, the FTSE 100 1.7% and the CAC 40 1.4%, having their best day in nearly two months.
Away from the corporate sector, the Bank of England announces its latest monetary policy decision later in the session and is widely expected to hold rates steady at 0.10% and keep its monthly bond purchases steady.
However, the central bank is also likely to significantly upgrade its growth outlook, which would increase expectations that its next move will be to tighten monetary policy rather than provide fresh stimulus to the economy as the pandemic eases.
German factory orders rose 3.0% in March, while the final U.K. composite PMI readings for April and Eurozone retail sales for March are due later in the session.
Oil prices edged higher Thursday following a huge fall in U.S. crude stockpiles, but gains are small as the recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic remains uneven. 
Government data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration late Wednesday showed crude stockpiles contracted by nearly 8 million barrels last week, falling to their lowest level since late February.
That said, the EIA also detailed a larger-than-expected 737,000-barrel build in gasoline inventories, rising for the fifth straight week.

1139,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2021 02:58AM ET</span>",Exclusive: China's Tencent in talks with U.S. to keep gaming investments - sources,"By Echo Wang and Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) - Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd is negotiating agreements with a U.S. national security panel that would allow it to keep its ownership stakes in U.S. video game developers Riot Games and Epic Games, according to people familiar with the matter.
Tencent has been in talks with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which has the authority to order the Chinese technology giant to divest U.S. holdings, since the second half of last year, the sources said.
CFIUS has been looking in to whether Epic Games' and Riot Games' handling of the personal data of their users constitutes a national security risk because of their Chinese ownership, the sources added.
Tencent owns a 40% stake in Epic Games, the maker of popular video game Fortnite. Tencent also bought a majority stake in Riot Games in 2011 and acquired the rest of the company in 2015. Riot Games is the developer of ""League of Legends,"" one of the world's most popular desktop-based games. 
Tencent is negotiating risk-mitigation measures with CFIUS so it can keep its investments, according to the sources. The details of the proposed measures could not be learned. They typically involve ringfencing the owner of a company from operations that have national security implications. They often call for the appointment of independent auditors to monitor the implementation of these agreements.
One of the sources said Epic Games has not been sharing any user data with Tencent.
The sources cautioned there is no certainty that Tencent will clinch deals to keep its investments and asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. 
Tencent, Epic Games and a CFIUS representative at the U.S. Treasury Department declined to comment.
A Riot Games spokesman said the Los Angeles-based company operates independently of Tencent and that it has implemented ""industry-leading practices"" to protect player data. He declined to comment on Riot Games' discussions with CFIUS.
CFIUS has been cracking down on Chinese ownership of U.S. technology assets in the last few years, amid an escalation in tensions between Washington and Beijing over trade, human rights and the protection of intellectual property. U.S. officials have expressed concerns that the personal data of U.S. citizens could end up in the hands of China's Communist Party government.
President Joe Biden's administration has maintained the hawkish stance against China inherited in January from his predecessor Donald Trump, albeit with more of a focus on geopolitical issues such as the future of Taiwan and Hong Kong, as well as China's persecution of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang.
Yet many key CFIUS roles have not yet been staffed. This has provided a reprieve to China's ByteDance, which was ordered by Trump last year to sell its popular short video app TikTok but balked at a transaction that would have involved  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. CFIUS has not sought to enforce the divestiture order under Biden.
Epic is locked in a legal fight with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) over access to the iPhone maker's app store. It alleges that Apple forces developers to use its in-app payment systems - which charge commissions of up to 30% - and to submit to app-review guidelines that discriminate against products that compete with Apple's own. 

Apple argues that Epic Games broke their contract when it introduced its own in-app payment system in Fortnite to circumvent Apple's commissions. It says the way it runs the app store inspires trust in consumers to open up their wallets to unknown developers.
Tencent's vast businesses include video games, content streaming, social media, advertising and cloud services. China has in recent months sought to curb the economic and social power of Tencent and other internet companies such as  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd, in a clampdown backed by President Xi Jinping. Reuters reported last week that Beijing was preparing a substantial antitrust fine for Tencent.

The carmaker of choice for fictional secret agent James Bond has had a tough time since floating in 2018, as it failed to meet expectations and burnt through cash. 
The arrival of its first sport utility vehicle, the DBX, which fist rolled off the production line in July 2020, has helped boost the company as it widens its appeal in a lucrative segment of the market. 
In the first quarter of 2021, total sales to dealers more than doubled to 1,353 vehicles and the firm said it was maintaining its full-year guidance that volumes will stand at around 6,000 vehicles. 
It hopes to reach around 10,000 cars and revenue of roughly 2 billion pounds by 2024/25. 
""I am pleased with our performance in the first three months of the year, delivering results in-line with our expectations of good growth and progress on the path to improved profitability and cash generation,"" said CEO Tobias Moers.

""We are encouraged by the growth in orders for both GT/Sport and DBX, providing good visibility.""

1142,By Investing.com,"<span>May 06, 2021 02:00AM ET</span>","European Stock Futures Edge Higher; SocGen, Unicredit 1Q in Focus","By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are seen edging higher at the open, continuing the positive tone from the previous session, as investors digest more corporate earnings ahead of a Bank of England meeting.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.1% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.1%. 
The major European indices closed substantially higher Wednesday, with the DAX gaining 2.1%, the FTSE 100 1.7% and the CAC 40 1.4%, having their best day in nearly two months as resource stocks jumped and data showed Eurozone business activity picked up in April.
Given these hefty gains a further substantial move higher Thursday may prove difficult, but the overall tone remains positive as the first-quarter earnings season continues.
Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) is likely to be in the spotlight Thursday after the French banking giant handily beat expectations in its first quarter, boosted by a strong performance in its global markets division. Italian banking giant Unicredit (MI:CRDI) also posted a respectable rebound, amassing its biggest ever cushion for payments to shareholders. 
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Europe's largest carmaker, raised its operating margin target for 2021, pointing to stronger demand for more profitable cars during the first three months of the year. 
ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT), the world's largest steelmaker, reported higher than expected first quarter earnings, while EssilorLuxottica (PA:ESLX), the maker of Oakley and Ray-Ban glasses, said its first-quarter sales were boosted by a strong rebound in China and the United States.
Earnings are also scheduled from blue chips Anheuser Busch Inbev (BR:ABI), Air France KLM (PA:AIRF) and ING (AS:INGA) among others.
Away from the corporate sector, the Bank of England announces its latest monetary policy decision later in the session and is widely expected to hold rates steady at 0.10% and keep its monthly bond purchases steady.
However, the central bank is also likely to significantly upgrade its growth outlook, which would increase expectations that its next move will be to tighten monetary policy rather than provide fresh stimulus to the economy as the pandemic eases.
German factory orders rose 3.0% in March, and later in the session sees the release of final U.K. composite PMI readings for April and Eurozone retail sales for March.
Oil prices edged higher Thursday following a huge fall in U.S. crude stockpiles, but gains are small as the recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic remains uneven. 
Government data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration late Wednesday showed crude stockpiles contracted by nearly 8 million barrels last week. This validated the earlier report from the American Petroleum Institute, an industry body, and points to crude oil stocks falling to their lowest level since late February.
That said, the EIA also detailed a larger-than-expected 737,000-barrel build in gasoline inventories, rising for the fifth straight week. 
U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% higher at $65.80 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.3% to $69.19. 
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.5% to $1,792.65/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.2010.

1143,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2021 11:00PM ET</span>",Investor group in exclusive talks to acquire Forbes for $650 million -source,"By Echo Wang and Krystal Hu
(Reuters) - An investor group led by U.S. merchant bank GSV's CEO Michael Moe has entered into exclusive negotiations to acquire business news and information publisher Forbes Media LLC for about $650 million, a person familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
A deal could result in Forbes' ownership changing hands seven years after Hong Kong-based investor group Integrated Whale Media Investments purchased 95% of the company. The remainder is owned by the Forbes family.
Moe's consortium has about a month to clinch a deal with Forbes before the exclusivity period expires, the source said, cautioning that no deal is certain.
A Forbes spokesman said: ""We have no comment, but investors have consistently shown interest in Forbes, which has produced three years of record results. 2021 is shaping up to be a strong year as well.""
GSV did not respond to a request for comment.
Reuters reported last week that Moe was leading a bid to acquire Forbes. Bloomberg News reported the exclusive negotiations earlier on Wednesday.
Forbes was valued at $475 million in 2014 when Integrated Whale Media bought a majority stake in the company from the Forbes family and investment group Elevation. Chinese conglomerate HNA Group made an unsuccessful bid to acquire a majority stake in Forbes in 2017, Reuters reported at the time.

As one of the oldest media outlets in the United States, Forbes publishes its flagship magazine which reaches six million readers. Founded by B.C. Forbes in 1917, it has long championed capitalism and entrepreneurship and is known for its annual list of the world's wealthiest people.
The company has been undergoing a digital transformation amid declining print revenue. It has been doubling down on expanding key franchises like Under 30 and live events, most of which have become virtual during the COVID-19 pandemic. It says its digital platform now reaches more than 140 million people with 40 global editions.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mixed Thursday morning as major markets returned from long holidays and the debate about whether the ongoing economic recovery will cause runaway inflation continues.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.24% by 10:45 PM ET (2:45 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component was down 0.92% as markets re-opened after a week-long holiday and the country will release the Caixin Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) and trade data for April on Friday.
Diplomats from the Group of Seven (G7) nations expressed concern about China’s stance on issues including climate change. “We encourage China, as a major power and economy with advanced technological capability, to participate constructively in the rules-based international system,” the diplomats added in a statement ahead of June’s G7 leaders’ meeting.
Investors are also looking to the resumption of U.S.-China trade talks to assess the implementation of their phase one trade deal, with implications for the current U.S. tariffs on China. U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai on Wednesday said she expects to resume talks with Chinese officials “in the near term.”
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.30%.
Japanese and Korean markets also re-opened after holidays, with the Nikkei 225 jumping 1.98% and the KOSPI gaining 0.55%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 fell 0.51%, as the country’s New South Wales state reported new COVID-19 cases.
Meanwhile, Wednesday’s Institute of Supply Management (ISM) Non-Manufacturing PMI for April disappointed, coming in at 62.7. Further economic data, in the form of the U.S. employment report, including non-farm payrolls, is due on Friday.
The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield edged higher as trading started in Asia.
The U.S. plans to sell $126 billion worth of long-dated bonds in the upcoming week’s refunding exercise. The target amount is unchanged from the previous quarter, suggesting that U.S. financing needs could have already peaked.
As the world’s largest economy rebounds, investors are increasingly focused on when the U.S. Federal Reserve might start throttling back its emergency support.
Investors are increasingly expecting that the central bank will slow the pace of bond purchases in the fourth quarter. Although Fed Chairman Jerome Powell still insists it is too early to discuss such a move, some officials have been more direct.
Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren stirred the debate on whether the Fed could start tapering its monthly bond purchases after suggesting that the U.S. mortgage market now requires less support.
“The housing market is quite strong right now and housing prices have been going up... so the need for buying mortgage-backed securities at the pace that we have been doing probably is not nearly as needed as it was much earlier in the recovery,” he told Bloomberg.
Across the Atlantic, the Bank of England will hand down its policy decision later in the day."

1146,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2021 08:56PM ET</span>",Blue Origin opens up bidding for first 'spectacular' space tourism trip in July,"By Eric M. Johnson
SEATTLE (Reuters) -Blue Origin, billionaire Jeff Bezos' rocket company, said on Wednesday it is targeting July 20 for its first suborbital sightseeing trip on its New Shepard spacecraft, a landmark moment in a competition to usher in a new era of private commercial space travel.
Blue Origin also said it will offer one seat on the first flight to the winning bidder of a five-week online auction, the proceeds of which will be donated to the space firm's foundation.
The New Shepard rocket-and-capsule combo is designed to autonomously fly six passengers more than 62 miles (100 km) above Earth into suborbital space, high enough to experience a few minutes of weightlessness and see the curvature of the planet before the pressurized capsule returns to earth under parachutes.
The capsule features six observation windows Blue Origin says are nearly three times as tall as those on a Boeing (NYSE:BA) 747 jetliner and the largest ever used in space. 
""The view will be spectacular,"" Blue Origin's Director of Astronaut Sales, Ariane Cornell, told a media briefing.
After its first flight in July, Cornell said Blue Origin would have ""a couple more"" crewed flights before the end of the year. She declined to disclose details of the ticket price, which has been a closely guarded secret inside the company for years. 
Reuters reported in 2018 that Blue Origin was planning to charge passengers at least $200,000 for the ride, based on an appraisal of rival plans from billionaire Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE:SPCE) Inc and other considerations, though its thinking may have changed.
Wednesday's announcement follows years of testing and development work that has included delays. 
Cornell said Blue Origin would ""love"" to increase the frequency of its tourist spaceflights and add launch locations, possibly outside the United States, depending on demand. For July's flight, the reusable New Shepard booster will launch and land in West Texas.
Celebrities and the uber-rich appear to be the core market for space tourist jaunts, at least initially. Cornell told reporters the most likely candidates would be ""very clear on our radar.""
Only 569 people had ever been into space, she said, adding that ""we're about to change that dramatically.""
But she declined to say when - or if - Bezos, a lifelong space enthusiast and currently the world's richest person, will take a trip on New Shepard.
Virgin Galactic also aims to fly private customers in early 2022, after a first flight with Branson on board later this year.
Its zero-gravity experience is anchored by its SpaceShipTwo plane, and the company has ambitious plans to offer point-to-point travel between far-flung cities at near-space altitudes.
Virgin says it will charge more than $250,000 for new reservations but has not announced final pricing. Sales will reopen following Branson's flight.
Meanwhile, a college science professor and an aerospace data analyst are among a four-member crew for a launch into orbit planned later this year by Elon Musk's SpaceX, part of a charity drive billed as the first all-civilian spaceflight in history.
Blue Origin has fallen far behind SpaceX on orbital transportation, and lost out to SpaceX and United Launch Alliance (ULA) on billions of dollars' worth of U.S. national security launch contracts which begin in 2022. 

But its space tourism announcement provides Bezos, who founded Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), needed momentum while it protests SpaceX's $2.9 billion contract under NASA's high-profile program to return Americans to the moon in coming years.
Regulatory filings revealed that Bezos sold Amazon shares worth about $2 billion this week as a part of an arranged trading plan. Bezos, who will step down as CEO in a few months, has been unloading shares of the company he founded and had also said he would sell shares worth $1 billion to fund Blue Origin projects.

CHICAGO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of U.S. lawmakers is demanding that airlines refrain from outsourcing jobs if they want to be eligible for a third round of federal payroll aid, after learning that United Airlines has sought bids to outsource catering work at five airports.
Around two dozen members of U.S. Congress made the request to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, according to letters released by Unite Here, the union representing more than 2,500 workers whose jobs are at risk under United's proposal.
Chicago-based United has received $7.7 billion in two COVID-19 relief deals, known as payroll support programs (PSP), to help the airline industry weather the pandemic and protect jobs. United stands to receive another $2.8 billion under a third package set to run through Sept. 30.
""We respectfully request that any new PSP payments to United Airlines and other carriers make clear that any outsourcing of jobs while receiving PSP payments would violate the terms of the program,"" seven senators wrote in a May 4 letter to Yellen, who has authority over the terms of the aid.
Treasury did not immediately comment on the letter.
United spokeswoman Leigh Schramm said the company has not yet made any decisions to move forward with a third-party vendor for its inflight catering services after seeking proposals in January.
""Given the unprecedented impact of COVID-19 on our business, United continues to explore ways to do things differently and become more efficient wherever we can,"" she said, adding that the outsourcing proposal is ""part of that effort.""

Union members and the lawmakers who signed the letters say United's proposal -- which would impact workers in Newark, New Jersey; Cleveland, Ohio; Denver, Colorado; Houston, Texas; and Honolulu, Hawaii -- violates the spirit of the aid.
A Treasury official said more information on the third tranche of airline support would be posted next week.

1148,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2021 07:56PM ET</span>",Factbox: Five takeaways from Facebook oversight board's Trump case,"By Elizabeth Culliford
(Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)'s oversight board, a body set up by the social network to give independent verdicts on a small number of thorny content decisions, has ruled Facebook was right to bar former U.S. President Donald Trump after the Jan 6. riot but wrong in placing an indefinite suspension.
Here are five takeaways from the board's case decision: 
1. Facebook's oversight board said the company was correct to block Trump - the first current president, prime minister or head of state it has banned.
The board's verdict sends a message that the world's largest social media company may act on other rule-breaking political and influential leaders in the United States and globally, backing Facebook on a major decision that has both been praised for cracking down the violations of an influential account and criticized for abusing a private companies' power to censor elected leaders. 
It also puts a burden on Facebook to be clearer about how it enforces its rules on world leaders. Some human rights advocates have called for the platform to be more consistent in its approach to violations of international leaders and invest more in localized content moderation and expertise.
2. The board passed decision on Trump's fate to Facebook
The board, which said Facebook should have used the rules on its books rather than an ""arbitrary penalty"" without an end-date, told the company to come up with a response consistent with its rules within six months. 
In punting the case back to Facebook, the board sends the dilemma of how to police one of its most controversial users back to the company and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg. It said Facebook must decide whether to restore Trump, suspend him for a definite period or restore his account.
Some civil rights groups and Facebook critics blasted the board for passing the buck, which it denied doing. Board members said they were not there to lift responsibility from Facebook but to make sure it follows the rules it has on the books.
The board also recommended Facebook come up with a policy to govern its response to crises where its normal processes would not prevent imminent harm.
3. Trump's representatives told board outside forces to blame for Capitol riot
The board said that a statement was submitted on Trump's behalf, through the American Center for Law and Justice and a Trump page administrator, requesting that the board reverse the decision.
The statement said Trump's Jan. 6 posts did not threaten public safety or incite violence and said there was no serious linkage between Trump's speech, in which he said the election was stolen and urged protesters ""to fight,"" and what the statement called ""the Capitol building incursion."" 
It said the riot was ""certainly influenced, and most probably ignited by outside forces"" and described a federal complaint against members of the Oath Keepers, a far-right militia group, which it said were not associated with Trump.
Trump representatives declined to share the full statement made to the board with Reuters.
4. Board members disagreed on criteria for Trump to return to Facebook
The board said Facebook must decide Trump's penalty ""based on the gravity of the violation and the prospect of future harm.""
A minority of the board thought the criteria should include Facebook being satisfied that Trump had stopped making unfounded election fraud claims and withdrawn praise or support for those involved in the riots. 
The board also disagreed on how narrowly it needed to assess Trump's posts in deciding if Facebook's ban was correct. A minority thought that while the ban was justified on Jan. 6 events, it was important to look at posts before the November election, including Trump's post during racial justice protests that said ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" and multiple posts referencing the ""China Virus.""
5. The board says Facebook needs to tell users about its newsworthiness rules
The board said Facebook needs to be less opaque and address the confusion it has caused around how it makes decisions on influential users, though this recommendation is not binding.
Facebook's newsworthiness allowance allows violating posts to stay up where the public interest outweighs the harm. Facebook told the board it did not apply the exemption to the posts in the Trump case, even though the company has previously said it treats politicians' speech as newsworthy.
The basic principle of giving world leaders greater latitude than average users has been criticized by some researchers and human rights advocates, who argue these posts should instead be more strictly policed. 
The board said all users should be held to the same content rules, but it emphasized Facebook should take quick action when posts by influential users pose a high probability of imminent harm and that this should take priority over other values of political communication.

The board noted it does not see a useful distinction between political leaders and other influential users on the site. 
It also said Facebook's penalty system in general was not clear and it should tell users more about the ""strikes"" it imposes, how penalties are calculated and give warnings before restricting accounts on Facebook and Instagram.

(Reuters) -Proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services on Wednesday recommended investors cast advisory votes in favor of the pay of JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon at the bank's annual meeting on May 18, but with a caveat.
ISS said ""cautionary support"" for the pay of Dimon and other JPMorgan leaders is warranted and cited concerns about the use of discretion by the bank's compensation committee.
The proxy adviser also recommended shareholders back all the bank's directors up for election despite opposition from climate activists.
However wary, the support could mean Dimon gets a better evaluation at the bank's upcoming meeting compared to other corporate leaders who have faced investor rebukes lately over their own pay. These include leaders at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co and at  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co.
Dimon received $31.7 million in 2020, according to the bank's proxy statement, largely in stock awards and about the same as the year before.
In a report to clients ISS said an issue is JPMorgan's board left performance pay for Dimon and others unchanged despite declines in some financial metrics. But the board's ""use of discretion has not resulted in a quantitative pay-for-performance misalignment for the year in review,"" ISS said.

As it did last year, ISS recommended investors vote ""for"" a resolution calling for the bank's chairman to be an independent director, unlike Dimon who holds both the CEO and chair titles. The policy could be phased in for the next CEO. 
""Shareholders would benefit from more independent oversight,"" ISS said.

Strong gains by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) sent Dow to the record. Energy and materials continued this week's momentum, leading gains among S&P 500 sectors. Defensive utilities and real estate led sectoral declines.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) -Brazilian state-run oil company Petrobras has reopened bidding for its Golfinho offshore oilfield cluster, two sources told Reuters this week, following a rise in crude prices over the last several months. 
Golfinho is one of dozens of legacy production assets that Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the firm is formally known, is selling to reduce debt and sharpen its focus on a prolific, deepwater formation called the ""pre-salt.""
The divestment strategy was in doubt after former Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco was replaced in April with Joaquim Silva e Luna, a retired army general. Luna has indicated he intends to follow aspects of Petrobras' current strategy, but revealed little about potential changes.
Still, there have been few reports of delays from potential buyers of Petrobras assets. On Friday, the company announced it was moving forward with the sale of two major pipeline units.
Petrobras had previously entered bilateral negotiations with DBO Energy, a local oil and gas firm founded by Norwegian and Brazilian executives, to sell Golfinho, after DBO presented the highest offer in an open bidding round, Reuters reported in January.
Those talks did not result in a final deal, and Petrobras will accept a new round of offers from interested parties in late May, the sources said, requesting anonymity to discuss confidential matters.
DBO will likely place another bid and Norway's BW Energy Ltd is also in the hunt, the sources said. Sector-focused private equity firm Seacrest Capital expressed interest for Golfinho in past rounds, although its status in the latest round was unclear, the sources added.
Petrobras and DBO declined to comment. BW and Seacrest did not respond to comment requests.

In the new bidding round, Petrobras is divulging previously unavailable production information from a well drilled in 2020, the sources said. 
The cluster was producing 14,900 barrels of oil and condensate per day, according to 2020 bidding documents, although production has been in decline.

1153,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2021 06:36PM ET</span>",Uber sees driver cost rising as U.S. economy recovers,"By Tina Bellon and Akanksha Rana
(Reuters) -Uber Technologies Inc signaled it would pay drivers more to get cars back on the road as the U.S. economy recovers from the pandemic and disclosed a $600 million charge to provide UK drivers with benefits, a sign of the potential costs if the United States requires more driver compensation.
Shares of Uber (NYSE:UBER) were down 4.6% in after-hours trade. The stock fell 3.4% during the regular session after the Biden administration blocked a Trump-era rule affecting gig workers. 
The cost and speed of business recovery is of paramount interest to investors, and Uber executives on Wednesday said the take rate, the share Uber takes in fees from each ride, would drop from the previous quarter to a 20% range. Taking a lower cut will allow Uber drivers to earn more, but weigh on Uber's second-quarter mobility revenue and profitability.
Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell said shares fell after hours because of the pressure on the take rate and implicit driver incentives.
The food-delivery business continued to grow in the first quarter, but ride-hail bookings were flat from the previous quarter.
Moreover, the ride-hailing mobility business had to absorb a $600 million hit to account for a settlement with its more than 70,000 UK drivers and provide them with more benefits.
""The company's bottom line has been hurt by the ruling in the UK which raised expenses and reminded investors that a similar move in the U.S. could have a much bigger impact,"" said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at Investing.com.
Uber posted an adjusted $359 million first-quarter loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization - a metric that excludes one-time costs, including stock-based compensation, narrowing losses by nearly $100 million from the previous quarter. 
Analysts on average had expected the company to report an adjusted EBITDA loss of around $452 million, Refinitiv data showed.
Uber has promised to be profitable on that metric by the end of the year, three months after its smaller ride-hail rival  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT), which on Tuesday said it would report sustained adjusted profits starting in the third quarter.
Uber's chief financial officer, Nelson Chai, said on Wednesday the company would become profitable in the ""second half of the year,"" leaving the door open to achieving profits in the third quarter.
Revenue at Uber's delivery segment, which includes its Uber Eats restaurant delivery business, more than tripled from last year and grew 28% from last quarter to $1.7 billion.
Uber's ride-hail gross bookings, which plummeted over the last year due to the pandemic, remained roughly flat from the last quarter and down 38% from the previous year.
SPRING REBOUND
Uber's first-quarter results come as the company reported record food delivery and rides bookings in March and April, as U.S. vaccination rates increased and temperatures warmed. 
Both Uber and Lyft have struggled to serve the spring rebound in ride-hail trips, when consumer demand temporarily outstripped driver supply, leading to higher prices and longer wait times in some U.S. cities. 
Uber in April said it would invest an additional $250 million to further boost driver earnings and offer payment guarantees in an effort to incentivize new and existing drivers. Those charges will further drag down second-quarter mobility results.
Excluding the $600 million charge, Uber reported $3.5 billion in first-quarter revenue, ahead of an average analyst estimate for $3.29 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
Uber and Lyft's shares took a tumble last week when U.S. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh told Reuters in an interview that ""a lot of gig workers should be classified as employees.""

Uber Chief Legal Officer Tony West on a Wednesday conference call said the company was hopeful it will have a dialogue with the Biden administration Labor Department that ""can ultimately lead to a resolution.""
The gig companies rely on low-cost flexible workers and say their services would become unavailable if workers were reclassified as employees.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Ratings agency S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings on Wednesday raised GameStop (NYSE:GME)'s credit rating by one notch, a critical step in the video retailer's transformation into an e-commerce company.
S&P Global Ratings said in a note that it lifted GameStop's credit rating to ""B"" from ""B-"" and removed it from CreditWatch after the company issued $550 million in equity and redeemed all balance sheet debt.
""We expect these actions to provide additional runway to achieve its business transformation initiatives, provide liquidity, and improve GameStop's financial risk profile,"" S&P analysts wrote.
S&P's move was seen to help the company significantly, by putting it into a better position to negotiate terms with suppliers. 
Last month, GameStop announced that Ryan Cohen will be named chairman at the annual meeting in June, further solidifying the turnaround the co-founder and former chief executive of online pet food retailer Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) Inc has been pushing since he joined the board in January.
Cohen, who owns 13% of GameStop through his RC Ventures LLC, has helped overhaul the board and reshuffled top management. The company is seeking a new CEO and a new CFO. On Monday GameStop said it is opening a distribution center in Pennsylvania to further aid its push into e-commerce.
S&P praised GameStop's raft of new initiatives and forecast stronger earnings.
""For fiscal 2021, we forecast GameStop will sustain better performance, noting the recent improvement ... including a meaningful increase in same-store sales in the first quarter,"" the note said.
S&P gave GameStop high marks for bringing in executives with technology and ecommerce backgrounds, which reinforces ""the retailer's intention to reinvent itself.""

Still, competition will be fierce and the note said: ""Prospects for success remain unclear.""
GameStop's share price has surged 746.50% since January, fed by heavy buying among retail investors following online forums on Reddit.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stock indexes mostly rose globally on Wednesday, although the Nasdaq ended lower for the second day, while the U.S. dollar eased off its highest in more than two weeks.
The Dow hit a record high and the S&P 500 ended up slightly, supported by gains in energy and other economically sensitive sectors including materials and financials. The S&P 500 energy index ended up 3.3%.
Investors were positioning themselves ahead of Friday's U.S. monthly jobs report, expected to show that nonfarm payrolls increased by 978,000 jobs last month.
Tony Rodriguez, head of fixed income strategy at Nuveen, said it was possible Treasuries could move if the data varies much from forecasts.
""It would have to be closer to 1.2 million (in jobs gains) to have the market really feel like growth is accelerating at a pace that's a little above what people expected coming into this,"" Rodriguez said.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 97.31 points, or 0.29%, to 34,230.34, the S&P 500 gained 2.93 points, or 0.07%, to 4,167.59 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 51.08 points, or 0.37%, to 13,582.43.
The Nasdaq's move followed sharp declines on Tuesday, when technology-related shares added to losses after U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said rate hikes may be needed to stop the economy from overheating. Yellen later said she was not ""predicting or recommending"" a near-term rate hike.
On Wednesday, Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON) Inc shares fell 14.6% on its announcement to recall its treadmills amid reports of multiple injuries and the death of a child in an accident.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 1.82% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.29%.
Upbeat earnings and business activity in Europe boosted stock prices there. Data showed euro zone business activity quickened last month, while the services industry returned to growth.
India's Nifty 50 was 0.8% higher as the central bank rolled out measures to support the coronavirus-ravaged economy.
The dollar was near flat following softer-than-expected U.S. economic data. U.S. private payrolls rose by the most in seven months in April, ADP data showed, as companies boosted production to meet a surge in demand amid massive government spending and rising vaccinations. But the 742,000 private jobs created fell short of the 800,000 jobs expected by economists in a Reuters poll.
A separate report showed services industry activity eased in April from a record level in March, likely due to shortages of inputs as demand surged, data from the Institute for Supply Management showed.
The dollar index fell 0.007%, with the euro down 0.07% to $1.2004.
In the U.S. Treasury market, yields drifted lower as inflation expectations leaped to multi-year highs even as Fed officials downplayed the risk of a big rise in inflation.
The benchmark 10-year yield was last down 1 basis point at 1.5819%, holding below a 14-month high of 1.776% reached on March 30.

Oil ended little changed after two days of gains despite a sharp drawdown in U.S. crude stocks. Brent crude rose 8 cents to settle at $68.96 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude eased 6 cents to settle at $65.63. 
Spot gold added 0.5% to $1,787.57 an ounce. U.S. gold futures gained 0.29% to $1,784.10 an ounce.

""As part of the firm's new hybrid way of working, from June onwards, the expectation will be that KPMG's people spend up to four days in the office spread over a fortnight, with the rest spent at home or at client sites,"" KPMG spokeswoman Zoe Sheppard said in an emailed statement.

Sheppard said the hybrid plan was drawn up incorporating feedback from staff.
On Tuesday,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) asked U.S.-based employees to return to working in the office by mid-June and in the United Kingdom to return by mid-July.

The company reported first-quarter net income of $95.7 million, or 84 cents per share, compared with $107.2 million, or $1.01 per share, in the year-ago period.
Excluding one-time items, Albemarle earned $1.10 per share. By that measure, analysts expected earnings of 80 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Shares of the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company have nearly tripled in the past year, closing on Wednesday at $167.15, up 3.1% on the day. The stock was flat in after-hours trading.
Albemarle said the outlook for lithium sales has improved since 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic forced the company to pause expansions and production in some regions. Prices for the white metal should improve for the rest of the year, the company forecast.
Albemarle is in the final stages of two projects to boost its lithium processing and expects to approve further expansion projects by June.

Weakness in Albemarle's division that supplies crude oil refineries offset the surge in sales of lithium during the quarter.

(Reuters) -Shares of Hollywood star Jessica Alba's Honest Co traded sharply higher on their Nasdaq debut on Wednesday, valuing the consumer goods company at around $2 billion.
The shares were trading 37.5% higher than the IPO price, at around $22, on Wednesday afternoon in New York. Alba's 6.1% stake in the company is now worth $124 million. 
""This is an incredible jump off into building a company that I hope will be around for 100-plus years,"" Alba, the company's co-founder and chief creative officer, said in an interview.
""Our growth, fueled by being public, will enable us to drive more product innovation and consumer accessibility,"" added Alba, known for her acting roles in the film ""Fantastic Four"" and TV series ""Dark Angel.""
Honest's offerings include eco-friendly baby products, vitamins, sunscreen lotions and sanitizers that are sold online and through partnerships with brick-and-mortar stores including Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and  Target  (NYSE:TGT).
The company's debut comes amid a bullish market for IPOs and increased investor interest in sustainable companies. 
Plant-based burger maker Impossible Foods is looking to list through a blank-check merger, Reuters reported in April, while sustainable sneaker maker Allbirds is also in talks for an IPO, according to media reports.
Co-founded in 2011 by Alba, Honest is backed by investment firms Lightspeed, Fidelity and General Catalyst, among others. 
Honest was valued at as much as $1.7 billion in 2015 before it came under scrutiny in 2016, when a lawsuit said its products contained a harsh chemical it had pledged to avoid. Honest then reached a $7.35 million settlement for wrongly labeling ingredients in some products as natural, plant-based or chemical free.

Honest reported a 28% surge in revenue to $300 million last year, as the COVID-19 pandemic bolstered sales of its cleaning products. Its losses narrowed to $14.5 million from $31.1 million a year earlier. It has never turned a profit.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), J.P. Morgan and Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) are the lead underwriters for the company's offering.

PayPal's quarterly performance builds on an equally strong 2020 for the company, which also saw record levels of payment volumes.
San Jose, California-based PayPal processed a total of $285 billion in payments in the first quarter, up 50% from a year earlier, and added 14.5 million net new active customers.
""Our strong first-quarter results demonstrate sustained momentum in our business as the world shifts into the digital economy,"" Chief Executive Officer Dan Schulman said in a statement.
The company has been among the big winners of the pandemic as more people used its payment services to shop online and pay bills while staying indoors during the health crisis. 
 Visa Inc  (NYSE:V), the world's biggest payment processor, is emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic, its top boss said last month, helped by a surge in online shopping. 
Venmo, PayPal's app which allows individuals in the United States to send each other money, processed $51 billion in payments in the quarter, up 63%.
PayPal also said it expects to add 52–55 million net new active accounts in 2021, with an about 30% rise in total payments volume on a spot and forex neutral basis. 
The company in February forecast an addition of about 50 million active users in 2021. 
It also expects annual revenue and diluted earnings per share ahead of analyst estimates, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. securities regulator is considering measures to require big investors to disclose more about short positions, or bets that stocks will fall, use of derivatives to bet on other stock moves and to protect small investors from trading apps that use features common to video games in order to boost risky trading activity.
The review of rules by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was prompted by January's GameStop (NYSE:GME) saga and the meltdown of Archegos Capital, its new chair plans to tell lawmakers. Gary Gensler, sworn in last month as chair of the top markets watchdog, will testify before the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee on Thursday. Democrats are pressuring him to take a tough stance on Wall Street after Gamestop's fierce rally in January, fed by bullish posts on Reddit, and the March implosion of New York investment fund Archegos. ""Whenever there are major market events, it's a good idea to consider what risks they might have placed on the entire financial system,"" Gensler will tell lawmakers, according to prepared testimony published by the committee on Wednesday. SEC staff are working on potential measures, Gensler will say, including greater disclosure of ""short-selling,"" a strategy hedge funds and other big investors use to bet a stock will fall; increasing transparency around securities lending, which underpins short-selling; and new reporting rules for the ""total return"" equity swaps that felled Archegos, a family office. In addition, Gensler has asked staff to draft a request for public input into how trading apps entice retail customers using game-like features such as points, rewards, bonuses, and competitions, according to his testimony. 
""We need to ensure investors using apps with these types of features continue to be appropriately protected,"" he will say.
Gensler did not elaborate on the timing for any potential regulatory proposals, which typically must go through a lengthy rule-making process including public feedback.
Shares of GameStop soared in January after retail investors congregating on Reddit and trading on low-cost brokerage platforms bought shares in the video game retailer, causing big losses for hedge funds that had shorted the stock.
That episode was followed in March by the collapse of Archegos, whose soured media stock bets left the fund and banks that financed its trades nursing roughly $10 billion in losses.
""The professional investor community on Wall Street and Reddit rebellion of retail investors at home will be carefully listening to what the SEC chairman has to say about his thinking on how these financial activities are regulated,"" said Dennis Kelleher, chief executive of Washington-based Better Markets.
As volatility soared in January, retail broker Robinhood curbed buying in GameStop and other stocks because it could not provide the cash its clearinghouse, the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp (DTCC), required to guarantee those trades during the two days it takes them to settle.
Gensler has directed SEC staff to draft a proposal on expediting the settlement process to reduce system risks, according to his testimony. 
The heads of the DTCC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, which oversees brokers, will testify alongside Gensler. 
Gensler's promises to Congress spell disruption for Wall Street. The SEC is also cracking down on special purpose acquisition company or ""SPAC"" mergers, and drafting new climate change risk disclosure rules, issues Gensler is also likely to be grilled on. 

""We wouldn't be surprised to see members use the opportunity to press their interest for and against climate change regulatory changes, for revisions to family office rules, and more,"" said Ty Gellasch, head of Washington-based Healthy Markets.
""They could fill seven hearings with Chair Gensler's to-do list.""

The New York-based insurer's net investment income jumped nearly 74% to $5.31 billion on strong returns from private-equity investments.
MetLife saw rising payouts from deaths related to COVID-19, especially in the United States and Latin America. But those were offset by lower costs from annuities and long-term care policies, also linked to coronavirus-related deaths. 
Global life insurers are taking steps to curb payouts stemming from the health crisis, including for long-term health consequences that are not yet fully understood.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has begun a key step for the eventual resumption of U.S. cruise industry operations by issuing new technical instructions.
In October, the CDC issued Conditional Sailing Order for operators, which acted as a guidance for a phased resumption of cruise ship passenger operations. 
On Wednesday, it announced two new phases and said operators now have all necessary requirements needed ""to start simulated voyages before resuming restricted passenger voyages and apply for a COVID-19 conditional sailing certificate to begin sailing with restricted passenger voyages."" 
The CDC said on April 28 it was ""committed"" to the resumption of cruise industry passenger operations by mid-summer as it issued some clarifications of its earlier order.
The agency also released the COVID-19 Conditional Sailing Certificate application, ""the final step before restricted passenger voyages.""
The new guidance includes eligibility and requirements for conducting a trial voyage in preparation for restricted passenger voyages and for CDC cruise ships inspections during simulated and restricted passenger voyages.
Once cruise ships operators receive approved COVID-19 Conditional Sailing Certificate applications, they will be permitted to sail with passengers.
The Cruise Lines International Association, which represents Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp, Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) and  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) Cruises , said Wednesday it was reviewing the CDC's latest instructions. The association said last week it was optimistic that CDC ""clarifications show positive progression—and, importantly, a demonstrated commitment to constructive dialogue, which is key to restarting cruising."" 
The group added ""plenty of work remains in order to achieve our mutual goal of responsible resumption from U.S. ports this summer.""
Florida and Alaska have filed a lawsuit seeking to force the CDC to immediately allow the resumption of cruise operations.

The CDC said COVID-19 vaccines ""play a critical role in the safe resumption of passenger operations, but not all cruise ship operators have announced plans to mandate passenger vaccinations.""
The agency said it ""recommends that all port personnel and travelers (passengers and crew) get a COVID-19 vaccine.""

The biggest U.S. oil producer has slashed costs, delayed projects and said it could trim an estimated 14,000 employees globally, or 15%, including contractors. Exxon (NYSE:XOM) reported its first annual loss last year as the COVID-19 pandemic battered energy demand.
The company will spend more this year than in 2020 as workers exit, according to the filing. 
Total cash outflows would be between $400 million and $600 million, versus $47 million last year, according to the filing. Exxon had set aside some money last year toward the costs.
The severance cost estimate does not include job cuts related to changes in the company's portfolio, it said.
Reductions should be ""substantially complete"" by year end, including voluntary and involuntary exits and the use of fewer in contractors, Exxon said.

In the first quarter the company had before-tax charges of $39 million mostly from employee separation costs in Singapore and Europe.
Cost savings from its global staffing review are likely to range between $1 billion and $2 billion per year versus 2019 levels, according to Wednesday's filing.

The booster shots, given to volunteers previously inoculated with  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s two-dose vaccine regimen, also boosted antibodies against the original version of COVID-19, Moderna said. 
The early data comes from a 40-person trial testing both Moderna's existing shot and a version developed to protect against the South African variant of COVID-19 called mRNA-1273.351. Moderna is also studying a shot that combines both the new and existing vaccine.
The results show that while booster shots of either version of the vaccine increased antibodies against all of the variants of COVID-19 tested in the trial, the new booster had a bigger response against the South African variant than the original vaccine.
""We are encouraged by these new data, which reinforce our confidence that our booster strategy should be protective"" against the newer variants of COVID-19, Stephane Bancel, Moderna's chief executive officer, said in a statement.
Both booster shots were well tolerated, with side effects similar to what volunteers in previous studies experienced from the second dose of its vaccine, Moderna said.
The new variants of COVID-19 first discovered in South Africa and Brazil are thought to be more resistant to existing vaccines. Both variants have been detected in the United States but comprise only a small fraction of U.S. cases so far, according to federal data last updated in April. 
Moderna's study is looking at levels of antibodies in participants' blood that combat COVID-19, an early indication that they will be protected against the virus. It first announced it was studying ways to protect against the variants of COVID-19 in February.

Moderna expects to share additional data soon on another potential booster shot that mixes its existing COVID-19 vaccine with the newly developed shot. 
The U.S. government scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is conducting a separate early stage study of mRNA-1273.351, Moderna said.

However, Cloudflare (NYSE:NET) and Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) are trading at lofty valuations now and we think are overdue for a price correction. So, it’s wise to avoid them now. Let’s look closer.Several cyber hacking incidents—the most notable being the SolarWinds cyber hack last December—have highlighted the importance of advanced cybersecurity solutions. As the world becomes increasingly digitized (more dependent on digital operations and solutions), the demand for cybersecurity solutions is expected to increase exponentially.
However, investors are now mostly focused on cyclical stocks that are expected to do well as the economy recovers. Investors’ sector rotation into cyclical stocks is reflected in Global X Cybersecurity ETF’s (BUG) 9% loss over the past three months compared to SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust’s (SPY) 7.6% gains.
Although cybersecurity solutions are expected to be in greater demand in the coming months, and many companies in the sector are well positioned to benefit, some overvalued stocks in this space could witness a sell-off in the near term. Examples are Cloudflare, Inc. (NET) and Zscaler, Inc. (ZS). They are currently trading at price levels that are not justified by their current financials or prospects. So, we think it’s wise to avoid them now.

1172,By StockNews,"<span>May 05, 2021 04:30PM ET</span>","2 Auto Manufacturing Stocks to Buy in May, 2 to Avoid","From small auto manufacturing companies to big conglomerates, all automakers are struggling to maintain their production volume due to a global semiconductor chip shortage. While some fundamentally sound companies, such as Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) (VWAGY) and  Daimler  (OTC:DDAIF), have sufficient warehouse stocks and supply chains to survive the shortage, weak players, such as XPeng (XPEV) and Li Auto (LI), are struggling to stay afloat. Let’s look closer at each name.With the reopening of factories and resumption of production worldwide, the auto manufacturing industry is back in business this year from its forced, COVID-19-driven hiatus. Buoyed by a pent-up demand for personal vehicles and a growing interest in electric vehicles (EVs), the industry has seen a significant increase in sales so far this year. In fact, the global automotive aftermarket is expected to grow at a 3.8% CAGR of 3.8% over the next seven years to hit $529.25 billion by 2028.
However, the automobile industry has been facing a serious problem. A global semiconductor shortage has forced automakers to cut production and idle plants. Given that the shortage is expected to last at least until year’s end, many auto manufacturers have been hoarding their chips on hand for their expensive models.
Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) and Daimler AG (DE:DAIGn) (DDAIF) have managed to overcome the shortage issue by diversifying their supply chains, scaling up production, and maintaining a good warehouse of the required components. So, we believe these two stocks should continue to be strong performers this year. Conversely, XPeng Inc. (XPEV) and Li Auto Inc. (LI) are struggling to stay afloat due to the chip shortage and to weakness in their financials. So, we think these two stocks will witness further declines.

Investing.com – The Dow closed below its record intraday highs Wednesday as technology cut gains while cyclicals continued to advance despite a surprise decline in U.S. services activity and weaker labor market data. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.28%, or 96.99 points, to end the day at a record close of 34,230.02 the S&P 500 was up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.37%.
Tech stocks struggled to hold onto their gains amid ongoing concerns about the impact of rising inflation and an eventual increase in rates. 
Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) traded in the green, while Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) closed in the red.
Facebook, meanwhile, was in the spotlight after its oversight board ruled in favor of the social media giant's decision to ban former President Donald Trump, but said the company must make a decision on whether to ban Trump permanently in the coming months.
In other news, Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) fell more than 14% as the exercise equipment company recalled its Tread+ and Tread treadmills due to a risk of injury. The recall comes after weeks of negotiations with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.
Energy stocks were pushed higher even as oil prices gave up some gains despite data showing a larger-than-expected draw that strengthened investor expectations for a recovery in demand.
U.S. crude oil stocks slipped by 9 million barrels in the week ended April 30, a much larger decrease than the 2 million barrel drop expected.
Other cyclicals including materials and financials supported the broader market's move higher as optimism over the economy continued despite weaker labor market and services data.
ISM nonmanufacturing data for April fell a reading of 62.7, missing expectations of 64.3.

Investing.com -- Stocks rose on Wednesday as investors looked to what is expected to be a strong April jobs report on Friday, an indication the economy continues to roar back.
Strong economic data and earnings last week pushed markets to records, but they have waffled around in the last couple of days.
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen tossed a wet towel of uncertainty on the situation Tuesday by first suggesting rates might have to rise to prevent the economy from overheating and then trying to walk those words back. 
Tech stocks sold off in the afternoon Tuesday and tried to retrace that ground on Wednesday as investors delivered the message: Don’t talk about interest rates, especially if you are the former Federal Reserve Chair.
Big tech names like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) rose on Wednesday, as did General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), which said it could hit the top end of its 2021 profit forecast despite a global chip shortage that has hampered production.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. A look at the gig economy
 Uber Technologies Inc  (NYSE:UBER) analysts expect a loss per share of 56 cents on revenue of $3.26 billion when the ride-hailing company reports Wednesday night. The Labor Department nullified a Trump-era rule that tried to make it more difficult for a gig worker to be counted as an employee, a possible blow to companies like Uber and LYFT Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) that rely on independent gig workers.
2. Pharmaceutical earnings
 Moderna  Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA)reports first quarter results early on Thursday, and analysts expect EPS of $2.60 on revenue of $2.23 billion. Rival  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) beat expectations earlier this week and raised its sales forecast for its Covid-19 vaccine to $26 billion as governments and employers press people to get their vaccines. On Wednesday the Biden administration said it would support a waiver on the patents for the Covid vaccines, sending Moderna shares down more than 5%.
3. Focus on job market
On Wednesday, ADP’s private payroll report for April showed jobs rose 742,000. That lifted stocks and tosses more optimism on Friday’s all important nonfarm jobs report from the government. But between now and then, Thursday brings unemployment data. Initial jobless claims are expected to come in around 540,000 and continuing claims around 3.62 million. The data are released at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).

1180,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2021 03:36PM ET</span>",Biden admin still undecided on Minnesota copper mine project - Vilsack,"By Andrea Shalal and Ernest Scheyder
(Reuters) - U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said on Wednesday that the White House has not decided on the fate of the Twin Metals copper mining project in Minnesota, as it works to balance economic growth and strong opposition from environmentalists.
Vilsack's comments were among the first from a senior official in President Joe Biden's administration on the proposed underground mine, which environmentalists fear would permanently mar the Boundary Waters (NYSE:WAT) Canoe Area Wilderness on the U.S.-Canada border.
Twin Metals and its supporters, including several Minnesota labor unions, have said the project can be constructed safely and in a way that boosts the region's economy.
The Biden administration is ""trying to find the balance between preserving a pristine area, and at the same time looking for ways in which job growth, economic growth can take place in rural areas. And that's what we're going to attempt to do. There are no final decisions being made on this,"" Vilsack told reporters in a White House briefing.
The mine would, if built, be a major supplier of copper to the United States as Biden aims to build more electric vehicles, which use twice as much of the red metal as those with internal combustion engines.
Representatives for Twin Metals, which is controlled by Chile's  Antofagasta  (LON:ANTO) Plc, said the company expects the regulatory review process ""to remain fair and based on science and law in the years ahead.""
Friends of the Boundary Waters Wilderness, an environmental group opposed to the project, said in response to Vilsack's comments that mining in the region would be ""much more of a soggy Band-Aid than any kind of real fix for the area's economy.""
Former U.S. President Barack Obama's administration had started a two-year process that would have banned copper mining in the Boundary Waters region for 20 years. But his successor, Donald Trump, put that process on hold, effectively letting mine planning continue.
Some of Twin Metals' leases for the land also expired under Obama, though Trump reissued them.
Environmentalists had been expecting the Agriculture Department, which oversees the U.S. Forest Service, the agency that controls federal lands in the region, to restart the review process for the 20-year ban and also pull the land leases.

Representative Betty McCollum, a Minnesota Democrat, introduced a bill last month that would ban mining in the region. Biden only has the power to block mining for 20 years in the region, though Congress can permanently block it.
In March, Vilsack moved to temporarily block another controversial copper mine, Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) Plc's Resolution Copper project in Arizona.

Thus, analysts expect these stocks to generate substantial momentum in the near term. Let’s discuss.The tech sell-off has been ongoing for some time as investors rotate away from the expensive tech players to relatively cheaper outdoor and cyclical stocks that are expected to gain significantly from a faster-than-expected macroeconomic recovery.

As such, we think it is wise to bet on small-cap companies  PRGX Global  (NASDAQ:PRGX), Core Molding (CMT), and Evolving Systems (EVOL).They have immense growth potential. Read on.During times of economic recovery, small-cap stocks tend to outperform their large-cap counterparts. So, as the United States’ economic recovery gains steam, small cap stocks have, not surprisingly, been making a solid comeback on the back of rising consumer spending and easy access to capital. Also, several small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) have been receiving substantial government support in the form of tax deferrals and subsidies. And the $1,400 recovery checks that have been awarded by the government to millions of U.S. households are driving an increase in consumer spending and a consequent increase in demand for these companies’ products and services. 
Investors’ growing interest in the small-cap stocks is evident in the Vanguard Small-Cap Index Fund ETF’s (VB) 13.7% gains and the SPDR S&P 600 Small Cap ETF’s (SLY) close to 21% returns so far this year. These returns compare to the 11.2% gains of the large-cap focused SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY).
So, investors that are seeking to capitalize on the economic recovery and have higher-than-average risk appetites should invest in PRGX Global, Inc. (PRGX), Core Molding Technologies, Inc.

The 170 year-old publication had benefited from an action-packed 2020 that was dominated by the tumultuous U.S. elections, civil unrest and the coronavirus crisis, as well as the attention it drew from criticism by former U.S President Donald Trump on many occasions during his term.

The company said on Wednesday it added 301,000 digital subscribers in the first quarter, its lowest gain since the third quarter of 2019.
""We now expect annual total net subscription additions to be in the range of our 2019 performance.""
However, efforts to ramp up its digital products including news, games, cooking and podcast apps have helped it rake in hordes of subscribers in recent years, especially during the height of the pandemic as people stuck at home sought entertainment.
At the end of March, the Times had more than 7.8 million total subscriptions across digital and print - with close to 7 million digital-only subscriptions, 75% of which came from its core news product.
Although its digital business has been a beacon for other newspapers across a struggling industry, tech giants like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) have siphoned online advertising dollars from publishers and distribute news articles without paying the producing outlets.

The Times' revenue in the first quarter rose 6.6% to $473 million versus estimate of $463.3 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Excluding items, it posted a profit of 26 cents per share, above estimates of 14 cents.

1188,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2021 01:47PM ET</span>",GM's Barra sees a more profitable future through the haze of chip shortage,"By Nick Carey and Ben Klayman
(Reuters) -General Motors Co and Chief Executive Mary Barra were forced by the semiconductor supply-chain crunch to slash production and sell fewer vehicles at higher prices.
The result: Fatter margins, far stronger than expected first-quarter profit and a healthy boost for GM shares. 
Executives at Stellantis NV, created by the merger of PSA and Fiat Chrysler, echoed the same theme on Wednesday. Last week officials at  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co made similar comments.
Through the haze of production cuts and supply-chain snafus, some automakers are discovering they can deliver better results without stockpiling vehicles or padding sales volumes with low-priced, low-margin models.
""We'll never go back to that level of inventories that we held pre-pandemic because we've learned we can be much more efficient,"" Barra told analysts on a conference call on Wednesday, though she added future supplies would be ""a little higher"" than current levels to satisfy customer demand. 
""It's better for everybody,"" she said. ""It's better for the car company, it's better for the dealer.""
Barra added the No. 1 U.S. automaker was focused on maximizing production of high-demand vehicles like the full-sized Chevrolet Silverado pickup, and GMC Yukon, Chevy Suburban and Cadillac Escalade SUVs. 
The leaner vehicle supplies allowed GM to raise average new-vehicle transaction price by 9% overall, including 10% for pickups and over 20% for large SUVs, Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said.
Thanks to high consumer demand that has pushed up prices, focusing on those high-margin models contributed $3.2 billion to GM's first-quarter pretax profit. 
Pretax margins in GM's North American auto business hit 12.1% in the first quarter, up from 8.5% a year earlier.
GM has continued to build its highest-profit vehicles by shifting supplies of chips from lower-priced models and idling factories that produce them. Last week, it extended downtime for plants in Kansas and Ontario into early July and late June, respectively, curtailing output of the Cadillac XT4 and Chevy Equinox SUVs, and the Chevy Malibu sedan.
Ford on Wednesday outlined plans to idle more plants, including two weeks in May at its Kansas City, Missouri, plant that builds the top-selling F-150 truck.
ATTAINING BALANCE
Auto executives, especially at the Detroit Three, have talked for years about more closely matching production and inventories to customer demand, moving away from endless rounds of discounts and year-end clearance sales. The pressure to keep factories running, and a tradition of aiming for higher sales volumes, kept the prize out of reach.
At Daimler (OTC:DDAIF), Chief Financial Officer Harald Wilhelm on April 23 highlighted the company's higher margins and praised the industry for ""not dumping"" vehicles into the market.
""We are not pushing like mad for volumes, and that has a healthy impact,"" Wilhelm said. 
The current chip supply crisis is far from the ideal way for automakers to achieve a more profitable balance of supply and demand. Automakers have cut full-year profit forecasts, and are warning the squeeze could last into next year. 
Barra echoed other auto executives when she said the chip shortage will worsen in the second quarter before improving in the second half of the year.
GM reiterated its full-year 2021 earnings guidance and said ""based on what we know today,"" its results will be at the upper end of the $10 billion to $11 billion adjusted pretax profit it has previously forecast. 
GM stuck to earlier forecasts that the chip shortage could shave $1.5 billion to $2 billion from this year's profit. The automaker declined to say how much vehicle production would be lost this year due to the issue.
Carmakers across the world have had to curb output, hampering their attempts to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, due to a shortage of vital chips used in everything from computer management of engines to driver assistance systems. Stellantis, echoing GM as well as Ford last week, said second-quarter production would suffer and the chip shortage would linger into 2022. 
Barra also said on Wednesday GM was working with Honda Motor Co to expand their partnership to purchasing, research and development, and connected services.

GM posted a first-quarter net profit of $3 billion, or $2.03 per share, up from $294 million or 17 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, it earned $2.25 per share, well above analyst expectations of $1.04.
The company's shares were up 3.8% at $57.45 on Wednesday afternoon.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers are pushing for tens of billions of dollars in funding to shift to electric vehicles and away from gas-powered vehicles and build hundreds of thousands of charging stations.
Representatives Andy Levin and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Wednesday are unveiling a revised version of their bill dubbed the ""Electric Vehicle Freedom Act"" to create a network of high-speed charging stations within five years along the public roads of the national highway system in the United States.
The House Democrats proposed a version last year while Donald Trump was president and who backed ending taxpayer subsidies for electric vehicle purchases. Levin said in an interview ""everything's changed"" in the push for EVs with the change in administration.
President Joe Biden has called for $174 billion in new spending to boost EVs and charging, including $15 billion to help build and support a national charging network of 500,000 stations by 2030.
""We have a president who campaigned that he was going to install 500,000 chargers,"" Levin said.
A U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee panel is holding a hearing on several pieces of legislation to boost electric vehicles and charging Wednesday.
""We must invest in the necessary charging and manufacturing infrastructure so consumers are able to reliably charge their cars,"" committee chairman Frank Pallone said.
Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the panel's top Republican, said the Biden administration is moving to a ""mandatory rush to green"" in vehicles.
Biden faces a push from many lawmakers and 12 states led by California to endorse phasing out the sale of new gasoline-powered passenger vehicles by 2035, something California plans to do. Biden has not backed a phaseout date.

The United Auto Workers (UAW) union also opposes setting a phaseout date. UAW legislative director Josh Nassar told the committee the government should not subsidizes EVs built outside the United States.
The UAW criticized General Motors (NYSE:GM) announcement Thursday to invest $1 billion to build EVs in Mexico. ""If the public is going to foot the bill, the public should get economic benefits in return, in the form of domestic investments and quality jobs,"" Nassar said.

1194,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2021 01:11PM ET</span>",BlackRock ups boardroom pressure as annual meetings get going,"By Ross Kerber and Simon Jessop
BOSTON/LONDON (Reuters) -BlackRock voted against more company directors and backed more shareholder resolutions in the first quarter than a year earlier, as the world's biggest asset manager looks to push boards to do more on climate and other sustainability issues.
The information from the $9 trillion New York-based money manager in a report to be released on Wednesday helps to explain what is shaping up to be a tough shareholder voting season at major corporations this spring. 
Just on Tuesday, investors rejected the pay of executives at GE Corp, for instance, and last week gave a record level of support, 81%, to a resolution calling for a report on plastics pollution at Dupont.
Both votes took place after the first-quarter period covered by BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s report. But in a separate piece posted on its website on Wednesday, BlackRock said it voted against the pay at GE, and against board compensation committee members, ""given the misalignment of pay and performance.""
In addition, BlackRock said it supported a resolution calling for a so-called ""say on climate"" advisory vote on greenhouse gas emissions at  Charter Communications  Inc (NASDAQ:CHTR) on April 27. The measure drew support from 39% of votes cast.
Together the material suggested BlackRock taking a more aggressive stance under Sandy Boss, the company's London-based global head of investment stewardship since 2020.
""We are accelerating the pace of our stewardship activities; resulting in more engagement and more voting, reflecting heightened expectations, which ... are just a function of the urgency of some of the issues,"" Boss said in an interview.
Boss declined to comment on votes since April or upcoming ones. Activists have urged BlackRock and other influential top investors to push their portfolio companies more after years of fund manager votes that rubber-stamped management wishes.
For instance, BlackRock said on Wednesday it had abstained from voting at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) PLC on a resolution calling for the bank to phase out fossil fuel financing shareholders largely opposed. BlackRock said the resolution's wording was ""imprecise and ambiguous."" 
Citing that vote and others yet to come at companies like  Duke Energy  (NYSE:DUK) and ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Sierra Club official Ben Cushing said in a statement that BlackRock is ""taking too much credit, too soon.""
Among other things, BlackRock said it had backed three-quarters of the environment and social-focused resolutions filed by shareholders during the first quarter, including eight environment-focused votes. 
In the same period last year, BlackRock's support for such resolutions was less than 10%, the report showed, including its opposition to all three environmental resolutions on which it cast ballots. 

Of the 2,600 shareholder meetings held in the period, at which BlackRock voted on more than 21,000 proposals, the money manager said it had voted against management on one or more proposals at 35% of meetings, up from 30% a year earlier.
BlackRock said it did not back directors or director-related proposals 12% of the time, up from 9% a year ago. Reasons included a lack of board diversity, misaligned pay and a lack of independence.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) has softened its stance on tough new European carbon dioxide emissions targets for automakers, betting it can absorb more stringent cuts than its rivals, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The EU last month raised its target for cuts in net greenhouse gas emissions to 55% by 2030 from 1990 levels instead of 40% and Europe's automakers will find out in July what their contribution on CO2 emissions is expected to be.
Three sources told Reuters that Volkswagen, which owns car brands including Porsche, Audi, VW, Seat and Skoda, is quietly letting policymakers in Brussels know that it would support more ambitious cuts in emissions than other car manufacturers.
While the sources did not say what specific targets Volkswagen would be comfortable with, the move by Europe's biggest carmaker is both undermining and upsetting smaller rivals that want Brussels to give them more leeway.
""This has become a quest for survival,"" one person familiar with the carmaker said. ""You can't wait for others to eventually catch up.""
Asked about its stance on CO2 emissions, Volkswagen said it had already signalled its support for ambitious CO2 cuts in the past, adding this would require an expansion of electric vehicle charging infrastructure and renewable energy.
The company said it expected the European Commission to recommend a 50% cut in fleet-wide CO2 emissions for passenger cars by 2030, adding this was the level it had prepared for.
It might be able to absorb even more.
Volkswagen has set itself a 2025 deadline for overtaking U.S. pioneer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and becoming the world's biggest seller of electric vehicles (EVs), a plan that includes building six battery factories in Europe alone by 2030.
BINDING COMMITMENTS
Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) Chief Executive Herbert Diess has reasons to be aggressive.
The German carmaker took an early decision to build a common platform for EVs, it has a cash pile of 24 billion euros ($29 billion) and is fast clawing market share for mass-market EVs away from early leaders such as  Renault  (PA:RENA).
With its manufacturing and financial muscle, Volkswagen could reach full manufacturing cost parity between electric and conventional cars by 2025, analysts at Swiss bank UBS say.
Tensions over emissions cuts came to a head at a board meeting of the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) in March, two people familiar with the matter said.
Several chief executives said they were concerned about the prospect of tougher EU standards, as they could blow a hole in profits from fossil-fuel engines that could not yet be plugged by electric vehicles, the two people said.
But Diess took a more upbeat view, saying his company's EVs would achieve cost parity by the mid-2020s, a comment that raised eyebrows among fellow CEOs at the meeting including Renault's Luca de Meo, one of the people said.
Renault and Volkswagen declined to comment on the meeting.
The ACEA said it did not report on details of discussions that took place during its board meetings.
""What we can report, however, is that during this meeting, all CEOs agreed that they are open to higher CO2 reduction targets for cars in 2030, provided that these targets are directly linked to binding commitments from member states to roll out the required charging points and hydrogen stations,"" the association told Reuters.
MASS MARKET
But some ACEA members, such as Volkswagen, are able to absorb deeper cuts than others, the people familiar with the meeting said, pointing out that while the association was open to more ambitious targets, it has not given a firm number.
At the moment, the European industry must deliver fleet-wide cuts in emissions of 37.5% by 2030 for new passenger cars from 2021 limits - equivalent to a reduction from 95 grams of CO2 per km this year to 59 g/km at the end of the decade.
One person familiar with the matter said the industry was now bracing for this target reduction to rise to at least 50% when the European Commission unveils its plans.
That could even rise to 55%, or more, as the legislation goes through the European Parliament, the person said, potentially squeezing some of the weaker European players with lower pain points when it comes to emissions.
Premium carmakers can get away with meeting tougher emissions standards by pursuing both electric vehicles and combustion engines, simply because some clients will always be prepared to pay more for luxury electric vehicles.
But it's different for the mass market where affordability is key, so Volkswagen was forced to come up with a strategy to build affordable and profitable EVs for the masses quickly.
It introduced a modular electric-drive platform, known as MEB, ahead of its European rivals and it now underpins electric EVs under a variety of its brands, including Audi, VW and Skoda.
""Five years ago, we decided to build a single platform for electric cars. Many in the industry questioned our approach,"" Diess told Volkswagen's Power Day in March. ""Today, they are following suit, while we are reaping the fruit.""
UNDER ATTACK
Taking a page out of Volkswagen's book, Renault's de Meo, a former Volkswagen executive who turned the Seat brand around, is now banking on its electric platforms known as CMF B-EV and CMF A to produce small and affordable EVs.
""It is our weapon to counter Volkswagen,"" he said in a memo last year.
Volkswagen is already winning market share at Renault's expense in the battery electric vehicle sector in Europe, figures from database EV-Volumes.com show.
Volkswagen's share soared to 25% last year from 14% in 2019, overtaking the Renault, Nissan (OTC:NSANY), Mitsubishi alliance, whose share shrank to 19% from 23% in 2019.
In the first quarter of 2021, Renault's share declined further to 15%, tying with Tesla for third place behind Volkswagen on 21% and Stellantis on 17%, according to EV-Volumes.com. 
For a graphic on Joining the EV race:
https://graphics.reuters.com/AUTOS-ELECTRIC/yzdvxbkkdvx/chart.png 
""Renault has held a strong position within the European BEV (battery electric vehicles) market for several years now. That said, with launches from peers such as VW and Stellantis, we believe this leadership is coming under increasing attack,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts said.
Selling mass-market EVs is also vital to earn valuable carbon credits that carmakers can sell to rivals struggling to meet EU emissions targets.
EV champions can even make a business selling credits to heavy emitters. Tesla, for example, sold Italy's FCA European and U.S. CO2 credits worth 2 billion euros from 2019 to 2021, and green credit sales helped boost its first-quarter revenue.
FCA's merger with France's PSA to form Stellantis, however, has brought an end to its need for Tesla credits this year, thanks to the French carmaker's electric technology, Stellantis said on Tuesday.
Concerns Renault, among others, might have a tougher time than some in meeting stricter emission standards, however, is hitting a nerve in the French government, which has a 15% stake in the carmaker.

Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire lashed out at tougher EU automotive standards last month, telling Le Figaro newspaper they should not ""destroy our industry"".
""Some proposals are going too far,"" he said.

Archegos has hired restructuring advisers to assess the potential legal claims from banks and to plan for a possible winding down of its operations, the report said, citing two people familiar with the matter. (https://on.ft.com/33eR2Gl)
The family office's meltdown was triggered after ViacomCBS (NASDAQ:VIAC), a company Archegos was heavily exposed to, announced a stock offering in March. A slump in the media company's share price alarmed the banks, which called on the fund for more collateral.
The fund defaulted on the margin call, which set off a scramble among Wall Street banks that had financed its trades to start unwinding them.
Global banks lost nearly $10 billion from the Archegos fallout.  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN),  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) were some of the banks that were hit.
The New York-based fund had assets of around $10 billion but held positions worth more than $50 billion. The saga is likely to have regulatory repercussions, as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve both have said the situation is under scrutiny.

A number of the banks who lost money are preparing to issue ""letters of demand"" to Archegos, which are requests for payment before launching a legal claim, three people close to the process told FT.
Archegos declined to comment on the FT report.

1203,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2021 11:52AM ET</span>","ANALYSIS-Unlike Trump, Biden arms export policy strikes balance on human rights, economics","By Mike Stone
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ninety minutes before President Joe Biden took office on January 20th, the United States signed a $23 billion dollar deal to sell F-35 jets, drones and advanced missiles to the United Arab Emirates.
It was part of flurry of last minute deals President Donald Trump had told Congress were coming in his last two months in office, forcing the Biden administration to make quick decisions on whether or not to stick with the geopolitically sensitive weapons sales.
To the surprise of some Democratic allies, Biden has so far kept the lion's share of Trump's more controversial agreements. Executives at five large defense contractors who requested anonymity to speak freely were also surprised by the speed of the Biden administration's deliberations. 
Longer-term, however, those executives and five more people in and around the administration told Reuters that Biden's policy will shift to emphasize human rights over Trump's more commercial approach to exporting military equipment.
Biden's posture towards arms exports - specifically around reducing weapons used to attack others - could shift sales at Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Corp and  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT). That means fewer bullets, bombs and missiles, while security products like radars, surveillance equipment and defenses against attacks get the green light.
In an interview last week, Raytheon (NYSE:RTN)'s CFO Neil Mitchill said that offensive munitions exports, ""going forward, the kinds of sales that we were talking about have been declining,"" adding there has been a multi-year downward trend of offensive weapon sales to foreign customers.
Boeing and Lockheed declined to comment.
In the early days of the Biden administration, officials paused weapons sales to Middle East allies, including sales of Raytheon's and Boeing-made precision guided munitions to Saudi Arabia. 
Eventually a determination was made to only sell the Kingdom ""defensive"" arms, while limiting weapons that could be used to attack out of concern over casualties in Saudi Arabia's war with Yemen.
Biden's team ultimately decided to stick with the massive UAE deal. The move spurred criticism from the human rights group Amnesty International which immediately bashed the decision and drew complaints from lawmaker Robert Menendez, Chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
One former U.S. official familiar with the Biden transition team's thinking noted that many aspects of the F-35 sale still need to be negotiated, giving them leverage as the Abraham Accords between UAE and Israel are implemented. The F-35 sale was a side deal to the accords.
PIVOT TO DEFENSE
But arms deals like Trump's UAE agreement, and others with governments that have poor records on human rights records look far less likely from the Biden White House. 
""While economic security will remain a factor"" when reviewing weapons sales, the Biden Administration will ""reprioritize"" other factors including U.S. national security, human rights and nonproliferation, a U.S. official has told Reuters.
""I'm hopeful that as we hear statements that support human rights as being front and center in arms transfer deliberations, we'll see that play out through actual decisions, and not just words,"" Rachel Stohl, vice president at the Stimson Center in Washington said. 
During the transition period from election day in November to Biden's inauguration, Trump's team sent notification of $31 billion of foreign arms sales to Congress. Congressional notifications occur for most foreign military sales before a contract can be signed to sell a weapon.
On average, foreign military sales under Trump amounted to $57.5 billion per year, versus an average of $53.9 billion per year for the eight years under his predecessor Barack Obama, in 2020 dollars, according to Bill Hartung, director of the Arms and Security Program at the Center for International Policy think tank. 
Biden's approval of several late-Trump deals will ease the political and diplomatic transition from one administration to another, according to a State Department official. In the case of the UAE deal, the official said, it helps the two nations ""meet our mutual strategic objectives to build a stronger, interoperable, and more capable security partnership.""
As Lockheed's CEO Jim Taiclet put it to Reuters late last year, ""alliances are really important... Foreign Military Sales are part and parcel of that.""

The Biden administration inherited a backlog of more than 500 weapons export deals teed up by the Trump administration, one person briefed on the State Department's backlog said.
Going forward, the Stimson Center's Rachel Stohl said Biden's State Department team is ""looking at countries, at individual weapons systems, as well as individual sales."" But as more appointees take their posts at the State Department she said there could be a ""paradigm shift on the way in which arms sales are considered as part of holistic efforts to develop and build partnerships and capacity.""

BERLIN (Reuters) -France, Germany and Spain have reached a general agreement on the next steps in developing a joint fighter jet and hope to hammer out all the details by mid-May, a German defence source told Reuters.
The three nations are trying to resolve differences over access to know-how, or intellectual property rights (IPR), after arms firms struck a deal on industrial workshare. Pressure for a quick deal is mounting ahead of a September election in Germany.Disagreements over IPRs meant the countries missed an end-April deadline previously set by Germany and France to broker a deal that would secure the next phase in Europe's biggest defence project, whose total cost is estimated at 100 billion euros ($120 billion).

Participants will put together a list of IPRs by mid-May, spelling out what can be shared by all partners and what must be kept confidential for specific companies, the source said. France's Dassault Aviation, Airbus and Indra - the latter two representing Germany and Spain respectively - are involved in the scheme to start replacing French Rafale and German and Spanish Eurofighters from 2040. The next step of development is expected to cost 2.5 billion euros ($3.00 billion) in total. Two other sources said an agreement was close but more discussions were needed, with IPRs the biggest remaining hurdle. A French government source said there was no deal yet.
Even if a final agreement is reached by mid-May, Berlin may not have time to secure the approval of Germany's powerful parliamentary budget committee ahead of September's federal election. Approval is needed before funds can be spent. Typically that process takes several months but the last realistic date at which the budget committee can make a decision is June 24, two sources said. Although German political parties have starkly different views on defence spending, analysts say the deal is likely to be presented as an anchor for Franco-German ties lying at the heart of European co-operation, which have cross-party German support. Previously, a source with knowledge of the issue told Reuters the German defence ministry must refer the budget proposal to the finance ministry by May 19.

1207,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2021 11:33AM ET</span>",Higher prices help Stellantis weather worsening chip shortage,"By Giulio Piovaccari, Gilles Guillaume and Nick Carey
MILAN (Reuters) -Higher prices and robust consumer demand will help Stellantis deliver a strong performance this year, despite a worsening global shortage of semiconductor chips this quarter, the world's fourth-biggest carmaker said on Wednesday.
Chief Financial Officer Richard Palmer said the group also expected to meet European CO2 emissions targets this year without environmental credits bought from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), giving another boost to results.
""Clearly the fact that we don't have to pay Tesla any longer will further improve our performance in Europe,"" he told a conference call after forecast-beating quarterly revenues. 
Palmer said the chip shortage should improve in the second half of 2021, but warned the disruption to the auto industry could last into 2022. 
Carmakers across the world have had to curb output, hampering their attempts to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, due to a shortage of vital chips used in everything from computer management of engines to driver assistance systems. 
So far, however, Stellantis has benefited from focusing on high-margin pickup trucks and SUVs in its crucial U.S. business, as lean inventories have driven up new car prices. The higher prices paid by American consumers added about $1.5 billion to Stellantis' first-quarter revenues.
Total revenues rose 14% to 37 billion euros ($44.5 billion) in January-March on a pro-forma basis, beating analysts' mean forecast of 34.9 billion euros in a Reuters poll. 
Shares in Stellantis, formed at the start of the year from the merger of Italian-American Fiat Chrysler and France's PSA, rose more than 5%. 
PRODUCTION SETBACK
Citi analysts described the results as ""solid"", adding that ""overall it seems likely that Stellantis profitability is running ahead of expectations."" 
But production losses due to the chip shortage prevented a stronger rebound from industry wide plant shutdowns in March 2020 to halt the spread of the pandemic. 
Chip shortages cut around 11% of Stellantis' planned production in the first quarter. 
Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co warned last week the shortage could halve its production in the second quarter.
Palmer told reporters the shortage was currently affecting eight of Stellantis' 44 assembly plants. 
But he said the disruption had not affected its integration plan, from which the group aims to deliver over 5 billion euros a year in savings.
""The synergy plan is very much on target,"" Palmer said.
Stellantis reiterated its forecast for an adjusted operating profit margin of 5.5%-7.5% this year. 

The group said planned production launches - for Jeep's new Grand Wagoneer and Wagoneer large SUV models scheduled for this quarter and for the next generation Grand Cherokee in the third quarter - remained on track.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Sporting goods maker Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) has launched the sale of its Reebok brand in an auction which risks being affected by a political row over possible forced labour in China's western Xinjiang region, three sources told Reuters.
Adidas bought the U.S. fitness label for $3.8 billion in 2006 to help compete with arch-rival  Nike  (NYSE:NKE), but its sluggish performance led to repeated calls from investors to dispose of the brand, which is now expected to fetch only around 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion). 
Adidas has asked for first round bids to be submitted next week and is expecting China's Anta Sports and Li Ning to hand in offers, with Korea's Fila and U.S.-based Wolverine also seen as possible bidders, the sources, who are all familiar with the situation, said. 
Financial investors including TPG, Sycamore, Cerberus and Apollo are also likely to join the fray, lured by the turnaround potential of Reebok which is expected to make a loss in 2021 and post only ""slightly positive"" core earnings next year, they added.
Adidas declined to comment. The prospective bidders also declined to comment or were not immediately available for comment. 
For Chinese buyers the appeal could be dented by consumer boycotts of Western fashion brands in the country over comments they did not use cotton sourced from Xinjiang. 
Some researchers and foreign lawmakers say the Xinjiang authorities use coercive labour programmes to meet seasonal cotton picking needs, which China strongly denies.
Among others, the Shanghai Half Marathon in April scrapped plans to provide runners with Adidas-branded T-shirts.
Germany's Hugo Boss said on Wednesday it expects sales in mainland China to keep growing fast despite the boycott calls, while Puma said last week that it expects a hit to its sales.

Adidas is marketing Reebok off 2025 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of more than 200 million euros with expected annual revenue growth of 10%, the sources said.
Analysts have said Reebok's recent collaborations with celebrities like Cardi B and a refreshed focus on women's apparel have put the brand in a better place.

The Treasury said it will sell $58 billion in three-year notes next week as well as $41 billion in 10-year notes and $27 billion in 30-year bonds, unchanged from last quarter. 
It noted that it faces uncertain and sizable borrowing needs due to pandemic-related spending and that any shifts in borrowing needs will be met with changes in its issuance of Treasury bills and cash management bills.
The Treasury also said it expects Congress to raise or suspend the U.S. debt limit in a timely manner, and that it may take certain extraordinary measures if Congress does not.
Any such measure would be implemented after the reinstatement of the debt ceiling, if it occurs, rather than in anticipation of such a move, said Brian Smith, deputy assistant secretary for federal finance, in a call with reporters.
The Treasury also warned that extraordinary measures could be exhausted more quickly than in previous debt limit episodes.
The government expects its cash balance to be around $450 billion at the expiration of the debt limit suspension on July 31.

It expects the amount of Treasury bills outstanding to fall by around $150 billion by this date, which is approximately one-third of the size of the decline in bill supply since the February refunding.
The Treasury has reduced bill issuance this year as it cuts its cash balance, after raising a record amount of cash last year.

(Reuters) -British consumer goods giant Unilever (NYSE:UL) on Wednesday said an overwhelming majority of its shareholders voted in favour of its plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across its supply chain to net zero by 2039.
The maker of Dove soaps and Hellmann's mayonnaise is the largest company globally to give investors a say on its climate transition action plan. 
It said over 99% of shareholders who voted, voted in favour of the non-binding resolution, which was released during an online shareholder meeting. 
""Climate change represents a clear and present danger to our value chain,"" Chief Executive Officer Alan Jope said at the virtual meeting. 
""The overwhelming vote shows support to our ambitious emission reduction targets."" 
The company's emission reduction plans include transitioning to renewable energy sources, eliminating fossil fuels from its cleaning products, reducing corporate travel and refrigeration emissions. 
It will first eliminate emissions to net zero within its own operations and halve the impact of its products across its supply chain, compared to 2010 levels, by 2030.
The pathway to achieving these goals will come by focusing on reducing emissions associated with its business and products towards zero ""as far as possible,"" rather than purchasing and retiring carbon credits, the company said in its ""climate transition action plan https://www.unilever.com/Images/unilever-climate-transition-action-plan-19032021_tcm244-560179_en.pdf"" shared with shareholders ahead of the vote.

This led workers to find gig jobs at companies such as Airbnb (ABNB), Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER), and Fiverr International (NYSE:FVRR). Now that the economy is rapidly improving and job prospects are bullish, these stocks should be avoided.Gig economy stocks have taken off during the pandemic. The rise was somewhat justified as more businesses turned to gig workers and more people turned to gig employment during the pandemic.
However, now that we are emerging from the pandemic, gig economy stocks are clearly overvalued. Job-seekers and employers who turned to the gig economy during the pandemic will now largely return to traditional work-employee relationships. This spells bad news for gig economy stocks.
Let's take a quick look at three gig economy stocks that are overvalued and primed for a decline: Airbnb (ABNB), Uber Technologies (UBER), and Fiverr International (FVRR).

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Pandora (OTC:PANDY), the jewellery maker best know for its silver charm bracelets, will stop selling mined diamonds and focus on more affordable, sustainable, lab-grown gems, it said on Tuesday.
""Diamonds are not only forever, but for everyone,"" Pandora Chief Executive Alexander Lacik said as the Danish company launched a new collection of man-made stones.
Pandora, which made 85 million pieces of jewellery last year and sold 50,000 diamonds, said it aimed to ""transform the market for diamond jewellery with affordable, sustainably created products"".
The growing acceptance of man-made diamonds by millennials attracted to cheaper stones guaranteed not to have come from conflict zones has spurred firms such as De Beers to end its decades-old policy of shunning synthetic gems in its jewellery.
Prices of lab-grown diamonds have fallen over the past two years following the U-turn by De Beers in 2018 and are now up to 10 times cheaper than mined diamonds, according to a report by Bain & Company.
Pandora's new collection of lab-grown diamonds will be launched initially in the United Kingdom and will be available in other key markets next year, it said.
Pandora said it expected the diamond market to continue to grow, with sales of lab-grown diamonds outpacing overall growth.
Pandora's lab-grown gems will be made using a technology in which a hydrocarbon gas mixture is heated to 800 Celsius (1,472 Fahrenheit), spurring carbon atoms to be deposited on a small seed diamond, growing into a crystal layer by layer.

Pandora, which has until now sourced mined diamonds from KGK Diamonds, said it will get its lab-grown stones from suppliers in Europe and North America. Mined diamonds already in Pandora stores would still be sold, it said.
Opponents of mined diamonds say their extraction causes environmental damage and so-called blood diamonds help fund conflicts. A study commissioned by the natural diamond industry in 2019 said mined diamonds were less carbon-intensive.

Investing.com – U.S. stock markets opened mostly higher on Wednesday, the market turning positive after initially struggling to shake off the comments by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen that had spooked it on Tuesday.
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 28 points, or less than 0.1%, at 34,161 points, while the S&P 500 was up 0,2%. The Nasdaq Composite was outperforming with a gain of 0.7%.
The Nasdaq had had had its worst day since March after Yellen said it may be necessary to raise interest rates (at some unspecified point in time) to stop the economy overheating. She subsequently walked back her comments as “not a recommendation”. Paul Donovan, chief economist with UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a morning note that the comments were ""stating the blatantly obvious.""
Chicago Federal Reserve President Charles Evans repeated that he expects policy to stay on hold for ""some time"" yet, although his reasons were not the ones usually trotted out by senior Fed officials. 
""Our employment mandate is within sight,"" Reuters reported Evans as saying in remarks prepared for delivery to the Hyman P. Minsky Conference. But with a projected rise in inflation in coming months likely to be short-lived, ""achieving our inflation goal may prove more difficult,"" he said.
Economic data continue to paint a picture of a strengthening recovery, meanwhile. Payrolls processor ADP said an estimated 742,000 people found nonfarm jobs in the private sector in the month through April, the most since September. The figures were slightly below expectations, when adjusted for an upward revision to the previous month’s number.
The auto sector led the way in early trade, as General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Stellantis (NYSE:STLA), the holding company that incorporates Fiat Chrysler and the Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY) and Citroen brands,. both rising after reporting stronger-than-expected results for the first quarter. Both companies were able to ride a rebound in demand, while the shortage of chips that has hit production in recent months also served to keep supply tight and margins firm.
GM stock rose 3.3% in early trade, while Stellantis stock rose 5.3%. Component supplier BorgWarner (NYSE:BWA) stock also rose 3.6% on well-received results.
Among the losers were Peloton Interactive  (NASDAQ:PTON), which fell 6.8% to its lowest since September after issuing a recall for all its treadmills due to safety concerns, after initially trying to brazen out reports of injuries and a death. 
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock also inched lower by 0.3% after its oversight board upheld the social network giant's ban on Donald Trump.  Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), for whom Trump's presence on its network was proportionately more important as a driver of traffic, fell 1.3% to its lowest since February."

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Denmark's Maersk said on Wednesday it expected its ""exceptionally strong"" performance in the first quarter to continue for the rest of the year, driven by high demand for shipping containers from China to the United States.
Maersk, which handles about one in five containers shipped worldwide, said there were not enough ships available in the world to meet a surge in consumer demand, resulting in record-high freight rates.
The firm's shares traded 4% higher at 0921 GMT, near a record high reached last week.
""The situation today is that our customers are trying to meet a very, very high underlying demand, while at the same time rebuilding stock,"" Chief Executive Soren Skou told a media call.
Large retailers and producers, including Puma and Signify, have said congestion at ports, container shortages and delays at the Suez Canal were causing problems in shipping products made in Asia to key markets.
Imports into North American from Asia rose 40% in the first three months of the year. Container ships are now waiting 16 days outside the port in Los Angeles to unload, Skou said.
""This is a huge problem for our customers,"" the CEO said. ""It's a mess and it will take some time to clear.""
The company set money aside to buy more containers but had no plans to order more ships, he said.
Skou said he expected bottlenecks in the Suez Canal, where Maersk at one point had 50 container ships waiting to pass, to be cleared by next month. 
Maersk last week raised its outlook for full-year underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to $13 billion-$15 billion from $8.5 billion-$10.5 billion.
It lifted its forecast for global container demand growth to 5%-7% from 3%-5%. Container demand contracted 1.8% last year.
""We now expect the current dynamics to last into the fourth quarter,"" Skou said.
Maersk confirmed on Wednesday the 30% rise in first-quarter revenue announced in a preliminary trading statement last week and reiterated its upbeat profit outlook for 2021.

The company said EBITDA more than doubled in the period to $4.0 billion, in line with preliminary numbers.
Maersk said high free cash flow had prompted it to speed up an existing $1.6 billion share buyback programme and launch a new $5 billion share buyback programme that will conclude in 2023.

1222,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2021 08:56AM ET</span>","Hilton earnings disappoint as pandemic pains linger, shares fall","(Reuters) -Hilton Worldwide on Wednesday posted quarterly results below estimates as a rise in COVID-19 cases and tighter travel curbs in parts of Europe and Asia hurt bookings, sending shares of the U.S. hotel operator down more than 1% before the bell.
Analysts expect hotels to rebound strongly in the second half of this year but remain reserved about how quickly demand would pick up for business travel, on which major chains including Hilton and rival Marriott rely heavily.
Hilton said it suspended operations at 275 properties, mostly in the United States and Europe, during the first quarter due to the pandemic, compared with about 730 properties a year earlier.
The company said it has seen ""meaningful improvement"" in bookings in March and April as coronavirus vaccination rates rise and more people feel confident about traveling again.
Hilton's revenue per available room (RevPAR) - a key measure for a hotel's top-line performance - fell more than 38% to $46.23 in the quarter ended March 31 from a year earlier. That, however, was an improvement from $40.68 in the prior quarter. 
Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst David Katz said he expects Hilton's results to continue to improve in the United States and China through the second quarter and in Europe by the second half of the year.
""Both of these non-U.S. regions are recovering more gradually due to vaccine-related challenges,"" Katz said in a note.
While Hilton cut expenses by 54% to $853 million, it still missed Wall Street's profit expectations and posted a quarterly loss.

On an adjusted basis, Hilton gained 2 cents per share, missing analysts' average estimate for a profit of 8 cents per share, according to Refinitiv data.
Total revenue fell more than 54% to $874 million and missed estimates of $1.10 billion.

1225,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2021 08:01AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Lilly hit by staff accusations, FDA scrutiny at COVID drug factories","By Dan Levine and Marisa Taylor
(Reuters) - Eli Lilly & Co (NYSE:LLY) employees have accused a factory executive of altering documents required by government regulators in an effort to downplay serious quality control problems at the U.S. plant producing the drugmaker’s COVID-19 treatment, according to an internal Lilly complaint and a source familiar with the matter.
The unsigned report, filed April 8 in Lilly’s confidential employee complaint system and reviewed by Reuters, is the latest sign of manufacturing problems at the drug giant. The complaint asserts that the executive, a top quality official at the company’s factory in Branchburg, New Jersey, rewrote findings by Lilly technical experts at the plant, which has been under investigation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, to make the conclusions appear more favorable to the company.
The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the findings involved the production of drugs including Lilly’s COVID-19 therapy, whose use in the United States is funded by the federal government. The coronavirus antibody treatment, bamlanivimab, has been authorized by the FDA for emergency use in combination with a second Lilly drug for mild to moderate infections in people at high risk of severe illness.
Separately, FDA inspectors in March identified numerous manufacturing lapses at a second Lilly facility in Indianapolis that bottles the COVID-19 therapy and other drugs. The problems included substandard sanitation and quality control procedures, according to a preliminary FDA inspection report released to Reuters under open records laws. The Indianapolis inspection findings have not been previously reported.
The troubles at the two factories, along with a succession of internal complaints in recent years, deepen the regulatory, production and leadership issues facing Lilly, one of the largest drugmakers in the world. In addition to the FDA investigations, Lilly’s chief financial officer resigned in February over what the company called “inappropriate personal communications” with an employee. He has declined to comment in the past and could not be reached Tuesday.
As Reuters reported in March https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-elililly-special-report/special-report-insider-alleges-eli-lilly-blocked-her-efforts-to-sound-alarms-about-u-s-drug-factory-idUSKBN2B31K5, a human resources officer at the Branchburg factory said she was forced out of her job after raising concerns about quality control, record-keeping and staff shortages in the Branchburg factory. The company has denied any retaliation against employees.
Contacted by Reuters for this story, Lilly confirmed it had received the recent employee complaint about the Branchburg plant. The company said it could not comment further given that an investigation was underway by an independent third party, which it did not identify.
“Depending on the outcome of that investigation, we will take appropriate action,” said Lilly spokeswoman Kathryn Beiser. “Lilly has long-standing policies and procedures designed to enable - and encourage - individuals to come forward with information about any potential issues or concerns without fear of retribution.”
Lilly also confirmed that it had submitted a response to the FDA about its recent inspection of the Indianapolis plant. The company declined to share the document with Reuters, and said none of the issues identified by the FDA at either plant has affected the quality of products released in the marketplace.
Amid the escalating manufacturing problems, however, the Branchburg plant has not shipped new batches of the COVID-19 drug bamlanivimab in nearly two months, according to the employee complaint and the source familiar with the matter. Reuters could not independently confirm that the Branchburg plant was not releasing bamlanivimab to the Indianapolis bottling plant or other facilities. 
Lilly did not respond to questions about whether shipments have stalled at Branchburg, though the company said it expected to meet its production commitments for the COVID-19 treatment.
The Branchburg factory executive named in the complaint, Lydia Wible, did not respond to requests for comment made via email and telephone. On her behalf, Lilly said she declined to comment.
Lilly did not make Chief Executive Officer David Ricks available for comment. Reuters found no evidence he knew of the problems described in the complaint.
The new complaint about the Branchburg facility refers to “13 employees involved in this investigation.” It does not identify them, saying they fear retaliation. The source familiar with the matter said the group that submitted the complaint comprises more than 10 employees, including managers.
The source claimed that many of the staffers had seen the relevant documents both before and after they were altered.
The complaint did not specify what alterations the employees believed were made to the documents but said Wible “rewrites factual data provided by subject matter experts to formulate responses she feels are more beneficial.”
It is not clear whether any of the documents have been submitted to the FDA, although the agency routinely reviews such records.
The FDA declined to answer questions on the Lilly inspections or the employee complaint, but said ""the agency takes the safety and quality of FDA-regulated products seriously"" and noted that it imposed quality control measures when it authorized bamlanivimab.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees vaccine and therapeutics production, did not respond to requests for comment.
Nathan Cortez, a law professor who specializes in FDA regulation at Southern Methodist University in Texas, said the employee accusations regarding Branchburg and Indianapolis could amplify Lilly’s problems with regulators.
“If you have a string of manufacturing problems across multiple facilities and you're starting to develop a not-so-great manufacturing track record, the FDA will probably consider harder responses,” he said. Referring to the internal complaint, he said: “If somebody is sticking their neck out, that strikes me as a pretty big deal and evidence of some deeper problems within the company.”
DISCOMFORT AND DISMAY
The April complaint asserts that Wible, the Branchburg factory executive, altered information provided by internal technical experts, saying she is “solely responsible for providing written responses to the FDA” regarding the types of quality control problems that regulators flagged.
The complaint said that Wible - who did not respond to questions from Reuters - used “her authority to rewrite technical investigations for which she has little or no experience.”
According to the complaint, staff members who gather information for the FDA were concerned about presenting altered material to regulators. They “are uncomfortable and do not feel confident in defending the reformulated responses in the event they are called upon by the FDA,” the complaint said.
The complaint also expressed impatience with company leaders.
“How long is it going to take for the company to pay attention and do something about this?” it said, referring to the accusations against Wible. “We are all working very hard to meet the commitments to the FDA and cannot do so under these conditions.”
The complaint said Wible had, prior to recently altering the records required by the FDA, provided “fabricated” information including “fictitious numbers” to a Branchburg human resources investigator looking into potential manufacturing lapses.
Asked by Reuters about the matter, former human resources investigator Amrit Mula confirmed that she had concluded through an internal inquiry in 2018 that Wible had given her fabricated information. Mula said she was looking into unsanitary conditions in a warehouse, as well as information about the improper disposal of quality-control records for Trulicity, a blockbuster diabetes drug then made at the plant.
Reuters reported in March that Mula claimed to have identified serious violations of FDA manufacturing rules at the plant and to have been forced out of the company in early 2019. Mula has since sought compensation from Lilly, arguing the company retaliated against her for raising legitimate concerns as part of her job.
Senior executives at Lilly headquarters in Indianapolis, including Leanne Hickman, vice president of quality, knew about the alleged fabrications and retaliation and protected Wible, doing nothing to address the problems, according to the complaint.
Hickman did not respond to requests for comment conveyed by email and telephone. On her behalf, Lilly said she declined to comment.
In November 2019, roughly eight months after Mula’s departure, FDA inspectors showed up at the Branchburg plant for a routine inspection and cited some of the same problems Mula said she had repeatedly flagged to her bosses. The preliminary FDA report found that quality control data on various manufacturing processes had been deleted and not appropriately audited.
The FDA red-flagged the problems as “Official Action Indicated,” or OAI, which is its most serious category of violation. If not addressed, an OAI can lead to a prohibition on the sale of drugs from a facility, regulatory experts say. The FDA has not taken further public action.
Inspectors returned in July https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-elililly/exclusive-fda-faults-quality-control-at-lilly-plant-making-trump-touted-covid-drug-idUSKBN26Z0CH and found several more problems, including that the company failed to properly investigate quality-control problems to prevent recurrence and that batches of drugs had been discarded because of manufacturing mistakes.
In October, the Trump administration ordered $375 million worth of bamlanivimab and shortly afterward authorized its use on an emergency basis to help curb the pandemic. Bamlanivimab is combined with a second Lilly drug, called etesevimab, to treat COVID-19.
‘A LOT OF WORK TO DO’
A condition of the emergency authorization was that an outside auditor inspect batches of bamlanivimab to ensure they met FDA standards. Lilly and the FDA have not responded to questions from Reuters about whether this requirement was carried out.
Lilly said in March that its combination antibody therapy reduced the risk of hospitalization and death by 87% in a study of more than 750 high-risk COVID-19 patients.
Around he same time, the FDA inspected the Indianapolis plant, which receives the kinds of injectable drugs manufactured in New Jersey, fills them into vials and syringes, and distributes them to customers.

Preliminary FDA reports, which are partially redacted, show inspectors found that procedures to ensure certain areas remain sterile were substandard and that Lilly failed to thoroughly investigate drug batches that had failed quality control tests. In addition, when vials from outside vendors were discarded as defective, the company failed to thoroughly investigate.
“The FDA found serious concerns on multiple fronts,” said Steven Lynn, a former head of the FDA’s Office of Manufacturing and Product Quality, who reviewed the inspection report for Reuters. “Lilly has a lot of work to do.”

Automakers and parts suppliers have been getting a boost from higher vehicle sales as more people prefer personal transport due to COVID-19, but a chip shortage that has forced car companies to shut factories and book billions of dollars in losses, threatens to dent gains.
Ford, which made up about 13% of BorgWarner's 2020 sales, said last week that the chip shortage could cut the automaker's second-quarter vehicle production in half.
BorgWarner, which makes products including turbochargers, powertrain sensors and battery heaters, said it now expects full-year sales between $14.8 billion and $15.4 billion, up from $14.7 billion to $15.3 billion, previously.
The company also raised its 2021 adjusted earnings per share forecast to a range of $4 to $4.35, from a prior range of $3.85 to $4.25 per share.
BorgWarner said adjusted earnings per share rose to $1.21 in the first quarter ended March 31, from 77 cents, a year earlier, beating analysts' average estimate of 92 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Net sales rose 76% to $4.01 billion.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Wednesday, rebounding after the sharp tech-induced losses of the previous session while investors digest more corporate earnings and employment data.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 70 points, or 0.2%, S&P 500 Futures traded 14 points, or 0.3%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 85 points, or 0.6%.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed almost 2% lower Tuesday, its worst day since last March, after comments from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen about higher interest rates resulted in investors exiting the megacap technology and growth stocks in their droves.
However, the tone is more positive Wednesday with investors looking forward to more corporate earnings in what has been a generally strong first quarter, prompting many companies to raise guidance.
General Motors (NYSE:GM) is scheduled to report Wednesday, and much of the attention will be on the chip shortages that are crippling production plans at the giant carmaker and how they'll weigh on future results. Ford last week cut its full-year forecast because of its production woes. 
The likes of  Hilton Worldwide  (NYSE:HLT), Allstate (NYSE:ALL) and Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) are also due to release first-quarter data, while eyes will also be on  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) after the ride-hailing company reported another strong month of passenger numbers after the bell on Tuesday. Rival Uber (NYSE:UBER) is also due to release its figures after the bell.
Turning to economic data, ADP is expected to report 800,000 new private-sector jobs in April at 8:15 AM ET (1215 GMT), compared with the 517,000 in March, offering up evidence of a continued recovery in the labor market. It will also act as a preview of Friday's nonfarm payrolls numbers. 
The ISM’s non-manufacturing survey for April will also be published at 9:45 AM ET, where again the focus will be on the employment subindex, given the Federal Reserve’s focus on the job market. 
Oil prices surged Wednesday, with a sharp fall in U.S. crude stockpiles adding to increased optimism the reopening drives in Europe and the U.S. will boost overall fuel demand. 
U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute showed a draw of 7.69 million barrels for the week ended April 30, the largest drop since late January. Investors now await data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, due later in the day, for confirmation.

1231,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2021 06:13AM ET</span>","U.S. chip startups, long shunned in favor of internet bets, stir excitement again","By Jane Lanhee Lee
OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - Silicon Valley venture capitalists, long focused on software and internet companies, are again pouring money into the semiconductor industry, lured by the promise of a new generation of artificial-intelligence chips that could challenge incumbents like  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp.
The new wave of semiconductor innovation will do little to address the shortage of chips based on older technology that is currently plaguing the auto industry and others. The shortage stems from a confluence of factors as carmakers, which shut plants during the COVID-19 pandemic last year, compete against the sprawling consumer electronics industry for chip supplies.
The enthusiasm for chip startups is mostly a result of the need, by companies using AI software, for special-purpose processors that can efficiently run machine-learning algorithms requiring huge troves of data - the heart of the booming artificial-intelligence business.
Upstart chip-makers including SambaNova Systems, Groq, and Cerebras Systems all say they are making chips that can perform AI tasks better than processors from Nvidia, whose multipurpose graphics chip sets - originally made for video games -now dominate the AI market.
“How can a car be good at being fun to drive and good to take the kids and soccer balls to soccer practice and carry freight and bricks and garbage? The answer is it can't,” said Andrew Feldman, co-founder and CEO of Cerebras Systems, arguing that AI algorithms need specific chips rather than chips that can serve multiple purposes. 
Cerebras' innovation is a very large chip, 56 times the size of a postage stamp, that packs 2.6 trillion transistors. 
 Gartner  (NYSE:IT) analyst Alan Priestley has counted over 50 firms now developing chips specifically for AI applications, and said there may be more. He expects the market to be worth over $70 billion by 2025, up from $23 billion in 2020.

https://graphics.reuters.com/VENTURECAPITAL-SEMI/FUNDING/qmyvmldgbpr/chart.png 
Venture funding for U.S. chip startups reached $1.8 billion last year, the highest level in at least two decades, according to data firm PitchBook. Another $1.4 billion has already been invested this year. 
For a graphic on U.S. venture capital in semiconductor companies:
https://graphics.reuters.com/VENTURECAPITAL-CHIPS/FUNDING/jbyprwzadve/chart.png 
In April alone, SambaNova said it raised $676 million for its reconfigurable AI chips. Groq, which boasts of a super-powerful single-core design that is fast and easy to program, announced it had raised $300 million. The CEOs of both companies told Reuters the funding rounds were bigger than planned due to strong investor interest.
The opportunities are now piquing the interest of predominantly software-focused venture capital firms such as Battery Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, and Foundation Capital. They were among the most active semiconductor investors over the past two years, said Brendan Burke, analyst at PitchBook.
Battery Ventures' general partner, Dharmesh Thakker, said he started considering chip investments a few years ago after he noticed his AI software companies were all working with Nvidia.
""We said, 'Hey, there might be an opportunity to build another Nvidia in that whole space around AI.'"" 
Bessemer Venture Partners and Foundation Capital did not respond to requests for comment.
Ian Buck, Nvidia's general manager of accelerated computing, said he is confident the company will stay ahead in the AI chip game. Nvidia GPUs have been evolving over the past seven years to meet AI software needs, with some chips specifically designed to handle AI.
SUBSIDIES BECKON
Peter Barrett, general partner at early-stage investor Playground Global, says new materials and techniques for building chips are driving innovation in areas beyond AI. He cited chips for quantum computers, a new technology that uses subatomic particles to store and process information.
All this activity is coming as the U.S. government finalizes new subsidy programs to support the domestic chip industry. Andy Rappaport, a new board member of Groq who has invested in chips for decades, believes the geopolitical instability and competition between the United States and China could even drive venture capital firms to invest not just in chip design companies but even manufacturing. “If the federal government wants to goose my returns and underwrite my risk, then you could see a credible scenario where a new manufacturing player could emerge,” he said.
That, in turn, could trigger even more bets on chip-design firms. “If I knew manufacturing was no longer an issue, it makes it easier for me to invest in the IC companies,” said venture capitalist Hany Nada of ACME Capital, referring to integrated circuit, or chip, suppliers.
Ironically, with AI chips it is getting easier for AI algorithms to improve chip manufacturing, bring costs down, and open up manufacturing again to startups, said Matthew Putman, who started Nanotronics in 2011 to do exactly that, and had an early investment from Peter Thiel's Founders Fund. 

By 2019, Nanotronics had raised about $90 million. And Putnam is no longer worried about where funding will come from. 
“In 2013 or 2014 when I would go in and literally if you didn't have an app or any kind of enterprise SaaS software, you wouldn't even get past the receptionist,” he said, adding that was even after Founders Fund had invested. “That has changed, a lot.”

1232,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2021 06:06AM ET</span>",ARK Innovation's performance under pressure as tech stocks swoon,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) -A rotation out of growth and technology stocks and a recent slide in shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc are weighing on the performance of ARK Innovation, the flagship exchange-traded fund managed by star stock picker Cathie Wood that bested all other U.S. equity funds in 2020.
The $23.1 billion fund posted a gain of less than 1% last month, a showing nearly 3 percentage points behind the average fund in its category, according to Morningstar data. For the year to date, the fund is down 9%, a performance that puts it in the bottom 100th percentile in Morningstar's category of 543 mid-cap growth funds. The S&P 500 is up 10.9% over the same time. 
Investors pulled $645.5 million out of the fund during the week that ended April 21, a 2.6% decline that was its largest weekly outflow in percentage terms since 2018 and only the fifth weekly loss overall since 2019, according to Refinitiv Lipper. The fund brought in $37 million the following week, the smallest weekly inflow in percentage terms since January 2020.
Among the factors denting the fund is a rally in shares of financials, energy firms and other companies that stand to benefit from a powerful U.S. economic rebound that has made the growth and tech stocks that dominated last year less alluring to some investors. The Russell 1000 Value index, for example, is up nearly 15.8% for the year to date, while the Russell 1000 Growth index is up 5.5% over the same time.
Shares of Tesla, which make up 10.5% of the fund and are its biggest holding, are down 4.5% since the start of the year, contributing to the fund's slide. Virtual healthcare company Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC) Health Inc, the fund's second-largest holding, has seen its shares fall nearly 21% over the same time. 
""The market has rotated away from the fund's favored growth stocks toward more economically sensitive segments of the market,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA. ""We think if underperformance continues longer, some investors will become frustrated and seek an alternative."" 
More recently, growth and technology stocks have sold off over the last few days, a move investors have pinned on everything from profit-taking to worries that the U.S. economic rebound will peak in coming months.
Managing investor expectations after last year's eye-popping performance will be a test for fund manager Wood, who is widely seen as one of the most bullish investors on Wall Street in companies such as Tesla and the cryptocurrency bitcoin. She became a favorite of retail investors as technology and growth stocks surged during the pandemic last year. 
ARK did not respond to a request to comment for this story. 
The fund gained 152.8% in 2020, the best performance among any actively managed U.S. equity fund tracked by Morningstar. 
Of the fund's 10-largest holdings, only one - payment company  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ) - is up for the year to date. 
""We are in a scenario now that is quite different than it was the year before, and as we see the reopening increase and the pandemic eases, the performance of growth names is going to be more dictated by the Fed"" and its interest rate policies than by the economic recovery, said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU). 
The slowing performance of the fund could also focus more investor attention on its strategy of taking large bets on a handful of companies, a style that may make it ""ill-prepared to grapple with a major plot twist,"" noted Robby Greengold, a strategist on Morningstar's U.S. equities team. 

Overall, funds such as ARK Innovation that outperformed in one year do not tend to outperform in the following year, according to a 2020 study led by James Choi, a professor at the Yale School of Management. 
""The disappearance of significant performance persistence is due to lower returns to favorable styles, as well as less favorable style tilts and increased style-adjusted underperformance by past winning funds,"" the study noted https://www.nber.org/papers/w26707.

1233,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2021 05:15AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Facing chips shortage, Biden may shelve blunt tool used in COVID fight","By Andrea Shalal, Trevor Hunnicutt and David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Some critical industries could suffer if the U.S. government uses a national security law to redirect scarce computer chips to the auto industry, a senior administration official told Reuters.
The analysis suggests the White House could opt to reject calls to invoke the Defense Production Act by automakers and a bipartisan set https://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/2/rubio-coons-urge-biden-to-invoke-defense-production-act-to-address-semiconductor-shortage of U.S. lawmakers. 
Numerous automakers have been forced to slow or pause production due to a lack of semiconductors and have spoken with the White House about possibly using the 1950 law that allows the government to force companies to produce materials for national security reasons. 
Still, many auto industry officials said privately they do not think invoking the act would be feasible or likely.
Asked whether using the law was a possibility, the administration official said ""the short-term outlook is challenging.""
Reallocating semiconductors to automakers ""would result in fewer chips for others,"" the official, who is involved in high-level discussions on the issue, told Reuters. Such a move could hurt makers of consumer electronics such as laptops and medical devices like pacemakers, the official added.
""This is the worst nightmare if you're a supply chain manager,"" said another person familiar with the White House's thinking. ""As a nation, it's terrible.""
No final decisions have been made, people familiar with the matter said.
The official said the administration is pushing chips users and producers to increase transparency by improving the capacity to forecast demand and generating better information on how chips are moving through supply chains to end users. 
The administration plans to issue recommendations once it completes a 100-day review required under a February executive order by Biden, including ways to ""incentivize and encourage production at home and surge capacity,"" the official said.
The review is looking at supply chains for semiconductors, high capacity batteries, critical minerals and pharmaceuticals and active pharmaceutical ingredients.
Biden used the Korean War-era law to boost vaccines and critical medical equipment supplies to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. The chips issue threatens the U.S. economy and imperils jobs in election battlegrounds from Texas to Michigan.
Last week, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co warned the chip shortage will slash second-quarter production by 50%. Biden has asked Congress for $50 billion to bolster the domestic chips industry and $50 billion to create a new Commerce Department office to monitor domestic industrial capacity.
U.S. Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, who had urged use of the Defense act, said he was ""pleased"" with the administration's actions so far.
Washington has been appealing to Taiwan and other foreign governments to boost chip production levels for U.S. buyers, said the official. The administration is considering regulatory options and possible multilateral agreements to avert future crises, the person said.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) is looking to build more U.S. chipmaking factories in Arizona beyond one already planned, Reuters reported.

Industry data show U.S. manufacturers only account for about 12% of worldwide semiconductor manufacturing capacity, down from 37% in 1990. More than 80% of chip production happens in Asia.
""There's no quick fix,"" said Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

1234,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2021 04:45AM ET</span>",Novo Nordisk lifts guidance after first quarter beats expectations,"By Nikolaj Skydsgaard
COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Denmark's Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) raised its sales and profit forecasts on Wednesday after beating first-quarter earnings expectations, lifting shares in the world's biggest maker of diabetes drugs.
Sales were still hit by the effect of patients and wholesalers stocking up on drugs last year in preparation for the COVID-19 pandemic, Novo said, but inventory changes and the timing of shipments had offset that in the first quarter. 
""We are very encouraged with the sales growth in the first three months of 2021,"" Chief Executive Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen said. 
Novo Nordisk now expects sales growth in local currencies this year to come in at between 6% and 10%, up from a previous forecast of 5% to 9%, and operating profit growth in local currencies in the range of 5% to 9%, up from an earlier estimate of 4% to 8%.
Shares in Novo Nordisk traded up 1.82% at 0753 GMT. 
Sales in local currencies rose 7% in the first quarter to 33.8 billion Danish crowns ($5.46 billion), above a forecast of 32.5 billion in a Refinitiv poll, while operating profit came in at 14.98 billion Danish crowns, beating analysts' expectations for 14.6 billion.
""It's a strong start to the year,"" Sydbank analyst Soren Lontoft Hansen told Reuters. 
By volume Novo Nordisk is the world's biggest insulin provider, but an increasingly competitive global insulin market means it aims to sell more of its newer drugs, many of which are used to treat type 2 diabetes. 
Revenues were driven by a 13% rise in sales of its GLP-1 products, which imitate an intestinal hormone that stimulates insulin production, offsetting a 7% overall drop in insulin sales. 
Sales of its recently launched once-daily diabetes pill Rybelsus grew 247% to 729 million crowns, which Hansen said lagged expectations as the pandemic had made it difficult for Novo to promote the drug to physicians. 

""As the U.S. is gradually coming out of a lockdown... we are very optimistic that we'll stay on a very positive trajectory for Rybelsus,"" Chief Executive Jorgensen told a media briefing.

The company known for its smart men's suits saw first-quarter sales almost double in mainland China and it expects that momentum to continue unchanged despite the boycott calls, acting Chief Executive Yves Mueller told journalists.
At least three Chinese celebrities said in March they were dropping Hugo Boss, and some internet users vowed to boycott the brand for good after it made contradictory comments over its purchase of goods and cotton from the Xinjiang region.
Compared with the first quarter of 2019, a year before the coronavirus pandemic hit the region, currency-adjusted sales rose by 29% in mainland China in the first quarter and Mueller said this trend continued at the start of the second quarter.
German sportswear company Puma said last month it expected a hit to sales from the China consumer backlash.
Overall, group sales fell 10% to 497 million euros ($597 million), while Hugo Boss just managed to turn an operating profit of 1 million euros. The average of forecasts by analysts were for 442 million euros in sales and a 28 million euro loss.
Hugo Boss shares were up 4.2% at 0742 GMT.
Mueller declined to comment on reports last month of possible interest in the company, including from French luxury group LVMH, which had boosted the stock.
The company said it was confident sales in the second quarter would almost double, and it hoped to generate a positive operating profit in the period. But it said it could not give a precise outlook.
Mueller, who will hand over to former Tommy Hilfiger boss Daniel Grieder next month, said about 20% of its sales space was still closed at the start of the second quarter, but he was optimistic for a rebound in demand as lockdowns ease.

""The desire to consume is coming back,"" he said, adding that he saw pent-up demand for smart clothes as people start meeting friends again and planning weddings and parties.

 Hugo Boss  (DE:BOSSn) stock rose 3%, to a new 52-week high, after the German fashion house saw first-quarter sales almost double in mainland China, and predicted a rebound in the rest of the business in the course of the year.
Deutsche Post (OTC:DPSGY) stock rose 0.6% after the German raised its full-year profit forecast Wednesday after more than tripling its operating earnings in the first quarter, while Veolia (PA:VIE) stock rose 1% after the French utility posted higher first quarter earnings on Wednesday and kept its 2021 financial outlook.
AP Moeller-Maersk (CSE:MAERSKb) stock rose 3% after the Danish shipping giant launched a new $5 billion share buyback program as rising demand and freight rates boosted earnings.
Additionally, the big miners, including Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO), BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) and  Anglo American  (LON:AAL), all rose about 2% as copper prices rose past a key psychological level of $10,000 a ton.
Oil prices surged Wednesday, with a sharp fall in U.S. crude stockpiles adding to increased optimism the reopening drives in Europe and the U.S. will boost overall fuel demand. 
U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute showed a draw of 7.69 million barrels for the week ended April 30, the largest drop since late January. Investors now await data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, due later in the day, for confirmation.

Canada has reported at least five cases of blood clots following immunization with the vaccine, but public health officials maintain the benefits of the AstraZeneca shot outweigh the potential risks.
The Alberta case, of a woman in her 50s, marks the second case of blood clots, and the only death after more than 253,000 doses of AstraZeneca were administered in the province, Alberta's chief medical officer of health Dr. Deena Hinshaw said in a statement on Tuesday.
""While any death is tragic, it is important to remember that the risks of dying or suffering other severe outcomes from COVID-19 remain far greater than the risk following AstraZeneca vaccine,"" Hinshaw said.
AstraZeneca did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for a comment.
Canada has had 1,243,242 confirmed coronavirus cases and 24,342 deaths, according to a Reuters tally
Last month, the province of Quebec reported Canada's first death of a patient after receiving the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine.
AstraZeneca, working with the vaccine's inventor Oxford University, was one of the leaders in the global race to develop a COVID-19 vaccine. Its cheap and easily transportable shot was hailed as a milestone in the fight against the crisis, but has since faced a series of setbacks. 

The rare complication, which some regulators including Health Canada are calling Vaccine-Induced Prothrombotic Immune Thrombocytopenia, involves blood clots accompanied by a low count of platelets, cells in the blood that help it to clot. 
Dozens of countries paused the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine in March after reports of rare, but serious, blood clots. Several of them have now resumed use either fully or with restricions after health regulators said the benefits of the shot outweigh any risks.

The inflows, however, were modest as investors maintained a cautious stance amid risks thrown up by the coronavirus pandemic.
Foreigners were net buyers of a combined total of $367 million in South Korean, Taiwanese, Philippine, Thai, Vietnamese, Indonesian and Indian stocks last month, data from stock exchanges showed. That compares with an average monthly inflow of $3.7 billion in the second half of last year.

South Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia, and Vietnam showed a rise in their manufacturing activity in April, helped by a surge in overseas demand for their goods, with developed economies making a fast recovery from the pandemic fallout.
Taiwanese equities led the region, with inflows worth $1.9 billion in April, with the economy posting its highest quarterly growth in more than a decade as demand for its tech exports surged.
""Taiwan's inflows can be attributed to several factors, including a weakening U.S. dollar, strong export orders and industrial production growth,"" Margaret Yang, strategist at DailyFX said. 
Indonesia and South Korea received inflows last month worth $90 million and $65 million, respectively.
However, Indian equities faced outflows worth $1.3 billion, with the country facing the world's biggest surge in coronavirus cases. 
India's daily cases rose by a record high of 382,315 and its death toll also touched a high of 3,780 on Wednesday, raising more pressure on its government to impose a national lockdown. 

Meanwhile, foreigners also sold Philippine shares for the 18th consecutive month in April, as a two-week lockdown in Manila and some other provinces hit its economic activity.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's corporate watchdog accused  Westpac Banking  (NYSE:WBK) Corp of insider trading while financing a A$16 billion ($12 billion) energy grid privatisation in 2016, the latest in a series of regulatory problems for the country's No. 2 lender.
The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) said Westpac knew it had won the contract to help two pension funds buy Ausgrid, a state-owned power supplier to millions of people around Sydney, for two hours while it bought A$12 billion of derivative products to support the deal.
""The Ausgrid information was not generally available and it was information which, if generally available, a reasonable person would expect to have a material effect on the price or value of the traded products,"" ASIC said in a civil lawsuit filed on Wednesday. 
The lawsuit casts a fresh cloud over Westpac one day after it posted a tripling of first-half profit largely due to penalties it paid in the prior period to settle an unrelated regulator lawsuit accusing it of enabling millions of offshore payments, including to purveyors of child exploitation material.
It also underscores the increased determination of Australia's financial regulators to take on big cases after they were accused in a 2018 public inquiry of being too cosy with the sector. 
""With everything Westpac's been through in the last few years, and they've increased regulatory compliance spend enormously, there's a lower probability that they're going to occur in the future,"" said Morningstar banking analyst Nathan Zaia.
""If ASIC wins the case they'll face a penalty. How large that will be will be anyone's guess.""
Seven Westpac employees and former employees were named in the ASIC lawsuit but do not face prison time since it is a civil case only.
A Westpac spokesman declined to comment beyond a company statement which said the bank was considering its position and took the allegations ""very seriously"".
Westpac shares initially traded higher on Wednesday as analysts upgraded their forecasts following its result the previous day, but the stock gave up most of its gains to be flat by mid-afternoon, just behind the broader market.
The two pension funds which Westpac helped buy Ausgrid for a total A$16 billion, AustralianSuper and IFM, declined to comment.
A representative of New South Wales state premier Gladys Berejiklian, who was state treasurer at the time of the privatisation deal in 2016, also declined to comment.

In a previous ASIC action, a court ordered Westpac to pay A$3.3 million in 2018 for its involvement in fraudulent setting of interbank lending rates in 2010.

1245,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2021 12:35AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Boeing faces new hurdle in 737 MAX electrical grounding issue - sources,"By Eric M. Johnson, David Shepardson and Tracy Rucinski
SEATTLE/WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. air safety officials have asked Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co to supply fresh analysis and documentation showing numerous 737 MAX subsystems would not be affected by electrical grounding issues first flagged in three areas of the jet in April, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
The extra analysis injects new uncertainty over the timing of when Boeing's best-selling jetliner would be cleared to fly by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
The electrical problems have suspended nearly a quarter of its 737 MAX fleet.
U.S. airlines have said they expected Boeing to release the service bulletins as soon as this week that would allow them to make fixes and soon return the planes to service, but this latest issue will likely push that timelime back.
“We continue to work closely with the FAA and our customers to address the ground path issue in affected 737s,” a Boeing spokeswoman said.
Asked about the status of the planes, a FAA spokesman said ""we are continuing to work with Boeing.""
Airlines pulled dozens of 737 MAX jets from service early last month after Boeing warned of a production-related electrical grounding problem in a backup power control unit situated in the cockpit on some recently built airplanes.
The problem, which also halted delivery of new planes, was then found in two other places on the flight deck, including the storage rack where the affected control unit is kept and the instrument panel facing the pilots.
The glitch is the latest issue to beset the 737 MAX, which was grounded for nearly two years starting in 2019 after two fatal crashes. 
The slog of questions over a relatively straightforward electrical issue illustrates the tougher regulatory posture facing America's largest exporter as it tries to emerge from the 737 MAX crisis and the overlapping coronavirus pandemic.
Late last week, Boeing submitted service bulletins advising airlines on how to fix the problems with grounding, or the electrical paths designed to maintain safety in the event of a surge of voltage, the two people said.
The FAA has approved the service bulletins but then, in ongoing discussions with Boeing, asked for additional analysis over whether other jet subsystems would be affected by the grounding issue, one of the sources said. The FAA will review Boeing's analysis and any necessary revisions to the service bulletins before they can be sent to airlines.
Boeing has proposed adding a bonding strap or cable that workers screw onto two different surfaces creating a grounding path, two people said.
Boeing had initially told airlines a fix could take hours or a few days per jet.

The electrical grounding issue emerged after Boeing changed a manufacturing method as it worked to speed up production of the jetliner, a third person said. A fourth person said the change improved a hole-drilling process.
The FAA issued a new airworthiness directive last week requiring a fix before the jets resume flight, saying the issue impacts 109 in-service planes worldwide. Sources said it impacts more than 300 planes in Boeing's inventory.

1246,By Investing.com,"<span>May 04, 2021 11:31PM ET</span>","Asian Stocks Mixed, Investors Digest Yellen Interest Rate Comments","By Gina Lee
Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mixed Wednesday morning, with closures in major markets softening the impact of comments from U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen regarding interest rates that jolted markets.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was up by 11:24 PM ET (3:24 AM GMT) while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index inched down.
Japanese, Chinese and Korean markets are closed for a holiday. Treasury futures were steady with cash markets closed in the region.
Yellen gave investors a scare when she said on Tuesday, ""It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure our economy doesn’t overheat."" She then clarified later that day her comments were not a prediction of an imminent rate hike from the U.S. Federal Reserve.
Stock valuations hovering near their highest levels in two decades sparked a debate on whether government spending could trigger excessive inflation.
Some investors downplayed the impact of Yellen’s comments on the Fed’s next move.
“Yellen’s comments did not specify a timeframe for rises and she clarified her comments by saying that she was not recommending Fed rate hikes... we still expect the Fed will be very patient as economic data improves,” Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) currency strategist Kim Mundy told Bloomberg.
However, others were more cautious.
""Moderate inflation and a slow-moving Fed would continue to be supportive, but inflation and a reactive Fed may prove to be a negative for valuations... either way yields and equities are likely to be in a dance as much better than expected economic data continues to challenge central banks' rates guidance,"" NAB director of economic Tapas Strickland told Bloomberg.
Investors are also monitoring upcoming economic data from the U.S. after the latest Institute of Supply Management (ISM) Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) and a trade balance where the deficit widened to a record $74.4 billion in March.
The data includes the ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI and ADP National Employment Report, both due later in the day. April’s employment report, including non-farm payrolls, is due on Friday.
Employment will be an area of focus after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell argued earlier in the week that the labor market is still far short of where it needs to be to start talking of tapering asset buying. Minneapolis Fed Bank President Neel Kashkari, a notable dove, added on Tuesday that it may take a few years for the economy to get back to full employment.
Meanwhile, comments from other senior Fed officials, including Chicago Fed President Charles Evans and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, are also forthcoming. However, the question of whether U.S. President Joe Biden will nominate Powell for a second four-year term remains.

(Reuters) -Honest Company Inc, the consumer goods company founded by actress Jessica Alba, said it priced its initial public offering (IPO) on Tuesday slightly above the midpoint of its indicated range, raising $412.8 million. 
The company said late Tuesday that it sold 25.8 million shares at $16 each. Honest had previously indicated shares could be sold in the IPO at $14-$17 apiece. 
The IPO values Honest at $1.44 billion.
Honest, which counts the likes of Lightspeed, Fidelity and General Catalyst among its backers, sells products including diapers, nursing pillows, vitamins and non-toxic household products. These are sold on Honest.com and through partnerships with brick-and-mortar stores including Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and  Target  (NYSE:TGT).
Alba, known for her roles in film ""Fantastic Four"" and TV series ""Dark Angel"", in 2011 co-founded Honest, which touts its baby products as a safer alternative to those that use synthetic chemicals, and remains a shareholder. 
But the company came under scrutiny in 2016, when a lawsuit said its products contained a harsh chemical it had pledged to avoid.
Honest then reached a $7.35 million settlement for wrongly labeling ingredients in some products as natural, plant-based or chemical free.
The Los Angeles-based company plans to list its shares on the Nasdaq under the symbol ""HNST"" on Wednesday.

Honest is offering 6.5 million shares of common stock. Stockholders named in the prospectus are offering 19.4 million shares of common stock.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) and J.P. Morgan are among the lead underwriters for the offering.

1249,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2021 09:29PM ET</span>","Big three drug distributors blame doctors, regulators in trial over opioid epidemic","By Brendan Pierson
(Reuters) - The three largest U.S. drug distributors, facing their first trial over claims that they fueled the opioid crisis, said responsibility for ballooning painkiller sales lies with doctors, drugmakers and regulators.
AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp, McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK) and  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH) are defending themselves against a lawsuit brought by the city of Huntington and Cabell County in West Virginia.
""We intend to prove the simple truth that the distributor defendants sold a mountain of opioid pills into our community, fueling the opioid epidemic,"" Paul Farrell, a lawyer for Cabell County, said in his opening statement in Charleston, West Virginia federal court.
Huntington and Cabell are seeking money to address the toll the opioid crisis has wreaked on their communities - estimated by one of their expert witnesses at $2.6 billion.
The distributors say that they are middlemen who should not be held responsible for an epidemic that has killed nearly 500,000 people in the United States.
The amount of opioids sold in West Virginia and elsewhere is determined by doctors who prescribe the painkillers and by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, which sets quotas for their production, the companies contend.
""We are a mirror on what happens in healthcare,"" Enu Mainigi, a lawyer for Cardinal, said Monday. ""We reflect it, we don't drive it.""
Opioids resulted in the overdose deaths of nearly 500,000 people in the United States from 1999 to 2019, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. West Virginia is among the hardest hit states, recording more opioid prescriptions and overdose deaths per capita than any other in 2018, according to data from the National Institutes of Health. 
Mainigi said a surge in opioid prescriptions in the 2000s was driven by a change in medical care, as doctors were encouraged to treat pain more aggressively.
A verdict in the non-jury trial before U.S. District Judge David Faber could help lay the groundwork for settlements in the sprawling nationwide litigation over the opioid crisis, which encompasses more than 3,300 lawsuits by local governments around the country against opioid manufacturers, distributors and pharmacies.
Farrell said on Monday that the trial, expected to last 12 weeks, would show the distributors ignored numerous ""black flags"" that their drugs were being diverted into illegal channels.
The defendants have denied such allegations.
""We always reported suspicious orders,"" said Robert Nicholas, a lawyer for AmerisourceBergen.
The distributors' lawyers also said most opioid deaths stem from illegal drugs like heroin, and that there was no evidence prescription pills were a ""gateway"" to those drugs. 

Huntington and Cabell County previously opted out of a proposed $26 billion nationwide settlement with the three distributors and drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).
Another opioid trial is underway in a case brought by California counties against J&J and other drugmakers, and a trial in a case brought by New York counties is scheduled to begin next month.

The company said the eurodollar options pit, which was reopened last August, will remain open, allowing the trade of contracts in both open outcry and electronic venues. However, grain trading pits will remain closed. 
Open outcry traders use hand signals and shouting to communicate bids and offers in trading pits that until recent years were packed with brokers wearing bright-colored jackets.
Chicago-based CME shuttered its trading floor in the city a year ago as part of efforts to reduce large gatherings that can contribute to the spread of the coronavirus.
The exchange operator had already closed most of its futures pits in 2015 as trading volumes shifted to electronic platforms, although more than 20 products including eurodollar, as well as grain, livestock, dairy and lumber options, were still traded in pits.

Open-outcry trading is an increasingly rare tradition in global markets. The 144-year-old London Metal Exchange said last month that it plans to announce around June 8 whether it will reopen its open outcry trading ring or permanently shut the only such floor in Europe.
The New York Stock Exchange partially reopened its trading floor in May 2020.

(Reuters) -Pfizer Inc on Tuesday raised its forecast for 2021 COVID-19 vaccine sales by more than 70% to $26 billion and said demand from governments around the world fighting to halt the pandemic could contribute to its growth for years to come.
The company said it expects to file for full U.S. approval of the vaccine in May for people over the age of 16, as it is now only authorized for emergency use. It also expects to hear soon from U.S. regulators on expansion of the vaccine's emergency use authorization (EUA) for children ages 12-15. 
Revenue from the vaccine - developed with German partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) - is expected to account for more than one third of  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s sales this year.
The forecast is based on contracts to deliver 1.6 billion vaccine doses this year. The company expects to sign more deals for this year and is in supply talks with several countries for 2022 and beyond.
""Based on what we've seen, we believe that a durable demand for our COVID-19 vaccine – similar to that of the flu vaccines – is a likely outcome,"" Chief Executive Albert Bourla said. 
The two-shot vaccine was Pfizer's top-selling product in the first quarter. Expenses and profit from the vaccine are split 50-50 between Pfizer and BioNTech.
Given persistent infections globally and ongoing discussions with governments, Mizuho analyst Vamil Divan said the 2021 forecast could increase further and spill over to future years.
Daily vaccination rates for adults in the United States are off more than 25% since hitting a peak in mid-April. Authorization in children would expand the vaccine-eligible population by millions of people.
Pfizer said it expects to have safety and efficacy data for children ages 2-to-11 in September, when it plans to ask for further expansion of the EUA for that age group. 
The company has also filed new data with U.S. regulators that would allow the vaccine to be stored at standard refrigerator temperatures for up to four weeks, up from five days currently.
Pfizer and BioNTech aim to produce up to 2.5 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses this year, 900 million of which are not yet included in the New York-based drugmaker's sales forecast. 
If Pfizer sells that number of doses at similar prices, the vaccine's sales in 2021 could be more than 50% above the projected $26 billion.
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc has forecast $18.4 billion in 2021 sales of its similar COVID-19 vaccine.
Pfizer expects to profit from the vaccine, while some drugmakers including Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) have said their vaccine will be sold on a not-for-profit basis until the end of the pandemic.
Pfizer aims to manufacture at least 3 billion doses of the vaccine next year. It also expects to have safety and immunogenicity data from a third booster dose of the vaccine in July.
Pfizer and BioNTech have published data showing impressive durability for their vaccine at least six months after vaccination. Still, Bourla said he believes regular boosters will be needed to maintain high levels of immunity, and governments around the world have started signing deals for the shots.
The COVID-19 vaccine generated $3.5 billion in revenue in the first quarter, exceeding analysts' estimates of $3.28 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
Total revenue for the quarter of $14.6 billion, topped analysts' forecasts of $13.5 billion.

It plans to boost R&D spending to fuel drug discovery using the messenger RNA technology in the COVID-19 vaccine. The company is developing two flu vaccines that are expected to enter clinical trials in the third quarter.
Pfizer shares were down slightly in afternoon trading.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average pared its earlier losses and closed slightly higher, rising 19.8 points, or 0.06%, to 34,133.03.
Comments by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on the potential need for interest rate hikes further exacerbated the tech sell-off, as investors worry higher rates would weigh on valuations of growth companies. 
""It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn't overheat, even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy,"" she said in taped comments at a virtual event by The Atlantic.
""Wall Street won’t find out if the Fed is making a policy mistake until several months down the road and that is making some traders nervous,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda wrote in a note, adding investors look for clarity on economic recovery from Friday’s nonfarm payroll report.
Fiscal stimulus, rapid vaccinations and the Federal Reserve's accommodative stance have spurred a strong rebound in the U.S. economy and pushed Wall Street to record highs this year. The so-called ""pandemic winners,"" however, have recently started to fall out of favor.
Among individual stocks, CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) gained 4.4%after reporting a first-quarter profit above analysts' estimates and raising its 2021 forecast. 
 Gartner  (NYSE:IT) was the largest percentage gainer on the S&P 500, jumping 14.2% after better-than-expected first-quarter earnings. 
In extended trade, T-Mobile rose 2.8% after the telecom firm raised its full-year postpaid subscriber net addition forecast. 
Results in this earnings season so far have been largely upbeat. Average profits at S&P 500 companies are expected to have risen 47.7% in the quarter, compared with forecasts of a 24% growth at the start of April, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.47-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.60-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

""When more people participate in our democratic process, we will all prosper,"" the group wrote in a letter released on Tuesday.
State legislators are considering two Republican-backed bills, one from the House and one from the Senate, that would limit early voting, change polling locations, restrict how voters can apply for mail-in ballots and give partisan poll watchers more power.
The House will bring its proposal to the floor on Thursday for a possible vote, according to a legislative schedule posted online on Tuesday. If the legislation is approved, a committee of lawmakers from the House and Senate would then work to reconcile differences between the bills.
Republicans have also introduced or passed voting limits in Georgia, Arizona and Florida, citing unsubstantiated claims by former President Donald Trump that the November election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden was stolen. Democrats have condemned the restrictions as an attack on democracy.
Top U.S. companies decried Georgia's law, and Major League Baseball moved its All-Star game out of the state in protest.

So, let’s take a closer look.The resumption of industrial operations in the second half of 2020 marked the onset of an increase in demand for basic materials. With commodity prices rising substantially, investors are engaging in indirect commodity trades to profit from the flourishing markets. This is evidenced by ProShares Ultra Basic Materials ETF’s (UYM) 170.5% returns over the past year compared to S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 47.9% gains over the period.
With the reopening of manufacturing and industrial operations, the demand for basic materials is expected to continue rising in the near term. Also, the White House’s proposed American infrastructure plan is likely to raise commodity prices further, owing to global supply constraints. In addition to these positives, because many basic materials companies pay substantial dividends, this industry offers solid investment opportunities amid troublesome market volatility and fluctuating Treasury yields.
We think high-yield basic materials stocks Rio Tinto Group (RIO), Fortescue Metals Group Limited (OTC:FSUGY), and Sibanye-Stillwater Ltd. (SBSW) are ideal investment bets now.

Then Avoid These 5 Stocks","In response to the hype surrounding popular cryptocurrencies, especially bitcoin, Berkshire’s vice chairman Charlie Munger calls bitcoin “disgusting and contrary to the interests of civilization.” Irrespective of one’s agreement or disagreement with this view, we think it could be wise to avoid fundamentally weak cryptocurrency stocks Coinbase (COIN), Marathon (MARA), Riot (RIOT), Silvergate (SI), and BitDigital (BTBT). Please read on.Cryptocurrencies have taken the world by storm over the past few years. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, hit an all-time high of nearly $64,800 on April 14. However, it plunged below $50,000 later in the month following speculation that the United States Treasury may crackdown on money laundering executed through digital currencies.
So, it doesn’t come as a surprise that Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc.’s (BRK.A) vice chairman Charlie Munger, who has long criticized bitcoin for its extreme volatility and lack of regulation, called it “disgusting and contrary to the interests of civilization” at BRK.A’s annual shareholder meeting on May 1. Also, on April 30, Turkey’s central bank banned the use of cryptocurrencies as a form of payment, and India is expected to propose a law to ban cryptocurrencies and impose a fine for anyone trading or holding it.
Irrespective of one’s view on the prospects of cryptocurrencies, we think investors should stay away from fundamentally weak cryptocurrency stocks Coinbase Global, Inc.

The lessons apply to investors in stocks like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), NIO (NIO), Fisker (FSR), and Xpeng (XPEV).Every bull market has different themes in regards to technology, demographics, geopolitical considerations, and government policy. However, they do tend to follow the same emotional trajectory - from fear to greed. In a way, it’s similar to how every hit song is unique but follows the same general structure in terms of its progressions, chorus, and themes.
Bull markets also tend to focus on certain industries that consist of stocks with huge valuations based on projections about future performance and market size. Currently, electric vehicles (EVs) are one such example. Despite the KraneShares Electric Vehicle and Mobility ETF (KARS) being down 20% over the past 2 and a half months, it’s up 150% since the March 2020 lows. 
Given the industry’s high valuations, it’s not surprising that value investors, like Warren Buffett, aren’t currently interested in investing in EV stocks. Although Buffett hasn’t commented too much on EVs, he did extensively discuss the massive risks of the dot-com bubble in Berkshire Hathaway’s (BRK.B) annual shareholder meeting last weekend. And, there are many similarities between the late 1990’s and now. Thus, I believe investors in stocks like Tesla (TSLA), NIO (NIO), Fisker (FSR), and Xpeng (XPEV) should consider Buffett’s previous insight on the subject.

Milk and meat alternatives made from plants are popular with health- and environment-conscious consumers and are also gaining investor attention, as demonstrated by oat milk company Oatly's recent plans for an initial public offering.
Nestle's new product will be launched in three versions - original, unsweetened and chocolate - in France, the Netherlands and Portugal in the coming weeks, with a rollout in other European markets planned, the Swiss company said.
It said the product is carbon neutral, high in calcium, proteins and fiber, and suitable for drinking hot or cold, frothing or as an ingredient for cooking or baking. It was created in just six months, reflecting Nestle's ambition to speed up innovation to keep pace with new consumer trends. 
""We created a new brand for this proposition so we need to have high expectations,"" Cedric Boehm, head of Nestle's dairy business in Europe and the Middle East, told reporters on a call, without giving further details. 
It will be priced ""at the heart of the market"", he said.

1261,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2021 07:12PM ET</span>",GE shareholders reject CEO Culp's $230 million pay in rare rebuke,"By Jessica DiNapoli and Rajesh Kumar Singh
NEW YORK/CHICAGO (Reuters) -General Electric Co shareholders rejected top executives' compensation packages, including a payout of as much as $230 million to CEO Larry Culp, at the industrial conglomerate's annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday.
While the shareholder vote was non-binding, the move was a rare rebuke of a major corporation's handling of its executive pay.
It comes after GE laid off 20,000 workers last year. It is set to embolden corporate governance reform advocates who have criticized the shielding of CEOs from the financial fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic and the cost cuts companies often choose to implement. 
As part of an extension of Culp's employment contract to 2024, GE last August canceled old shares given to him and granted him new shares tied to lower financial targets.
Proxy advisory firms, Institutional Shareholder Services Inc (ISS) and Glass Lewis, opposed the pay packages, arguing that lowering the bar on the performance targets was unjustified and the stock award too generous. GE countered that the uncertainty of the pandemic made it difficult to incentivize Culp without lowering his performance targets, and that an extension of his contract with a new stock award was needed because the company's turnaround would take longer than expected.
Some 57.7% of GE shareholders rejected the executive pay packages, according to preliminary results.
GE said in a statement that it will gather feedback from investors and will evaluate its executive compensation program moving forward. Its shares, which have gained about 140% since last May, closed down about 2.5% at $13.12.
Culp, the first company outsider to lead GE, did not comment on the vote outcome.
IUE-CWA, the industrial division of the Communication Workers of America that represents GE's workers, cheered the thumbs-down from shareholders. Ahead of the vote, the union members staged a protest outside the company's headquarters in Boston.
""We need GE to invest in America, not just one top executive,"" said Carl Kennebrew, national president of IUE-CWA. ""We are glad that shareholders are starting to see it the same way."" 
START OF A TREND?
Last week, AT&T (NYSE:T) shareholders voted against a measure to approve executive compensation.
At least four other S&P 500 companies who have disclosed shareholder vote tallies with regulators have been defeated over executive pay so far this year through the end of April; International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) Corp,  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX), Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) Inc and TransDigm Group Inc, according to compensation consultant Farient Advisors LLC, which looked at companies that have reported this year and last. Only one company, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc, had its executive pay rejected by shareholders at this point in 2020, according to Farient.
GE said in its statement that its board remained confident in Culp and his team. The company, however, did not say whether it would change the executive compensation as a result of the vote.
Losing the shareholder vote can put pressure on corporate boards and executives to negotiate new pay deals. Two years ago, Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co renegotiated the compensation of its chief executive at the time, Bob Iger, to toughen his performance targets after shareholders voted down his pay. 
GE has had to grapple with crushing debt levels and operating challenges, particularly in its power business.
Culp said at the shareholder meeting that the company currently has no plans to increase its dividend or bump up payments to retirees as it is ""focused on a multi-year transformation, the deleveraging and delivering profitable growth over time.""
Since taking the reins in 2018, Culp has sold assets to repair GE's balance sheet, including a $30 billion deal to merge the company's jet-leasing unit with Ireland's AerCap.

The industrial conglomerate now expects to reduce overall debt by $95 billion by 2023.
He has also been implementing lean-manufacturing practices aimed at eliminating waste and building profit margins.

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Tuesday pressed the chief executive of ""Fortnite"" creator Epic Games on how the fundamental changes the game maker is asking her to force on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s App Store would affect the livelihoods of millions of developers who make software for Apple devices.
Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers (NYSE:ROG) is presiding over a three-week trial that kicked off Monday in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. 
Epic has alleged that Apple has abused the power it holds over the software developers who want to reach its 1 billion iPhone users by charging commissions of up to 30% on in-app purchases and conducting App Store reviews that Epic alleges hold back companies Apple views as competitors.
Epic Games Chief Executive Tim Sweeney on Monday testified that ""Apple exercises total control over all software on iOS"" and can deny access to apps at will.
Epic wants Gonzalez Rogers to order Apple to allow users to put third-party software onto their iPhones and ease its in-app payment rules. Those changes would apply to all kinds of apps, not just games like Epic's ""Fortnite."" 
After Epic's Sweeney had been further questioned by attorneys for both Epic and Apple on Tuesday, the judge asked Sweeney whether he was familiar with the economics of running other apps, such as food apps, dating apps or instant messaging apps. Sweeney said he was not. 
“So you don’t have any idea how what you are asking for would impact any of the developers who engage in those other categories of apps, is that right?” Gonzalez Rogers asked.
""I personally do not,"" Sweeney said.
At another point, Sweeney said users faced ""friction"" in making purchases in the ""Fortnite"" game outside of native applications.
Gonzalez Rogers asked Sweeney whether the company's desire to be free of Apple's in-app purchase requirements meant that it wanted the ""Fortnite"" user base, which includes many younger users, to have access to ""what I would call, as a parent, an impulse purchase."" 

""What you are really asking for is the ability to have impulse purchases,"" she said to Sweeney through layers of plexiglass separating the witness booth from the bench.
""Yes,"" Sweeny replied, ""customer convenience is a huge factor in this.""

The company first went public in 2000, but it had to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy following financial restatements, investigations into its accounting practices and a plunge in sales at some of its franchisees.
It was bought by privately owned JAB Holding Co in a $1.35 billion deal in 2016 when the investment firm was ramping up its bets on coffee and restaurant businesses.
The doughnut chain's move would help it tap into a historic boom in U.S. capital markets, with companies raising $167 billion in 2020, according to Dealogic data, a record that investment bankers expect will be surpassed this year.
It also comes at a time when demand is rising for snacks and sweets from customers craving familiar treats while staying at home due to COVID-19 restrictions.
As a part of a promotion earlier this year, the company gave away free glazed doughnuts to anyone who showed a valid COVID-19 vaccination card at a Krispy Kreme store in the United States.

Known for its glazed sugary treats, Krispy Kreme opened its first store in North Carolina in 1937 when it started selling doughnuts in local grocery stores. It now sells its treats in 12,000 grocery and convenience stores in the United States and operates nearly 1,400 shops in 33 countries. 
Rival Dunkin' Brands (NASDAQ:DNKN) was taken private last year by Inspire Brands, owner of Arby's and Sonic Drive-In, for $8.76 billion.

1264,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2021 07:11PM ET</span>","Lyft sees sustained profit starting in third quarter on cost cuts, demand rebound","By Tina Bellon and Akanksha Rana
(Reuters) -Lyft Inc on Tuesday surprised Wall Street with significantly lower losses than expected and said it would deliver dependable profit on an adjusted basis beginning in the third quarter thanks to cost cuts that allow the company to earn more per ride.
The results come as  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) emerges from more than a year of pandemic-related restrictions during which ridership and revenue plummeted. The company said it expected a strong rebound in U.S. travel in the third quarter, when many homebound Americans who hunger for travel are likely to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19.
Shares were up 5.2% at $59 in after-hours trading on Tuesday. Over the previous five days they had lost 11%.
Lyft reported an adjusted $73 million first-quarter loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization - a metric that excludes more than $300 million in one-time costs, including stock-based compensation. 
That is significantly narrower than the $144 million loss analysts had projected on average, according to Refinitiv data.
Lyft reaffirmed its goal to be profitable on the adjusted EBITDA metric in the third quarter of this year and said it would remain profitable beyond that time, even as the company invested in future growth opportunities.
Lyft President John Zimmer said Lyft would take advantage of its leaner cost structure to make more money per rider as passengers return to the platform in greater numbers in the coming months.
Zimmer also played down the threat of federal regulation that would turn most ride-hail and food-delivery workers, who currently are independent contractors, into employees.
Lyft had recently pulled forward its profitability goal by three months when it announced the sale of its self-driving technology business for $550 million.
Lyft's larger rival, Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc, has projected profitability on an adjusted basis by the end of 2021. Uber is scheduled to report results on Wednesday afternoon.
On a net basis, Lyft's loss widened to around $427 million, driven by high stock-based compensation costs as the result of the company's public listing more than two years ago. 
At $609 million, first-quarter revenue also outstripped average Wall Street expectations for $559 million. 
Lyft has drastically slashed costs during the pandemic when ridership plummeted and it continued to cut expenses in the first three months of 2021, even as riders gradually returned.
Total costs in the first quarter decreased by more than $344 million and overall, Lyft has slashed nearly $2.5 billion in costs since the beginning of last year.
Zimmer said the company also expected incentive spending for drivers to increase in the coming months, but executives during a conference call said those incentives were covered by the higher prices riders currently pay in many cities as demand temporarily outstrips supply.
Lyft Chief Executive Logan Green said he expected supply to balance out in the third quarter, once vaccinations increase, COVID-19 infections decrease and federal unemployment benefits for gig workers expire.
The number of active riders in the first quarter rose more than 7% from the last three months of 2020, but ridership still remains around 36% below last year. 
Executives said they expect trip demand, particularly leisure and airport travel, to ramp up significantly in the third quarter. 
REGULATORY PRESSURE
But as business gradually returns, Lyft and its gig-economy peers in the ride-hail and food-delivery industry face regulatory pressure under the new administration of U.S. President Joe Biden, who campaigned on the promise of delivering benefits to gig workers by turning them into employees.
The shares of the companies took a tumble last week when U.S. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh told Reuters in an interview that ""a lot of gig workers should be classified as employees.""
The companies rely on low-cost flexible workers and say their services would become unavailable if workers were reclassified as employees. They say surveys show the majority of their workers do not want to be employees.
Zimmer on Tuesday played down the risks of federal regulation, saying a labor bill supported by U.S. Democrats faced tough odds of passing in Congress.

He said the company instead was focused on adopting compromise regulation on the state and local levels, modeled after a November gig industry-sponsored California ballot measure that cemented ride-hail and food delivery workers' status as contractors, but provided them with some benefits.
""I honestly believe that we will continue to see common-ground, practical solutions that balance independence for drivers ... with additional benefits,"" Zimmer said, adding that he thinks the federal government will eventually pass guidance that makes it easier for states to adopt compromise regulation.

But the company said business demand gained momentum in the period, albeit at a more modest pace than leisure demand.
After the pandemic pushed the hospitality industry to one of its worst downturns in 2020, hotel operators are expected to bounce back this year on the back of rising inoculation rates and pent-up demand. 
""The expansion of vaccine distribution and the easing of travel restrictions in certain markets fueled improved confidence in travel in many of the markets in which we operate,"" Chief Executive Officer Mark Hoplamazian said.
Hyatt said its first-quarter comparable system-wide revenue per available room (RevPAR) - a key measure of a hotel's performance - fell about 48.9%.
Total revenue fell 55.9% to $438 million, missing analysts' estimates of $468.9 million.

Net loss attributable to Hyatt was $304 million, or $2.99 per share, in the three months ended March 31, compared with a loss of $103 million, or $1.02 per share, a year earlier.

(Reuters) -Match Group Inc forecast current-quarter revenue above expectations on Tuesday, banking on its online dating apps including Tinder and Hinge attracting more subscribers as easing pandemic curbs encourage people to socialize. 
The company expects second-quarter revenue in the range of $680 million to $690 million, 22% to 24% higher than last year and above analysts' estimates of $678.8 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
""As we head into summer, with a growing number of people getting vaccinated, we cannot help but be excited ... Looking forward to a summer of love,"" Chief Executive Officer Shar Dubey said in a letter to shareholders.
She noted that accelerating re-openings in the United States drove growth at its brands in the reported quarter, and as summer months began last year, propensity to pay rebounded across the portfolio.
With the pandemic keeping people from meeting one another in person, the company has also been tapping into the fast-growing social discovery space, which lets users discover and connect with people not exclusively for dating as they might never meet them face-to-face. 
However, Dubey warned that the post-pandemic recovery is going to take some time to play out as the situation in the rest of the world remains more mixed, with the COVID-19 trends in India, Brazil, Japan and certain European markets worsening. 
Total revenue jumped 23% to $668 million versus estimates of $650.7 million, largely powered by a 18% revenue rise at Tinder on 15% average subscriber growth. Other brands saw a rise of 30%. 

Match's average revenue per user rose 9%. Total subscribers increased 12% to 11.1 million.

Both Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) skyrocketed last year due to the suitability of their offerings. And because remote activities are expected to continue even in the post-pandemic world, and both the tech giants are constantly innovating to stay ahead of their competitors, we think their stocks are solid long-term investments. However, let’s discuss which stock could perform better this year.Technology stocks have ruled the last two decades. The major tech companies began the internet decade as start-ups and have grown to multi-trillion-dollar valuations. Over the last few years, the FAANG stocks have risen to prominence. The acronym FAANG stands for Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Alphabet Inc’s Google (GOOGL). These companies have ascended to unprecedented market-cap heights on the back of their sound business models, strong earnings, and market dominance.
AAPL and GOOGL have performed exceptionally well over the past year. They have upgraded and expanded their offerings to meet changing consumer demand amid the pandemic and to facilitate the “new normal” way of living and working. Though many investors are now shifting away from expensive tech stocks to quality non-tech stocks that are expected to thrive with the economic recovery, the current wave of artificial intelligence (AI), 5G network, cloud computing and virtual reality products has the potential to be revolutionary in coming years and help the FAANG stocks keep advancing.
While the demand for AAPL’s next generation products and services over the years has been impressive, GOOGL has been at the forefront of shaping the future with its search services and cloud-based offerings. Both stocks have generated significant returns over the past 10 years. While AAPL returned 965.8% over this period, GOOGL has gained 777.7%. However, in terms of year-to-date performance, GOOGL is a clear winner with 33.7% returns versus AAPL’s negative returns.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 fell Tuesday, as investors reined in their bullish bets on tech stocks after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen talked up the prospect of rate hikes to prevent the economy from overheating.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6%, or 19.8 points, but had been down about 320 points at the lows of the day. The S&P 500 was down 0.67%, and the Nasdaq Composite slumped 1.9%.
""It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn’t overheat,"" Yellen said Tuesday during an economic seminar presented by The Atlantic. ""Even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy, it could cause some very modest increases in interest rates.""
Still, the earlier remarks stoked the worst fears of the market – higher rates and inflation – exacerbating the selloff in high-flying tech stocks, which are less attractive in periods of rising rates and inflation during which a dollar today is more worth more than a dollar in the future.
""Yellen hit on the worst fears of the market: rising interest rates rising, inflation,"" Darren Schuringa, CEO of ASYMmetric ETFs said in an interview with Investing.com on Tuesday. ""Had Yellen mentioned rising taxes that would have been the trifecta [of market fears]. This, more than anything, is what's driving the markets down today.""
Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell more 1%, with the latter down 3.5%.
Chip stocks, down 1.6%, also contributed to the weakness in the tech, paced by a 3.7% decline in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). 
The tech wreck could continue as the reflationary environment will likely drive up bets on cyclicals.
""Tech has had its day in the sun, Schuringa said. ""If the economy is going to recover and inflation starts to come out, the reflation trade right now makes sense."" Investors will likely source funds for the reflation trade from areas in their portfolio ""where valuations are most stretched,"" he added.
The weakness in tech offset a wave of mostly bullish corporate earnings, with  Pfizer  , CVS and  Under Armour  (NYSE:UA) in the spotlight.
Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) reported first-quarter EPS of 93 cents that markedly beat Wall Street expectations of 78 cents, driven by strong sales of its Covid-19 vaccine.  
Pfizer's raised its outlook on full-year Covid-19 vaccine sales, which were about 24% of its overall revenue for the first quarter. 
CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) delivered Q1 results that were ahead of consensus estimates, boosted by vaccinations and increased sales of prescriptions. Its shares rose 4%.
Under Armour (NYSE:UAA)'s better-than-expected quarterly results were shrugged off as its shares fell nearly 1% on the day.
The wave of earnings for the first quarter so far, has seen about 86% of the S&P 500 companies deliver a positive surprise, putting the index on course for its best quarterly earnings in more than a decade.

Furthermore, given that people are increasingly keen on solar installations at their homes as the cost of solar panels declines, the industry is expected to get sales a boost going forward. While the solar sector is expected to continue thriving this year and beyond, not all companies in the industry are well positioned to benefit. Specifically, we think Sunnova Energy (NOVA), ReneSola (SOL), and SolarWindow (WNDW) possess weak financials and should be avoided now.The rising number of solar installations because of new laws mandating rooftop solar on new homes has been a recent positive for the solar industry. Also, a dramatic decline in the cost of solar energy is contributing to the sales surge. Solar energy is expected to be the lowest-cost source of bulk power in the coming years. 
According to a U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecast, 15 GW of solar photovoltaic (PV) generating capacity in the electric power sector will be added in 2021, with an additional 12 GW forecast for 2022.
In fact, with federal subsidies now making solar panel installation much more affordable, and with President Biden’s plans in his $2 trillion infrastructure package to drive carbon emissions to zero, investors have grown increasingly interested in the sector. While several companies are well positioned to capitalize on its potential, many continue to be unprofitable. So, we think it’s best to avoid  Sunnova Energy International Inc . (NYSE:NOVA), ReneSola Ltd. (SOL), and SolarWindow Technologies, Inc. (WNDW) because they currently possess weak financials.

But let’s find out which of these stocks is a better buy now?.Many economists believe China will overtake the United States as the world’s largest economy by 2028 given its current growth rate. The country is a global manufacturing hub with an affinity for technological innovations and development. Investor and founder of the world’s largest actively managed ETF company Ark Investment, Cathie Wood, has been betting on the Asian giant’s growth prospects for some time.

It comes as inflationary pressures continue to increase, while long-term rates have backed off.Thus far, it’s been a volatile Q2 for the precious metals. Silver (SLV) has traded in a 13% range since the start of April, with most of the volatility to the upside. This outperformance has helped silver to regain some ground vs. the S&P-500 (SPY), underperforming the index just over 900 basis points year-to-date but still lagging last year’s outperformance. Fortunately, the one area silver is leading is relative to gold (GLD (NYSE:GLD)), a great sign for the precious metals. Generally, the precious metals perform much better when silver is leading, and typically, pullbacks with a bullish silver/gold ratio are simply violent corrections and not the start of new bear markets. Let’s take a closer look below:

As shown in the chart below, the silver/gold ratio continues to remain in a strong uptrend since Q3 of last year and is now within a stone’s throw of a new 52-week high. This outperformance during the recent 8-month correction in miners and metals suggests that there’s no reason to give up on hopes of a new bull market in metals because silver continues to lead by a wide margin.

Markets sold off today as investors shed tech stocks like there's no tomorrow. Instead, they found shelter in defensive sectors like financials, materials and energy, which rose slightly.Janet Yellen also pitched in, saying rates may have to rise to keep the economy from overheating, something that the Federal Reserve has repeatedly said won't happen in the near term.
Big earnings await us, with  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT), Uber (NYSE:UBER) and GM publishing results today and tomorrow. 
The ADP jobs report on Wednesday is expected to show a strengthening job market.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. All hail Wednesday
If you like ride-hailing companies, today's your day. Keep an eye on Lyft shares to see how they react to results that hit after the bell on Tuesday. Then it's Uber's turn post-market. Both are expected to lose money, but it's the rebound in rides and forecasts that should be watched closely.
2. Generally speaking
Sticking with cars, General Motors (NYSE:GM) is also reporting on Wednesday. Much of the attention will be on the chip shortages that are crippling production plans and how they'll weigh on future results. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) last week cut its full-year forecast because of its production woes. 
3. ADP jobs
On the eco front, the ADP jobs report for April will give us a preview of Friday's non-farm payrolls numbers. As vaccinations increase and infections drop, consensus is calling for a jump to 873,000 from March's 517,000.

(Reuters) -CVS Health Corp on Tuesday boosted its 2021 adjusted profit forecast as it expects to record higher earnings from its health insurance and pharmacy benefits management (PBM) units this year, and its shares jumped more than 4%.
The company, best known for its national chain of retail drugstores, said it now expects 2021 adjusted profit of $7.56 to $7.68 per share, from its previous view of $7.39 to $7.55. 
""Even though investor expectations were high, the company's guidance raise was even higher,"" CFRA research analyst Kevin Huang said. 
CVS said its PBM business, which negotiates drug discounts for health insurers and employers, had not been hurt by the COVID-19 pandemic, unlike its retail segment, which took a sales hit during lockdowns and other restrictions imposed last year. 
The company's largest segment performed better as it managed rising drug costs and specialty drug use, Chief Executive Karen Lynch said of the PBM business in an interview.
PBM revenue rose 3.8% to $36.32 billion in the first quarter, and CVS raised its full-year adjusted operating income forecast for the unit. 
CVS also raised its full-year adjusted operating income target for its Aetna (NYSE:AET) health insurance unit after a near 20% jump in adjusted operating income in the first quarter. 
The company said it sees a return to normal demand for non-COVID-19 healthcare services and expects that and expenses related to COVID-19 testing and vaccine administration to marginally drive up medical costs for Aetna. 
CVS has been offering COVID-19 tests and administering vaccines at its pharmacies across the United States as part of the ongoing federal program. The company said it has so far put over 17 million vaccines into people's arms. 
While the U.S. government is paying for vaccinating Americans, insurers are covering the costs of administering the shots.

Excluding items, CVS earned $2.04 per share in the first quarter, topping analysts' estimates by 32 cents, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
CVS shares were up 4.4% at $81.14.

Vaccines have been allocated state by state based on population - a formula the Biden administration held to even as some states such as Michigan saw increases in coronavirus infections.
Under the new policy, unordered doses would be made available to states with a more immediate need, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters.
""They can still order ... up to their full allocation based on population,"" Psaki said. ""They can also order less than their full allocation and ... the doses that are not being given to that state will then go into kind of an overarching supply that could then be distributed to other states by population.""

The shift, first reported by the Washington Post, was conveyed to governors by the Biden administration on Tuesday.
New coronavirus cases in the United States fell for the third week in a row. About 30.5% of the population, or about 101,407,318 people, have been fully vaccinated as of last week.

However, fiscal stimulus and an improving job market have been boosting investors’ purchasing power and creating inflationary pressures.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 took a breather Tuesday, pressured by technology after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen talked up the prospect of rate hikes to prevent the economy from overheating.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.32.%, or 109 points, the S&P 500 was down 1.14%, and the Nasdaq Composite slumped 2.6%.
""It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn’t overheat,"" Yellen said Tuesday during an economic seminar presented by The Atlantic. ""Even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy, it could cause some very modest increases in interest rates.""
The remarks stoked the worst fears of the market – higher rates and inflation – exacerbating the selloff in high-flying tech stocks, which are less attractive in periods of rising rates and inflation during which a dollar today is more worth more than a dollar in the future.
""Yellen hit on the worst fears of the market: rising interest rates rising, inflation,"" Darren Schuringa, CEO of ASYMmetric ETFs said in an interview with Investing.com on Tuesday. ""Had Yellen mentioned rising taxes that would have been the trifecta [of market fears]. This, more than anything, is what's driving the markets down today.""
Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) fell more 2%.
Chip stocks, down 3%, also contributed to the weakness in the tech, paced by a 4% decline in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). 
The tech wreck could continue as the reflationary environment will likely drive up bets on cyclicals.
""Tech has had its day in the sun, Schuringa said. ""If the economy is going to recover and inflation starts to come out, the reflation trade right now makes sense."" Investors will likely source funds for the reflation trade from areas in their portfolio ""where valuations are most stretched,"" he added.
The weakness in tech offset a wave of mostly bullish corporate earnings, with  Pfizer , CVS and  Under Armour  (NYSE:UA) in the spotlight.
Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) reported first-quarter EPS of 93 cents that markedly beat Wall Street expectations of 78 cents, driven by strong sales of its Covid-19 vaccine.  
Pfizer's raised its outlook on full-year Covid-19 vaccine sales, which were about 24% of its overall revenue for the first quarter. 
CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) delivered Q1 results that were ahead of consensus estimates, boosted by vaccinations and increased sales of prescriptions. Its shares rose 4%.
Under Armour (NYSE:UAA)'s better-than-expected quarterly results were shrugged off as its shares fell nearly 4% on the day.
The wave of earnings for the first quarter so far, has seen about 86% of the S&P 500 companies deliver a positive surprise, putting the index on course for its best quarterly earnings in more than a decade.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Myanmar's ambassador to the United Nations told the U.S. Congress on Tuesday that Washington should target the state-run Myanmar oil and gas company and a state-owned bank with sanctions.
Ambassador Kyaw Moe Tun, a representative of elected lawmakers who oppose Myanmar's military junta, also warned that the crisis triggered by a Feb. 1 coup in the Southeast Asian nation threatened regional security.
The Biden administration has denounced the coup and imposed sanctions on the generals who led it as well as some of their family members and businesses that provide them with revenue.
The Myanmar ambassador told the House Committee on Foreign Affairs that as well as the military-run Myawaddy and Innwa banks, the United States should slap sanctions on the state-owned Myanmar Foreign Trade Bank (MFTB) and Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE).
MOGE operates offshore gas fields in joint ventures with international firms, including U.S.-based  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) and France's Total, while MFTB conducts transactions in foreign currencies for Myanmar's government.
The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) advocacy group says security forces have killed at least 766 civilians since the coup, which sparked nationwide protests.

Some pro-democracy activists have traveled to Myanmar's mountainous borderlands to join armed groups fighting for ethnic autonomy, raising fears of a spiraling conflict. 
“I wish to stress that Myanmar is not just witnessing another major setback to democracy, but also the crisis is threatening the regional peace and security,"" said Kyaw Moe Tun, who dramatically broke with the military junta in February, but has retained the country's seat at the United Nations.

The French carmaker, with Nissan, had exchanged stakes with Daimler a decade ago to strengthen their industrial partnerships.
Cooperation is continuing, Daimler and Renault said earlier this year, although people close to the matter had said larger initial plans never materialised and the cross-shareholdings were no longer deemed necessary.
Investors were guided to expect the shares to price at 69.85 euros each, a bookrunner organising the deal said. 
At that price, Nissan would reap just over 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) from the deal. 
Daimler shares closed at 72.41 euros a share on Tuesday.

1293,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2021 02:38PM ET</span>","Climate activists urge BlackRock, Vanguard to vote against Exxon directors","By Jennifer Hiller
HOUSTON (Reuters) -Climate activists are prodding  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM)'s top shareholders to vote against the reelection of two directors, a move that could boost a hedge fund's proxy fight to seat four candidates on the oil giant's board. 
Environmental group Sierra Club and other activists have bombarded BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) and Vanguard Group with calls and emails urging them to vote against Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods and lead independent director Kenneth Frazier at this month's shareholder meeting. The two money management firms hold more than 13% of Exxon shares combined.
Exxon is battling activist hedge fund Engine No. 1 over four seats on the 12-member board and the company's future direction. The fund has criticized Exxon's poor returns from heavy spending on fossil fuels and lack of a clear transition to cleaner fuels. It has support from some large pension funds in California and New York.
BlackRock and Vanguard declined to comment on their stance. Both have signed the Net Zero Asset Managers  Initiative, vowing to press portfolio companies to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner.
""The leadership of the boards of directors should be voted off"" if their company fails to embrace the Paris Accord's goal on limiting the rise in the global temperature, said Lisa Lindsley, director of investor engagement at Majority Action, one of the groups pressuring the Exxon shareholders.
Exxon spokesman Casey Norton said the company supports the Paris Agreement on climate change, is focused on investments to lower carbon emissions in high-emitting sectors such as heavy industry and power, and is ""the industry leader in carbon capture and storage."" 
Exxon is ""developing innovative solutions needed to help achieve society’s goal of a lower-carbon future,"" Norton said, adding that conversations with investors have been constructive.
Exxon, the top U.S. oil firm, in recent months has expanded its board, pledged to increase spending on lower-carbon initiatives and lower the intensity of its oilfield greenhouse gas emissions. It has not set 2050 targets as European peers have done.
In a Reuters interview last week, Woods, the CEO, said big shareholders have been receptive to Exxon's climate efforts. 
Shareholders ""are very encouraged by the fact that we're taking a leadership role and helping to provide solutions to meet some of these broader ambitions,"" Woods said.

Supporters from various groups have sent at least 10,000 emails to both BlackRock and Vanguard and made hundreds of phone calls to BlackRock's offices, asking them to vote against Woods and Frazier, according to the Australian-based Sunrise Project, part of a network of climate-focused groups that have zeroed in on large money managers.
""It's important to call on them to actually do more than just issue nice letters and press releases and actually make good on those commitments,"" said Ben Cushing, who leads the Sierra Club's financial advocacy campaign.

LONDON (Reuters) - Deliveroo's poor public debut in March has not put off other companies from listing in London, Britain's financial services minister said on Tuesday.
The food delivery company's flotation was supposed to be London's debut of the decade, but the stock plunged 30% on the first day, with some investors shunning the listing, citing concerns about gig-economy working conditions.
""I am delighted that Deliveroo chose to list in London,"" John Glen said in a recorded interview with CSFI think tank made public on Tuesday.
""There is strong pipeline of companies who are planning to IPO in London, and it will never be about one company, it's about a sustainable pathway to access finance and be assured about the regulations that exist,"" Glen said, without naming any companies. 
Shares in cyber security firm Darktrace rocketed on their London debut last week, while Alphawave IP Group said it was planning a London listing this month.
Britain is seeking to bolster the City of London financial hub after being largely cut off from the European Union due to Brexit, and looser listing rules is part of that strategy.
""London is unique as a financial hub,"" Glen said.
But many banks that used London as their European gateway have had to open hubs in the bloc where their regulator, the European Central Bank, wants them to be fully staffed quickly, forcing lenders into a difficult decisions about future business models in Europe.
Glen said the City remained vibrant and had only seen a ""modest adjustment"" in jobs since Brexit.
""We are never complacent and we are aware of the ECB's determinations around where people need to work, and we work constructively with regulators in London and take account of what we need to do to continue to see that growth in the UK,"" Glen said.

The EU has said it was in ""no rush"" to determine if Britain's financial sector has rules that are ""equivalent"" to those in the bloc, a condition for direct EU access.
""It's difficult to see where that lack of equivalence would come from,"" Glen said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Working from home does not work for everyone, especially those who want ""to hustle,"" JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)'s chief executive said on Tuesday at a conference in New York. 
The largest American bank recently told it workers that it expects all U.S.-based employees back in offices on a rotational basis by early July, subject to current public health rules limiting office capacity to 50%.
Bank CEO Jamie Dimon said he wants people back at work because exclusively working from home ""doesn't work for young people.""
""It doesn't work for those who want to hustle. It doesn't work for spontaneous idea generation. It doesn't work for culture,"" Dimon said at a conference hosted by the Wall Street Journal.
Dimon said he is open to some employees working from home a few days a week, a policy other banks like  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), HSBC and UBS are reportedly exploring. 
But starting on May 17, Dimon said he wants employees bank in the office a few days a week to reacclimate themselves to the workplace after working from home for over a year during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Dimon's ""get used to it"" approach, which could include requiring employees get vaccinated, has faced a backlash. Dimon said he received a ""nasty email"" from an employee's wife who disagreed with the push to return to work. 

""But that's life,"" Dimon said, saying the bank will be more competitive and work better for clients with employees meeting in person again. 
""In my view, September, October, it will look just like it did before and everyone's going to be happy with it.""

(Reuters) - As retail investors pump less money into blank-check companies, returns on those stocks are badly underperforming versus the S&P 500.
Reuters found that over 100 special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, that announced mergers this year on average have gained under 2% from the price they traded at when they first listed on the stock exchange. 
Most of those SPACs began trading on the stock market last year, and the group's median performance has trailed the S&P 500 by 15 percentage points, according to the Reuters analysis of data from Refinitiv and research firm SPAC Research. 
Their underperformance comes amid a fall from grace for SPACs as increased regulatory scrutiny threatens to make many proposed mergers less attractive.
In early 2021, individual investors hungry for exposure to industries such as electric vehicles and space travel snapped up a wave of SPACs, which acquire startups and take them public with less scrutiny than in a traditional initial public offer. 
Graphic: Retail investors lose interest in SPACs: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-SPACS/RETURNS/bdwvkblonpm/chart.png 
Since then, retail investors have lost much of their initial interest, and listings of new SPACs have fallen off. 
Retail investors' net daily purchases of SPACs have fallen to about $181 million from $500 million in late January, according to research firm VandaTrack. 
Backers say SPACs sidestep exorbitant fees charged by investment banks in IPOs, while critics warn that investors pay a heavy cost through share dilution during the process of launching a SPAC and acquiring a target company. 
A recent study https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3720919 by members of Stanford University and New York University law schools found that SPACs that spent more than others on payments to sponsors and other fees tended to see their share prices fall further following mergers with their target companies.
""It's not just bad luck that causes SPACs to underperform,"" said Michael Ohlrogge, assistant professor of law at NYU School of Law and one of the study's authors. ""There are all these costs that drain value from the SPAC merger, and those costs get passed on to investors.""
SPACs typically sell shares for $10, with a guarantee that investors can redeem those shares, often with interest, if they do not like the merger deal the SPAC eventually strikes. In their initial public offers marketed to institutional investors, they also provide warrants to buy additional shares at a potential discount.
Smaller investors tend to buy SPAC shares directly on the stock market, often with the intention of holding them long-term, although they do have the right to redeem their shares when the SPAC completes a merger. 
Of SPACs that have announced deals in 2021, the share prices of many rose ahead of the announcement, only to return to around their $10 listing price, suggesting investors are unimpressed with the planned mergers and may redeem their shares when the merger completes. 
For example, shares of Altimeter Growth Corp have receded 16% since April 13, when it announced it would combine with ride-hailing and food delivery firm Grab Holdings in a deal worth almost $40 billion. Its stock remains up 6% since it first traded on Dec. 1, compared with a 13% gain in the S&P 500.
The median performance of a SPAC from the day it announces what company it will merge with through now is a decline of 6% according to the Reuters analysis. 
Graphic: SPACS - best and worst vs S&P 500: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-SPACS/RETURNS/yxmvjdzdovr/chart.png 

Overall, about 90% of SPACs that announced deals this year are lagging the S&P 500, based on when they began trading on the stock market, typically at around $10, according to Reuters' analysis. 
The analysis included 114 SPACs that have announced mergers in 2021. It does not include over 400 SPACs that listed their shares this year and last year and are still looking for companies to merge with. In most cases, their shares are hovering around the $10 IPO price they can be redeemed for if a merger is eventually announced.

(Reuters) -Private-equity firm KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc said on Tuesday its first-quarter after-tax distributable earnings surged 63% year-on-year, driven by growth in its capital markets business and public market holdings.
After-tax distributable earnings (DE) – the cash used for paying dividends to shareholders – rose to $660.2 million from $406.3 million the previous year and $355.3 million in the 2019 quarter before the pandemic. That translated to DE per share of 75 cents, which exceeded the average Wall Street analysts' estimate of 63 cents, according to financial data provider Refinitiv.
KKR and its peers have been selling assets for top dollar as the global economy bounces back from fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The majority of KKR's divestments came from sales of stakes in portfolio companies, including sporting goods retailer Academy Sports and Outdoors Inc, pharmaceutical firm BridgeBio Pharma (NASDAQ:BBIO) Inc and sports-betting company FanDuel.
KKR said transaction fees from its capital markets business more than doubled to $112.2 million, up from $60.2 million in the previous year. Total realized investment income - which consists of proceeds from asset sales - rose 24% to $632.5 million during the quarter. Net income under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) rose to $1.64 billion from a loss a year earlier.
Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc, the world's largest private-equity firm, reported last month that its distributable earnings more than doubled, driven by asset divestments in the first quarter.  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) Inc also posted a 23% rise in after-tax distributable earnings as it cashed out on more of its holdings.
KKR said it raised $15 billion of new capital in the quarter across various funds in the first quarter. Reuters had earlier on Monday reported that KKR had amassed about $18.5 billion for its latest flagship North America private equity fund, raising its biggest-ever fund in less than five months.

Private-equity, opportunistic real estate and infrastructure portfolios climbed 19%, 6%, and 11%, respectively, KKR said, adding that its leveraged credit and alternative credit funds rose 2% and 7%, respectively.

Total assets under management rose to $367 billion from $252 billion in the previous quarter, due to strong fundraising and the closing of KKR's acquisition of annuities and life insurance provider Global Atlantic Financial Group Ltd.
KKR had $69 billion of unspent capital, as of the end of March, and declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.145 per share. Its shares were trading at $55.88 per share, down 0.69% in late morning on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has ended a criminal investigation into individuals associated with Airbus, the European planemaker that agreed to a record $4.0 billion global settlement 16 months ago, sources said on Tuesday.
Three sources familiar with the investigation said the SFO had written to former suspects to say it would take no further action. Overseas prosecutors could, however, take a different view in cases where suspects face more than one inquiry.
Airbus and the SFO, which along with French and U.S. prosecutors agreed to a ground-breaking deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) https://www.reuters.com/article/us-airbus-probe-france-idUSKBN1ZU1X4 with the company in January 2020, declined to comment. 
But the SFO updated its website on April 22 to state that its case would remain open until the end of the DPA - a settlement that allows companies to avoid criminal prosecution in a court-approved deal that often includes a fine and compliance monitoring - in January 2023. 
It previously stated that the inquiry remained active and the position in relation to individuals was being considered.
Airbus was accused of a ""pervasive and pernicious"" bribery scheme by a U.S. district judge last year after a four-year inquiry into sales across more than a dozen overseas markets culminated a corporate settlement.
Last week, the company drew a final line under British criminal investigations when former subsidiary GPT Special Project Management pleaded guilty to corruption over military contracts for Saudi Arabia.
Successfully prosecuting white collar crime is notoriously tricky, time-consuming and costly, especially if prosecutors rely on overseas authorities to share documentary evidence.
But the SFO, which has yet to successfully prosecute individuals following a DPA, has faced criticisms of serious failings after the collapse of high-profile trials against former executives at Serco, over prisoner-tagging, and at retailer Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) after corporate settlements. 

It also abandoned investigations into suspects associated with aero engine maker Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY) and drugs company GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) in 2019, raising the ire of anti corruption groups that say it is absurd for companies to settle allegations of wrongdoing when individuals cannot be held to account.
But Sarah Wallace, a lawyer at Constantine Law, noted it was inherently more difficult to prosecute and secure convictions against individuals than agreeing a DPA with a company.

MILAN (Reuters) -Ferrari pushed back its profit target for next year after delaying investments and some deliveries in the pandemic, but stuck to its timetable for a first electric car by 2025.
The luxury carmaker famed for its 'Cavallino Rampante', or 'Prancing Horse', badge had predicted adjusted core earnings of 1.8-2.0 billion euros ($2.2-$2.4 billion) in 2022.
But on Tuesday, the Italian company said it was postponing that target to 2023 because of the pandemic, even though it expects results to grow this year and next. 
""We expect the prudent steps we took in 2020 and are continuing in 2021 to adjust our expenditure in response to the COVID-19 emergency will postpone by one year the achievement of our year-end 2022 guidance,"" Chairman John Elkann said.
In a call on first quarter results, Elkann told analysts the pandemic had also taken its toll on Ferrari (NYSE:RACE)'s drive to diversify its brand into other luxury areas and on its Formula One-related activities.
A Milan-based trader said the target delay was bad news for Ferrari's highly-valued shares. ""This has raised concerns that the COVID-19 impact on the company could be greater than expected,"" he said.
Ferrari shares closed down 8% in Milan. 
But the company said excellent quarterly results, robust net orders and a record order book made it confident of reaching the top end of its 1.45-1.5 billion euros adjusted earnings forecast for this year.
""Our 2022 results will be better than 2021, which ... we believe will be very strong,"" said Elkann, the scion of Italy's Agnelli family, which controls Ferrari through its holding company Exor (OTC:EXXRF).
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts said the delayed guidance did not change Ferrari's long term challenges, such as the industry shift towards electric vehicles.
It ""leaves plenty of room for new management to discuss the potential beyond 2023 including an expanded model range,"" they said. 
Elkann, who confirmed Ferrari would launch its first SUV next year, the Purosangue, said an electrification drive was already included in the group's capital spending targets, without the need for any additions. Ferrari last month promised a first full-electric model for 2025.

The company, which is still searching for a permanent replacement for former CEO Louis Camilleri, who stepped down in December, repeated it was making good progress with a shortlist of strong candidates.

1307,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2021 12:26PM ET</span>",U.S. and Chinese trade experts among the WTO chief's new deputies,"GENEVA (Reuters) -The World Trade Organization has again chosen trade experts from China and the United States as deputies for its director-general, maintaining a delicate geopolitical balancing act which also keeps two fractious powers close at hand.
Two out of the four chosen are women, a first for the global trade watchdog. Their four predecessors, all men, stepped down on March 31. 
Replacing their compatriots are Angela Ellard, an American lawyer and trade expert who has worked at the U.S. Congress, and Zhang Xiangchen, currently vice trade minister and its former WTO ambassador, the WTO said in a statement.
France's WTO envoy Jean-Marie Paugam and Costa Rica's former trade minister Anabel Gonzalez were also selected, it said.
""It is the first time in the history of our organisation that half of the DDGs (deputy director-generals) are women,"" Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said in the statement.
Okonjo-Iweala, who became director-general on March 1, is the first woman and African at the WTO helm. 
""This underscores my commitment to strengthening our organisation with talented leaders whilst at the same time achieving gender balance in senior positions,"" she said. 
Traditionally, WTO deputies come from the United States, European Union, Asia and a developing country. An Indian candidate Mohan Kumar had challenged China's Zhang for the Asia post this time.
Henry Gao, a law professor at Singapore Management University, said that Zhang's selection shows China's growing importance within the body which it joined in 2001.
""The post is used for updating the DG on what major powers think. You really need to know what China thinks,"" he said.

He added that the U.S. and Chinese appointments could provide a channel for the two countries to discuss trade matters.
The WTO did not elaborate on the deputies' new roles. Responsibility for legal affairs dealing with trade dispute settlement, held previously by Germany's Karl Brauner, is seen by trade experts as among the most important.

1310,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2021 11:46AM ET</span>",Apollo's first-quarter earnings surge on strong fee revenue,"By Chibuike Oguh
(Reuters) -Apollo Global Management Inc said on Tuesday its first-quarter distributable earnings rose 78%, driven by growing management fees from its sprawling credit business and a surge in asset sales from its private equity portfolio.
The first quarterly earnings were the first reported by Apollo with co-founder Marc Rowan at the helm as chief executive. He succeeded Leon Black, who left the New York-based private equity firm in March following a review by law firm Dechert of his ties to late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. 
The review found Black paid Epstein $158 million for advice on tax and estate planning and related services between 2012 and 2017. It cleared Black of any wrongdoing.
""So I am the CEO of the business,"" Rowan said during an analyst earnings call. ""The lanes I have picked out for myself are strategy, culture, which includes compensation, communication, urgent strategic initiatives, and dealing with problems.""
In naming Rowan as CEO, Apollo passed over co-founder Joshua Harris, who had been widely expected to take over the top job from Black. Apollo co-Presidents Jim Zelter and Scott Kleiman were given charge of the day-to-day running of company. But Rowan said Harris remains active as a senior member of the executive team and board member.
""Yes, we have had changes in roles,"" Rowan said. ""Josh is less involved in compensation, which seems like a natural given that I'm now the CEO.""
Apollo's shares were down 1.18% at $54.42 per share in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
EARNINGS BEAT
Apollo said on Tuesday that first-quarter distributable earnings - cash used for paying dividends to shareholders - rose to $293.8 million from $165.1 million a year earlier. This resulted in distributable earnings per share of 66 cents per share, greater than the 58 cents estimated by Wall Street analysts on average, according to financial data provider Refinitiv.
Apollo peer Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc reported last month that its distributable earnings more than doubled in the first quarter, while  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) Inc said its after-tax distributable earnings rose 23% on strong asset sales from its private equity business.
Apollo said it sold $3.7 billion worth of assets in the first quarter. It exited its entire stake in luxury watch retailer Watches of Switzerland, as well as U.S. subprime lender OneMain Holdings (NYSE:OMF) Inc. It also sold a 9% stake in French glass bottle maker Verallia. 
The company also put a lot of capital to work. It deployed some $24.9 billion in the quarter, $19.1 billion of which want to credit investments. 
In March, Apollo agreed to an all-stock merger deal with Athene Holdings Ltd, bringing in-house the annuities provider, which is a key contributor to revenue generated from lucrative asset management fees.
Apollo said its fee-related earnings rose 26% to a record $286.7 million, driven by strong management, advisory and transactions fees. It reported a net income of $669.7 million under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), also a record.
Apollo said its private equity portfolio appreciated by 22% during the quarter, while its real estate, principal finance, and infrastructure funds rose 12%. Its credit funds rose 4% in aggregate. 

Total asset management rose to $461.1 billion from $455.5 billion in the prior quarter, driven by fundraising and the appreciation of its private equity portfolio. Apollo, which ended the quarter with $49.7 billion in unspent capital, declared a dividend of 50 cents per share.
Earlier this month, Apollo agreed to buy the media unit of  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ), which owns online services Yahoo and AOL, for $5 billion.

Stellantis was formed through the merger of France's PSA and Italy's FCA, which spent about 2 billion euros ($2.40 billion) to buy European and U.S. CO2 credits from electric vehicle maker Tesla over the 2019-2021 period.
""With the electrical technology that PSA brought to Stellantis, we will autonomously meet carbon dioxide emission regulations as early as this year,"" Stellantis boss Carlos Tavares said in the interview with French weekly Le Point.
""Thus, we will not need to call on European CO2 credits and FCA will no longer have to pool with Tesla or anyone."" 
California-based Tesla earns credits for exceeding emissions and fuel economy standards and sells them to other automakers that fall short. 
European regulations require all car manufacturers to reduce CO2 emissions for private vehicles to an average of 95 grams per kilometre this year.
A Stellantis spokesman said the company is in discussions with Tesla about the financial implications of the decision to stop the pooling agreement.
""As a result of the combination of Groupe PSA and FCA, Stellantis will be in a position to achieve CO2 targets in Europe for 2021 without open passenger car pooling arrangements with other automakers,"" he added.

Tesla's sales of environmental credits to rival automakers helped it to announce slightly better than expected first-quarter revenue this week.
The next tightening of European regulations will soon be the subject of proposals from the European Commission. The 2030 target could be lowered to less than 43 grams/km.

While these names may appear to be attractive cannabis bets for contrarian investors, a closer look at these companies’ weak financials and steep valuations may tell a different story. Read on.Cannabis stocks have been volatile this year. Not dissimilar to most nascent industries, stocks prices in the cannabis space have experienced big spikes and sharp declines over the years. Several marijuana producers are still unprofitable and are burning cash at a rapid clip. This means they must regularly raise equity capital, which dilutes shareholder value.
However, investors are nevertheless bullish on the expanding pot market in North America and the prospect of pot legalization in the U.S. and several other regions. This potential makes the sector attractive to investors with large risk appetites.
With this in mind, we compare two beaten-down pot stocks—Sundial Growers (SNDL) and OrganiGram (OGI)—to evaluate which is a better cannabis bet right now.

1315,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2021 11:11AM ET</span>","Low depreciation, higher rates give U.S. car rental firms rare perfect script","By Ankit Ajmera
(Reuters) - When Rob Ferretti of car rental firm Gothamdreamcars looked up the selling price for a 2018 Mercedes-Benz G-Class SUV, part of his luxury 25-vehicle fleet, he was elated it could fetch over $130,000 - nearly the same price paid three years ago. 
It is a very good time for car rental companies. A very rare combination of low depreciation costs on existing fleets, higher rates and a global shortage of semiconductors that has squeezed new car production, pushed trade-in prices for older vehicles to record highs in March. 
""I'm able to sell a Mercedes-Benz G Wagon for what I paid for it 20,000 miles ago. So that's effectively a free car,"" said Ferretti, who is a chief operating officer at the New Jersey-based firm. ""(This) is very beneficial for the business model.""
Lower depreciation costs, a major operating expense for car rental companies, has helped lift  Avis Budget  (NASDAQ:CAR) Group's profit. Avis' stock has surged six-fold in the past year, hitting fresh records several times over the past two months. 
Avis is the only listed company in the sector after rival Hertz went bankrupt last year. Privately held Enterprise Holdings is Avis' and Hertz's larger rival.
With rental bookings set to rebound in the summer, following widespread COVID-19 vaccinations, car rental firms stand to benefit from a jump in rates, as well as lower depreciation costs, analysts say.
""That's Goldilocks in the car rental world,"" said  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Adam Jonas. ""This is a very strong time and 'all the stars are aligned'.""
Those two factors are likely to be ""much more than sufficient"" to offset higher new car fleet costs that car rentals might face in the near-term as summer demand returns, Jonas said.
This year, car rental firms are expected to see their first major year-over-year increase in annual rates in several years in the United States, while fleet capacity remains low. 
Rental rates at Avis could rise for the first time in seven years this year, and set a new record. The company reported better-than-expected results on Monday.
The company's stock fell over 4% on Tuesday along with a broader pullback in the markets.
""We were modeling pricing of closer to a 5% (rise) for the year in 2021,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Hamzah Mazari said, referring to Avis' rates. ""The last time that Avis got 5% pricing was never.""
Avis could also post record margins over the next year or so, as its fleet costs hover below $250 per-unit per month in the Americas in 2021, Mazari said.

The company's fleet costs have stayed above or around $300 for several years.
""Once (Avis) gets back to pre-COVID $9.1 billion revenue number, which could be as early as next year given the vaccine rollout, they'll do above 11% margin, their prior peak in 2012,"" Mazari said. The margin stood at 8.6% in 2019.

Cummins, which focuses on heavy-duty trucks, is also expected to benefit from U.S. President Joe Biden's massive $2 trillion infrastructure plan that includes building and repairing roads, bridges, mass transit, schools and other infrastructure.
""The strength and breadth of the rebound in demand has surpassed our original expectations,"" Chief Executive Officer Tom Linebarger said in a statement on Tuesday.
Cummins, however, said its profit growth in the first quarter ended April 4 was hurt by a global semiconductor chip shortage and bottlenecks in global logistics that led to higher freight costs.
Margins in Cummins' main engine business fell to 14.4% in the quarter from 16.9% a year earlier.
Shares of the company, which counts PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR), Navistar (NYSE:NAV) International Corp and Deere (NYSE:DE) & Co among its customers, were down 1.7% in early trading.
Cummins said it now expects 2021 revenue to be up between 20% and 24%, compared with its previous forecast of 8% to 12%. 
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) as a percentage of sales is expected to be in the range of 15.5% and 16% in 2021, from the prior estimate of 15% and 15.5%.
Sales in Cummins' main engine business rose 14% to $2.46 billion in the first quarter, while volumes increased 26% to 172,300 units. 
On an adjusted basis, Cummins earned $4.04 per share, beating analysts' average estimate of $3.47, according to Refinitiv data.
Net sales rose 21.5% to $6.09 billion, above Wall Street's estimate of $5.36 billion.

1317,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2021 10:39AM ET</span>",Epic Games CEO cites Apple's 'total control' over iPhones at first day of antitrust trial,"By Stephen Nellis
OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - The chief executive of ""Fortnite"" creator Epic Games testified on Monday that he knew he was breaking Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s App Store rules by putting Epic's own in-app payment system into the game last year but wanted to highlight Apple's sway over the world's iPhone users, which now total 1 billion.
""I wanted the world to see that Apple exercises total control over all software on iOS, and it can use that control to deny users' access to apps,” Tim Sweeney said from behind layers of plexiglass in a federal courthouse in Oakland, California, on the first day of an antitrust trial against Apple.
The trial, expected to run three weeks, brings to a head a lawsuit Epic brought last year in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California that centers on two Apple practices that have become cornerstones of its business: Apple's requirement that virtually all third-party software for the world's 1 billion iPhones be distributed through its App Store, and the requirement that developers use Apple's in-app purchase system, which charges commissions of up to 30%.
Epic broke Apple's rules in August when it introduced its own in-app payment system in ""Fortnite"" to circumvent Apple's commissions. In response, Apple kicked Epic off its App Store. 
Epic sued Apple, alleging the iPhone maker is abusing its power over app developers with App Store review rules and payment requirements that hurt competition in the software market. Epic also launched an aggressive public relations campaign to call attention to its allegations just as Apple's practices have come under scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators in the United States and elsewhere.
In opening arguments, Epic attorney Katherine Forrest of Cravath, Swaine & Moore laid out the gaming company's argument that Apple has ""brick by brick"" built its App Store into a ""walled garden"" meant to extract fees from developers who want to access Apple's 1 billion iPhone users. Forrest argued that Apple has locked those users into its ecosystem with apps like iMessage, which lets Apple users send messages to other devices but has limited functionality when communicating with Android users.
“The most prevalent flower in the walled garden is the Venus fly trap,” Forrest argued before Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers (NYSE:ROG).
Apple has countered Epic's allegations by arguing its App Store rules have made consumers feel safe and secure in opening up their wallets to unknown developers, helping create a massive market from which all developers have benefited. Apple argues that Epic intentionally broke its contracts with Apple because the game maker wanted a free ride on the iPhone maker's platform.
In opening arguments for Apple, attorney Karen Dunn of Paul, Weiss noted Epic is asking the judge to force Apple to let third-party software be installed on its phones outside the App Store, similar to the ""side loading"" the Android operating system already allows. 
“Epic is asking for government intervention to take away a choice that consumers currently have,” Dunn told the court.
The courtroom was closed to the public, but in the audience as a ""corporate witness"" for each side were Epic's Sweeney and Phil Schiller, Apple's App Store chief.
During his testimony, Sweeney said Epic does pay commissions to other platform owners such as  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Group Corp's PlayStation and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Xbox but explained that those hardware makers use fees from developers to subsidize the further development of their hardware. 
Judge Gonzalez Rogers also asked her first direct questions of the trial during Sweeney's testimony, inquiring whether Apple's original iPhones from 2007 and 2008 were sophisticated enough to run Epic's video games. Sweeney said they were not. 
“So Apple did have to do something to the iPhone itself in order for it to be sophisticated enough to play your software? How is that any different than consoles?” she asked. 
Sweeney responded that the hardware development was similar, but the two devices had different business models. 

Sweeney and Schiller are expected to attend the entire trial, which will also feature in-person testimony from Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook and other senior executives at both firms.
Epic is not seeking monetary damages but is asking the court to hand down orders that would end many of Apple's practices.

(Reuters) -Under Armour Inc raised its expectations for annual profit and sales on Tuesday, after reporting a 35% jump in revenue as the reopening of economies in the United States and Asia fueled demand for the company's sports shoes and apparel.
The rollout of COVID-19 vaccines and new rounds of government stimulus lifted consumer confidence for discretionary spending this year, helping Under Armour (NYSE:UA) post a 32% increase in quarterly revenue from North America.
Revenue from the company's international segment surged 58%. 
Under Armour said it would spend more on marketing its brand, stores and website, to take advantage of recovering markets, including North America, China and Germany. 
It expects marketing and incentive compensations to make up about three quarters of the increase in costs this year. 
Still, the sportswear maker lifted its full-year adjusted earnings per share forecast to between 28 cents and 30 cents, from 12 cents to 14 cents.
It expects full-year revenue to rise by a high-teens percentage, compared with a previous outlook of a high single-digit percentage increase. The company forecast second-quarter revenue to rise about 70% after store closures hammered sales a year ago. 
Under Armour, like rival  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE), also flagged transportation and logistics problems caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Under Armour's shares fell 2.3% to $23.60 in choppy trading. Its stock has risen about 40% this year. 
""There are still industry issues to look out for such as issues with ports. It's not that the consumer doesn't want the product but we're seeing issues with getting the product in store,"" said Jessica Ramirez, retail analyst at Jane Hali & Associates. 

Under Armour's first-quarter net revenue rose to $1.26 billion, beating estimates of $1.13 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Streaming is a long-term growth area which is why David Cohne is recommending Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), and AMC Networks (NASDAQ:AMCX).Over the past ten years, consumers have been cutting the cord on cable and tossing out their satellite dishes in favor of streaming services. Last year, the pandemic accelerated this trend, with many people forced to stay at home. As a result, media companies have been jumping into the streaming wars with their own services.
While most streaming stocks saw huge gains last year, this trend isn’t expected to end anytime soon. Across the world, more people pay for streaming subscriptions than cable TV. Why pay for cable when you can watch shows or movies from any place at any time, from an internet-based library of content.
There are so many different streaming services now that there is something for everybody. That’s why investors need to pay attention to streaming stocks. The industry will continue to grow. But not all of these services will be winners when all is said and done.

(Reuters) - The COVID-19 pandemic, which has killed more than 127,000 Britons, is making people rethink their retirement and long-term savings plans, an added boon for money managers who are already benefiting from a record-setting recovery in financial markets.
The death of a loved one, the need to squirrel away funds for emergencies and pandemic-influenced changes in life goals are motivating more people to have conversations about financial planning, British money managers said.
""We have seen three characteristics emerge from this crisis – the early retirees, the retirement delayers and the newly motivated pension planners,"" said Rosie Hooper, chartered financial planner at asset manager Quilter Plc.
""This pandemic has just accelerated things, whether out of necessity or desire.""
In the first few months of the pandemic last year, investors were hit hard by a collapse in financial markets. Massive government stimulus, however, has lifted sentiment since then.
While some have used the money for big-ticket purchases like cars and homes, others are salting it away.
A survey by the country's statistics office (ONS) showed that one in eight workers, or 13%, of people aged 50 years and over said they had changed their retirement plans, with 5% saying that they will retire earlier and 8% planning to retire later.
In any case, people are now talking more about their retirement plans, wealth managers said.
""There are signs it's helping people make up their mind,"" said Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst at Hargreaves, which manages 1.5 million clients.
""LEAVE IT ALL BEHIND""
The crisis has also upended priorities: some want to spend more time on pet projects or with family, as many continue to work from home despite vaccination drives and as companies cut real estate footprint.
""For some people, it has opened their eyes to the compromises their working life has forced on them, so they're keen to leave it all behind as soon as possible,"" Coles said.
Tom Selby, senior analyst at AJ Bell, which has 346,700 customers, said new customers at its investment platform surged by nearly two-thirds in the first three months of this year from a year earlier. A majority of them invested for the long term via savings accounts and pensions.
Overall funds under management in the UK reached a record 1.4 trillion pounds at the end of 2020, while inflows tripled to 31 billion pounds, data https://www.theia.org/media/press-releases/ps52bn-inflows-active-funds-december-second-highest-inflows-record from Britain's investment industry trade body Investment Association showed.
""Everyone will know someone that very sadly has passed away as a result of COVID ... that will make people consider their life plan, their life goals, when do they want to retire,"" said Andrew Croft, CEO of blue-chip asset manager St. James's Place.
""People will be considering that a lot more. If you reach a conclusion that maybe I want to retire earlier than I originally planned, what you are going to do is you are going to find your way to a financial planner.""

Croft, however, added it was too early to call this a trend.
""It could be that in 12 months' time everyone has forgotten it and they have moved on. That's why I think it has got some way to play out.""

1322,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2021 10:22AM ET</span>",Mediaset sets sights on European expansion after Vivendi truce,"By Elvira Pollina
MILAN (Reuters) -Italy's top commercial broadcaster Mediaset (OTC:MDIUY), controlled by the family of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, will press on with European expansion plans after agreeing a split with its second largest investor Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY).
Led by French billionaire Vincent Bollore, Vivendi had managed to block Mediaset's pan-European strategy after the two companies in 2016 fell out over a collapsed pay-TV deal and locked horns in a protracted legal battle.
The accord signed on Monday paves the way for Vivendi to reduce its 28.8% stake over five years. It will also ensure the French group backs Mediaset's revamped overseas expansion scheme to tackle rising competition from rivals such as streaming app service Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).
Investors welcomed the deal, pushing shares in Mediaset up as much as 6% on Tuesday to levels last seen in September 2019. By 1330 GMT shares were up 2.3% at 2.75 euros. 
Shares in Vivendi, whose market value is more than 10 times Mediaset's three billion euros, were little changed.
The agreement to settle all pending legal claims comes after Vivendi regained full voting rights on its stake thanks to a string of court rulings, which also dismissed a three billion euro damage request from Mediaset.
After years of unsuccessful attempts, lawyers from law firms Cleary Gottlieb and Chiomenti, representing the French and Italian companies, stepped up efforts over the past few weeks. 
They worked frantically through the weekend, teleconferencing over Zoom and Teams, a person familiar with the process said, and put the final touches on the accord on Monday evening. 
Vivendi will now sell two thirds of its Mediaset holding on the market over five years. Mediaset's biggest shareholder Fininvest has a call option to buy any unsold shares each year at a set price.
Fininvest, the Berlusconi family's holding company, which already owns 44% of Mediaset, will buy another 5% from Vivendi at a price of 2.7 euros a share when the deal closes in July.
Mediaset will pay an extraordinary dividend of 0.30 euro a share in July.
Kepler Cheuvreux calculated the terms of the deal implied a one-off loss of around of 200 million euros for Vivendi, which the broker said was ""relatively immaterial"" given the size of the group.
Vivendi's aborted purchase of Mediaset's loss-making pay-TV arm - which was subsequently wound down - and its investment in Mediaset were billed as a longstanding plan championed by Bollore to build a southern European media powerhouse.
Mediaset has also turned to Europe. Over the past two years, the Milan-listed company, which controls Spanish broadcaster Mediaset Espana, built a 23.5% potential holding in German media group ProSiebenSat.1, flagging its ambition to create a pan-Europan TV champion.
Broker Equita said it expected Mediaset to now target ""an aggregation with Mediaset Espana and therefore with ProSieben.""
Mediaset's expansion plan could now take place in the second half of the year, Bestinver Securities said in a report.
Shares in Mediaset Espana rose around 3% on Tuesday in Madrid.

Under the accord sealed on Monday, Vivendi has agreed not to buy Mediaset and Mediaset Espana shares for five years and not to obstruct the Italian group's drive in Europe's free-to-air television market, two sources with knowledge of the matter said.
The sources said Mediaset and Vivendi were free to compete for the controlling stake in France's M6, which owner Bertelsmann has put up for sale.

(Reuters) - The big question for U.S. gaming companies when they report results in the coming days is whether players will remain hooked on ""Call of Duty"", ""Grand Theft Auto"" and ""NBA 2K21"" after life returns to some normalcy following vaccine rollouts.
Huge demand during the pandemic for game titles propped up results for  Electronic Arts Inc  (NASDAQ:EA), Activision Blizzard Inc (NASDAQ:ATVI) and Take-Two (NASDAQ:TTWO) Interactive Software Inc over the past few quarters. Most analysts are bullish and think the sales momentum can be sustained; some are a bit more skeptical.
John Patrick Lee, ETF Product Manager at VanEck, said ""return to normalcy risk"" is a very real risk to the video game market right now, with widespread vaccinations and lowering case counts in some countries.
""This could potentially mean that restaurants, bars, movie theaters, sports events, and other options are going to take video game consumers away from the digital world and into the real world.""
THE CONTEXTThe video gaming industry has seen a surge in sales over the past year as gamers remained indoors, but with the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines and easing of restrictions, people are venturing outdoors.
The gaming frenzy drove worldwide console sales to a record $56 billion in 2020. High demand also fueled a global shortage in semiconductor chips that has roiled the industry.
Moreover, publishers also need to keep refreshing their top-selling titles such as ""Overwatch"", ""Battlefield"" and ""Grand Theft Auto"" to attract new gamers and retain old ones, as they face fierce competition.
Activision, which is expected to report after the market close on Tuesday, is anticipated to post a rise in revenue as it continued to benefit from its popular title ""Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War"".
Similarly, analysts expect EA to also come out with a strong picture after its acquisitions of Codemasters, the publisher behind top racing titles like ""F1"" and ""Dirt"", and the ""Kim Kardashian: Hollywood"" creator Glu Mobile (NASDAQ:GLUU).
""Video games are as popular as ever. We don't see that changing any time soon,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analysts wrote in a note.

Sales for the first quarter rose 51%, to $198.4 million, from the year earlier, and beat the estimate of $185 million. But Chegg estimated sales for the current quarter at between $188 million and $190 million, compared to the average analyst forecast of $192 million, according to data compiled by Investing.com. Profit of 28 cents for the previous quarter also missed the estimate of 30 cents.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Thomson Reuters exceeded first quarter revenue and operating profit estimates on Tuesday, helped by gains in its three main divisions and an economic recovery, as the global news and information company predicted full-year sales growth at the high end of earlier forecasts.
Adjusted earnings per share, which excluded a gain from the sale of the  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI)' investment in Refinitiv and other adjustments, rose to 58 cents per share, well ahead of the 42 cents forecast by analysts.
That excludes a gain from the sale of a stake in data and analytics company Refinitiv to the  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSEG). Thomson Reuters holds a 15% stake in the LSE following the Refinitiv deal, which closed in January.
Thomson Reuters, which owns Reuters News, said in a statement that its overall operating profit rose by a third to $387 million during the first quarter. 
Total sales were up 4% to $1.58 billion, ahead of estimates, and Thomson Reuters said they are forecast to grow 3.5% to 4% for the full year. It said second-quarter revenue growth will be the year's high point, reflecting the improvement from the same period last year, when the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic hit.
Thomson Reuters' three main divisions, Legal Professionals, Tax & Accounting Professionals, and Corporates, showed sales gains of between 3% and 7%, it said.
Its New York and Toronto listed shares both gained more than 4% in early trading.
""We're pleased with the start of the year and our results and we're cautiously optimistic that the economies in which we operate are starting to recover and showing upside and promise for the rest of the year,"" Chief Executive Steve Hasker said in an interview after the results. 
However, he cautioned that risks remained as the coronavirus pandemic has surged in some parts of the world. 
Hasker said Thomson Reuters could announce potential takeover targets in the second half of 2021, but noted that asset prices are ""full"" at present.
The company's Reuters News segment grew sales by 2% to $160 million in the quarter, helped by its professional business.

Reuters last month unveiled a new subscription website as part of a broad initiative to court business professionals, joining many other major news organizations which already charge for their content.
Also in April, Reuters named one of its top editors, Alessandra Galloni, as its next editor-in-chief. Galloni is the first woman to lead the globe-spanning news organization in its 170-year history.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mostly lower again on Tuesday, amid fresh concerns that stocks may have advanced too far, too fast.
By 10 AM ET (1400 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 250 points, or 0.7%, while the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.9%. The S&P 500 was outperforming with a gain of 0.3%.
The market was unsettled by comments from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon at a Wall Street Journal event saying that a return of inflation is likely, given that pent-up demand will be released into the economy just as the government is ramping up spending to force the pace of recovery.
Fears about inflation have been largely quiescent for the last couple of weeks, after an effective barrage of communications from the Federal Reserve promising not to reduce monetary stimulus for some time yet. However, surging commodity prices and input prices for manufacturers are starting to force another rethink.
Michael Antonelli, a market strategist at RW Baird, said via Twitter that the market is likely “as good as it gets” right now, given fresh memories of a strong earnings season and economic data that are flattered by extraordinarily weak year-ago numbers.
“I’m not a “sell in May” guy but summer can be a choppy period for markets especially when we’re all outdoors living a Roaring 20s,” Antonelli said.  
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) stock bucked the trend, rising over 3% as it revised its profit guidance for the year substantially higher due to the expected performance of its Covid-19 vaccine, developed jointly with BioNTech. CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) also gained, as the pharmacy chain reported a strong first quarter in which demand for Covid-19 testing more than offset the effects of a 'weak' season for cold and flu medicines due to social distancing.
However, tech stocks sold off broadly, as doubts about their ability to continue growing earnings bubbled to the surface. Old-economy stocks too came under pressure - handy earnings beats weren't enough to stop  ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and Dupont (NYSE:DD) stock both falling over 1.2%.
“Longer-term expectations appear overly optimistic,” analysts at Oxford Economics said in a note to clients. “The bottom-up consensus points to an ongoing profit margin expansion over the next few years and we think this is unlikely against a backdrop of rising cost pressures and proposals for higher corporate tax rates.”"

(Reuters) - HoneyBook has raised $155 million in a late-stage funding round led by Durable Capital Partners that values it at more than $1 billion, the small business billing and management tool will announce later on Tuesday.
The Series D funding round includes investments from Tiger Global Management, Battery Ventures, Zeev Ventures, 01 Advisors as well as existing investors Norwest Venture Partners, OurCrowd and Citi Ventures, HoneyBook said in a statement seen by Reuters.
Founded in 2013, HoneyBook combines tools such as invoices, contracts and project management features, helping entrepreneurs and freelancers streamline and scale their business with less legwork.
The company saw an uptick in demand last year as sweeping corporate layoffs driven by the COVID-19 pandemic led to a surge in people launching their own businesses. 
The health crisis has triggered small businesses to quickly adopt online tools to support growth, helping HoneyBook triple its annual recurring revenue. 
New HoneyBook subscribers more than doubled over the past year, and members booked more than $1 billion on the platform in the past nine months alone, HoneyBook said. 
""Clients now expect streamlined communication, seamless payments and the same level of exceptional service online that they were used to receiving from business owners in person,"" Chief Executive Officer Oz Alon said.

(Reuters) -Industrial materials maker DuPont (NYSE:DD) raised its full-year profit and revenue forecasts and breezed past first-quarter expectations on Tuesday, boosted by demand from chip companies as well as a recovery in automobile markets. 
The company, which makes everything from brake fluid to fabric for protective garments, is benefiting from a recovery in demand from a COVID-19 pandemic-led slump and costs cuts it implemented last year to cope with the fallout of the health crisis.
DuPont, once part of the erstwhile chemical giant DowDuPont, now expects net sales between $15.70 billion and $15.90 billion and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3.60 to $3.75 for the year ended December 2021. 
It had previously forecast sales between $15.40 billion and $15.60 billion on earnings of $3.30 to $3.45 per share.
Still, the company warned of a $300 million hit in the year from escalating raw material, logistics costs and supply constraints of key raw materials.
It said the impact from the costs was only about $20 million in the first quarter, but expects them to rise to about $90 million in the second and to carry through the next couple of quarters.
DuPont said it hopes to offset the hit by raising prices in the low single digits for the year.

The company has been tweaking its portfolio; it has separated its Nutrition & Biosciences business, agreed to divest two other businesses, and struck a deal to buy Laird Performance Materials for $2.3 billion to expand in advanced electronic materials used in smart and autonomous vehicles among others.
Adjusted earnings per share of 91 cents for the first quarter beat estimates of 76 cents, while sales of $4 billion surpassed the $3.85 billion estimated by analysts, according to Refinitiv IBES.

PARIS/LONDON (Reuters) -Diplomatic moves to ease transatlantic air travel could unleash fierce competition to entice passengers back into near-empty cabins at a time when tottering airlines can ill afford a price war in the world's richest aviation market.
Talks between Brussels and Washington on resuming mass travel for vaccinated tourists have raised hopes of a summer rebound - further buoyed by new EU reopening proposals.
Airlines are desperate for good news after a year of COVID-19 lockdowns that pushed many to the brink of collapse, or into the arms of governments.
The United States will reopen to Europeans in ""a matter of the next two or three weeks"", Lufthansa Chief Executive Carsten Spohr predicted last week.
But the German airline boss also cautioned against any race to the bottom on fares.
""The North Atlantic is historically the most disciplined traffic region,"" Spohr told investors. ""I expect this discipline (to) prevail.""
United Airlines, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) have added summer routes to countries like Iceland and Greece that plan to welcome vaccinated travellers. 
Consumers are showing some interest.
Air France-KLM said U.S. sales twitched back to life last month after French President Emmanuel Macron announced restrictions may be eased for vaccinated Americans - and again when the EU confirmed talks with Washington.
Air France is adding a Paris-Denver service, in what network chief Olivier Piette described as a ""big bet"" on a secondary U.S. leisure route with less direct competition.
The Franco-Dutch group is partnered with Delta and Virgin Atlantic in one of three transatlantic joint-ventures that allow extensive commercial cooperation. Lufthansa is paired with United, and British Airways with American.
Virgin is expecting a scrap, Chief Executive Shai Weiss said recently. ""I'm sure there's going to be tremendous competition and we'll rise to it.""
But airlines bled dry by the crisis will resist aggressive discounting, predicts analyst John Grant of data specialist OAG.
""The bean counters will be keeping a close eye on that,"" he said. ""Investors will also want to see airlines behaving responsibly in the recovery.""
DISNEY AND A DOSE OF REALITY
Airlines currently plan about 65% of pre-crisis transatlantic capacity in the third quarter, according to OAG - but many flights could end up cancelled.
Mid-sized Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787s and Airbus A350s will be summer favourites, OAG expects, thanks to fuel efficiency and freight capacity. Grounded 747s and A380 superjumbos are unlikely to return so soon. 
Summer bookings are just a fifth of their level at the same point in 2019, separate ForwardKeys data show. 
Greece, which has been promising unfettered access for visitors with vaccines or negative tests, is so far the standout destination for U.S. tourists with sales at 74% of pre-crisis levels.
For Britons, Disney World remains a draw, with Orlando, Florida bookings down 52%, a relatively strong showing.
Airline network managers have suffered repeated false starts, with a shift to last-minute booking further obscuring recovery prospects.
American Airlines revenue chief Vasu Raja offered a ""dose of reality"" on summer traffic to Europe. ""A lot of the customers that would have gone there have already booked trips to Hawaii or Florida anyway,"" he told investors.
European carriers such as Virgin and British Airways have more at stake in the North Atlantic than U.S. peers cushioned by a rebounding domestic market. Hopes are high for a return to quarantine-free travel between Britain and the United States.
European airline shares rose on the latest EU reopening steps, with British Airways parent IAG (LON:ICAG) up 2.5% on Tuesday as London trading resumed after a public holiday. 
Geoffrey Weston, a consultant with Bain & Co., expects airlines to rein in revenue management software that typically sets fares to fill planes.
""In recovering markets there's more human intervention and control over pricing,"" Weston said, adding that Norwegian Air's transatlantic exit had also eased pressure.
Soaring cargo rates have allowed airlines to keep routes open with low passenger occupancy and may limit the competitive drive to slash fares as demand picks up.
Air France is serving 11 U.S. cities - increasing to 12 with Denver - with A350s, 787s and first class-equipped 777s whose freight loads largely cover the costs of running the flight.

""It's thanks to cargo that we've been able to maintain our long-haul programme,"" said Piette.
""It's a good fit with current consumer behaviour.""

1337,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2021 08:36AM ET</span>","Saudi Aramco beats quarterly profit forecast, maintains dividend","By Hadeel Al Sayegh, Saeed Azhar and Alexander Cornwell
DUBAI (Reuters) -State-run oil producer  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) beat analysts' forecasts on Tuesday with a 30% rise in first-quarter net profit and maintained its dividend payout, helped by strong oil prices.
Earnings by global energy companies such as  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) have climbed on the back of rising crude prices, which are up by about a third this year, as fuel demand recovers from the pandemic and as a global surplus of crude shrinks.
""Given the positive signs for energy demand in 2021, there are more reasons to be optimistic that better days are coming,"" Amin Nasser, chief executive of the world's top oil exporter, said in a statement.
""And while some headwinds still remain, we are well-positioned to meet the world's growing energy needs as economies start to recover,"" he said.
Net income rose to $21.7 billion for the quarter to March 31 from $16.7 billion a year earlier. Aramco was expected to post net profit of $19.48 billion, according to an average of estimates by five analysts.
Aramco, which listed in 2019 with the sale of a 1.7% stake mainly to the Saudi public and regional institutions, said earnings were boosted by stronger crude prices and higher refining and chemicals margins, helping offset lower production.
The OPEC+ group, the alliance that groups the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and several other producers, have cut output to support prices but agreed on a plan in April to start gradually easing those curbs from May 1.
Aramco, which reduced its output as part of that pact and as a result of Saudi Arabia's additional voluntary production cuts, said global demand for petroleum products was recovering from its lows in 2020 but remained below pre-pandemic levels.
Aramco declared a dividend of $18.8 billion for the first quarter, to be paid in the second quarter, in line with company guidance of a $75 billion dividend for this year.
""Aramco’s dividend commitment is already pretty ambitious, particularly given the continued volatility in the market,"" said Dmitry Marinchenko, oil and gas analyst at Fitch Ratings.
Aramco would possibly prefer to keep dividends stable, particularly in light of some uncertainty around the Shareek or Partner programme by the Saudi government, he said.
The programme encourages Saudi companies including Aramco to lead private sector investments in the domestic economy.
HSBC, in an equity note to clients, said the move could restrict headroom to boost dividends in the next few years.

Aramco average total hydrocarbon production came in at 11.5 million barrels per day of oil equivalent in the first quarter of 2021. That includes 8.6 million barrels per day of crude oil.
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed has said more Aramco shares could be sold in the next year or two, including to international investors. He has said the kingdom was in talks to sell 1% to a leading global energy company.

1340,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2021 07:52AM ET</span>",Dubai optimistic visitors will return but numbers unclear,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Dubai's tourism chief on Tuesday said he was very optimistic business and leisure travellers would return this year, though the pandemic made it difficult to predict exactly how many.
Dubai, a trade and tourism hub which has kept its borders open since reopening last July, saw 1.26 million visitors in the first quarter, while last year the number of visitors fell 67% to 5.5 million. 
""We are very optimistic on the numbers for the year,"" Dubai Tourism Chief Executive Issam Kazim told reporters on Tuesday.
But he said forecasts were ""a little bit up in the air"" as some markets expected to be allowing international travel were in fact imposing restrictions.
Kazim did not identify any particular market.
The United Kingdom, a top source market, has suspended most direct flights from the United Arab Emirates while arrivals who have recently been in the Gulf state must quarantine in hotels.
Meanwhile, the UAE has largely banned entry for those who have recently visited India, another key market, due to the latest outbreak there. 
Key events, like the multi-month Expo 2020, which starts in October, would help attract visitors to Dubai, Kazim said.
Dubai was one of the first destinations to reopen to international travellers last July. That drew some international criticism after a rush of visitors in December coincided with a second wave of infections in the UAE. 

Dubai responded by limiting capacity at hotels and restaurants, though avoided repeating the toughest restrictions as infections reached a daily record.
Infections in the UAE have since eased to around 1,900 daily cases, down from a peak of 3,977 in February though still higher than December. The UAE does not provide a breakdown of infections in each emirate.

1341,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2021 07:42AM ET</span>",Analysis: Buffett's ESG snub risks alienating Wall Street,"By Ross Kerber, Jessica DiNapoli and Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc shareholders can accept Chairman Warren Buffett's hostility to bitcoin, blank-check acquisition firms and wild bets on trading app Robinhood. But when it comes to environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) standards, many are drawing a line.
Buffett and his board opposed two shareholder resolutions at Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting last week that called for annual reports on how its companies are responding to the challenge of climate change, as well as reports on diversity and inclusion in the workplace.
He prevailed, supported by directors who along with him control a combined 35% of Berkshire Hathaway's voting power. But some of his top investors, including BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), the world's biggest asset manager, were part of the roughly 25% of Berkshire Hathaway shareholders who defied him and voted for each resolution. The California Public Employees' Retirement System, the largest U.S. public pension fund, and Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI) Inc, the $625 billion asset manager based in Pittsburgh, were among sponsors of the climate-change resolution.
It is a steadily growing trend. Environment-related proposals at Berkshire Hathaway's 2018 annual meeting drew no more than 12% support from shareholders, as did a resolution on diversity last year.
As more Wall Street funds manage assets with a mandate to consider ESG causes, some corporate governance experts say pressure on Buffett will increase in the coming years.
""Even an investor of Buffett's renown may not be immune to such larger market trends,"" said Ric Marshall, executive director for ESG Research at MSCI Inc.
Berkshire Hathaway and Buffett did not respond on Monday to requests for comment. 
In opposing the shareholder proposals, Berkshire Hathaway's board argued that the Omaha, Nebraska-based company's decentralized business model made it unreasonable to have one-size-fits-all standards for its operating units on climate change and diversity.
Buffett, one of the world's biggest philanthropists, told investors during Saturday's shareholder meeting that requiring ESG reports from all the subsidiaries would be ""asinine,"" because many of them are small and Berkshire Hathaway allows them to run independently.
He also said he does not like making ""moral judgments"" on businesses, and it is ""very tough"" to decide which ones benefit society. 
Berkshire Hathaway is hardly alone. Other major companies, including  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), have resisted ESG shareholder proposals, calling them impractical or inferior to their own.
Whistle Stop Capital CEO Meredith (NYSE:MDP) Benton, a consultant to shareholder group As You Sow, which filed the Berkshire Hathaway diversity proposal, said Berkshire Hathaway stood out in demonstrating little initiative on the ESG front and Buffett showed a ""lack of leadership.""
""Even Buffett can't ignore what his investors are asking for,"" Benton said. 
DISCLOSURES, NOT HOPE
In a note on its website, BlackRock criticized Berkshire Hathaway for not adequately showing how its business model would be ""compatible with a low-carbon economy"" and not disclosing information to help investors assess its diversity efforts. 
Federated Hermes' Tim Youmans, one of the firm's engagement leaders, said Berkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman Greg Abel, who Buffett said this week would become chief executive if he were to step down, seemed more focused on climate change at the shareholder meeting than his boss.
Abel said at the shareholder meeting that all of Berkshire's coal-fired power plants would be shut by 2049 and that its utility businesses had already made a big transition to renewable energy. 
Youmans said this gave him hope the company would be more responsive on ESG questions, but added, ""We're looking for disclosures and targets as opposed to hope.""
Shareholder proposals on environmental and social issues at S&P 1500 companies averaged 28% support in 2020, up from 20% in 2017, according to proxy solicitor Georgeson.
Activists hope to do even better in 2021 after the United States rejoined the Paris climate agreement and the Black Lives Matter movement drew wide support. 

Dupont shareholders overwhelmingly backed proposals last week calling for the disclosure of workforce diversity data and a report on plastic pollution.
The 81% of votes cast for the latter was a U.S. record for an environmental proposal opposed by management, according to Heidi Welsh, executive director of the Sustainable Investments Institute.

1342,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2021 07:41AM ET</span>","Driver shortage, looming regulation cloud Uber, Lyft recovery","By Tina Bellon and Akanksha Rana
(Reuters) - As U.S. customers gradually hail more rides after a year of pandemic restrictions, Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc's and  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT)'s recovery story is clouded by driver shortages and regulatory threats to have workers reclassified as employees.
U.S. President Joe Biden campaigned on the promise of delivering benefits to gig workers and U.S. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh last week intensified the debate, telling Reuters in an interview that ""a lot of gig workers should be classified as employees.""
Shares in Uber and Lyft dropped as much as 8% and 12% respectively following Walsh's comments, with the companies' business dependent on low-cost flexible labor. 
While a reclassification of independent contract workers is not foreseen quickly and some analysts expect a compromise between regulators and the companies, the threat poses a risk to Uber's and Lyft's growth and bottom line. 
Wall Street is expecting the companies to show continued rider and revenue growth compared to the last quarters when Lyft and Uber report first-quarter results on Tuesday and Wednesday after the bell, respectively.
Investors on average expect Lyft to post nearly $560 million and Uber around $3.3 billion in revenue during the first three months of 2021, according to Refinitiv data. 
In adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, Lyft is expected to report a $144 million loss and Uber a roughly $450 million loss. 
Lyft has told investors it will be profitable on that metric by the end of the third quarter, Uber sees itself reaching it by the end of the fourth quarter as the recovery progresses.
Lyft said in mid-March it expects positive weekly year-over-year rider growth for the first time since the pandemic, while Uber said March marked the highest amount of ride-hail and food delivery gross bookings in the company's history.
But the companies are struggling to serve the uptick in trip demand, with many U.S. drivers still unwilling to return to the road over safety and financial concerns, meaning the companies risk disgruntled customers or higher costs to incentivize drivers to return.

""(It's) a better problem to have, but one that could put wrinkles in profitability timelines it if persists,"" analysts at Bernstein wrote in a note. 
Uber has said it would invest an additional $250 million to boost driver earnings and offer payment guarantees, but some analysts say the companies might have to provide further financial commitments if the supply crunch persists.

1343,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2021 07:41AM ET</span>","Explainer-Ahead of Trump Facebook ruling, here’s how social media sites handle world leaders","By Elizabeth Culliford
(Reuters) - Facebook's independent oversight board on Wednesday will announce whether it is overturning the company's suspension of former U.S. President Donald Trump's account. The long-awaited ruling will bring the focus back onto how the world's largest social network decides what world leaders and politicians can and can't say on their platforms. 
Here is how big tech companies deal with this thorny issue:
WHO GETS SPECIAL TREATMENT?
 Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) currently have rules that give world leaders, elected officials and political candidates greater latitude than ordinary users. 
Facebook defines politicians as candidates running for office, current office holders and many cabinet appointees, along with political parties and their leaders. Twitter's public interest rules https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/public-interest apply to verified government or elected officials, their appointed successors and candidates, registered political parties or nominees for public office that have more than 100,000 followers. 
WHAT ARE THE CURRENT RULES?
Twitter says it errs on the side of leaving content up when it is in the public interest, including keeping a record to hold leaders accountable. It also allows leaders to interact with other public figures and engage in ""foreign policy saber-rattling."" 
In March, Twitter began adding warnings to and restricting the reach of some world leaders' tweets that would be removed if sent by the average user. Twitter also says it pulls world leaders' tweets down for offenses like promoting terrorism or posting private information.
Facebook exempts politicians' posts and paid ads from its third-party fact-checking program, though it did start affixing some separate labels, for example, notices about voter fraud rarity on some of Trump's posts around the election.
The company's ""newsworthiness exemption"" also allows politicians' rule-breaking posts on the site if the public interest outweighs the harm. (https:// Facebook, which had occasionally removed Trump's content for violations like COVID-19 misinformation before he was banned, faced employee backlash for its inaction on inflammatory posts including one during anti-racism protests that said ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's YouTube says it does not have different rules for world leaders, though its exception for ""educational"" or ""documentary"" content does allow certain news coverage of politicians making rule-breaking statements. SO WHAT HAPPENED WITH TRUMP? After the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, Twitter banned Trump for breaking its ""glorification of violence"" rules, departing somewhat from precedent to take possible interpretations of his tweets into account. Facebook blocked Trump's accounts on its platforms indefinitely. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the current context meant the risks of allowing him to use the service were ""simply too great."" A slew of online platforms barred the former president, including Snapchat, which had already removed him from its Discover program, and Amazon-owned Twitch, which had previously suspended him for hateful content in June.  YouTube also gave Trump's channel its first-ever strike following the riot. This would normally come with a week-long suspension but the account remains frozen months later. YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki said the suspension will be lifted when the company determines the risk of real-world violence has decreased. WHAT ABOUT OTHER GLOBAL LEADERS?  Human rights groups have argued that the tech firms need to apply standards consistently to other global leaders. Facebook's suspension of Trump followed bans in recent years of some government officials, including in India and Myanmar for promoting violence, but the company had never before blocked a current president, prime minister or head of state. Leaders who have drawn particular public scrutiny but remain active on social media sites include Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has used Twitter to call for Israel's elimination and Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro, who has posted on Facebook that indigenous citizens were ""evolving"" and becoming more human. (https://reut.rs/3gWRnW1) In March, Facebook put a 30-day freeze on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's page for spreading COVID-19 misinformation. Both Maduro and Bolsonaro have previously had content removed by Facebook and Twitter for this reason during the pandemic. Earlier this year, Facebook banned the Myanmar military from the site after they took power in a coup. U.N. human rights investigators have previously said the platform played a key role in fomenting violence in Myanmar. WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW? 
Both Facebook and Twitter have called for input on their rules after facing intense scrutiny over their handling of U.S. presidential election and the storming of the Capitol by pro-Trump supporters.  Facebook has asked its oversight board to give recommendations along with the Trump decision, while Twitter opened a public survey.

At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 10 points, less than 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 4 points, or 0.1%, lower, and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 42 points, or 0.3%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended up 0.7% on Monday, the S&P 500 was up 0.3% on the first trading day of the month, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.4%, as signs of a faster reopening of the economy pushed cyclical corners of the market, including energy and materials, higher.

The DJIA and S&P 500 indices are up over 11% this calendar year, helped not only by the economic reopening but also by vast sums of fiscal and monetary stimulus, vaccine optimism and accelerating earnings. More evidence of the improved corporate outlook is expected this week, with another 130 companies prepared to release quarterly results.
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), with BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) the maker of the first Covid-19 vaccine built on mRNA technology, reported earnings before the opening bell, and raised its guidance for the current year's earnings and revenue by some 15% to reflect both the eager takeup of its drug and an improvement in its non-vaccine business.

1348,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2021 06:56AM ET</span>",French banks told to speed up response to climate change,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - French banks and insurers should speed up their response to climate change, France's banking regulator said on Tuesday, after publishing what it called the world's first climate-related stress test of banks.
Other financial watchdogs around the world will also be conducting similar tests on the finance industry to help to reduce the impact of climate change on economies. Banks and other finance companies will have to disclose to investors the impact of climate change on their balance sheets under proposed European Union rules.
The ACPR, the banking supervisory arm of the Bank of France, conducted a voluntary pilot test on nine banks and 15 insurers - accounting for nearly all their respective sectors - to measure resilience to common ""scenarios"" like a slow response to climate change.
It covered a 30-year period from 2020 to 2050, looking at risks from ""transitioning"" or moving from polluting to more climate-friendly assets and from physical risks like fires and floods.
The watchdog found that the companies' exposures to transition risks were ""rather moderate"", but the expected increase in claims and premiums for some insurance risks was particularly noticeable.
There are also uncertainties over how fast climate change will unfold and data gaps, the watchdog said.
""In the light of these results, banking institutions and insurers now need to step up their efforts to combat climate change by integrating the risks associated with climate change into their financial risk assessment process,"" Bank of France First Deputy Governor Denis Beau told reporters.
The results will have no impact on how much capital the financial firms must currently hold, and there will be no specific, follow up actions.
""The aim of the exercise was.. to stimulate thought, analysis and promote a better integration of climate risks into risk management at firms,"" Beau said.
The French Banking Federation, an industry body, said the results showed the resilience of French banks, with relatively modest exposures to sectors like mining, oil and agriculture.
The Bank of France is host to the secretariat for the Network for Greening the Financial System, a group of central banks creating best practice in regulating banking risks from climate change.

The ACPR said its pilot would help to inform the Bank of England's own climate stress test in June, and a test the European Central Bank will conduct in 2022.
The ACPR's own test will become a regular event, with the next one scheduled for 2023/2024.

Emirates, the world's biggest long-haul airline before the pandemic, has been gradually rebuilding its network of 157 passenger destinations since flights were grounded in March 2020. 
It is currently operating to around 120 destinations, though capacity remains limited due to the continued grounding of most of the airline's 118 Airbus A380 superjumbos.
“We already have a plan to get back to almost 70% of our capacity to be recovered by winter 2021,” Emirates Chief Commercial Officer Adnan Kazim told reporters on Tuesday.
He did not disclose its current operating capacity, although he added that the airline had a way to go to reach 70%. 
Emirates has mainly been operating flights with its 151 Boeing (NYSE:BA) 777s though with passenger demand still at very low levels globally those planes have mostly carried cargo.

Kazim said the airline expects to operate around 30 to 40 Airbus A380s over the summer, more than what it is currently operating. 
The restoration of capacity largely depends on countries easing coronavirus restrictions and whether they permit international travel. Dubai's Emirates does not have a domestic market that can cushion against international border closures.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co said on Tuesday it will launch its premium brand Genesis in Europe this summer, debuting its flagship sedan and sports utility vehicle (SUV) in one of the world's fastest growing electric vehicle markets.
Genesis, which launched as Hyundai's standalone luxury division in 2015 to compete with premium brands like BMW, Mercedes and Lexus, said it will sell both conventional and electric models in the region.
""The Electrified G80 will be the first all-electric Genesis to arrive in Europe. A further two battery electric cars will follow, providing European customers with a choice of three Genesis zero-emission cars within the first year,"" Genesis Motor Europe said in a statement. 
The unit said orders will open for the Genesis G80 sedan and the Genesis GV80 SUV in June, with the new G70 sedan and GV70 SUV following soon after.
""While Genesis cars are now at a level right below Lexus cars in the U.S. market, it would take some time for them to stand out in Europe as a luxury brand, considering competition among prominent European brands,"" said Lee Seung-hwan, an analyst at Daishin Securities. 
Lee said however the Genesis brand has room to grow in the European market as they could offer more cost-competitive EVs than other European carmakers. 
Sales of electric and plug-in hybrid cars in the European Union almost trebled to over 1 million vehicles last year, accounting for more than 10% of overall sales, data from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) showed.

As carmakers began rolling out new EVs to meet environment regulations, Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY), Europe’s biggest automaker, unveiled its ID.3 and ID.4 models, while premium brands such as BMW, Mercedes and Audi launched high-end versions. 
In the first quarter, sales of Genesis cars jumped 165% in South Korea and more than doubled from a year earlier in the United States, according to Hyundai sales data. The brand launched last month in China.

LONDON (Reuters) -Bank of America has snapped up Emmanuel Regniez from  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) to co-head its investment banking franchise for France as it seeks to strengthen its network of European hubs after Brexit, according to a memo seen by Reuters.
Regniez will share the investment banking leadership for France with Jerome Morisseau and will work closely with Stephane Courbon and Laurent Vieillevigne - respectively chairman of the bank's corporate and investment banking division for France and vice chairman of investment banking for France.
Regniez has 26 years of investment banking experience having worked for Nomura and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and most recently Citi, where he ran investment banking and sponsor coverage for France. 

His move comes as Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is building out its senior team in France to expand its client base in Europe's second biggest M&A market, according to Refinitiv's first quarter data.

1357,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2021 06:10AM ET</span>",Chipmaker TSMC eyeing expansion of planned Arizona plant: sources,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) is planning to build several more chipmaking factories in the U.S. state of Arizona beyond the one currently planned, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, announced in May 2020 it would build a $12 billion factory in Arizona, an apparent win by the Trump administration in its push to wrestle global tech supply chains back from China. 
TSMC is setting up a 12-inch wafer fabrication plant in Phoenix, and the facility is expected to start volume production in 2024, Taiwan's investment commission of the ministry of economic affairs, which approved the investment, said in December. 
TSMC manufactures the bulk of its chips in Taiwan and has older chip facilities in China and the U.S. state of Washington. 
Three sources familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media, told Reuters that up to five additional fabs for Arizona are being planned. 
The initial fab is relatively modest by industry standards, with a planned output of 20,000 wafers - each of which contains thousands of chips - every month using the company's most sophisticated 5 nanometre semiconductor manufacturing technology. 
It is not clear how much additional production capacity and investment the additional fabs might represent, and which chip manufacturing technology they would use.
TSMC last month said it planned to invest $100 billion over the next three years to increase production capacity, though it did not give details. 
One person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters the expansion was in response to a request from the U.S., but declined to provide further details.
""The United States requested it. Internally TSMC is planning to build up to six fabs,"" the person said, adding that it was not possible to give a timeframe. 
The Biden administration is preparing to spend tens of billions of dollars to support domestic chip manufacturing. Under existing legislation, foreign firms are eligible for those funds, but whether they will ultimately receive it is an open question. 
A second person familiar with the plans said the company had already made sure there was enough space for expansion when they obtained the land for the first plant. 
""It's so they can build six fabs,"" the source said. 
The third person, from a TSMC supplier involved in the Arizona project, said TSMC had told them the plan was to build a total of six fabs over the next three years.
Reuters was not able to independently confirm the timeframe. 
TSMC referred to comments by CEO C.C. Wei on an earnings call last month, saying the company was starting chip production in Arizona in 2024 with a 20,000 wafer per month 5-nanometer technology. 

""But in fact, we have acquired a large piece of land in Arizona to provide flexibility. So further expansion is possible, but we will ramp up to Phase 1 first, then based on the operation efficiency and cost economics and also the customers' demand, to decide what the next steps we are going to do.""Asked whether the planned expansion was because of a request from the United States, TSMC said it was ""not sure"" what was meant by ""requests"" coming from the U.S. side and that it will decide next steps based on operational efficiency, cost economics and customer demand.
""Once there is any official decision, we will disclose it accordingly.""

1359,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2021 05:46AM ET</span>",Infineon points finger at contract partners over chip shortages,"By Douglas Busvine
BERLIN (Reuters) -German chipmaker Infineon (OTC:IFNNY) on Tuesday highlighted a lack of investment in new capacity by its manufacturing partners for tightness in semiconductor markets, saying it had invested to expand its own capacity to match market growth.
A snapback in demand for everything from smartphones to cars, following a slump caused by the coronavirus pandemic, has disrupted chip supply chains especially in the car industry.
Infineon said there have been bottlenecks in areas where it relies on contract manufacturers, known as foundries, such as TSMC, especially automotive microcontrollers and products used in the industrial internet.
""Foundries have not invested enough to keep up with the situation,"" Chief Executive Reinhard Ploss told analysts after Infineon raised its forecast for sales and profit margins for its fiscal year to Sept. 30.
Despite the upbeat outlook, Infineon shares declined by more than 4% in Frankfurt after a winter storm, which knocked out its own plant in Austin, Texas, exerted pressure on profit margins in the company's fiscal second quarter to March 31.
The Munich-based chipmaker expects supply constraints in its core automotive business - which accounts for 45% of revenues - to ease in the second half of this year, with lost volumes only likely to be made up in 2022.
Contract chip makers have invested chiefly in production of higher-margin processors used in devices like smartphones, leaving existing plants unable to meet demand for the older chips used in cars.
Scarcity was being felt above all in older 20- to 90-nanometre chips, where only now are foundries recognising that investing in new production is an economically viable proposition, said Chief Operating Officer Jochen Hanebeck.
""Foundries are investing now but the lead times to get this new capacity on board will be into 2023,"" he said.
FORECASTS RAISED
Infineon raised guidance for revenue in the current fiscal year to Sept. 30 to a midpoint of 11 billion euros ($13.2 billion) from 10.8 billion. It now expects a profit margin of 18%, up from an earlier view of 17.8%.
Second quarter revenue of 2.7 billion euros, up by 36% from the same period a year earlier, edged a consensus forecast of 2.69 billion euros in a poll of analysts published by the company.
Segment result margin, management's preferred measure of operating profitability, came in at 17.4% in the quarter - ahead of a consensus view of 16.9% in a poll by Vara Research.
The weeks-long outage at its Austin plant - hit by a triple loss of power, gas and diesel due to the winter storm - knocked an estimated 1 percentage point off margins for the latest quarter.

Production in Austin is not expected to return to pre-storm levels until June, Ploss said, adding that it would not be possible to make up overall for lost production.

OSLO (Reuters) -Norway's Telenor wrote off the value of its Myanmar operation in light of the country's deteriorating security and human rights situation, plunging the group into a first-quarter loss and sending its shares lower on Tuesday.
While it will continue to operate in Myanmar, Telenor's mobile business in the Asian country, where it has had a presence since 2014, remains severely restricted following the military's seizing of power in a Feb. 1 coup.
The new regime imposed network restrictions for all operators, and on March 15 ordered a nationwide shutdown of mobile data that has since cut Telenor's subscription and traffic revenues in the country in half, the company said.
However, it still added some 2 million users in Myanmar during the quarter as call volumes rose, increasing its local customer base to 18.2 million.
""Telenor calls on the authorities to immediately reinstate unimpeded communications and respect the rights to freedom of expression and human rights,"" the company said in a statement.
While Telenor saw an ""irregular, uncertain, and deeply concerning situation"" with ""limited prospects of improvement going forward"", Telenor would stay in Myanmar for now, CEO Sigve Brekke said. 
""We still believe we are making a difference when keeping our operations running,"" he told an earnings presentation. ""We strive to continue to do so to the best of our ability.""
The company declined to comment on whether it was realistic to expect any cash flow from the Myanmar operation for the time being, with Brekke adding that the current uncertainty made it impossible to comment on future options. 
""Our continued presence will depend on the development in the country and the ability to contribute positively to the people of Myanmar,"" he said.
WRITE-OFF
Telenor fully impaired Telenor Myanmar in its first-quarter accounts, booking a loss of 6.5 billion crowns ($783 million) and removing the operation from its overall corporate outlook for 2021.
As a result of the writedown, the Telenor group's net earnings slumped to a loss of 3.9 billion Norwegian crowns in the first quarter from a year-ago profit of 698 million crowns.
Telenor shares were down 2.0% at 0913 GMT, lagging a flat Oslo benchmark index.
Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) fell 8% year-on-year to 13 billion crowns, in line with an analyst forecast of 13.1 billion crowns.
Telenor reiterated full-year guidance for overall organic revenue and earnings to remain unchanged year-on-year from 2020, excluding the Myanmar impact. It repeated that capital expenditure would amount to between 15% and 16% of sales.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), which holds a neutral rating on the stock, said the guidance technically amounted to a downgrade due to the exclusion of Myanmar, which represented 6% of group revenue and 7% of EBITDA last year.
""The Asian operations otherwise delivered a decent performance in Thailand and Malaysia offset by Myanmar and there was some weakness in the Nordics as the competitive environment remains tough in markets like Sweden and Norway,"" the bank said.

The company, which serves 187 million customers in nine countries across Europe and Asia, a net gain of 5 million since the start of the year, last month announced plans to merge its Malaysian unit with competitor Axiata, seeking to form a new market leader..

Many European countries saw corporate bankruptcies fall to historic lows last year as governments put in place a range of measures to help them survive the coronavirus crisis and the lockdowns that left many businesses shuttered for months.
However, fears are rising that there will be a surge in insolvencies once the measures are rolled back and the European Systemic Risk Board, the EU's top economic watchdog, even warned of a ""tsunami"" of business bankruptcies.
""Is there a risk of going beyond catching-up with an increase beyond the 2020 bankruptcy 'deficit'? Nothing can be excluded, but nothing allows it to be anticipated today,"" Villeroy said.
Though bankruptcies in France were rising this year from 2020's lows, they remained significantly lower than in 2019, Villeroy told an online European Investment Bank conference.
He said the central bank's monthly business climate survey showed cash levels were above long term averages in industry and heading that way in services, with the exception of sectors hardest hit by COVID restrictions like hotels and restaurants.

Meanwhile, public authorities that mediate between overstretched borrowers and their lenders were not seeing particularly high activity, Villeroy said.
With firms concerned state support could be withdrawn too quickly, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Monday that the government would ease access in June to state grants to help them get back on their feet as they gradually emerge from coronavirus restrictions.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -Drugstore company Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) said on Tuesday that it will partner with DoorDash Inc, Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc and others to launch same-day delivery - in under two hours - for retail products in the United States.
Rivals, including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and CVS Health (NYSE:CVS), have since the start of the pandemic doubled-down on getting products to doorsteps within hours as shoppers become increasingly accustomed to quick-turn delivery. Walmart in February said it is raising wages for stocking and digital workers, who fulfill local online and curbside pick-up orders.
Walgreens same-day purchases made online or via its app will be packaged by store workers and then picked up by delivery drivers. There will be no minimum order amount and customers in most markets will pay a delivery fee of $7.99 that will go to Walgreens.
""Our goal is really to get it as low for the customer as possible. Over the next couple of months we will obviously be refining the price point and strategy behind that based on what we see,"" Walgreens' vice president of digital commerce, Stefanie Kruse, said in an interview.
Kruse declined to provide financial details about the company's contracts with DoorDash, Uber and other delivery firms, but said they had been chosen because they have the geographic reach to meet the needs of Walgreens' more than 9,000 stores.

Tipping and motivating drivers has been a major sticking point for many retailers trying to ramp up same-day delivery operations and Kruse said Walgreens this summer plans to start encouraging customers to tip upfront on its app. Some drivers avoid taking delivery orders for retailers whose customers are unlikely to tip.
Last year, Walgreens began letting shoppers pick up retail products in-store, on curbsides and via drive-thru.

Turkish Airlines (IS:THYAO) became one of the first major carriers to post a profit this year after a boost in freight revenues helped it ride out a continuing passenger slump triggered by the coronavirus crisis.
The Istanbul-based company said it posted first-quarter net income of $61 million, or 438 million liras, even as sales declined, reversing a year-earlier loss and beating analyst estimates.
The carrier tapped into demand for cargo space that has been in short supply during the pandemic with fewer flights eliminating capacity in the holds of passenger aircraft. Foreign-exchange and tax gains also buoyed earnings, while operating expenses for everything from pilot wages to fuel were reduced.
“The increased focus on cargo operations during the pandemic paid off,” said Burak Isyar, head of research at ICBC Turkey Securities.
Turkish Airlines reported a year-earlier loss of $327 million in what’s always a tough period for airlines. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had predicted a loss of $6.4 million.

MILAN (Reuters) -Mediaset rallied on Tuesday after it agreed a consensual break-up with its second-largest investor Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) , putting an end to years of legal sparring and enabling the Italy's top commercial broadcaster to pursue its expansion abroad.
Mediaset (OTC:MDIUY) shares jumped almost 6%, to levels last reached in September 2019, and were up 3% by 0811 GMT.
Controlled by billionaires Silvio Berlusconi and Vincent Bollore, respectively, Mediaset and Vivendi have been at odds since 2016, when the French media giant built a 29% stake in the Milan-listed group following a collapsed pay-TV deal.
After a recent string of victories scored by Vivendi in court, the parties on Monday agreed a scheme under which the French company will drastically cut its stake in Mediaset.
Vivendi will sell on the market over a period of five years the two-thirds of its 28.8% stake in Mediaset which it had been forced to place into a trust.
Fininvest, the Berlusconi family's holding company, which already owns 44% of Mediaset, will buy another 5% from Vivendi at a price of 2.7 euros a share, a touch above Monday's market close. 
Vivendi spent some 1.3 billion euros in 2016 to built its Mediaset stake, paying 3.7 euros a share.
The accord also commits Mediaset to paying an extraordinary dividend of 0.30 euro a share in July, while ensuring Vivendi's backing of Mediaset's plan to move its legal base to the Netherlands as part of a wider strategy to seek tie-ups with European peers. 
""The agreement is positive because it allows Mediaset to get the transfer of its headquarters to the Netherlands and to go ahead with the project to create a European free-to-air TV operator,"" broker Equita wrote in a note.
Mediaset, which controls Spanish broadcaster Mediaset Espana, has built a potential 23.5% stake in German media group ProSiebenSat.1 as part of its European expansion plan.

It is also among the contenders for Bertelsmann's controlling stake in France's M6.
Equita said it expects Mediaset will target ""an aggregation with Mediaset Espana and therefore with ProSieben"".

Investing.com - European stock markets traded largely higher Tuesday, helped by optimism that the region is finally turning the corner as its economies reopen.
At 3:50 AM ET (0850 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.4% lower, while the CAC 40 in France rose 0.1% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.6%, after a holiday-extended weekend.
Confidence is growing throughout Europe over its recovery from the pandemic as the rate of vaccination in EU member states rises quickly. On Monday, the European Commission put forward a plan to reopen the continent to holidaymakers from countries with low Covid infection rates, such as the U.K., and to anyone who has been fully vaccinated, by the start of June.
There is a similar note of optimism in the U.S., with many states continuing to relax pandemic restrictions amid the vaccine rollout.

OSLO (Reuters) - Norway's Telenor said on Tuesday it had written off the value of its Myanmar operation in light of the country's deteriorating security and human rights situation, plunging the group into a first-quarter loss.
While it will continue to operate in Myanmar, Telenor's mobile business in the Asian country, where it has had a presence since 2014, remains severely restricted following the military's seizing of power in a Feb. 1 coup.
The company added some 2 million users in Myanmar during the quarter, increasing its local customer base to 18.2 million. 
But the new regime imposed network restrictions for all operators, and on March 15 ordered a nationwide shutdown of mobile data that has since cut Telenor's subscription and traffic revenues in the country in half, the company said.
""We see an irregular, uncertain, and deeply concerning situation,"" Telenor Chief Executive Sigve Brekke said in a statement commenting on Myanmar.
""Due to the worsening of the economic and business environment outlook and a deteriorating security and human rights situation, we see limited prospects of improvement going forward.""
Telenor fully impaired Telenor Myanmar in its first-quarter accounts, booking a loss of 6.5 billion Norwegian crowns ($783 million) and removing the operation from its overall corporate outlook for 2021.
The company aims to focus on the security of its employees as well as access to services for customers and continued transparency, Brekke said.
As a result of the writedown, the Telenor group's net earnings slumped to a loss of 3.9 billion Norwegian crowns in the first quarter from a year-ago profit of 698 million crowns.
Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) fell 8% year-on-year to 13 billion crowns, in line with an analyst forecast of 13.1 billion crowns.
Telenor, reiterated full-year guidance for overall organic revenue and earnings to remain unchanged year-on-year from 2020. It repeated that capital expenditure would amount to between 15% and 16% of sales.
The company, which serves 187 million customers in nine countries across Europe and Asia, a net gain of 5 million since the start of the year, last month announced plans to merge its Malaysian unit with competitor Axiata, seeking to form a new market leader..

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Pandora (OTC:PANDY), the jewellery maker best know for its silver charm bracelets, will stop selling mined diamonds and focus on more affordable, sustainable, lab-grown gems, it said on Tuesday.
""Diamonds are not only forever, but for everyone,"" Pandora Chief Executive Alexander Lacik said as the Danish company launched a new collection of man-made stones.
Pandora, which made 85 million pieces of jewellery last year and sold 50,000 diamonds, said it aimed to ""transform the market for diamond jewellery with affordable, sustainably created products"".
The growing acceptance of man-made diamonds by millennials attracted to cheaper stones guaranteed not to have come from conflict zones has spurred firms such as De Beers to end its decades-old policy of shunning synthetic gems in its jewellery.
Prices of lab-grown diamonds have fallen over the past two years following the U-turn by De Beers in 2018 and are now up to 10 times cheaper than mined diamonds, according to a report by Bain & Company.
Pandora's new collection of lab-grown diamonds will be launched initially in the United Kingdom and will be available in other key markets next year, it said.
Pandora said it expected the diamond market to continue to grow, with sales of lab-grown diamonds outpacing overall growth.
Pandora's lab-grown gems will be made using a technology in which a hydrocarbon gas mixture is heated to 800 Celsius (1,472 Fahrenheit), spurring carbon atoms to be deposited on a small seed diamond, growing into a crystal layer by layer.
Pandora, which has until now sourced mined diamonds from KGK Diamonds, said it will get its lab-grown stones from suppliers in Europe and North America. Mined diamonds already in Pandora stores would still be sold, it said.

Opponents of mined diamonds say their extraction causes environmental damage and so-called blood diamonds help fund conflicts. A study commissioned by the natural diamond industry in 2019 said mined diamonds were less carbon-intensive.

1370,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2021 02:25AM ET</span>","Infineon raises revenue, margin guidance on chip boom","BERLIN (Reuters) -German chipmaker Infineon (OTC:IFNNY) raised its guidance on Tuesday for revenue and margins in the current fiscal year, saying that demand was greatly exceeding supply and it continued to invest in additional capacity.
Munich-based Infineon, the leading semiconductor supplier to the car industry, lifted its revenue forecast for the year to Sept. 30 to a midpoint of 11 billion euros ($13.2 billion) from 10.8 billion.
It now expects a profit margin of 18%, up from an earlier view of 17.8%.
""The semiconductor market is booming,"" Chief Executive Reinhard Ploss said, adding that demand greatly exceeded supply in most areas.
""Infineon's manufacturing facilities are running at full speed and we continue to invest in additional capacity.""
A snapback in demand for everything from smartphones to cars, following an slump caused by the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, has disrupted supply chains especially in the car industry.
Ploss said there were bottlenecks in those segments where Infineon relies on so-called foundries, or contract manufacturers, especially automotive microcontrollers and products used in the industrial internet.
Infineon reported second-quarter revenue of 2.7 billion euros, up 3% from the prior quarter and by 36% from the same period a year earlier and beating a consensus forecast of 2.63 billion euros in a poll of analysts published by the company.
Segment result margin, management's preferred measure of operating profitability, came in at 17.4% in the quarter - below a consensus view of 18.6% in the poll by Vara Research.

The company forecast third-quarter revenue of 2.6-2.9 billion euros, saying revenue growth would be curbed by supply constraints following a temporary shutdown at its plant in Austin, Texas, following a winter storm and capacity limitations at foundries. It saw segment margin at 18%.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening in a mixed fashion Tuesday, amid continued concerns over rising Covid-19 cases in India but also optimism as major economies around the world reopen.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.2% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.2% but the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.6%.
Monday's session on Wall Street saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average end 0.7% higher, the broad-based S&P 500 gain 0.3%, but the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.5% as technology stocks lagged sectors seen as beneficiaries of a pandemic recovery.
Trading in Asia has been thinned by holidays in both China and Japan.
Turning back to Europe, confidence is growing over the recovery from the pandemic as the rate of vaccination in EU member states rises quickly. On Monday, the European Commission put forward a plan to reopen the continent to holidaymakers from countries with low Covid infection rates, such as the U.K., and to anyone who has been fully vaccinated, by the start of June.
There is a similar note of optimism in the U.S., with many states continuing to relax pandemic restrictions amid the vaccine rollout. New York, one of the hardest hit of the U.S. states, recently announced the most mobility restrictions will soon be lifted, while 24-hour subway service will resume in New York City later this month.

The country’s second wave of Covid-19 infections shows no signs of slowing down, with the number of reported cases topping 20 million earlier Tuesday. The World Health Organization stated last week that one in every three new coronavirus cases globally is being reported in India.
The earnings season continued in Europe Tuesday.
Norwegian telecommunications company  Telenor  (OL:TEL) posted a first-quarter net loss after fully impairing the value of its Myanmar operations after a military coup in the country earlier this year, while Swiss staffing firm  Adecco  (SIX:ADEN) swung to a profit, helped by the gradual reopening of businesses.
Results are also expected from the likes of Infineon (OTC:IFNNY), Deutsche Post DHL Group (OTC:DPSGY) and Siemens Energy (DE:ENR1n).
Oil prices edged lower Tuesday, with the ever increasing number of Covid-19 cases in India, causing some concern. However, investors remain optimistic the continued economic recovery in regions such as Europe and the U.S. will boost overall fuel demand.
U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute, due later in the session, will be studied with interest.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% lower at $64.44 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.1% to $67.50. Both contracts are over 30% higher so far this year.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Asian share markets were mostly positive Tuesday as investors looked to signs of recovery from the coronavirus pandemic as major economies around the world reopen.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was just 0.13% higher in the the Asian afternoon session in trading thinned by holidays in China and Japan. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was trading 0.33% higher at 28,441.95. 
Australia's S&P/ASX200 edged up 0.44% to 7,059.4 as the Reserve Bank met expectations and kept the official cash rate target at 0.1%.
In a statement, the bank signalled the cash rate would stay ultra low until least 2024 and upgraded its growth forecast for the Australian economy from 3.5% to 4.75% over 2021.
In early futures trade, FTSE Index was pointing to a 0.3% gain at the open, Eurostoxx 50 futures were flat and S&P 500 futures indicated a 0.24% decline for the US.
The mildly positive tone in Asia was broadly in line with that on Wall Street overnight, where upbeat earnings, news of cities reopening and a dovish Federal Reserve helped offset a disappointing report on manufacturing activity.
While that combination is also causing investors to position for stocks to defy the customary 'Sell in May' adage, they have turned cautious ahead of key U.S. services data due on Wednesday and non-farm payrolls numbers on Friday.
""Dovish tones from the Fed and an extraordinary fiscal stimulus from the Biden Administration are fuelling optimism that the U.S. economy will strengthen further during 2021,"" said Stephen Koukoulas, managing director at the Canberra-based Market Economics.
""Attention is also moving the U.S. payrolls data this Friday where close to 1 million new payrolls and an unemployment rate back down towards 5.6% is set to reinforce this upbeat sentiment.""
Taiwan was an exception in the Asian region, with stocks there down by 1.7% after initially falling by up to 3.3% earlier in the day. 
The index is up about 15% for the year, which ranks it as one of the strongest performing markets in the region.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng's positive performance on Tuesday came after the index shed nearly 1000 points over the past two sessions.
""The 'Sell in May' story is taking place in Hong Kong, we are not seeing investors chasing the market,"" Jack Siu,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN)'s greater China chief investment officer said.
""For the new economy stocks, there is a lack of interest because there are concerns about what the new regulations will be and what impact that will have on those companies. Those uncertainties are putting investors on the sidelines.""
Japan and mainland China's markets remained closed on Tuesday for holidays dampening trading volumes across the region.
Monday's session on Wall Street saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average end 0.7% higher at 34,113.23 points, while the S&P 500 gained 0.27% to 4,192.66 with most of the gains concentrated in industrial and commodity shares.
The Nasdaq Composite dipped as technology stocks lagged sectors investors saw as beneficiaries of a pandemic recovery.
Energy stocks also gained on the back of higher oil prices.

Later in the Asian session, Brent crude was down 0.2% at $67.38 while U.S. light crude was off 0.31% at $64.56. Both were trading higher after a positive lead from the US overnight.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up Tuesday morning as investors digested mostly positive economic data from the region and await a central bank policy decision later in the day.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was up 0.29% by 10:48 PM ET (2:48 AM GMT) ahead of the Reserve Bank of Australia’s policy decision to be handed down later in the day. The Bank of England will also hand down its policy decision on Thursday.
Australian trade data for March was also released ahead of the decision, with the trade balance at a lower-than-expected AUD5.574 billion.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 0.38% after the city reported stronger-than-expected economic growth in the first quarter. The GDP grew 7.8% year-on-year and 5.3% month-on-month.
South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.51% even as April’s consumer price index grew a better-than-expected 2.3% year-on-year.
Japanese and Chinese markets remained closed for a holiday.
Ten-year Treasury yields dropped back to around 1.6% in response to U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s warning that the economic recovery from COVID-19 is patchy.
Powell said the U.S. economy was doing better but was ""not out of the woods yet"" at a conference of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition on Monday.
Powell added that progress in the recovery has been uneven across racial and income divides, ahead of the Fed’s release of a study on the disparate effects of COVID-19 on different demographics within the country.
New York Fed President John Williams (NYSE:WMB) also warned current conditions are “not nearly enough” for a shift in the current monetary policy. Other Fed officials, including Chicago Fed President Charles Evans and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, are also due to speak later in the week.
In the U.S., April’s Institute of Supply Management (ISM) Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index, released on Monday, was a lower-than-expected 60.7. Further data, including the U.S. trade balance and the April U.S. employment report, including non-farm payrolls, will be released later in the week.
Back in Asia, countries such as India, Thailand and Nepal continue to see surging numbers of cases, with the emergence of mutant variants of the virus also adding to the strain on healthcare systems.
But investors are seemingly more focused on accelerating vaccination rates in countries such as the U.S. and Europe, with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) set to authorize the  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE)/BioNTech SE (F:22UAy) COVID-19 shot for the 12-15 age range early in the following week.
However, some investors remained optimistic.
“The world remains almost perfect for equities,” AXA Investment Managers chief investment officer Chris Iggo said in a note.
Despite strong growth, rising earnings and rich valuations, “no-one is taking the punch-bowl away for now,” the note added."

(Reuters) - KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc has amassed about $18.5 billion for its latest flagship North America private equity fund, raising its biggest-ever fund in less than five months, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.
The fundraising wrapped up quickly by industry standards, given that many buyout funds can take a year or more to raise. It also happened with limited travel among KKR executives amid the COVID-19 pandemic, underscoring investor demand for private-equity funds that promise to outperform the booming stock market. 
KKR raised about $17 billion for KKR North America Fund XIII from investors including sovereign wealth funds, family offices and public and private pension funds, the sources said. An additional $1.5 billion has been committed to the fund by KKR and its employees, the sources added.
The fund attracted $24 billion in commitments from investors, but KKR decided to scale it back so it can deploy the capital selectively over the next few years, the sources said. The formal fundraising close is expected to come in the coming weeks, the sources added.
A KKR spokeswoman declined to comment. 
The North America fund surpasses in size KKR's 2006 Fund, which up to this point had been its biggest ever with $17.6 billion in capital. It is the first to be raised by Pete Stavros and Nate Taylor as co-heads of KKR's Americas private equity business.
KKR's prior regional funds, the $13.9 billion KKR Americas XII and the $9 billion KKR North America Fund XI, had returned 1.42 times and 2.08 times of their investors' money, respectively, as of September, according to the website of the Oregon Public Employees Retirement Fund, one of KKR's investors. 

KKR, which is led by co-founders Henry Kravis and George Roberts, had $349 billion in assets under management as of April, including the portfolio of annuities and life insurance provider Global Atlantic Financial Group Ltd.

So, we think it could be wise to buy the dip in these stocks.The technology industry has taken a backseat amid a fast-paced global macroeconomic recovery in which countries are focused on infrastructure spending and direct fiscal stimulus to boost their economies. The bullish recovery outlook for the U.S. has led to an increase in benchmark Treasury yields, which has in-part contributed to the tech sell off.
The economic recovery has incentivized investors to focus on outdoor stocks amid the proposed American Jobs plan spending. However, the tech industry is likely to regain momentum soon because most businesses are adopting cost-effective hybrid working models to maximize productivity.

In fact, despite retreating from their highs, these two stocks still look highly overvalued. So, we think they are best avoided now.On the one, hand investor optimism over the long-term prospects of the electric vehicle (EV) industry, due, among other factors, to increasing governmental initiatives worldwide to shift to zero-emission transportation systems helped most of the EV stocks rally over the past year. But on the other hand, given the industry’s solid growth potential, many production companies have shifted their focus to building EVs and efficient auto parts, causing the industry to become significantly overcrowded.
Owing to the impressive stock market performance of many EV stocks over the past year irrespective of fundamental strength, the industry has caught the eye of Reddit chatroom WallStreetBets (WSB). The Reddit forum has been trying to precipitate another Gamestop (GME)-like short squeeze. The relative overvaluation of the industry has led to potential asset bubble concerns because most companies are currently trading significantly higher than their revenue and earnings potential would imply.
Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) and NIO, Inc. (NIO), two popular EV players, are found frequently in the Reddit forum’s top 10 dashboard.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. sports apparel maker  Under Armour  Inc (NYSE:UAA) has agreed to pay $9 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charges that it misled investors about its revenue growth, the agency said on Monday.
The SEC found that Under Armour (NYSE:UA) failed to disclose to investors that it employed a sales tactic to accelerate or ""pull forward"" a total of $408 million in existing orders in the second half of 2015 after a warm winter began to hurt sales of the company's higher-priced cold weather apparel that customers had requested be shipped in future quarters.
Maryland-based Under Armour did not admit to or deny the SEC's charges, the regulator said in its order.
""This settlement relates to the company's disclosures and does not include any allegations from the SEC that sales during these periods did not comply with generally accepted accounting principles,"" Under Amour said in a statement.
For six consecutive quarters beginning in the third quarter of 2015, the SEC found that Under Armour misleadingly attributed its revenue growth to various factors without disclosing to investors material information about the impacts of its pull forward practices. It also found that the company's use of pull forwards raised significant uncertainty as to whether it would meet its revenue guidance in future quarters.
The company has agreed to cease and desist the practice, which is a violation of U.S. antifraud provisions, the SEC said.

""When public companies describe how they achieved financial results, they must not misstate any information that is material to investors,"" said Kurt Gottschall, who leads the SEC's Denver regional office.
""By using pull forwards for several consecutive quarters to meet analysts' revenue targets while attributing its revenue growth to other factors, Under Armour created a misleading picture of the drivers of its financial results and concealed known uncertainties concerning its business,"" he added.

DKNG’s 19.92x forward EV/Sales is 1,061.7% higher than the 1.71x industry average. And the stock’s 21.58x forward Price/Sales is 1,463.6% higher than the 1.38x industry average. However, the company’s EPS is expected to remain negative in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022.
While DKNG may not be a good bet now, the sports gambling industry has been gaining investors’ attention owing to the increasing legalization of sports gambling across several states.

Qiagen's products include several types of COVID-19 tests that helped it to boost sales over the past year and recover from a difficult 2019 that included profit warnings, a slump in China business and a CEO departure.
The company said it plans to keep growing sales even after the pandemic by broadening its portfolio and making sure each coronavirus-related test has other applications as well.
""We have made multiple product expansions to our non-COVID related portfolio, including the launch of a Lyme disease test,"" Qiagen's Chief Executive Thierry Bernard said in a statement.
The company said first-quarter adjusted earnings rose to 65 cents per share on a currency-adjusted basis, beating the 63 cents on average forecast by analysts in a Vara Research poll, as research laboratories around the world have returned to work and clinical labs moved beyond COVID-19 testing.
""This performance was particularly driven by 16% constant currency growth in sales of non-COVID product groups that represented 64% of our sales,"" Bernard said.
Qiagen also confirmed its 2021 forecast for adjusted earnings of $2.42 to $2.46 per share and net sales growth of 18% to 20% at constant exchange rates.

Let’s discuss these names.The cannabis landscape has been sprouting new opportunities of late because of increasing legalization in the United States and the growing acceptance of marijuana’s medical and recreational uses. Although marijuana usage has yet to be made legal at the federal level, state legalization momentum remains strong as more governors take steps to end marijuana prohibition in their states.
However, the cannabis space is highly competitive and not all players are in a good shape financially. In fact, now that Mexico has passed a bill to legalize recreational pot use—making it one of the world’s largest cannabis markets—the business climate for Canadian and U.S. pot operators could become even more competitive. 
Against such a backdrop, the stocks of cannabis companies Canopy Growth Corporation (CGC),  Tilray Inc . (TLRY),  Sundial Growers Inc . (SNDL) and OrganiGram Holdings Inc. (OGI), which are expensive, and the companies financially inadequate, should be avoided now.

1389,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2021 04:20PM ET</span>","Uber, Lyft have a California playbook to fight proposed U.S. rules on workers","(Corrects to reflect that AB5 is no longer the law in California for ride-hail and food-delivery workers, instead of that AB5 is no longer the law in California for anyone, paragraph 5; also corrects paragraph 20 to reflect that AB5 was defeated ""for app-based gig workers."")
By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) -Uber,  Lyft  and other gig-economy companies face a new challenge from the Biden administration to their use of contract workers, but as they gear up for a fight in Washington they could turn to a lobbying playbook that helped them score a decisive win against California regulators last year.
U.S. President Joe Biden campaigned on the promise of providing legal protections and benefits to gig workers, who as independent contractors generally have no access to unemployment insurance, sick pay and health insurance. U.S. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh said last week: ""A lot of gig workers should be classified as employees.""
In Congress, Democratic lawmakers are pushing a union-supported labor bill, the PRO Act, that in part is modeled after a California law called AB5 that reclassified most gig workers as employees. 
AB5, however, is no longer the law in California for ride-hail and food delivery workers, while it remains in effect for other freelancers. Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc, Lyft Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT), DoorDash Inc and Instacart, whose business model relies on low-cost flexible labor, mounted a $205 million campaign that overturned the law for the industry last November.
Among the tactics honed in the California fight, the gig-work companies used their apps to reach out to voters and drivers through messages, emails, mailed leaflets, billboards, radio and online ads. They also urged workers on their platforms to speak out against AB5. 
The companies threatened an end to ubiquitous food-delivery and ride-hail services many consumers have gotten used to during the pandemic if drivers were classified employees.
The looming fight over the status of gig-economy workers comes amid a wider debate over business regulation. The federal government exercised a light hand in regulating Uber, DoorDash and other digital-economy companies as they redefined traditional definitions of work, communications or retailing. Now, Democrats and Republicans in Washington, for different reasons, are calling for the government to exercise more control over one-time startups that dominate significant sectors of the economy. 
Uber, Lyft, DoorDash and Instacart so far this year have spent a combined $1.3 million to lobby the Biden administration and members of the U.S. House and Senate, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. In 2020 they spent some $5.7 million, more than half of which came from Uber.
LOBBYING PUSH
Less than two weeks after Biden won the White House in November, companies banded together to form the App-Based Work Alliance, a Washington-based advocacy group. The group is now promoting statements of drivers and food-delivery workers saying they want to remain independent contractors, and do not want the PRO Act because they fear it would deprive them of opportunities to earn money on their own schedule for a few hours a week.
The companies cite surveys to argue the majority of their mostly part-time workers do not want to be classified as employees. 
While the surveys show massive support for remaining independent contractors, they also follow years of threats by the companies of eliminating work opportunities if workers become employees. Some of the surveys are co-written by researchers with company ties, sponsored by the companies or completed with unscientific methodologies by a blogger who sent out emails and social media posts. 
For example, one study by the National Bureau of Economic Research listed Uber's chief economist, Jonathan Hall, as a co-author, and a 2020 survey of 1,000 drivers by Benenson Strategy Group and GS Strategy Group was paid for by Uber. Uber said that while it paid for the poll, the survey was conducted by reputable research groups. 
In California, the gig companies did not simply oppose any changes to their employment practices. Instead, they campaigned for compromise, advocating changes to labor laws to allow workers to remain contractors while also receiving more modest benefits than required for employees.
DoorDash said its workers on average work just four hours a week, while Uber said 37% of its U.S. drivers and 58% of its delivery people averaged fewer than 10 hours per week in the last quarter of 2020. The companies say those part-time gigs would become impossible under an employment model. 
But Uber data from the fourth quarter of 2019, before the pandemic, also showed that California drivers working 25 hours and more per week completed more than 60% of all trips in the state, suggesting that full-time drivers complete the bulk of the work.
DRIVER ADVOCACY
Gig Workers Rising, a group of workers that advocates for greater benefits and says it does not receive financial support from labor groups, in a statement dismissed the companies' compromise proposal.
""(The proposal) is not a blueprint for workers' rights, it's a game plan for gig corporations and investors looking to maximize their profits,"" the group said in a statement.
The defeat of AB5 for app-based gig workers in California was a blow to organized labor groups, California's Democrats and even Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, who had urged the state's voters to reject the gig industry's proposal.
Though AB5 is gone, gig workers in California now have access to some benefits, including healthcare subsidies, accident insurance and minimum pay while passengers are in their car. Those benefits are significantly less costly to the companies than employee benefits and labor groups say drivers do not know how to access them.
As the fight over gig-worker rights heats up on the national level, the companies could deploy similar measures.

""Right now there's no call for action, but if that became the case, for example if a real piece of legislation or ballot measure was put forward, we'd certainly activate our driver base,"" a Lyft spokeswoman said.
Uber and DoorDash said they had no specific plans for an outreach campaign as of now. Uber in August sent an email to all its drivers nationwide, outlining its proposal for a change in law to combine independent contractor status with some benefits.

Investing.com – The Dow closed higher Monday as signs of a faster reopening of the economy pushed cyclicals corners of the market including energy and materials higher.  
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended up 0.70%, or 239 points, the S&P 500 was up 0.27%, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.44%.
Energy led the broader market higher, underpinned by rising oil prices as investors renewed bets on a recovery in global demand despite Covid-19 cases in India that continue to mount.
""Support from the economy’s reopening is being reinforced by aggressive fiscal and monetary stimulus, the release of pent-up demand, and the drawdown of sizable household savings,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) said in a note.
Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), HollyFrontier (NYSE:HFC) and  Baker Hughes  (NYSE:BKR) were among the best performing energy stocks on the day, with the latter up 8%. Baker Hughes rallied after  Barclays  (LON:BARC) upgraded the stock overweight from equal weight and lifted its price target to $28 from $25, citing optimism on oilfield services and equipment stocks.
In a sign of progress on the reopening, New York and New Jersey are set to begin lifting all restrictions from May 19, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Monday. 
In tech, meanwhile, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in the spotlight as the tech giant entered a court battle in the Northern District of California with game developer Epic Games over alleged anti-competitive practices in its App Store. Apple removed Epic Games' Fortnite from its App Store after the latter attempted to circumvent Apple's 30% fee.  
Some on Wall Street believe that Apple will ultimately win the legal battle against Epic.  
""This week Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, will officially begin its much anticipated court battle royale with Apple in Northern District of California that we ultimately believe Cupertino will win while defending its golden jewel App Store ecosystem,"" Wedbush said in a note.
Other megacap tech stocks traded lower. Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) fell.
Sentiment on stocks was also lifted by ongoing signs the economic recovery is gathering momentum even as the manufacturing activity for April fell short of investor expectations.
""[D]espite coming in below expectations, the reading suggests that activity in the sector is still expanding at a solid pace,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said.
On the economic front, weaker-than-expected manufacturing activity was largely shrugged off as the underlying data ""suggests that activity in the sector is still expanding at a solid pace,"" Jefferies said.
Still, despite the strong day of gains, there are some on Wall Street who caution that stocks could be set for a short-term correction.
""[W]e would note that for the most part, equities remain overbought / extended on a short-term basis […] this to us implies we are still vulnerable to a correction ahead,"" Janney Montgomery Scott said. ""The S&P 500 could correction by 10-to-15%, though will main its long-term uptrend,"" it added."
1391,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2021 04:02PM ET</span>",'Fortnite' creator Epic Games makes case against Apple at antitrust trial,"By Stephen Nellis
OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) -Attorneys for ""Fortnite"" creator Epic Games on Monday argued at an antitrust trial against Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) the iPhone maker has turned its App Store into a ""walled garden"" with a ""Venus fly trap"" designed to lock in 1 billion iPhone users and the developers who want to reach them.
The three-week trial in Oakland, California, the culmination of a lawsuit Epic brought last year in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, centers on two Apple practices that have become cornerstones of its business: Apple's requirement that virtually all third-party software for the world's 1 billion iPhones be distributed through its App Store, and the requirement that developers use Apple's in-app purchase system, which charges commissions of up to 30%.
Epic broke Apple's rules last year when it introduced its own in-app payment system in ""Fortnite"" to circumnavigate Apple's commissions. In response, Apple kicked Epic off its App Store. 
Epic sued Apple, alleging the iPhone maker is abusing its power over app developers with App Store review rules and payment requirements that hurt competition in the software market. Epic also launched an aggressive public relations campaign to call attention to its allegations just as Apple's practices have come under scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators in the United States and elsewhere.
In opening arguments, Epic attorney Katherine Forrest of Cravath, Swaine & Moore laid out the gaming company's argument that Apple has ""brick by brick"" built its App Store into a ""walled garden"" meant to extract fees from developers who want to access Apple's 1 billion iPhone users. Forrest argued that Apple has locked those users into its ecosystem with apps like iMessage, which lets Apple users send messages to other devices but has limited functionality when communicating with Android users.
“The most prevalent flower in the walled garden is the Venus fly trap,” Forrest argued before Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers (NYSE:ROG), who is presiding over the trial in a courtroom in Oakland, California.
Apple has countered Epic's allegations by arguing that its App Store rules have made consumers feel safe and secure in opening up their wallets to unknown developers, helping create a massive market from which all developers have benefited. Apple argues that Epic intentionally broke its contracts with Apple because the game maker wanted a free ride on the iPhone maker's platform.
In opening arguments for Apple, attorney Karen Dunn of Paul, Weiss noted Epic is asking the judge to force Apple to let third-party software be installed on its phones outside the App Store, similar to the ""side loading"" the Android operating system already allows. 
“Epic is asking for government intervention to take away a choice that consumers currently have,” Dunn told the court.
The courtroom was closed to the public, but in the audience as a ""corporate witness"" for each side were Epic Games Chief Executive Tim Sweeney, who was expected to take the stand later on Monday, and Phil Schiller, Apple's App Store chief.

Both executives are expected to attend the entire trial, which will also feature in-person testimony from Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook and other senior executives at both firms.
Epic is not seeking monetary damages but is asking the court to hand down orders that would end many of Apple's practices.

(Reuters) -Robinhood Financial on Monday struck back against comments by Warren Buffett that likened the retail brokerage to a casino that encourages millions of inexperienced day traders to place short-term stock market bets. 
At Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc's annual meeting on Saturday, Buffett said Robinhood has attracted, ""maybe set out to attract,"" large numbers of people who just gamble on short-term price movements. Buffett's long-time business partner, Charlie Munger, was harsher, saying it was ""god-awful that something like that would draw investment from civilized man and decent citizens.""
""If the last year has taught us anything, it is that people are tired of the Warren Buffetts and Charlie Mungers of the world acting like they are the only oracles of investing,"" Robinhood's Head of Public Policy Communications, Jacqueline Ortiz Ramsay, said in a blog post https://robinhood.engineering/the-old-guard-of-investing-is-at-it-again-a8b870fbfd49. 
""And at Robinhood, we're not going to sit back while they disparage everyday people for taking control of their financial lives.""
Buffett and Munger made their comments after Berkshire shareholder Robert Miles asked them what they thought of Robinhood and other retail brokers enabling people of all ages and experience to participate in the market.
Miles said he did not think their responses were meant to disparage Robinhood users.
""They're trying to dissuade people from making money through trading, which Charlie (Munger) said is not how they made their money. They made their money by investing,"" he said in an interview.
Buffett specifically pointed to the high volume of short-term options bets on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s stock, and compared the practice to playing the state lottery, which he said was ""taxing hope.""
""He said it wasn't immoral, it's just in his opinion not very wise,"" said Miles, who teaches a class on Buffett at the University of Nebraska, Omaha.
Robinhood also traded barbs with Munger in February, calling him elitist, after the 97-year-old investor said the brokerage encouraged gambling in stocks.
Brokers like Robinhood have attracted controversy this year as retail traders drove huge rallies in shares of companies like  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) despite no fundamental financial reason for the frenzy. 
During a Feb. 18 congressional hearing on the matter, lawmakers slammed Robinhood's ""gamification"" of stock trading on mobile phones through things like a virtual confetti celebration following a big trade. Robinhood later removed the confetti animation from its app.
Massachusetts regulators in April sought to revoke Robinhood's broker-dealer license, saying it encourages inexperienced investors to place risky trades without limits, while the brokerage sued to invalidate underlying the case.

While some people do gamble on stocks, it is far more socially beneficial than going to the racetrack, because when they do so, they add capital, liquidity and risk-bearing capacity to the market, said James Angel, a finance professor at Georgetown University.
But they should never bet more than they can afford to lose, he added. ""I warn my students, if you're looking for entertainment, you're going to pay for it.""

 Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE), with BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) the maker of the Covid-19 vaccine built on mRNA technology, is set to report before the opening bell. Analysts are expecting earnings per share of 78 cents on revenue of $13.7 billion. Listen for Pfizer’s outlook on vaccine rollouts for the rest of the year.
2. Another health-related report
Drugstore retailer and insurance giant CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) will also come out on Tuesday morning. Analysts are expecting EPS of $1.72 on revenue of $68.4 billion. Last week, CVS said it was launching a $100 million venture fund focused on investments in tech-enabled and digital healthcare companies.
3. Word from the energy sector
Oil giant ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) will report on its quarter with analysts expecting EPS of 55 cents on revenue of $8.5 billion. U.S. gas demand rose 3% last week to the second-highest level since the pandemic started as Americans hit the road again. Demand levels hovered nearly 5% over the four-week average, according to data from GasBuddy.

Read on for a closer evaluation of these names.While investor optimism surrounding the rebounding U.S. economy and a fast-paced vaccination is driving the stock markets, the Biden’s administration’s $3.5 trillion proposal to tax the rich and soaring COVID-19 cases in many countries worldwide are driving remarkable volatility in the stock market.
In this environment, momentum investing could help investors dodge short-term market volatility because stocks that generated momentum usually maintain it for some time irrespective of market conditions. Investors’ interest in momentum stocks is evidenced by iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF’s (MTUM) 9.3% returns over the past month versus SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Growth ETF’s (SPYG) and SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Value ETF’s (SPYV) 8.1% and 3.3% gains, respectively, over the same period.

1396,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2021 03:20PM ET</span>",Warren Buffett says Greg Abel would become Berkshire CEO after he's gone -CNBC,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) -Warren Buffett ended years of speculation about who would succeed him at Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc by saying Vice Chairman Greg Abel would take over as chief executive officer if he were to step down.
""The directors are in agreement that if something were to happen to me tonight, it would be Greg who'd take over tomorrow morning,"" Buffett said, according to a CNBC report on Monday. Buffett, 90, has never provided a timetable for his departure.
Abel, 58, has overseen Berkshire's non-insurance businesses since 2018, after building its Berkshire Hathaway Energy unit into a major U.S. power provider.
Many analysts and investors had viewed the Edmonton, Alberta, native as Buffett's most likely successor, and committed to preserving Berkshire's corporate culture.
""Simple, understated, very knowledgeable, but humble at the same time, and also serious,"" said Steve Haberstroh, a partner at CastleKeep Investment Advisors in Westport, Connecticut.
Ajit Jain, 69, a vice chairman overseeing Berkshire's insurance businesses, was another CEO candidate, but Buffett told CNBC that Abel's relative youth ""makes a real difference.""
Buffett's hand may have been forced after Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 97, let slip at Berkshire's May 1 annual meeting while discussing Berkshire's decentralized business model that ""Greg will keep the culture."" He did not mention Jain.
""I suspect Buffett disclosed this reluctantly,"" though ""Abel's coronation is not exactly a surprise,"" said Jim Shanahan, an analyst at Edward Jones & Co.
Buffett has built Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire since 1965 into a $628 billion empire with dozens of businesses such as Geico auto insurance, the BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream and See's Candies.
Its shares are performing well in 2021 but have trailed the Standard & Poor's 500 over the last decade, reflecting Berkshire's size and Buffett's struggle to deploy its now $145.4 billion cash pile.
Succession has been a central issue since 2006 when Buffett, then 75, discussed it in his annual shareholder letter.
Buffett's eldest son Howard is expected to become non-executive chairman, while investment managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler are in line to become chief investment officer.
NEVER A DUMB THING
While Abel lacks Buffett's charisma and showmanship, he won Buffett's confidence for his commitment to Berkshire's culture, long-term thinking and ability to spend money wisely.
""Greg has a lot of experience dealing with regulators and making acquisitions, and a track record of managing many people,"" said longtime Berkshire shareholder James Armstrong, president of Henry H. Armstrong Associates in Pittsburgh.
Buffett called Abel ""a first-class human being"" in a 2013 video message.
""There's a lot of smart people in this world, but some of them do some very dumb things,"" Buffett said. ""He's a smart guy who will never do a dumb thing.""
A lifelong hockey fan, Abel graduated in 1984 from the University of Alberta.
He worked at PricewaterhouseCoopers and energy firm CalEnergy before joining Berkshire Hathaway Energy, then known as MidAmerican Energy, in 1992, which Berkshire took over in 2000.
Abel became MidAmerican's chief in 2008, replacing David Sokol, who many investors thought was being groomed to replace Buffett and was given a broader role.
Sokol resigned in 2011 after Berkshire learned he had invested in Lubrizol while successfully persuading Buffett to buy the chemical company. Regulators took no action.
Berkshire Hathaway Energy benefited from its ability, unusual in the utility industry, to retain earnings rather than pay dividends.
That freed Abel to buy Nevada utility NV Energy and Alberta electric transmission company AltaLink while expanding into renewable energy. The unit also controls one of the largest U.S. residential real estate brokerages.

Despite outward appearances, Abel has let his hair down in public.
In 2014, he accepted the Ice Bucket Challenge to raise awareness for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's Disease. Abel flashed two thumbs up to a camera as he got soaked with water.

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Dow indexes rose on Monday amid a largely upbeat earnings season, while the Nasdaq came under pressure from declines in some high-flying growth stocks, as the rotation into cyclical and ""reopening"" stocks continued. 
Economy-sensitive cyclical S&P 500 sectors such as consumer staples, energy, industrials and materials outperformed sectors housing growth stocks, including technology and communication services, by early afternoon. 
By 2:15 p.m. ET (1815 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 282.76 points, or 0.83%, to 34,157.61, the S&P 500 gained 18.49 points, or 0.44%, to 4,199.66 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 40.13 points, or 0.29%, to 13,922.55.
""We've seen a slight change in the pace of value stocks outperforming growth stocks year-to-date,"" said Rod von Lipsey, managing director at UBS Private Wealth Management. ""We still continue to believe that value will be a source of outperformance during increased mobility and recovery.""
The Nasdaq index fell as megacap technology stocks, including Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc,  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), traded lower despite largely upbeat results.
The stocks have struggled to maintain the upward trajectory coming into reporting season. Chipmakers also fell, with the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index down 1.5%.
With more than half of S&P 500 companies having reported so far, profits are now seen rising 46% in the first quarter, compared with forecasts of 24% growth at the start of April, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. About 87% of the companies have come also reported earnings per share ahead of analysts' estimates. 
""This is now the fourth straight quarter of earnings just absolutely crushing estimates,"" said Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at Baird. ""I think there just continues to be an underestimation of how strong this rally and how strong the economy is rebounding.""
Strong earnings, improving economic data, fiscal stimulus and the Federal Reserve's ultra accommodative stance have supported markets, pushing the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq indexes to record levels last week.
Data on Monday showed U.S. manufacturing activity grew at a slower pace in April, likely constrained by shortages of inputs amid pent-up demand due to rising vaccinations and massive fiscal stimulus.
The Labor Department's non-farm payrolls data, slated to be released on Friday, is expected to show a rise in job additions in April. 
The largest percentage gainer on the S&P 500 was Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS), which rose 9.1%, while the largest decliner was  Estee Lauder  (NYSE:EL), down 6.9% after the cosmetics maker missed analysts' estimates for third-quarter sales. 
On the Nasdaq 100 the largest gainer was  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc, which rose 4.3% after the drugmaker said it will supply 34 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine this year to the global COVAX program.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc fell 3.6%. Industry sources told Reuters the electric-vehicle maker, under scrutiny in China over safety and customer service complaints, is boosting its engagement with mainland regulators and beefing up its government relations team. 

The S&P index recorded 82 new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 104 new highs and 39 new lows.

Investing.com – The Dow jumped Monday, led by energy and materials on signs of an ongoing recovery as the reopening of the economy continues to advance.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.88%, or 296 points, the S&P 500 was up 0.49%, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.34%.
Energy led the broader market higher, underpinned by rising oil prices as investors renewed bet on a recovery in global demand despite the threat of a slower recovery as Covid-19 cases in India continue to mount.
""Support from the economy’s reopening is being reinforced by aggressive fiscal and monetary stimulus, the release of pent-up demand, and the drawdown of sizable household savings,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) said in a note.
Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), HollyFrontier (NYSE:HFC) and  Baker Hughes  (NYSE:BKR) were among the best performing energy stocks on the day, with the latter up 9%.
Baker Hughes rallied after  Barclays  (LON:BARC) upgraded the stock overweight from equal weight and lifted its price target to $28 from $25, citing optimism on oilfield services and equipment stocks.
In tech, meanwhile, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in the spotlight as the tech giant entered a court battle in the Northern District of California with game developer Epic Games over alleged anti-competitive practices in its App Store. Apple removed Epic Games' Fortnite from its App Store after the latter attempted to circumvent Apple's 30% fee.  
Some on Wall Street believe that Apple will ultimately win the legal battle against Epic.  
""This week Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, will officially begin its much anticipated court battle royale with Apple in Northern District of California that we ultimately believe Cupertino will win while defending its golden jewel App Store ecosystem,"" Wedbush said in a note.
Other megacap tech stocks traded lower. Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) fell.
Sentiment on stocks was also lifted by ongoing signs the economic recovery is gathering momentum even as the manufacturing activity for April fell short of investor expectations.
""[D]espite coming in below expectations, the reading suggests that activity in the sector is still expanding at a solid pace,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said.
Still, despite the strong day of gains, there are some on Wall Street who caution that stocks could be set for a short-term correction.
""[W]e would note that for the most part, equities remain overbought / extended on a short-term basis […] this to us implies we are still vulnerable to a correction ahead,"" Janney Montgomery Scott said.

So, we think it’s wise to avoid fundamentally weak EV players ChargePoint (CHPT), Hyllion (HYLN), and XL fleet (XL). Let's discuss.The year 2020 saw unprecedented investor interest in the electric vehicle (EV) industry as governments worldwide announced or implemented initiatives to address the climate change concerns. The future of the global EV market looks promising with massive opportunities for growth in the battery, hybrid, and plug-in-hybrid EV markets. According to Globe Newswire, the global EV market is expected to grow at a 29% CAGR from 2021- 2026.
However, EV production costs are increasing because the world is currently witnessing a global semiconductor shortage. This, along with stock price overvaluation, is motivating investors to rotate drop EV stocks in favor of relatively cheaper cyclical stocks amid the economic recovery. This activity is evidenced by the Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF’s (DRIV) 4.1% gains over the past three months versus the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust’s (SPY) 12.8% returns.

1400,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2021 02:20PM ET</span>",NY state lawyer calls NRA bankruptcy 'sideshow' in trial closing,"By Maria Chutchian
(Reuters) -A lawyer for New York Attorney General Letitia James called the National Rifle Association's bankruptcy bid ""a circus sideshow"" during closing arguments on Monday in a case over whether to allow the NRA to reorganize in the gun-friendly state of Texas.
The NRA filed for Chapter 11 in January, saying it planned to use the bankruptcy process to exit what it has called a corrupt political and regulatory environment in New York, where is it currently incorporated.
It is attempting to fend off a lawsuit to dismiss the Chapter 11 case by James and the group's former ad agency, Ackerman McQueen.
The NRA's lawyers will present their closing arguments later on Monday. 
The case before U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Harlin Hale in Dallas coincides with the United States reeling from another spate of mass shootings, with President Joe Biden calling for a ban on assault weapons and tighter gun control measures. The gun rights advocacy group has been influential in its opposition to such legislation in the U.S. Congress.
If the NRA is permitted to proceed with the Chapter 11 case, it could make it easier for it to fend off allegations of financial wrongdoing and corruption.
James, a Democrat, sued the NRA and Chief Executive Wayne LaPierre in New York state court in August, accusing it of financial misconduct and aiming to dissolve the organization.
She said the NRA had diverted millions of dollars to fund luxurious trips for officials, no-show contracts for associates, and other questionable expenses.
LaPierre has testified that he sought bankruptcy protection out of fear that James would try to place it into receivership. 
James has said the NRA claims to be solvent and called its bankruptcy and plan to reincorporate in Texas after 150 years in New York a bad-faith effort to escape her lawsuit and oversight.
Gerrit Pronske, a lawyer for James, called the NRA's bankruptcy ""a circus sideshow"" on Monday during the closing stages of the trial that began on April 5. The NRA has accused James of “weaponizing” her powers to pursue a “blatant and malicious retaliation campaign” against the group because she dislikes what it stands for.

A lawyer for the NRA's former ad agency Ackerman on Monday attacked LaPierre's leadership, calling him a ""dictator"" and arguing that the bankruptcy amounted to a ""fraud on the court."" 
The lawyer, Brian Mason, said LaPierre violated the NRA's own bylaws when he put the organization into Chapter 11 without first obtaining board approval. LaPierre has rejected claims of wrongdoing, arguing that he had authority to file for Chapter 11 on behalf of the NRA.

“We are glad to see that they are working with other countries to help them meet their supply needs,” Jeff Zients, President Joe Biden’s Covid-19 response coordinator, told Bloomberg News in a statement. He said the company is ahead of schedule in its commitments to supply the U.S.
The governments of Mexico and Canada said last week that they expected to begin receiving doses of Pfizer’s vaccine from the U.S., the first time the company’s U.S.-made shots are known to have been delivered to any buyer other than the American government itself.
Zients’s statement is the first indication that the Biden administration won’t stand in the way of the exports. Pfizer did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.
Demand for shots in the U.S. has begun to wane, falling to 2.4 million injections a day for the last week, according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker. With about 40% of the adult population fully vaccinated already, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, supplies of shots are abundant enough that pharmacies have begun to advertise their availability.
That’s allowed Biden to begin turning some attention overseas, where the pandemic is raging in countries led by India, raising the risk that dangerous new variants of the virus may arise.
Biden has said he plans to send millions of doses of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc’s vaccine abroad. The company has manufactured doses in the U.S. to fulfill a government contract, but the vaccine isn’t authorized for use in the U.S.
The White House has direct control over where its AstraZeneca shots go and has said it will make a decision on an initial tranche of 10 million doses in the coming weeks, pending a safety review.

1402,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2021 02:05PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Blackstone asks its companies to regularly report on sustainability,"By Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc has for the first time asked executives in companies controlled by its private equity arm to regularly report on environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters to their boards, according to a letter seen by Reuters. 
The world's largest manager of alternative assets such as private equity and real estate has been seeking to bolster its sustainability credentials as investors increasingly question companies on their impact on the environment and workers. 
Blackstone said in the letter to the portfolio company CEOs that they should report to their boards on climate risks, environmental certifications such green building ratings, diversity among employees and commitments to human rights.
""Environmental, social and governance factors are attracting greater focus globally and demand careful attention on your part,"" Blackstone's private equity business heads wrote to the portfolio company CEOs.
""We believe providing transparency for your directors on ESG-related matters is a best practice.""
The move to require regular ESG reporting in its private equity portfolio companies is significant for Blackstone because buying and running companies is the firm's largest business by total assets under management. 
Funds that manage money using environmental, social and governance factors have risen in popularity in recent years, putting pressure on other investors to respond. U.S. regulators are also starting to scrutinize companies that fail to disclose risks stemming from climate change.
Some Blackstone portfolio companies have already been reporting on ESG matters, but this has not been standardized across the firm's portfolio, said Christine Anderson, Blackstone head of external relations who also oversees the firm's ESG efforts. 
Companies in Blackstone's real estate division have been reporting on ESG since 2019, she added. 
A Blackstone spokeswoman said that the success the New York-based firm has had with ESG reporting in its real estate division is now leading the firm to expand the effort across private equity. Blackstone plans to take the reporting from its portfolio companies to develop standards and best practices across the firm, the spokeswoman said. 
Last week, Blackstone announced a slew of new hires in ESG who will help implement diversity and sustainability initiatives across its businesses.

The firm does not yet ask portfolio companies to report sustainability data according to recommendations from the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure or the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, a person familiar with the matter said. This is because the firm is still deliberating what sustainability reporting framework is the best one to use, the source added.

Despite the high investment risks that penny stocks can possess, we believe Acerinox (ANIOY (OTC:ANIOY)), ARC Resources (AETUF),  Alliance Resource  Partners (NASDAQ:ARLP), and Champion Iron (CHPRF) are worth keeping an eye on. As such, let’s review these names.The global commodity market is on a roll. An expected inflationary environment in the United States and the rapid recovery of industrial activities have been driving commodity prices higher. In addition, with consumer spending steadily rising, primarily on the back of the recent federal rescue package and an improving job market, commodity prices have begun to spike. Consequently, commodity-related penny stocks have emerged as the most sought-after investments on Wall Street currently.
A penny stock (also known as a microcap or nano stock) refers to a small company’s stock that usually trades at less than $5. Many of these stocks are from upstart and struggling companies. However, given their low-price levels, investors often target the best of them for the higher-than-usual upside that they can offer.
While it’s true that penny stocks are quite volatile and are usually speculative investments that doesn't mean that they do not sometimes represent promising opportunities. Acerinox, S.A.

1405,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2021 01:05PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Ford, BMW lead $130 million investing round in solid-state battery startup","By Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and BMW AG are leading a $130 million funding round in a solid-state battery startup, Solid Power, as carmakers push to lower the cost of electric vehicles by investing in the development of affordable but powerful rechargeable batteries, the companies said on Monday.
The Series B investment round, which includes venture capital firm Volta Energy Technologies, allows Solid Power to expand in-house manufacturing capabilities and positions the battery maker to eventually supply future EVs, possibly by the end of the decade according to BMW battery cell technology chief Peter Lamp. Solid Power declined to say at what level the funding round values the company.
""The partnerships and the capital that comes along with it are really going to put us on a good footing to execute on our road map, which simply speaking is qualifying this technology for vehicle use and getting them into vehicles in the not-too-distant future,"" Solid Power Chief Executive and co-founder Doug Campbell said in an interview.
Carmakers are racing to develop EVs amid tightening CO2 emission standards in Europe and China. 
Solid-state battery technology involves a high-capacity energy storage device that improves on lithium-ion batteries, replacing the liquid or gel-form electrolyte with a solid, conductive material. Among other benefits, the new technology offers more energy density and better safety due to a lack of flammable components. Solid Power has said its technology can deliver 50% more energy density than current lithium-ion batteries. 
However, solid-state battery technology is more expensive than lithium-ion cell technology. It also must prove it can operate and remain durable in the real world, and must increase its scale to meet industry demand.
Monday's announcement marks the second investment in Solid Power for Ford and Volta Energy. Both participated in the $26 million Series A round in 2018 that included Hyundai Motor Co and Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF). 
""We've been working with more than a dozen different startups in this space and we've been most impressed with the progress that Solid Power has made,"" Hau Thai-Tang, Ford's chief product platform and operations officer, said.
Solid Power, based near Denver, raised $5 million in convertible debt from BMW iVentures earlier this year. Its partnership with the German automaker began in 2016.
Following the latest investments, Ford and BMW will own equal, unidentified stakes in Solid Power, which was established in 2012 as a spinout from the University of Colorado Boulder, Campbell said. 
Ford is pushing to electrify key models in its lineup, including the Transit van late this year and F-150 pickup mid-2022, and already sells the all-electric Mustang Mach-E SUV. It previously said it will invest $22 billion in electrification through 2025.
By the end of 2021, BMW aims to have five fully electric models available across the BMW and MINI brands, and it said by 2023 it will have fully electric models available for almost all of its market segments. 
 Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, which has called the technology a ""game changer,"" plans to introduce solid-state batteries on an electrified platform by 2025.
Another solid-state battery startup is Volkswagen-backed QuantumScape, which aims to introduce its battery in 2024. It went public last year through a reverse merger with a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC).

Campbell declined to say whether Solid Power is exploring going public with a SPAC.

1411,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2021 11:40AM ET</span>",Analysis: Headwinds facing Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway have some investors fretting,"By John McCrank and Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - For some Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) shareholders a list of post-pandemic challenges including looming inflation, a dearth of acquisitions and more environmental and social disclosure demands are prompting a rethink on Warren Buffett's conglomerate.
Making money at Berkshire used to be like ""shooting fish in a barrel,"" Buffett's long-time business partner Charlie Munger said at its annual meeting on Saturday.
""But that's gotten harder,"" Munger added.
Investors have long been happy to bet on Buffett outperforming markets, and many remain confident Berkshire's growth will pick up if the U.S. economy continues roaring back from its pandemic-induced slump. 
But some worry the last year may have exacerbated Berkshire's difficulties delivering faster growth.
""We have been reducing our position in Berkshire for a number of years because it appears that we can make more money than he can,"" said Bill Smead, whose firm, Seattle-based Smead Capital Management has lowered its Berkshire holdings to about 2.2% of its $2.5 billion portfolio, from 5% a decade ago.
With unprecedented government stimulus and rock bottom interest rates threatening to lift inflation, Berkshire may be too big to pivot heavily to companies that could benefit from rising consumer prices, Smead said.
Several Berkshire shareholders expressed frustration that Buffett did not snap up more shares of companies at the beginning of the pandemic, a missed opportunity given the S&P 500's nearly 90% surge from last year's low.
Steve Haberstroh, a partner at Berkshire shareholder CastleKeep Investment Advisors, said this was ""frustrating"", although he was gratified when it announced share buybacks and new stakes in  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) and  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX)
Another issue hampering Berkshire's ability to generate money is historically low interest rates, which the Federal Reserve has pledged to leave at near-zero for years.
Berkshire now earns about $20 million annually on its more than $100 billion in Treasury bills, compared with about $1.5 billion before the pandemic, Buffett said.
""Imagine your wage is going from $15 an hour to $0.20 an hour,"" Buffett said.
Still, Berkshire has outperformed the S&P 500 year to date, gaining 18.6% versus the index’s 11.84% gain. But it has trailed over the past decade, returning nearly 236% compared with just over 277% for the index.
As the economy improves, Berkshire is poised to benefit, said James Shanahan, an analyst at Edward Jones & Co.
""If it has a challenge, it relates to capital deployment,"" he said. Berkshire's $145.4 billion cash hoard could swell by $25 billion by year end, he said.
Buffett said he would like to put $70 billion to $80 billion to work through acquisitions.
But the growth of special purpose acquisition companies, which take private companies public, has made buying whole companies pricey for Berkshire, Buffett said.
SUCCESSION PLANS
Among the biggest reasons for Berkshire's success is the relationship between Buffett, 90, and Munger, 97, and the business culture they cultivate.
Both expressed confidence in Berkshire's ability to stay on course without them, and had Vice Chairmen Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, join them on stage at the annual gathering.
""This decentralization won't work unless you have the right kind of culture accompanying it,"" Buffett said about Berkshire.
""Greg will keep the culture,"" Munger said of Abel.
After the meeting, Buffett ended long-running speculation about by telling CNBC that Abel, who oversees Berkshire's non-insurance businesses, would be named chief executive if he were to step down.
""The directors are in agreement that if something were to happen to me tonight, it would be Greg who’d take over tomorrow morning,"" Buffett said.
Robert Miles, a shareholder who teaches a class on Buffett and Berkshire at The University of Nebraska, called Abel and Jain's presence at the meeting ""a real value-add.""
Jain said he and Abel talk every quarter about businesses they oversee.
Abel addressed Berkshire's efforts around environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, with two shareholder proposals asking the board to publish annual reports on how each of its units addressed them.
Berkshire opposed the proposals, citing its decentralized business model.
Both were rejected, but received support from around one quarter of the votes cast, suggesting greater discontent than Berkshire shareholders historically have demonstrated.
""These are complex topics that warrant ongoing dialogue,"" said Caitlin McSherry, Director of Investment Stewardship at Neuberger Berman, a shareholder that backed the proposals.
Smead, of Smead Capital Management, looks forward to when Berkshire will again become a frequent buyer of choice for companies looking to sell.

""We would (add) where they are back to shooting fish in a barrel,"" he said.

1412,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 03, 2021 11:36AM ET</span>",BioNTech Soars to Record as Vaccine Success Spurs on Biotechs,"(Bloomberg) -- BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), the vaccine maker partnered with  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE) on its Covid-19 shot, rose as much as 10% on Monday as the stock rallied past $200 a share at the open, breaking yet another record after closing at new highs four out of five days last week.
The German company was among the top gainers as the biotech sector regained lost footing and optimism about economies reopening bolstered stocks. Shots from Pfizer and BioNTech as well as  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc. have helped the U.S. reach more than 245 million doses administered, while side-stepping some of the safety concerns that have arisen for shots from AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).
The biotech sector is bouncing back after hitting a four-month low in early April on regulatory concerns related to industry consolidation, new drug applications and potential legislation to rein in the cost of prescriptions. The Nasdaq Biotech Index is up 5.7% from an April 12 trough while the broader market climbed 1.7%. Returns for the biopharma benchmark still trail S&P 500 stocks for the year.
“Vaccines are winning,” Raymond James analysts led by Chris Meekins said in a note to clients. In the U.S., infections, death and hospitalizations are still moving in the right direction, with cases now at their lowest seven-day average since early October. But other parts of the world like India are still suffering amid a massive resurgence in infections, they added.
First-quarter earnings from Pfizer on Tuesday before the stock market opens could provide a further boost for the German biotech.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) expects the pharmaceutical heavyweight to “significantly raise” its vaccine sales expectations for the year and forecasts they could top $19 billion in 2021. Pfizer rose as much as 2.4% on Monday for the biggest gain since April 16.
Moderna also jumped as much as 5.6% in early trading, and the stock topped its record closing high of $185.98.
Other companies waiting on critical data on their Covid-19 inoculations were mixed, including CureVac NV which rose about 3% and  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) Inc. with a 12% decline.

However, as the dominant streaming company increases its content spending significantly this year to deliver more titles to its members, the company should generate substantial user growth in the coming months. So, we think the stock should rebound quickly. Read on.The video streaming video giant Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) has seen an exponential increase in its subscription base in recent years, and its stock has gained 22.3% over the past year. But its stock price has declined 5% year-to-date, due to a slowdown in growth after a COVID-19-pandemic driven boom last year and a lighter content slate in the first half of this year because of production delays.
In the second half of this year, however, new seasons of NFLX’s biggest and most popular shows and an exciting movie lineup should allow the stock to regain its momentum.
With more people replacing their traditional cable services with streaming services to reduce costs and access more varied content, we believe Netflix’s stock is poised for a turnaround. Here is what we think could shape NFLX’s performance in the near term:

It is now critical for businesses to have cloud infrastructure in today’s fast-changing market environment. As such, this segment of the technology sector is at the cusp of exponential growth and the stocks of cloud service providers are expected to witness major growth. Indeed, Wall Street analysts predict more than 20% upside in Twilio (NYSE:TWLO), DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU), Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), and Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS). Read on.Rapid digitization has favored the cloud computing sector greatly. The COVID-19 pandemic and the remote working culture it ushered in have been major driving forces. Resources such as databases, remote servers, and storage centers have replaced expensive on-premises infrastructure. Companies have adopted cloud computing rapidly thanks to its scalability, cost-effectiveness, and efficiency, and the migration from expensive on-premises IT infrastructure to on-demand services has been a major boon for companies that offer these services.
Analysts believe the demand for cloud infrastructure will continue increasing because the remote working culture is expected to continue even after the pandemic. Interestingly, cloud computing is evolving and now many applications are being built exclusively for the cloud.  Gartner  (NYSE:IT) predicts that the portion of enterprise IT spending on public cloud computing will expand 18.4% in 2021 to $304.9 billion. Further, cloud computing still has much untapped potential, and investors can capitalize on it by picking fundamentally sound cloud stocks.

1419,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2021 11:25AM ET</span>","Verizon to offload Yahoo, AOL for $5 billion","By Eva Mathews
(Reuters) -Verizon Communications Inc is getting rid of its media businesses that include iconic brands Yahoo and AOL for $5 billion, ending an expensive and unsuccessful run in the media and advertising world.
Despite spending more than a decade and billions of dollars building a stable of internet brands, the New York-based telecom company has struggled to make headway in a highly competitive internet advertising space dominated by  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
Having written $4.6 billion off the value of the businesses in 2018, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) will get just $4.25 billion in cash from private equity firm Apollo Global, along with preferred interests of $750 million and a 10% stake in the unit - about half of what it had paid for the businesses.
The move concludes a steady drip of deals which saw Verizon sell blogging platform Tumblr in 2019 for an undisclosed sum and news website HuffPost to BuzzFeed last year.
The unit, which was previously named Oath and recently renamed Verizon Media, will now be called Yahoo when the deal closes around the second half of 2021 and continue to be helmed by Guru Gowrappan.
For Apollo, the deal comes at a time when the big internet platforms have sewn up huge portions of the digital advertising market, drawing regulatory scrutiny over their practices.
Reuters reported that Verizon sought buyers for Yahoo Finance in 2019, and some industry estimates had valued that business alone at around $2 billion.

That compares to the roughly $4.48 billion Verizon spent on Yahoo in 2017, betting its 1 billion-plus users would be a fertile audience for online ads. It acquired email service AOL for $4.4 billion in 2015.
Verizon Media's portfolio also includes online brands such as TechCrunch, Makers, Ryot and Flurry, according to its website. It reported revenue of $1.9 billion in the first quarter of 2021.

1420,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2021 11:21AM ET</span>",Airport security app Clear looks to score with U.S. 'vaccine passport’,"By Paresh Dave
(Reuters) - Over 60 U.S. stadiums and other venues are deploying an app from Clear to verify people's COVID-19 status, placing the New York company known for its airport security fast lanes at the forefront of a national debate over ""vaccine passports.""
Major League Baseball's San Francisco Giants and New York Mets are among the first big businesses to demand guests prove they tested negative for the virus or are immunized against it. While the teams welcome paper proof, they encourage downloading records onto Clear's Health Pass feature for convenience.
As with mask mandates, such requirements are under attack from Republican politicians and anti-surveillance activists, as un-American intrusions on civil liberties. They fear businesses will discriminate against the unvaccinated and unnecessarily amass personal data.
Republican governors including in Florida and Texas last month moved to bar some establishments from asking about immunization status, though legal experts say door-checks are lawful to protect public health.
Privacy group Electronic Frontier Foundation fears Clear and other passport apps will hold data indefinitely and morph into consumer trackers. Clear said users control their health records. 
As a business based on replacing physical IDs, tickets and credit cards with facial or fingerprint recognition, Clear has a huge opportunity in emerging health-check rules that would familiarize more people with its technology. 
""Those experiences where you have to prove something about you – if we can help empower the consumer to get through that more quickly - that is our core business,"" said Catesby Perrin, Clear's executive vice president of growth. 
So far, Clear is among coronavirus health app frontrunners, with partners including United Airlines for its Los Angeles-to-Honolulu flights and the Venetian resort in Las Vegas for conventions it hosts. 
With fans anxious to get back to live sports, the Giants said its promotion generated about 6,000 Clear downloads in April. Nationwide, over 70,000 Health Passes are used for venue admission weekly, Clear said, though the app is only starting to verify vaccination status. 
(Graphic: U.S. installations of Clear's app soar as venues reopen: https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/VACCINE-APP/azgpoxorbvd/chart.png)
Also gaining traction is Excelsior Pass, funded by New York state, which supports verification of tests and vaccinations within the state. The app generated 500,000 certificates in April, and a companion app for businesses to verify them had 40,000 installations, New York spokeswoman Jennifer Givner said. 
Excelsior Pass developer  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) Corp is in discussions with additional states, vice president Eric Piscini said. 
In Europe, several governments have introduced apps that may be required to access transport, gyms and restaurants, while the 27-nation European Union races to develop a ""gateway"" that will enable them to work across borders.
Airline-backed Travel Pass and the nonprofit CommonPass, which was installed an estimated 20,000 times over the last two months in the United States, are being tested for international flight checks. 
It remains unclear whether high-tech options to prove health status will be widely required. At their best, apps would combat fake records by validating information against public health databases, but that is no small task.
Piscini said it requires accessing at least 64 separate databases in the United States. But California, for example, has yet to specify whether and when it will share records with apps.
Clear has started testing access to vaccination records but declined to disclose details.
New online tools that have gained a few thousand users, including VaxYes and ConfirmD, are attesting to the veracity of vaccine certificate uploads by having medical professionals weed out forgeries.
""The demand (to automate) is there. There's just a myriad different hoops to get through,"" said Mohammad Gaber, chief executive of VaxYes developer GoGet.
AIRPORTS TO BALLPARKS 
Clear users upload a driver's license or other identity document and take a selfie, which the system checks to make sure they match before connecting to COVID-19 test results from hundreds of labs or the proof of vaccination.
Some venues also require a symptom survey on Clear or an automated temperature check at a Clear kiosk. 
Users get a ""green"" pass with their headshot and a QR code to show staff or scan at entrances. Venues pay for the system.
Texas music festival Electric Cookout adopted Health Pass to reduce chances of an outbreak, said co-founder Pooja Shah. About 50 out of 1,200 attendees used it at an April event and received access to special areas, she said. 
Clear's primary service, priced at $179 annually, enables customers to use biometric scans to skip ID card inspections at nearly 40 U.S. airports. It also offers a free service enabling registered users to jet through ""Clear lanes"" to access entertainment venues.
Combining subscribers and non-paying users, Clear, whose services also go by Alclear and Secure Identity, said it has about 5.7 million members.
The company will not disclose financial results, but announced in February a $100 million funding round with investors including growth firm General Atlantic and the National Football League's 32 Equity fund. 
Clear still has hurdles to become accepted and get people comfortable with using it. 
The Seattle Mariners baseball team promoted Clear's technology for ID-less beer purchases from 2018 through 2019. The team said the effort did not generate ""meaningful"" usage data.
Washington state's alcohol regulator said Clear cannot be the ""sole methodology for ascertaining legal age."" 
Clear said it was pleased with results and continues to educate regulators.

The Giants aim to enable card-less concession sales this year, and its chief business development officer, Jason Pearl, is enthusiastic about Clear's technology. ""I don't think anyone else comes close.""

Officials should announce reopening before the Group of Seven economic talks scheduled for June, the groups said Monday in joint letters to President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
“We are confident that the right tools now exist to enable a safe and meaningful restart to transatlantic travel,” said the letter from 49 industry groups and unions on both sides of the Atlantic. “Safely reopening borders between the U.S. and U.K. is essential for both countries’ economic recovery from Covid-19.”
Exports between the two countries and tourism represent have a significant impact on each nation’s economy, highlighting the importance of resuming more normal travel, the group said.

Further, the outlook for oil remains positive due to lower production and a surge in demand this summer.We’re seeing strength in commodities across the board. In fact, a handful are making new, all-time highs such as copper, iron ore, and lumber. Even the laggards are starting to move higher such as crude oil, gasoline, and natural gas.
The factors driving strength in these assets are pretty similar. The coronavirus resulted in significant production disruptions, and many companies aggressively cut costs including capital expenditures to preserve cash. Like the rest of the world, they anticipated a meaningful time period in which demand would remain weak. However, demand did not drop as much as anticipated and for many commodities - it’s now higher than it was in 2019. 
Of course, a contributing factor is that the previous bear market in energy has led many companies to be hesitant about taking on more debt and invest significantly in new production. Prices may have to go much higher before supply starts increasing. Thus, in the intermediary, energy prices could have significantly more upside in the coming months. To take advantage of this, investors should consider investing in these 3 energy stocks: Sandridge Energy (SD), Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ), and Sunoco LP (SUN).

This offers investors a buying opportunity to scoop up quality biotech stocks such as Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) at cheaper prices.Biotech stocks experienced a massive rally in 2020. The SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI) soared over 110% from April 8th, 2020, until its high on February 8th of this year. This was more than twice the S&P 500’s gain of 42% over the same period. The industry rose on the excitement of potential Covid-19 treatments and vaccines.
However, since February of this year, shares of biotech companies have underperformed. Many stocks in the industry were stung by setbacks in clinical trials, a rotation away from growth stocks, drug-pricing reforms, and delayed drug approvals. But I believe the selloff is overdone, as these factors weighing on the industry are temporary. The overall bullish growth story for biotech innovations and advancements remains. Traders are starting to agree with me as XBI has been trending upward over the past couple of trading sessions.
Investors are starting to realize that while COVID is improving in the United States, there are still parts of the world, such as India, plagued by the virus. This means eyes are back on biotech companies, as the pandemic not only brought attention to companies working on vaccines but also biotechs that were not. That is why I am recommending  Gilead Sciences Inc . (NASDAQ:GILD) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:VRTX), two biotech firms I believe will see their shares rise in the months ahead.

Cannabis is one such example of this phenomenon. Until 2000, less than 30% of Americans approved of its legalization for recreational use. Today, two-thirds of the country is in support.
So it’s not surprising that laws and regulations surrounding cannabis are also changing. In the US, marijuana is now available in 36 states for medicinal use and recreational use in 17 states. Given cannabis’ increased acceptance and use especially among young people, it’s likely to be legalized federally in the not-too-distant future. This would be a major development, as it would allow the industry to more easily access financial services to enable its growth.
Currently, the global cannabis industry is estimated to be worth $24.6 billion and expand at a 14.3% rate through 2028.

1429,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2021 10:15AM ET</span>","Distributors' 'mountain' of pills fueled opioid epidemic, W.Va. judge told","By Brendan Pierson
(Reuters) -A city and county in West Virginia launched their case against the three largest U.S. drug distributors at a widely anticipated trial on Monday, accusing them of fueling the opioid crisis that has resulted in nearly 500,000 overdose deaths in the United States over two decades.
""We intend to prove the simple truth that the distributor defendants sold a mountain of opioid pills into our community, fueling the opioid epidemic,"" Paul Farrell, a lawyer for the city of Huntington and Cabell County, said in his opening statement in Charleston, West Virginia.
Lawyers for the distributors - AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp, McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK) and  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH) - are expected to give their opening statements later in the day.
The companies have denied the claims, arguing they cannot be liable for distributing pills that were prescribed by doctors.
Huntington and Cabell, along with other West Virginia towns and counties, opted out of a proposed $26 billion nationwide settlement with the three distributors and drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).
A verdict in the trial, before U.S. District Judge David Faber, could help lay the groundwork for settlements in the sprawling nationwide litigation over the opioid crisis, which encompasses more than 3,300 lawsuits by local governments around the country against opioid manufacturers, distributors and pharmacies.

Opioids resulted in the overdose deaths of nearly 500,000 people in the United States from 1999 to 2019, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. West Virginia is among the hardest hit states, recording more opioid prescriptions and overdose deaths per capita than any other in 2018, according to data from the National Institutes of Health.
Another opioid trial is underway in a case brought by California counties against J&J and other drugmakers, and a trial in a case brought by New York counties is scheduled to begin next month.

The new valuation for the Jack Ma-founded company, which has been forced to restructure following scrutiny from Beijing, was $144 billion as at the end of February, based on regulatory filings cited by the WSJ. 
Ant declined to comment. Fidelity did not immediately to respond to a request for comment. 
The $144 billion valuation compares with an appraised value of $295 billion as at the end of August, the WSJ report said. Fidelity was among a small group of global investors that bought into Ant three years ago.
Ant's $37 billion initial public offering (IPO) in Shanghai and Hong Kong, which would have been the largest in the world, was cancelled in November soon after Ma made a speech in Shanghai in which he called for reform of China's regulatory system.
Since then, Ant has restructured to become a financial holding company which analysts have said could dent Ant's appeal to investors because of higher capital requirements that could reduce growth prospects. . 
Fidelity's reported valuation was to the end of February and would not have taken into account the impact of Ant Group's restructuring announced in April. 

In May 2018, Fidelity invested about $238 million in Ant on behalf of various funds, the WSJ reported, citing Ant's IPO prospectus, in a round that valued the company at about $150 billion, higher than the U.S. asset manager's current valuation of Ant.
Reuters reported in March that some of Ant Group's global investors valued the Chinese company at more than $200 billion based on its 2020 performance, less than the potential $315 billion valuation touted ahead of its listing.

The automaker will stop production at its Cologne plant twice, from May 3rd to June 18th and then from June 30th until workers return from the summer break in mid-August. Output at its Saarlouis factory will also halt for much of the current month and into June, according to the company.
“We will make up for the lost production as best as we can,” a Ford spokesman said via email. “We are working to improve the situation as soon as possible.”
News of outages in Germany comes after Ford last week said the dearth of semiconductors would cut its second quarter production in half, joining a list of automakers flagging fresh stoppages. In recent weeks, Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc, Volvo Group and Mitsubishi Motors (OTC:MMTOF) Corp. and BMW AG have joined the list of carmakers idling factories.
Ford’s Cologne plant assembles the Fiesta (NASDAQ:FRGI) model and produces around 1,000 cars per day when operating normally. The Saarlouis plant produces the Focus model and also makes around 1,000 autos per day. The Cologne plant also manufacturers engines.
The chip shortage could cost automakers $61 billion in lost sales this year, according to consultant AlixPartners. Germany’s Bild newspaper earlier reported the closure decisions.

(Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rebuffed a bid by current and former employees of  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co to revive a lawsuit over losses to their retirement plan following a scandal over fake accounts that rattled the bank in 2016 and led to billions of dollars in fines and penalties. 
The justices declined to hear an appeal by the employees of a lower court ruling that threw out their proposed class action case against San Francisco-based Wells Fargo under a federal law requiring careful management of private-sector retirement plans. 
The case centered on the fallout from revelations, beginning in 2016, that Wells Fargo employees opened millions of unauthorized customer accounts after pressure by the bank to meet unrealistic sales goals. Wells Fargo in 2020 agreed to pay $3 billion to settle a joint investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Justice Department.
Participants in Wells Fargo's 401(k) retirement plan funds that invested in the company's own stock sued the bank and the plan's administrators in 2016 in federal court in Minnesota, accusing them of breaching their duty to act prudently under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).
The employees who filed suit said the administrators did nothing to halt Wells Fargo's fraudulent practices or protect the plan from the fallout, such as by disclosing the problem to the public. Instead, the employees said in court papers, the plan kept purchasing Wells Fargo stock. After the revelations in September 2016, the plan lost $1 billion, the employees said in court papers. 
Under a 2014 Supreme Court precedent aimed at weeding out meritless litigation whenever a company's stock price drops, plaintiffs must show that a prudent administrator faced with insider information would have considered an alternative course of action. 

The St. Louis-based 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2020 threw out the case, finding that the employees had not adequately shown that prudent fund managers would have erred on the side of earlier disclosure. 
The Supreme Court in 2020 issued a ruling involving a similar lawsuit by participants in  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) Corp's retirement plan that did not resolve the dispute over when cases may proceed.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened May brightly, with plenty of willingness to buy the dip caused by end-of-month profit-taking on Friday. 
The market was underpinned by expectations that the coming week will bring further evidence of a robust economic recovery, in the shape of the ADP and official labor market reports on Wednesday and Friday respectively. Analysts expect the U.S. economy to have added nearly 1 million jobs in April as lockdown restrictions were lifted across the country and infection rates fell against a backdrop of wider vaccine-induced immunity. The 988,000 job gain would be even more than the 916,000 jobs added in March.
Concerns about a possible tightening of monetary policy remain muted, meanwhile, despite comments by Dallas Federal Reserve President Robert Kaplan last Friday that it is already appropriate to talk about reducing the pace of bond purchases from the current rate of $120 billion a month. 
Kaplan is a noted hawk among the central bank's top management and his voice seems set to remain a minority one for some time yet.
As of 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 265 points, or 0.8%, at 34,139 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.2%.
Amon the early movers was  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ) stock, which rose 0.7% after the company said it has agreed to sell various media assets including Yahoo and AOL to Apollo, drawing a line under an unsuccessful foray into advertising technology.
Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) stock rose 1.7% after the company reported a swing to profit of over $11 billion in the first quarter at its annual shareholder meeting at the weekend, which was also notable for fresh scorn heaped by Berkshire’s Charlie Munger upon the cryptocurrency trading boom. Warren Buffett's investment firm has seemed increasingly out of touch with contemporary market trends in recent years, refusing to embrace the hype of crypto and numerous other innovations in markets, such as SPACs (another target for Munger's wrath).
SPACs were in the headlines again on Monday as Swiss biotech company Roivant Sciences agreed to be taken public by the  Montes Archimedes Acquisition  Corp (NASDAQ:MAAC) set up by former KKR dealmaker Jim Momtazee, in a deal that values Roivant at $7.3 billion.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN) is launching plant-based hamburgers and sausages ahead of the summer grilling season, the company said on Monday, increasing competition for Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) as it releases an updated version of its own faux burger.
Purveyors of plant-based meat are seeking to boost sales as COVID-19 vaccinations encourage more people to eat at restaurants and gather for backyard cookouts and other events.
Companies like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods aim to meet consumer demands for more climate-friendly diets, but sales of some of their products have slowed more recently as the plant-based trend cools.
Tyson Foods, the biggest U.S. producer of animal meat by sales, introduced its first plant-based products in 2019. It is adding burger patties, bratwurst, Italian sausage and ground ""meat"" made from pea protein to its offerings, according to a statement. 
The burgers, marketed under Tyson's Raised & Rooted brand, will be sold in packages of two quarter-pound patties at a suggested retail price of $4.99.
Tyson is making another attempt at an alternative burger after phasing out a patty last year that was a blend of beef and plants.
Beyond Meat, meanwhile, is launching a new version of its plant-based Beyond Burger at grocery stores nationwide this week, it said in an April 27 statement. 
Packages of two quarter-pound patties have a suggested retail price of $5.99, while new packs of four patties have a suggested price of $9.99, according to the company. A one-pound Beyond Beef pack will also be sold.
Beyond Meat already sells plant-based bratwurst and Italian sausage.
Its updated burger is juicier and ""BBQ-ier"" than a previous version and resembles the flavor of ground beef, according to the company. Each Beyond Burger patty has 20 grams of protein, compared to 21 grams per serving for Tyson's burger.

""Our products are plants made meatier,"" said David Ervin, vice president of marketing for Tyson's Raised & Rooted brand.

1436,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2021 09:00AM ET</span>",Time's up for 'zombie' German firms as insolvency waiver expires,"By Paul Carrel and Andreas Rinke
BERLIN (Reuters) - The reprieve is over. A year-long waiver on insolvency filings has ended in Germany and there are already signs that bankruptcies are starting to pick up in Europe's largest economy.
Germany introduced the waiver last March, when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, part of a package of measures aimed at supporting businesses but which gave rise to the charge that the government was simply propping up ""zombie companies"" with no future.
Insolvencies duly fell. But since October, Berlin has phased out the waiver. This year only firms awaiting state aid provided since November were exempt from filing - until now. Monday is the first business day that exemption no longer applies.
""The expiry of the supposed protection means a return to regular competitive conditions and market-economy transparency,"" said Patrik-Ludwig Hantzsch at German credit agency Creditreform.
That is welcome news to local critics who say the fall in insolvencies is proof in itself the state has done more than enough and now risks impeding what economic liberals hail as ""creative destruction"", the term popularised in the 1940s by Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter to describe unviable firms folding to make way for more dynamic newcomers.
The latest official numbers, for January, show corporate insolvencies down 31.1% on the year at 1,108. But the phase-out of the waiver from October has yet to show in the data as cases make their way through the courts, the Statistics Office said.
The headline numbers also belie a rise in insolvency proceedings opened, which give an indication of the future path of actual insolvencies.
In November of last year, a month after the phase-out of the waiver began, there was a 5% rise in these proceedings after a steady fall earlier in the year, a Federal Statistics Office tally of notices from local courts in Germany shows.
The number of proceedings opened rose by 18% in December, before dipping 5% in January and then rising by 30% on the month in February, and by 37% in March.
The European Union's top economic watchdog said last week EU governments must step in to avert a wave of insolvencies by healthy companies that are struggling due to the pandemic.
Bankruptcies in western Europe are seen rising by around a third this year compared to pre-pandemic levels as governments withdraw extraordinary support measures such as loan guarantees, raising the spectre of a surge in unemployment and steep losses for banks.
In Germany, the legal policy spokesman of the Social Democrats' parliamentary group, Johannes Fechner, vowed to try one last time this week to convince their CDU/CSU conservative ruling coalition partners to extend the waiver by two months.
Many companies would otherwise have to file for insolvency because state aid had not yet been paid out, Fechner said.
""These companies got into the crisis through no fault of their own and would be entitled to state aid. Thousands of jobs are on the line, and families' livelihoods depend on them,"" Fechner added.
""NO TSUNAMI""
Industry experts say a retroactive extension would not work.
""If a company has to apply (for insolvency) at the beginning of May, suppliers immediately demand payment in advance, customers jump ship and employees quit. The damage can then no longer be revised,"" Lucas Floether, chairman of the Gravenbrucher Kreis group of insolvency administrators, told Reuters last month.
Carsten Linnemann, vice-chairman of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group, said the end of the waiver affected only a small number of companies that had applied for coronavirus state aid and were still waiting for payment. 
One person familiar with government estimates said there is ""no insolvency tsunami"" expected in Germany due to other extensive support measures, including a government-backed 'Kurzarbeit' shortened hours facility.
The end of the waiver comes after the German economy contracted by a greater than expected 1.7% in the first quarter as a lockdown in place since November to contain the coronavirus stifled private consumption.
But Berenberg Bank economist Holger Schmieding did not expect a rise in insolvencies to delay an economic rebound, as robust global demand and the reopening of the domestic service economy would matter far more.

""Against that backdrop, a temporary spike in insolvencies will have no significant impact on overall business and consumer confidence and spending,"" he said.

Stocks of electric-mobility firms like Nikola Corp., Lordstown Motors Corp. and Romeo Power Inc. that went public by merging with special-purpose acquisition companies are down at least 69% from dizzying peaks, as investors question whether their visions for a greener future are divorced from reality.
For months, the SEC has raised concern that investors aren’t fully informed of risks embedded in SPACs, also known as “blank-check” companies. The agency warned in early April that the safe-harbor provision -- which allows sponsors, targets and others to make business projections -- protects participants only from private lawsuits, not SEC enforcement. Senator John Kennedy introduced legislation to boost disclosures for SPAC founders.
A crackdown could chill the SPAC market, according to Carol Anne Huff, co-chair of Winston & Strawn’s capital markets practice. “Forward-looking statements are sometimes wrong, and issuers need comfort to make projections on good faith,” Huff said.
Tighter rules would cut to the heart of the relationship between SPACs and green startups, which feed each other’s gauzy optimism. SPACs are publicly traded pools of money that seek to buy an existing company in a particular industry. Merging with an EV startup fulfills that goal, with an implied promise of big returns to come. The EV gets cash and protection -- the safe-harbor -- to tell public investors about its business plan and the green revolution.
The SEC push for more substance jeopardizes this marriage of convenience. Already, SPAC filings dropped to about 30 last month, from February’s red-hot peak of 188.
The risk isn’t hypothetical. Even with the safe harbor, SPACs targeting EVs and autonomous driving drew lawsuits more often than those in other industries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Law.
SPACs paved the way to public markets for at least nine electric-mobility plays including EV makers, charging station operators and battery developers since 2020, with more coming.
For a budding industry with tremendous growth potential such as clean tech, projections are critical, because there’s no past performance to tout and sometimes no product on the market, said Daniel Gross, a Yale University lecturer and chief investment officer of Climate Real Impact Solutions.
“EVs are the future, but not today in terms of total penetration,” Gross said. “So if you can’t tell your story, how do you scale into a market that the investor community believes in?”
Their audience is already wary, said Erika Karp, chief impact officer of Pathstone, an advisory firm to wealthy families. Sustainably minded investors are skeptical about SPACs, given that the starting premise -- you’ll find out what you own later -- is antithetical to that style of investing, which champions transparency, she says.
“Investors in SPACs take a big leap of faith for the sponsor; the sponsor takes another leap of faith in the company they buy,” Karp said. “There are lots of leaps of faith going on here.”
Nikola’s Skid
One dramatic blowup came from Nikola, which featured a colorful founder, Trevor Milton, and plans for an electric semi-truck and hydrogen fuel. Those helped Nikola forge a partnership with General Motors Co (NYSE:GM)., which faltered amid accusations it misled investors. Nikola’s stock, which topped $93 last year, now hovers around $11.
A representative for Phoenix-based Nikola said it’s “executing on our long-term strategy and vision to be a global leader in zero-emissions transportation.” Vernon, California-based Romeo declined to comment and Lordstown, named after the Ohio town where it’s based, didn’t respond to messages.
Buzzy trends also boosted the appeal of EV-plays, notably the rise of environmental, social and governance. That’s apparent in the language of SPAC prospectuses, said David Pogemiller, chief of research firm Boardroom Alpha. More than a third of 500-plus filings he studied included such passages.
Applying tenets of ESG investing such as transparency and good governance helps cut through the hype. BoardRoom analyzed those filings and found only 43 had passages indicating serious intent, based on prominence, phrasing and frequency.
Among the top 10 ranked for intent are SPACs tied to ex-NRG chief David Crane, including one that has a deal with charging-station operator EVgo; Riverstone’s Decarbonization Plus Acquisition SPACs, with one set to take public Hyzon Motors, a supplier of fuel-cell powered vehicles; and Peridot Acquisition, linked to lithium-ion battery recycler Li-Cycle Corp.
Overall, “greener” SPACs outperformed. Those 10 firms averaged 18% gains from their IPO offering through April 23, beating the total group’s 3.4%, Boardroom’s data show. Whether investors will get pickier is another matter.
“There is a drive for ESG-branded products because fees are higher and investors don’t care, because there’s a perception they’re doing good for the world,” said Julian Klymochko, manager of a SPAC-focused ETF at Calgary-based Accelerate Financial Technologies.

1442,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2021 07:31AM ET</span>","In Mexico autos town, labor rights falter despite U.S. trade deal","By Daina Beth Solomon
MATAMOROS, Mexico (Reuters) - After successfully staging a wildcat strike for higher wages in 2019, many workers at the Tridonex auto-parts plant in the Mexican city of Matamoros, across the border from Texas, set their sights higher: replacing the union that they say failed to fight for them. 
Six workers at the factory, which refits second-hand car parts for sale in the United States and Canada, told Reuters they felt let down that their union, SITPME, did not back their demands for better pay. About 400 Tridonex workers protested outside a Matamoros labor court last year to be allowed to switch unions.
When the first protests broke out in 2019, many of the plant's roughly 4,000 workers earned just above the then-minimum wage of 176.72 pesos ($8.82) a day.
The Tridonex workers and thousands more at other Matamoros factories walked off the job demanding a 20% raise and 32,000-peso bonus, many without union backing. In nearly all cases, the companies conceded. 
""This showed us what we were capable of,"" said Edgar Salazar, then a Tridonex employee. ""We know we have rights, but the union just wants to cash in. It doesn't support us at all.""
Jesus Mendoza, SITPME's long-time leader, said his union generated jobs and delivered perks to its members while maintaining harmonious relationships with employers.
However, Salazar and many of his Tridonex colleagues wanted to throw their support behind a new organization led by activist and attorney Susana Prieto. 
But their efforts are failing, labor experts acknowledge.
Dismantling the power of Mexico's entrenched unions is proving a tough challenge, some labor activists say, with few signs that reforms promised under a new North American trade deal are yet charting an easier course.
Amid resistance from SITPME, the Tridonex workers' request to be represented by Prieto's union has still not been put to a vote. Legal challenges by attorney Prieto to replace unions at 45 other factories in the area have also stalled. 
When Prieto urged strikes in January to again demand higher pay, just a few hundred people protested across a handful of companies. 
""They're scared, because they don't have anyone to defend them,"" Prieto said. According to Prieto, about 600 of her supporters at Tridonex -- including Salazar -- were fired between April and October 2020. Reuters could not independently confirm this. 
Cardone Industries, Tridonex's Philadelphia-based parent, did not respond to a question about allegations of retaliation.
It says layoffs were made due to reduced demand following pandemic lockdowns but did not provide further details. Cardone is controlled by Canadian company Brookfield Asset Management. 
SLOW PROGRESS
Leftist President Manuel Andres Lopez Obrador passed a law in 2019 guaranteeing workers the right to independent unions. Though strong on paper, it does not come fully into effect until 2023. 
""The law in general is very good. But that doesn't mean we're going to get any change in Mexico anytime soon,"" said Kimberly Nolan, a labor scholar at the Latin American Faculty of Social Sciences research institute. 
Some of the Matamoros workers are now looking to the United States for backing. 
A new free trade deal between Mexico, the United States and Canada (USMCA) implemented last year enshrined workers' rights to choose which union administers their collective contract.
With Democrat Joe Biden now president, Mexico may come under close scrutiny to uphold the USMCA's pro-worker provisions, which were partly designed to prevent low labor costs from leeching more U.S. jobs. 
Under the treaty, companies failing to ensure freedom of association for workers in Mexico could be sanctioned with tariffs and other penalties. 
The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, which runs U.S. trade policy, did not respond to a question of how the Biden administration would treat violations of the trade pact's labor measures. 
But Katherine Tai, head of the agency, said last week she was ""not afraid"" to use the enforcement provisions of the USMCA, without specifying which issues could come under review. 
The powerful U.S. union federation, the AFL-CIO, told Reuters in April it was drafting cases against companies in Mexico under USMCA, and would make details public in May. 
Matamoros is one of a string of Mexican border cities which American firms were lured to by cheap labor in recent decades. Its factories supply parts for General Motors Co (NYSE:GM),  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, Stellantis and other automakers. 
Booming trade with the United States has brought jobs to areas of northern Mexico but labor rights lag. 
Companies in Mexico have commonly fired workers, among other tactics, rather than allow them to agitate for new unions, say activists, scholars and government officials. 
""They fire them; they suppress them. They stop giving extra hours. They don't give bonuses. They change them to night shift,"" said Alfredo Dominguez, head of the Federal Center of Conciliation and Labor Registration, created under the labor reform to ensure collective contracts are legitimate.
One of the labor ministry's priorities is to eliminate so-called ""protection contracts,"" signed between unions and employers without workers' prior consultation or knowledge, which Dominguez said make up at least 80% of all collective contracts in Mexico.  
The labor reform, once implemented, will also do away with local panels blamed by labor activists for long delays in the process of establishing new unions like Prieto's. The boards will be replaced with tribunals reporting to the judicial branch.
NEW TACTICS 
Frustrated by delays in setting up a new union, hundreds of Tridonex workers early in 2020 opted for a new tactic: declaring they no longer wanted to pay dues to the established union, SITPME. After several tense protests, Tridonex consented. 
Then firings began, four workers told Reuters. 
In March 2020, Efren Ruiz, who cleaned and assembled brake parts for Tridonex and was a vocal advocate of Prieto's union, was dismissed. 
""This is reprisal,"" Ruiz remembered telling a supervisor, before security guards escorted him out, he said. 
Three other workers also said they believed their union activism led to their dismissals. A government record seen by Reuters, dated October 30, 2020, shows Tridonex dismissed 717 people from April to October last year. 
Reuters was unable to determine if any have been hired back since. Mexico's Social Security Institute, which tracks employment, said it could not comment on individual companies. 
Prieto said the firings were retaliation by the company to protect SITPME and prevent more strikes for better pay. 
SITPME leader Mendoza described complaints of retaliation as ""lies."" Cardone said in a statement the staff reduction was due to a drop in demand and was ""managed through transparent and constructive discussions with employees and relevant trade unions.""
SITPME - which extols membership perks such as medical and legal aid - said it lured back at least 3,000 people from different companies who had supported Prieto's breakaway group. Reuters could not independently confirm this. 

Mendoza noted that he strives for dialogue with companies, not strikes: ""What we do well is guarantee labor peace and efficiency in the workforce.""

1443,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2021 07:30AM ET</span>",Digital Dollar Project to launch five U.S. central bank digital currency pilots,"By Michelle Price
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. nonprofit Digital Dollar Project said on Monday it will launch five pilot programs over the next 12 months to test the potential uses of a U.S. central bank digital currency, the first effort of its kind in the United States. 
The private-sector pilots initially will be funded by Accenture (NYSE:ACN) Plc and involve financial firms, retailers and NGOs, among others. The aim is to generate data that could help U.S. policymakers develop a digital dollar. 
A partnership between Accenture and the Digital Dollar Foundation, the Digital Dollar Project was created last year to promote research into a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC).
""There are conferences and papers coming out every week around the world on CBDCs based on data from other countries,"" said Christopher Giancarlo, former chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and co-founder of the Digital Dollar Foundation.
""What there is not, is any real data and testing from the United States to inform that debate. We're seeking to generate that real-world data,"" Giancarlo added.
CBDCs are the digital equivalent of banknotes and coins, giving holders a direct digital claim on the central bank and allowing them to make instant electronic payments.
While debit cards or payment apps are a form of digital cash, those transactions are created by commercial banks based on money central banks credit to those banks' accounts. They are not fully government-backed, can take days to settle, and often incur fees. Cryptocurrencies, meanwhile, are controlled by private actors. 
Central banks around the world, including in China and Europe, are revving up CBDC projects to fend off threats from cryptocurrencies and improve payment systems. 
As guardian of the world's most widely used currency, the U.S. Federal Reserve is moving more cautiously. It is working with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to build a technology platform for a hypothetical digital dollar, but chair Jerome Powell said last week that it is ""far more important"" to get a digital dollar right than it is to be fast.
Giancarlo said Powell was correct to be cautious but that as China pushes ahead, the United States must drive a discussion on incorporating U.S. values such as privacy and freedom of commerce and speech into the development of CBDCs. 
""It's vital that the U.S. asserts leadership as it has in previous technological innovations,"" Giancarlo added.
A digital dollar could also boost financial inclusion in the United States, where transaction fees impede the access of many Americans to mainstream financial services, Giancarlo said.
The pilot programs, three of which will launch in the next two months, will complement the Fed's MIT project by generating data on the functional, sociological, business uses, benefits and other facets, of a digital dollar. The data is due to be released publicly.
Accenture has worked on a number of CBDC projects including in Canada, Singapore and France.
David Treat, a senior managing director at Accenture, said CBDCs would exist alongside other forms of physical and electronic money, rather than replace them. 

""It's not a panacea for all money,"" Treat said. ""We will be using physical cash and coin for some time.""

Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures were mostly higher in overnight trade on Monday, with investors buying into a dip that was caused by month-end profit-taking on Friday. 
Trading was set to be thinner than usual, with the U.K., China and various other markets all closed for the May Day holiday.
By 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), Dow Jones futures were up 207 points, or 0.6%, at 33,974 points. The S&P 500 futures contract was up 0.5% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was up a more modest 0.3%.
The events of the last week have reinforced impressions that stocks are an attractive place to be at a time when the economy is recovering increasingly clearly from the pandemic, with vigorous tailwinds from both fiscal and monetary policy. Those impressions will be tested on Wednesday and Friday with the latest reports on the pace of hiring, first from ADP and then from the government. Such reports will indicate just how rapid and substantial the economy's progress is.
The day's data calendar is relatively light, with the ISM's manufacturing survey at 10 AM ET the highlight. ISM's PMI hit a 36-year high of 64.7 in March and analysts point out that stocks typically tend to do badly when the ISM's main index is above 60, because it triggers expectations of tighter monetary policy.
However, the current recovery is not a usual economic cycle-type story, and many argue against giving much weight to such arguments.
One of few stocks to deviate from the positive trend in premarket trading was Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), after the German trade publication Automobilwoche reported at the weekend that its proposed factory in Berlin may postpone mass production by some six months to the end of next January, due to delays in gaining key building permits and other issues. Tesla hasn't confirmed the report.
Estee Lauder heads the roster of companies reporting earnings on Monday, with Loews, Williams, WEC Energy and Diamondback also all due
Commodity futures were largely rangebound in early trading, after data from the CFTC on Friday showing big gains in net long positioning in agricultural contracts and metals in particular. Gold Futures were up 0.6% at $1,778 a troy ounce, while U.S. crude futures were up 0.3% at $63.76 a barrel.

1449,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2021 04:50AM ET</span>","Tesla, under scrutiny in China, steps up engagement with regulators - sources","By Yilei Sun and Tony Munroe
BEIJING (Reuters) -Electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, facing scrutiny in China over safety and customer service complaints, is boosting its engagement with mainland regulators and beefing up its government relations team, industry sources said.
Tesla's change of strategy leading to more behind-the-scenes interaction with policymakers in Beijing compared to relatively little previously shows the seriousness with which the U.S. automaker views the setbacks in its second-biggest market.
It also comes at a time when China is trying to regulate large and powerful private companies, especially in the technology sector, on concerns about their market dominance. 
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday, a public holiday in China.
As they do elsewhere, regulators in China, the world's biggest auto market, discuss industry policies and standards with global and local companies, industry associations and think tanks.
Manufacturers typically join such meetings in China, but unlike rivals including  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Tesla officials were largely absent from the closed-door gatherings, according to four people familiar with the matter.
Instead, Tesla officials regularly speak at high-profile industry conferences. Outside China, Tesla's outspoken chief executive Elon Musk regularly takes to Twitter to comment on or criticise regulators or rules.
But in past weeks, Tesla executives attended at least four policy discussions, on topics including auto data storage, vehicle-to-infrastructure communication technologies, car recycling and carbon emissions, the people said. 
California-based Tesla, which makes electric Model 3 sedans and Model Y sport-utility vehicles at its own plant in Shanghai, did not make major commitments at the meetings, but participated in some discussions, they said.
RECRUITMENT ADS
Tesla is also expanding its government relationship team in China, one of the sources said.
According to two recruitment advertisements in April on its WeChat account, Tesla is hiring managers to update a policy database and maintain relationships with government and industry associations to ""build a harmonious external environment to support Tesla's business development in the regional market.""
It was not immediately clear how many managers Tesla was planning to hire for government relations. 
Accounting for roughly 30% of Tesla's global sales, China is the automaker's second biggest market after the United States and helped it post record first-quarter vehicle deliveries.
Pressure has been building over the past few months on Tesla's mostly excellent relations with Beijing. 
In February, Chinese regulators summoned it over consumer reports of battery fires, unexpected acceleration and failures in over-the-air software updates.
And in March, Tesla came under scrutiny when the military banned its cars from entering its complexes, citing security concerns over vehicle cameras, sources told Reuters at the time. Days later, Musk appeared by video at a high-level forum, saying that if Tesla used cars to spy in China or anywhere, it would be shut down.
Last month, Tesla was targeted by state media and regulators after a customer, angry over the handling of her complaint about malfunctioning brakes, climbed on top of a Tesla car in protest at the Shanghai auto show. Videos of the incident went viral.

Grace Tao, a Tesla vice president who heads its government relations effort in China, was criticised in state media last month after she was quoted in a media interview questioning whether the aggrieved customer was acting on her own. 
In response to the different complaints, Tesla has said it would set up a China data center, launch self-inspection to improve services and work with regulators.

1450,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2021 04:30AM ET</span>",European shares rally as investors begin May in bullish mood,"By Tommy Wilkes
LONDON (Reuters) - European shares gained on Monday as investors bullish about the global economic recovery looked ahead to a busy week for U.S. economic data that is expected to underline the strength of the rebound. 
With China, Japan and Britain closed for public holidays, volumes were thin and Asian shares got off to a slow start, with most markets slipping into the red.
But investors' optimistic mood, enhanced by a strong run of corporate earnings the past two weeks, has extended into May in Europe.
The Euro STOXX index rose 0.68% in early trading, while the German DAX gained 0.7% and France's CAC 40 0.61%.
Wall Street futures were higher, pointing to yet more gains after stock markets notched up another round of record highs last week.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, was flat on the day and below record highs, however, as losses in Asia offset the gains in Europe.
Underpinning investors' enthusiasm for riskier assets is the sense that the global economy is about to boom as countries come out of lockdowns and consumers and businesses unleash some of their excess savings built up over the past year.
German retail sales data for March came in far better than expected, underlying that a U.S.-led economic rebound is now gaining traction elsewhere.
Recent business surveys have also pointed to soaring confidence about the recovery, although some economists think businesses may be getting ahead of themselves and influenced more by the success and speed of COVID-19 vaccination rollouts.
""The data has been unrealistically strong in recent months - while the underlying economy is performing very well, manufacturing growth is not quite at the stratospheric levels the surveys imply,"" said UBS economist Paul Donovan.
""Newsflow about the vaccination cycle may be more important in dictating answers to sentiment surveys than actual economic activity.""
A busy week for U.S. economic data is expected to show resounding strength, particularly for the ISM manufacturing survey and April payrolls. Forecasts are that 978,000 jobs were created in the month as consumers spent their stimulus money and the economy opened up more.
Analysts at NatWest Markets, for instance, see U.S. payrolls surging by 1.25 million in April with unemployment diving to 5.2%, from 6% in March.
Such gains could stir speculation of a tapering in asset purchases by the Federal Reserve, though Chair Jerome Powell has shown every sign of staying patient on policy.
Powell is due to speak later on Monday and will be followed by a raft of Fed officials this week. Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan caused a stir on Friday by calling for beginning the conversation about tapering.
Powell's patience has helped limit selling pressure in Treasuries, yet 10-year yields still ended last week with a rise of 6 basis points. They were last 1.626%, down marginally on the day.
The rise offered some support to the U.S. dollar, which has been pressured by the rapid expansion of the U.S. budget and trade deficits, a byproduct of the economy's outperformance.
The dollar index stood at 91.218 and off a two-month trough of 90.422, though it still ended April with a loss of 2%.
The euro rose 0.2% to $1.2040, having backtracked from a nine-week peak of $1.2149 on Friday.
Cryptocurrency ether scaled a new record high beyond $3,000 as investors bet that it will be of ever greater use in a decentralised future financial system. Its lightning rally - now up 325% in 2021 - has eclipsed that of bigger rival bitcoin.
Oil prices ran into profit-taking, having ended last month with gains of 6% to 8%. [O/R]

Reports of possible interest in the largest telecoms provider in the Netherlands have surfaced repeatedly for months, driving up KPN's share price by about 45% since early October despite resistance from the company and the Dutch government against any foreign takeover.
Chief Executive Joost Farwerck on Friday said he was not looking to sell the company, pointing out that it was investing in infrastructure for the first time in 26 years.
KPN clearly has ""the intention to quell takeover rumours, (and has) no intention to be sold"", ING analyst David Vagman wrote in a note.
Apart from KPN's own resistance, efforts to buy KPN will need the approval of the Dutch government, which has the power to block any telecoms takeover it deems a threat to national security.
But other analysts said that fear of government intervention might not stop some parties from trying.
""Regarding EQT/Stonepeak, we believe it may not be their last attempt to pursue a takeover"", KBC Securities said, adding that KPN would be the right fit for the suitors, which already have stakes in other telecoms businesses.
EQT already owns the Netherlands' second-largest fibre optic network, DeltaFiber, and could use it as a vehicle to buy parts of KPN's fibre business and extract some cost efficiencies, a source close to the matter told Reuters in November.
The Dutch ministry of Economic Affairs on Monday said it could not comment on individual companies but that Dutch telecom companies were already providing the investment in digital infrastructure it desires. 
KPN has a strong defence against unwanted takeovers bids by virtue of a foundation that can build a controlling stake to block any deal. 
This proved successful in 2013, when KPN won a lengthy battle against a takeover attempt by Mexico’s  America Movil  (NYSE:AMX), which owns 20% of KPN shares.

America Movil has described its investment as ""financial"".

The industry continued to grow last year despite the COVID-19 pandemic, although at a lower pace than in 2019, with global Islamic assets expanding by 10.6% in 2020 against growth of 17.3% the previous year.
Islamic finance, which bans interest payments and pure monetary speculation, has been on the rise for many years across markets in Africa, the Middle East and Southeast Asia, but it remains a fragmented industry with uneven implementation of its rules.
""Over the next 12 months, we could see progress on a unified global legal and regulatory framework for Islamic finance ... we believe that such a framework could help resolve the lack of standardisation and harmonisation that the Islamic finance industry has faced for decades,"" S&P said on Monday. 
The industry is expected to receive some support in the coming two years in Saudi Arabia, where mortgages and corporate lending are expected to rise as the country pushes ahead with plans to diversify the economy.
Investments in Qatar for the 2022 soccer World Cup and the Expo event in Dubai later this year are also expected to support growth.
The ratings agency forecast global issuance of Islamic bonds, or sukuk, to reach $140-155 billion this year, up from roughly $140 billion in 2020, thanks to abundant liquidity and sustained financing needs among corporates and governments.
S&P also highlighted that the full impact of the coronavirus crisis has yet to materialise and more requests for sukuk restructurings and maturity extensions, as well as higher default rates, are expected this year.
""We see pressure on real estate developers, given the drop in real estate prices in the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) and building risks in the commercial real estate sector,"" S&P said.

""Similarly, companies related to aviation, tourism, travel, and hospitality - sectors that have been severely hit by COVID-19 - will take several quarters to recover to prepandemic levels.""

The group now expects sales to grow 14% to 17% in the year to September, up from a previous forecast for 8% to 12% rise. Adjusted basic earnings per share are seen at 1.90 euros to 2.05 euros versus an earlier forecast of 1.63 euros to 1.82 euros.
The upbeat outlook is helped by booming demand for the company's COVID-19 rapid tests, which are mainly sold in Germany and generated sales of 190 million euros ($228 million) in the second quarter alone.
Siemens Healthineers said it now expects rapid antigen test revenue of around 750 million euros for its full fiscal year, up from 300 million to 350 million forecast previously.
Comparable sales in the January-March period, Siemens Healthineers' fiscal second quarter, rose almost 13% to 3.965 billion euros. Net income increased by 8% to 447 million euros.
Makers of medical-imaging gear are also benefiting from pent-up demand from hospitals, which delayed ordering in the earlier stages of the pandemic. Dutch rival Philips posted a hefty jump in quarterly profit last week.
Healthineers said sales in its imaging business were up 7%, driven by double-digit growth in its computed tomography and X-ray products.

The company aims to become a world leader in cancer care therapy with the $16.4 billion acquisition of U.S. peer Varian, which it completed last month.

Automakers around the world are shutting assembly lines due to the shortage of chips for the industry, which in some cases have been exacerbated by the former U.S. administration's actions against Chinese chip factories.
Taiwan, home to a booming semiconductor industry, is front and centre of efforts to resolve that problem, and its chipmakers have vowed to ramp up capacity.
Speaking to CBS' 60 Minutes in comments broadcast on Sunday, TSMC Chairman Mark Liu said they first heard about the shortages in December and the following month began trying to squeeze out as many chips as possible for automakers.
""Today, we think we are two months ahead, that we can catch up the minimum requirement of our customers, before the end of June,"" he said.
Asked he meant the auto chip shortage would end in two months, he said ""no"".
""There's a time lag. In car chips particularly, the supply chain is long and complex. The supply takes about seven to eight months,"" Liu added.
TSMC is the world's largest contract chipmaker.

While the chip shortage began first being felt by automakers, it has since spread to other sectors like consumer electronics.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up Monday morning, with volumes thin over the closure of two major markets in the region and re-emerging inflation concerns.
Chinese and Japanese markets are closed for a holiday.
In Australia, the ASX 200 edged up 0.14% by 10:30 PM ET (2:30 AM GMT), ahead of the Reserve Bank of Australia’s policy decision due to be handed down on Tuesday. April’s Australian Industry Group manufacturing index, released earlier in the day, was at 61.7, higher than March’s 59.9 reading.
South Korea’s KOSPI inched up 0.05% while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid 1.45%.
U.S Treasury yields held above the 1.6% mark at the close of the previous session. Inflation concerns are back in the spotlight as U.S. economic data, including GDP and initial jobless claims, released during the previous week indicated potential inflation pressures and increased talk of a possible pullback in central bank support.
Investors are also worried that central banks could begin tapering their asset purchase programs that have supported the recovery earlier than expected.
U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Robert Kaplan said on Friday that signs of excessive risk-taking suggest it’s time to start debating a reduction in bond purchases, in direct contrast with the central bank’s current dovish policy.
Kaplan currently does not hold a vote on the rate-setting committee, but investors will pay close attention to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s comments due later in the day, and those of other Fed policymakers later in the week.
On the data front, the U.S. will release more economic data, including Institute of Supply Management (ISM) Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index and April non-farm payrolls, during the week, with almost a million jobs forecast to have been created during the month as Americans spent their stimulus checks and the U.S. economy continues its recovery from COVID-19.
However, some investors pointed out that the U.S. is still on the road to recovery.
""Payrolls should show another near 1 million jobs gain, but that would still leave them 7.5 million below pre-COVID levels,"" NAB director of economics Tapas Strickland told Reuters.
""Powell recently noted that it would take a string of months of job creation of about a million a month to achieve the substantial progress required to justify tapering QE,” Strickland added.
Other investors also played down inflation fears focusing instead on the Fed’s next moves.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) -  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) said on Sunday it will invest another $600 million in Israel to expand its research and development (R&D) and confirmed it was spending $10 billion on a new chip plant.
The announcement was made during a one-day visit to Israel by Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger as part of a European tour that included Germany and Belgium last week.
Intel is investing $400 million to turn its Mobileye (F:0ME) unit headquartered in Jerusalem into an R&D campus for developing self-driving car technologies.
Another $200 million will be invested in building an R&D centre, called IDC12, in the northern port city of Haifa next to its current development centre.
Intel said the ""mega chip design"" facility will have a capacity of 6,000 employees.
Gelsinger, on his first European tour since taking charge of the company in February, in a statement issued on Sunday predicted ""a vibrant future for Intel and Israel for decades to come"".
In recent years, Intel has bought three Israeli tech companies - Mobileye in 2017 for more than $15 billion, artificial intelligence chipmaker Habana in 2019 for $2 billion and Moovit a year ago for $1 billion.
During his brief visit, Gelsinger met with Intel and Mobileye management and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Israel's Finance Ministry in early 2019 said Intel would get a $1 billion grant to build an $11 billion chip plant, although at the time Intel would not confirm the amount.
On Sunday, Intel said investment would be $10 billion and the first phase of construction has begun.
Its current Fab 28 plant at the company's Kiryat Gat site produces 10 nanometre (nm) chips. 
Intel has not disclosed whether the new plant will produce smaller chips, which can increase efficiency, but in March it said it was building two 7 nm chip plants in Arizona for some $20 billion. 
Intel Israel's exports grew to a record $8 billion in 2020 from $6.6 billion in 2019, accounting for 14% of total high-tech exports and 2% of Israel's GDP.

Intel is the largest employer of Israel's high tech industry with nearly 14,000 workers.

""We will not be anywhere near as focused on buybacks going forward as we have in the past,"" Intel Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger said in an interview on the CBS news magazine ""60 Minutes"" to air on Sunday night. 
Gelsinger's comments were in response to a question comparing how much Intel has spent buying its own stock compared to its investment in research and development. 
A global shortage of semiconductor chips, critical in cars, laptops and other major consumer products, has put a spotlight on Intel, the only major U.S. chip manufacturer.
In the first quarter, Intel spent $2.3 billion on share repurchases, according to Bloomberg, which first reported Gelsinger's comments. 
The new CEO said in March that Intel will spend up to $20 billion to build two new factories in Arizona, greatly expanding its advanced chip manufacturing capacity. The majority of chips are currently produced in Asia.
According to a transcript of the ""60 Minutes"" interview, Gelsinger said Intel is also planning to reconfigure some factories to make chips for cars. Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and other automakers have cut production due to the shortage.

Intel's board of directors support the move to curtail stock buybacks, Gelsinger said.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Epic Games faces an uphill legal battle against Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) in an antitrust trial starting Monday, and a defeat for the maker of ""Fortnite"" could make it harder for U.S. government regulators to pursue a similar case against the iPhone maker, legal experts said.
But win or lose at the trial, Epic, which has pursued an aggressive public relations campaign against Apple alongside its court pleadings, may have already accomplished a major goal: Drawing Apple squarely into the global debate over whether and how massive technology companies should be regulated.
Apple has mostly succeeded in staying out of the regulatory crosshairs by arguing that the iPhone is a niche product in a smartphone world dominated by Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Android operating system. But that argument has become harder to sustain with the number of iPhone users now exceeding 1 billion. 
Epic alleges Apple has such a strong lock on those customers that the app store constitutes a distinct market for software developers over which Apple has monopoly power. Apple is abusing that power, Epic argues, by forcing developers to use Apple's in-app payment systems - which charge commissions of up to 30% - and to submit to app-review guidelines the gaming company says discriminate against products that compete with Apple's own.
""It's not a super-strong suit - I don't think they are likely to win,"" said Rebecca Haw Allensworth, a law professor at Vanderbilt Law School. ""But it has already achieved a lot of its purpose, which is drawing attention to some of Apple's practices that many developers see as abusive."" 
UPHILL BATTLE
Epic's arguments draw on major antitrust cases against Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Eastman Kodak and  American Express  (NYSE:AXP), but apply those precedents in new ways that have not been tested in U.S. courts, legal experts said.
For example, in arguing that iPhones are a software market unto themselves, Epic relies partly on a 1992 U.S. Supreme Court decision that rejected efforts by Kodak to force owners of its copying machines to use Kodak repair services. 
Spencer Waller, a competition law professor at the Loyola University Chicago School of Law, said the Kodak decision has had mixed success in subsequent cases.
""Plaintiffs are often unsuccessful because courts read Kodak narrowly at times,” Waller said.
Epic also faces hurdles in its contention that Apple's in-app payment commissions are too high at 30% and could be as much as 10 times lower if market forces prevailed. American courts have been reluctant to dive into setting specific rates, in large part because unlike Europe, the prevailing interpretation of U.S. antitrust law does not consider a dominant firm charging high prices to be anticompetitive in itself.
Apple argues that whatever dominant position it may have in mobile software is an outgrowth of its creation of both the iPhone and a curated App Store that makes consumer comfortable.
""If you obtained a monopoly legitimately, you're allowed to charge high prices,"" said Randal Picker, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School.
Regardless of who wins at the trial expected to last three weeks before Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers (NYSE:ROG) in Oakland, California, the case is all-but-certain to be appealed to the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which last year reinforced the notion that dominant firms can charge high prices in a case involving Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc.
""Anticompetitive behavior is illegal under federal antitrust law. Hypercompetitive behavior is not,"" Circuit Judge Consuelo Callahan wrote in the court's opinion.
A federal antitrust official, speaking anonymously because the official was not authorized to speak to the media, said that an Epic loss would dim the chances of the government pursuing a similar lawsuit against Apple.
BREWING ANTITRUST DEBATE 
Epic's suit has ramped up pressure on Apple in the court of public opinion at a time when the iPhone maker's business practices are facing fresh scrutiny around the world.
The U.S. Department of Justice https://reut.rs/3vAq5sD is probing the company's practices, Reuters has reported, and regulators in the United Kingdom and Australia have opened probes or called for regulation. 
European Union regulators last week accused Apple of distorting competition in the music streaming market, siding with Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) Technology in the zone's first major anti-competition charge against Apple.
Epic advertisements decrying Apple for taking such a big cut of revenue are landing aside those headlines.
""The public can understand these issues, and in many ways understand them better than these judges who have never played a game in their life,"" said Thomas Horton, a professor at the University of South Dakota School of Law. 
The biggest threat to Apple's App Store is not lawsuits, but rather new laws regulating digital platforms, said Joel Mitnick, a partner at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft and a former U.S. Federal Trade Commission trial lawyer. 
European lawmakers have already proposed legislation that could require Apple to allow developers to use their own payment systems, and consensus for new regulations is building in the United States as well.
Mitnick noted that concern about the power of big tech companies was bipartisan.

“If it were me, I would be looking at ways in which I could influence what might be inevitable changes to the rules under which (Apple) are going to operate,” he said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - A group of non-governmental organisations called on the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on Monday to end loans to the fossil-fuels sector, as the international lender holds its annual meeting this week with a focus on a green economic recovery.
The ADB, which finances initiatives aimed at boosting economic prospects for Asia's poorest, is also reviewing its lending policies, which its own management has said are not fit for a climate-changed world.
Governments this year have stepped up climate action as U.S. President Joe Biden seeks to reverse measures by the Trump administration. ADB's biggest shareholders, Japan and the United States, recently upped their emissions cuts targets.
""It's time to power our communities with clean, renewable energy,"" Chuck Baclagon, regional campaigner at 350.org, a U.S.-based group focused on the global energy transition, said in a joint statement.
More than 20 NGOs signed the statement sent to media for release on Monday.
""We need financial institutions like the Asian Development Bank to immediately stop lending money for coal, gas and oil projects,"" Baclagon said.
The ADB hosts its annual meeting virtually this week with the theme ""Collaboration for Resilient and Green Recovery"".
The groups said the ADB has lent $4.7 billion to gas projects in Asia since December 2015, when about 200 nations signed the Paris Agreement.
The ADB is reviewing its energy policy, which was last updated in 2009, Yongping Zhai, chief of the ADB's energy sector group said in an emailed response to Reuters' questions about the latest call from NGOs.
A draft new policy will be posted for public discussion by June, Zhai said.
The ADB has ""invested about $25 billion in the energy sector during 2015-2020,"" with 45% of that directed to renewable energy and energy efficiency and another 35% to network upgrades to integrate more renewable energy, he said.

The bank supports natural gas projects that provide community access to cleaner cooking and heating fuels, Zhai said, adding the ""management agreed with (an) independent evaluation that its energy policy is no longer adequately aligned with the global consensus on climate change.""

1463,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2021 10:15AM ET</span>","In energy-reliant Canada, banks and investors face dilemma in meeting emissions target","By Nichola Saminather
TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian banks' commitments to ""net-zero financed emissions"" by 2050 have drawn doubts from many investors, given the lack of a defined goal, details and their continued support for oil and gas companies, even if partially aimed at helping them transition to alternatives.
But their growing funding for green projects also presents a dilemma for shareholders who might want to divest.
The situation highlights the largely Canadian quandary faced by both the banks and their investors. Even in their quest to shrink financing for big emission-producers, the lenders cannot withdraw from an industry that accounts for about a tenth of the economy, despite its being responsible for over a quarter of emissions.
Over the past five months, Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), Toronto-Dominion Bank and Bank of Montreal, have announced plans to achieve net-zero emissions, but lacked details including a definition of that goal, interim reduction targets and plans to move away from traditional energy sources.
The six biggest banks account for nearly 90% of the industry's revenues and move in tandem on strategic shifts, including climate initiatives, which leaves shareholders with few local alternatives.
""The challenge with the current push to divest banks because they're involved in fossil fuels is that these are the very same banks critical to help meet many of our goals in alternative energy and sustainable financing,"" said Jamie Bonham, director of corporate engagement at NEI Investments, which holds shares of the five banks.
Canadian banks' outstanding loans to the oil and gas sector has stayed at the levels of two years ago, although it fell by 9.7% to C$47.5 billion ($42.2 billion) from a year earlier as of Jan. 31. 
They remain some of the biggest financiers of fossil fuel producers globally, with TD the world's top oil sands banker and RBC Canada's biggest financier of fossil fuels, in 2020, according to the Rainforest Action Network https://www.ran.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Banking-on-Climate-Chaos-2021.pdf. RBC, TD and Bank of Nova Scotia were among the 12 worst banks for fossil fuel financing globally between 2016 and 2020. 
Reports from the banks show none of the proceeds of green bonds they issued last year went to renewable projects by traditional energy companies.
(GRAPHIC - Global banks' financing for fossil fuel companies: https://graphics.reuters.com/CANADA-BANKS/ENVIRONMENT/xegvbxzkkvq/chart.png)
LAGGARDS
Their reluctance to step away from financing fossil fuels makes them laggards compared to their global counterparts, particularly European ones like BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bnp-paribas-shale-idUSKBN1CG0E3 and  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) that have distanced themselves from shale and/or tar-sands related oil and gas projects.
""When we set the net-zero target, that wasn't, for us, about divestment,"" said Andrea Barrack, TD's global head of sustainability and corporate citizenship, in an interview with Reuters. ""We're a major corporation in a country where a lot of... people's livelihoods depend on (the oil and gas) industry. We take those obligations seriously.""
TD's 2021 ESG report, expected to be released next year, will include some interim goals, Barrack said.
For more details on how Canadian banks are approaching their net-zero emissions targets, see
Despite the dilemma, some investors are taking action.
Amelia Meister, senior campaigner at retail investor group SumOfUs, which represents about 1,700 retail shareholders of Canadian banks, said some members have divested their bank shares, and over 2,500 have said they will move their money from the banks to credit unions.
""We don't necessarily know what their internal definitions for low carbon are,"" Meister said. ""Some define low carbon as light natural gas, which is still a fossil fuel.""
Others demand more transparency.
The banks should disclose milestones for achieving net zero emissions, including explicit criteria and timelines for withdrawing from activities not aligned with the Paris Agreement, said Emily DeMasi, senior engager for EOS, a stewardship service provider at Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI), representing investors who hold about C$3.3 billion of TD shares. 
They should also show how they are incentivizing clients to reduce emissions, she said. 
If they don't move quickly enough, EOS could band together with other investors, file shareholder resolutions and vote to remove directors, DeMasi said.
None of the big Canadian banks has joined the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, which commits to finding pathways to net-zero emissions by 2050. VanCity, the biggest credit union, which has never financed fossil fuel companies, is the only Canadian financial institution in the alliance. 
Banks globally face climate transition risks, said Jaime Ramos Martin, who manages  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors' ESG funds. 
""To be ahead on climate transition risks banks would need to transition their (portfolios) quicker than the economies where they are present,"" Ramos Martin said. ""Importantly, for us investors to follow up these efforts we need a great deal of disclosure, which currently is lacking.""
Meister blamed the banks for some of Canada's continued outsized reliance on traditional energy.

""Canadian banks dragging their heels has put our economy in a worse situation for the transition.""

1465,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2021 09:05AM ET</span>",Blow-out U.S. earnings suggest market has room to run,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. companies are leaping above expectations on first-quarter earnings, giving investors stronger confirmation that profit growth will be able to support the market this year.
A big piece of that growth is coming once again from technology and growth companies, which suggests greater durability in companies that underperformed more economically focused value names for months.
Earnings are rebounding from last year's pandemic-fueled lows. With results in from more than half of the S&P 500 companies, earnings are now expected to have risen 46% in the first quarter from the previous year, compared with forecasts of 24% growth at the start of the month, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
About 87% of reports have come in ahead of analysts' estimates for earnings per share, putting the quarter on track to have the highest beat rate on record going back to 1994, when Refinitiv began tracking the data.
Some strategists say the stronger-than-expected earnings could drive a richly valued market higher still. The benchmark S&P 500 is trading at about 23 times forward earnings, above the long-average of about 15, based on Refinitiv's data.
""The earnings results are really not being fully priced in yet, and that's because you're seeing estimates for the back half of the year start to pick up now in response to this better-than expected environment. That says to us there's still more room,"" said Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.
The high percentage of beats also follows many quarters where companies were holding off on giving guidance on the future, making it harder for analysts to estimate results for this year. 
Citing stronger earnings, Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist and head of quantitative research at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Securities, on Friday raised his 2021 S&P 500 price target to 4,600 from 4,300. The S&P 500 index was last at about 4,180.
Stocks have had little reaction to results overall so far. The S&P 500 is up more than 11% since Dec. 31. The index is up less than 2% since mid-April when the earnings period kicked in to high gear, but remains near record highs.
Earnings also are raising some fresh questions in the debate over growth versus value. After a decade of steadily under-performing the overall market, value has been a favorite among some investors as a bet on the reopening of the economy.
However, ""tech is showing an ability ... to still create as good, if not superior, sales growth to cyclicals. That's what I find amazing,"" said David Bianco, Americas chief investment officer for DWS.
""Tech is as much as of a reopening play as everybody else,"" he said.
Investors will be watching reports in the weeks ahead to see if the trend continues. Results are expected next week from a wide range of companies including Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI),  Cummins Inc  (NYSE:CMI), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) .
The first-quarter results come after a months-long rally in value stocks as investors bet on the reopening of businesses as COVID-19 vaccines became more available.
Value has outperformed growth names that include heavily weighted technology stocks, and for the year so far, the Russell 1000 value index remains up about 15%, while the Russell 1000 growth index is up about 8% in that time.
Technology-related companies as well as banks - value trade favorites - have had the largest percentage point contribution to estimated first-quarter S&P 500 earnings, with JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) at the top of the list, based on Refinitiv's data.
Tech is also among the strongest sectors for year-over-year sales growth for the quarter, Bianco noted.
While the risks of higher inflation and possibly higher taxes have given some investors reason to become more cautious on growth shares, earnings may make them think twice about avoiding the group.

""It pays for a lot of investors to be balanced between value and growth,"" said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute in St. Louis.
""We're actually carving out a third group ... defensives,"" he said, adding that those are the areas for investors to avoid for now.

A Tesla spokeswoman declined to comment on the report, referring to last month's official statement by the carmaker that put the start of production at the Gruenheide site towards the end of 2021.
Initially, Tesla had planned to start production on July 1, 2021, but red tape and plans to also build a battery cell factory on the site have delayed the project.

Tesla last month slammed lengthy regulatory processes in Europe's largest economy, saying its approval framework ""directly contradicts the urgency to plan and realise such projects that is necessary to battle climate change"".

1467,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2021 08:56PM ET</span>",Warren Buffett says U.S. economy's unexpected strength benefits Berkshire,"By Jonathan Stempel and John McCrank
(Reuters) - Warren Buffett said on Saturday that Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc is being lifted by a U.S. economy faring far better than he predicted early in the coronavirus pandemic, though investor euphoria is making it hard to deploy cash.
Speaking at Berkshire's annual meeting, Buffett said the economy has been ""resurrected in an extraordinarily effective way"" by monetary stimulus from the Federal Reserve and fiscal stimulus from the U.S. Congress.
""It did the job,"" Buffett said. ""This economy, right now, 85% of it is running in super high gear.""
Buffett lamented how an influx of so-called special purpose acquisition companies and inexperienced investors hoping for quick riches have made markets feel like a casino, making it hard for Berkshire to deploy more of its $145.4 billion cash hoard.
But the 90-year-old retained his optimism for the future of the company he has run since 1965, including after he's gone.
""We've seen some strange things happen in the world in the last year, 15 months,"" Buffett said. ""It has reinforced our desire to figure out everything possible to make sure that Berkshire is, 50 or 100 years from now, every bit the organization and then some that it is now.""
REINFORCEMENTS
The annual meeting was held in Los Angeles, where Buffett joined Berkshire's 97-year-old vice chairman Charlie Munger, to answer more than three hours of shareholder questions. 
Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, Berkshire's other vice chairmen and potentially successors to Buffett as chief executive, also fielded several questions.
Asked about their rapport, Jain said that they don't interact as much as Munger and Buffett, but they talk every quarter about businesses they oversee.
Berkshire scrapped for a second year its annual shareholder weekend in its Omaha, Nebraska, hometown, an extravaganza that normally attracts around 40,000 shareholders.
But Saturday's meeting, broadcast online on Yahoo Finance, was ""kind of what you come to love about Berkshire,"" said Steve Haberstroh, a partner at CastleKeep Investment Advisors in Westport, Connecticut. ""It's a little bit less about learning new things and more about being reminded about the old things.""
Many of Berkshire's dozens of operating units, which include Geico car insurance and the BNSF railroad, have been rebounding as anxiety over COVID-19 lessens, more people get vaccinated, stimulus checks are spent, business restrictions are eased and confidence about the economy grows.
Gross domestic product grew at an annualized 6.4% rate from January to March, according to an advance government estimate. Some economists project the economy will grow in 2021 at the fastest clip in nearly four decades.
Buffett conceded that the recovery made his decision last year to exit stakes in the four major U.S. airlines -- American, Delta, Southwest and United -- appear ill-timed.
Munger, meanwhile, downplayed concern that Congress and the White House might raise the corporate tax rate to 25% or 28%, saying it wouldn't be ""the end of the world"" for Berkshire.
Shareholders rejected proposals requiring Berkshire to disclose more about its efforts to address climate change and promote diversity and inclusion in its workforce.
But both proposals received about one-quarter of the votes cast, suggesting greater discontent than Berkshire shareholders historically demonstrate. Buffett, who controls nearly one-third of Berkshire's voting power, opposed both proposals.
Saturday's meeting came after Berkshire said first-quarter operating profit rose 20% to about $7 billion, while net income including investments totaled $11.7 billion..
CAUTION, SPACS AND ROBINHOOD
But there were signs Berkshire has grown more cautious about the markets.
While Berkshire repurchased $6.6 billion of its own stock from January and March, the pace of buybacks slowed.
Berkshire also said it sold $3.9 billion more stocks than it bought, though it still owned $151 billion of stock in just two companies, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).
Buffett acknowledged that low interest rates made Berkshire's $140 billion of insurance ""float,"" which it uses for investing and acquisitions, less valuable.
He also said the growth of SPACs, which take private companies public, has made buying whole companies pricey for Berkshire, which hasn't made a major acquisition since 2016.
""It's a killer,"" Buffett said, referring to SPACs. ""We've got probably $70 or $80 billion, something like that maybe, that we'd love to put to work, ... but we won't get a chance to do it under these conditions.""
Berkshire's leaders also heaped criticism on trading apps such as Robinhood, with Buffett saying they encourage a ""gambling impulse"" and Munger saying it was ""just god-awful that something like that would draw investment from civilized man and decent citizens. It's deeply wrong."" 
Buffett stood by Apple, calling the iPhone maker an ""extraordinary business"" with ""indispensable"" products, and admitted he erred by selling a small percentage of Berkshire's shares late last year.
As the meeting concluded, Buffett said the odds were ""very, very good"" that next year's meeting would include shareholders again.

""We really look forward to meeting you in Omaha,"" he said.

1468,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2021 07:15PM ET</span>",Buffett and Munger heap criticism on Robinhood for casino-like atmosphere,"By Jonathan Stempel and John McCrank
(Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday likened the millions of inexperienced day traders who entered the stock market in the past year to gamblers, and said commission-free brokerages such as Robinhood Financial for promoted a casino-like atmosphere.
Speaking at Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc's annual meeting, Buffett said Robinhood has attracted, ""maybe set out to attract,"" a large number of people who are just gambling on short-term price movements in stocks such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).
""There is nothing illegal to it, there's nothing immoral, but I don't think you build a society around people doing it,"" he said.
Buffett's long-time business partner, Charlie Munger, was more harsh. 
""It's just god-awful that something like that would draw investment from civilized man and decent citizens,"" he said. ""It's deeply wrong. We don't want to make our money selling things that are bad for people.""
Buffett said that while the odds of profiting from day trading stocks and derivatives are better than playing the state lottery, many new investors would have better results buying and holding shares of good companies. 
""The gambling impulse is very strong in people worldwide and occasionally it gets an enormous shove,"" Buffett said. ""It creates its own reality for a while, and nobody tells you when the clock is going to strike 12 and it all turns to pumpkins and mice,"" he said.
Some critics have said free trading platforms can encourage millennials to view trading as a game or amusement.
Brokers like Robinhood Financial have attracted controversy this year as traders drove huge rallies in shares of video game retailer  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME), movie theater chain AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc and other companies despite no fundamental reason for the frenzy.
Some of the buying was fueled by chats on forums like Reddit's WallStreetBets to ostensibly to punish hedge funds that had bet against so-called meme stocks.

Robinhood faces many lawsuits over its decision in January to curb trading in GameStop and other stocks, and Massachusetts is seeking to revoke its broker-dealer license.

1469,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2021 06:15PM ET</span>","Berkshire shareholders reject climate change, diversity proposals that Buffett opposed","By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc shareholders on Saturday easily rejected proposals requiring the company run since 1965 by Warren Buffett to disclose more about its efforts to address climate change and promote diversity and inclusion in its workforce.
The rejections were not a surprise, given that Buffett controls nearly one-third of Berkshire's voting power and opposed both proposals.
But the climate change proposal won support from just over 25% of votes cast and the diversity proposal from 24%, suggesting greater discontent than Berkshire shareholders historically demonstrate.
The votes came as a growing number of major investors, including BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) and the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) pension plan, call for companies to promote adherence to good environmental, social and governance principles.
CalPERS, along with Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI) and Caisse de Dépôt et Placement du Québec, had proposed requiring Berkshire to publish annual reports about its climate change efforts.
The nonprofit shareholder advocate As You Sow separately proposed annual reports on diversity, saying companies such as Berkshire benefit from a diverse workforce.
Buffett doesn't dispute that both issues are important, but opposed the proposals because of Berkshire's decentralized model, where its dozens of businesses run largely without his interference so long as they perform and are managed well.
""We do some other asinine things because we're required to do it, so we'll do whatever's required,"" Buffett said. ""But to have the people at Business Wire, Dairy Queen ... make some common report, ... we don't do that stuff at Berkshire.""The company has also said it is seeing ""great results"" from many subsidiaries addressing climate change on their own.

Berkshire shareholders also re-elected all 14 directors, despite calls from Institutional Shareholder Services and Neuberger Berman to withhold votes from members of Berkshire's governance, compensation and nominating committee. The vote totals were not immediately disclosed.

1470,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2021 06:05PM ET</span>",Berkshire defends $8 billion Texas power proposal to combat blackouts,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc on Saturday defended its $8 billion proposal to build natural gas plants in Texas to help reduce the threat of devastating blackouts such as those in February.
""When you look at the power sector (in Texas), it fundamentally let the citizens down,"" Greg Abel, a Berkshire vice chairman and previously chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Energy, said at the conglomerate's annual shareholder meeting.
""We've gone to Texas with what we believe is a good solution,"" he added. ""The health and welfare of Texas was at risk, and we needed to effectively have an insurance policy in place for them.""
Berkshire in March proposed building 10 natural gas-powered plants that would supplement the capacity of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which provides electricity to most of the state, and provide backup power in emergencies.
But the proposal reportedly contemplates guaranteed payments to Berkshire, upsetting the deregulated pricing model for Texas' power market.
The Dallas Morning News said Berkshire is proposing a guaranteed 9.3% rate of return. Berkshire has declined to comment.
Starwood Energy Group, the investment firm, last month proposed its own competing $8 billion plan to build 11 natural gas pants in Texas.
Texas suffered widespread power outages in February because of a fierce winter storm and plunging temperatures.
Electricity prices soared, with some ordinary customers receiving exponentially larger monthly bills, and about 4.5 million Texans were left without power for several days.
Berkshire Chairman Warren Buffett added that Texas ""is a terrific place to do business."" 
Abel downplayed a reported proposal by Elon Musk, who runs electric car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, to build a giant battery that could plug into Texas' power grid and power thousands of homes during hot summers.

He said Berkshire's plan could help stricken homes and businesses for several days, not merely hours like a battery.

1471,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2021 05:40PM ET</span>","Buffett says Berkshire ""not competitive"" with SPACs on deals","By John McCrank
(Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday compared the buying frenzy by special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, to gambling with other people's money and said their activity has made it tough for his company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc, to compete on deals.
Berkshire Hathaway has $70 billion to $80 billion it would ""love to put to work,"" but has not been able to under the current conditions, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Buffett said.
""It's a killer. The SPACs generally have to spend their money in two years, as I understand it. If you put a gun to my head and said you have to buy a big business in two years, I’d buy one, but it wouldn’t be much of one. We look and look,"" Buffett said at Berkshire's annual meeting.
SPACs are listed shell companies that raise funds to acquire private companies and take them public, allowing targets to sidestep the more onerous regulatory checks of an initial public offering.
More than $100 billion has been raised by U.S. SPACs, also known as blank-check companies, so far this year, while the value of SPAC mergers and acquisitions hit a record $263 billion, according to data from Dealogic.
""It's a different equation that you have if you're working with other people's money where you get the upside, and you have to give it back to them if you don't do something, and frankly, we are not competitive with that,"" he said. 
There are companies that are interested in being acquired by Berkshire, but it would be difficult for them to do so because a SPAC bidder would counter with a higher offer, Buffett said. 

""That won't go on forever, but it's where the money is now,"" he said.

Last week, the U.S. Surface Transportation Board (STB) granted a waiver to CP's $25 billion agreed bid for Kansas City Southern, which means the deal would not be subjected to the tougher railroad merger rules the regulator put in place in 2001.
CP won the exemption based on its smaller size, and analysts and shareholders have said that STB's ruling reduces the regulatory risk to CP's deal.
CP and larger rival Canadian National (CN) are in race to take over U.S. railroad Kansas City Southern (KCS), which would create the first direct railway linking Canada, U.S. and Mexico.
Either combination is seeking to benefit from the expected pick-up in trade after the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement was ratified last year.
In its argument filed with the regulator on Friday, CP said CN's offer to acquire KCS should be cause for concern because of its size.
""A combined CN/KCS would greatly expand the size of the fifth largest U.S. Class 1 railroad, vastly increasing the gap between CN/KCS and ... CP,"" Canadian Pacific said. 
CN said it has voluntarily agreed to have its transaction with KCS reviewed by the STB under the current rules to demonstrate the pro-competitive nature of the deal and to address any competition concerns. 
KCS did not immediately respond to a request for comment on CP's filing to the regulator.
CN launched an unsolicited cash-and-stock offer valuing KCS at about $29.55 billion, after CP agreed to buy KCS for about $25 billion in March.

CP has previously said it was not considering increasing its offer. KCS previously said its board has determined that CN's competing offer could be expected to lead to a ""superior proposal.""

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc said on Saturday its earnings are rebounding from the worst effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and that it has extended its aggressive stock repurchases with $6.6 billion of new buybacks.
A 20% increase in first-quarter operating profit suggests that the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate, whose dozens of businesses include the BNSF railroad and Geico auto insurance, may already have suffered the worst effects of the pandemic, which included the loss of tens of thousands of jobs.
Indeed, Berkshire said many businesses are enjoying ""considerably higher"" earnings and revenue, while others such as the Precision Castparts aircraft parts unit still struggle.
""Results were really good,"" said Jim Shanahan, a Edward Jones & Co analyst with a ""buy"" rating on Berkshire. ""The vaccination rollout and broad economic recovery are evident throughout Berkshire's franchise.""
The $6.6 billion of stock repurchases in the quarter allow Buffett to deploy excess capital, as high valuations and the growth of special purpose acquisition companies make takeovers of whole companies more difficult.
More buybacks likely occurred from March 31 to April 22 because Berkshire's share count declined, and may have exceeded $1.2 billion. Berkshire repurchased $24.7 billion of its own stock in 2020.
""It reflects that Buffett isn't being overly tight with Berkshire's valuation metrics and that he's confident about its future,"" said Tom Russo, a partner at Gardner Russo & Quinn in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, who has owned Berkshire since 1982.
Quarterly operating profit rose to $7.02 billion, or about $4,600 per Class A share, from $5.87 billion a year earlier.
Net income of $11.71 billion, or $7,638 per Class A share, compared with a year-earlier net loss of $49.75 billion, or $30,653 per share.
Last year's results reflected $55.62 billion of losses on investments and derivatives, as stock markets worldwide plunged.
Despite the buybacks, Berkshire ended March with $145.4 billion of cash, in part because it sold $3.9 billion more in stocks in the quarter than it bought.
Its largest stock holdings, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), totaled $110.9 billion and $40 billion respectively.
Berkshire's Class A shares are up 19% this year, outperforming the Standard & Poor's 500 after badly lagging in 2020.
Buffett and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger will host Berkshire's annual meeting on Saturday afternoon. 
BRINGING IT ALL BACK HOME
Manufacturing operations boosted pre-tax profit by 15%, with earnings nearly doubling at the Clayton Homes mobile housing unit as sales revenue increased and expected credit losses fell.
Russo expects more improvement in housing-related businesses. ""Between Johns Manville [insulation], Acme Brick, and Benjamin Moore paint and Shaw carpets, Berkshire has the entire homebuilding sector in its sweet spot,"" he said.
Pre-tax profit from retailers such as the Nebraska Furniture Mart and See's Candies more than doubled, while Berkshire's auto dealerships sold more vehicles and some results surpassed pre-pandemic levels despite supply chain disruptions.
At Geico, underwriting profit rose 4% as people drove less and had fewer accidents, offsetting lower premiums resulting from credits on policy renewals.
""Results were most impressive in the insurance segment,"" Shanahan said. ""Geico isn't growing as fast as Progressive (NYSE:PGR), but underwriting performance is much improved, after underperforming our expectations last year.""
BNSF revenue was essentially unchanged, as higher shipping volume of food and consumer goods offset less demand from energy companies for petroleum and sand.
""It looked like there was increased pricing competition, with rail volumes up but revenue down fractionally,"" said Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research.
Berkshire Hathaway Energy's profit rose 25%, including gas pipeline assets it recently bought from Dominion Energy.
Precision remained a trouble spot, even after a $9.8 billion writedown and 13,400 job losses in 2020.

Quarterly revenue fell 36%, and Berkshire said revenue and earnings should remain ""relatively low"" in 2021 because aircraft production is unlikely to grow significantly.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. companies are leaping above expectations on first-quarter earnings, giving investors stronger confirmation that profit growth will be able to support the market this year.
A big piece of that growth is coming once again from technology and growth companies, which suggests greater durability in companies that underperformed more economically focused value names for months.
Earnings are rebounding from last year's pandemic-fueled lows. With results in from more than half of the S&P 500 companies, earnings are now expected to have risen 46% in the first quarter from the previous year, compared with forecasts of 24% growth at the start of the month, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
About 87% of reports have come in ahead of analysts' estimates for earnings per share, putting the quarter on track to have the highest beat rate on record going back to 1994, when Refinitiv began tracking the data.
Some strategists say the stronger-than-expected earnings could drive a richly valued market higher still. The benchmark S&P 500 is trading at about 23 times forward earnings, above the long-average of about 15, based on Refinitiv's data.
""The earnings results are really not being fully priced in yet, and that's because you're seeing estimates for the back half of the year start to pick up now in response to this better-than expected environment. That says to us there's still more room,"" said Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.
The high percentage of beats also follows many quarters where companies were holding off on giving guidance on the future, making it harder for analysts to estimate results for this year. 
Citing stronger earnings, Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist and head of quantitative research at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Securities, on Friday raised his 2021 S&P 500 price target to 4,600 from 4,300. The S&P 500 index was last at about 4,180.
Stocks have had little reaction to results overall so far. The S&P 500 is up more than 11% since Dec. 31. The index is up less than 2% since mid-April when the earnings period kicked in to high gear, but remains near record highs.
Earnings also are raising some fresh questions in the debate over growth versus value. After a decade of steadily under-performing the overall market, value has been a favorite among some investors as a bet on the reopening of the economy.
However, ""tech is showing an ability ... to still create as good, if not superior, sales growth to cyclicals. That's what I find amazing,"" said David Bianco, Americas chief investment officer for DWS.
""Tech is as much as of a reopening play as everybody else,"" he said.
Investors will be watching reports in the weeks ahead to see if the trend continues. Results are expected next week from a wide range of companies including Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI),  Cummins Inc  (NYSE:CMI), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) .
The first-quarter results come after a months-long rally in value stocks as investors bet on the reopening of businesses as COVID-19 vaccines became more available.
Value has outperformed growth names that include heavily weighted technology stocks, and for the year so far, the Russell 1000 value index remains up about 15%, while the Russell 1000 growth index is up about 8% in that time.
Technology-related companies as well as banks - value trade favorites - have had the largest percentage point contribution to estimated first-quarter S&P 500 earnings, with JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) at the top of the list, based on Refinitiv's data.
Tech is also among the strongest sectors for year-over-year sales growth for the quarter, Bianco noted.
While the risks of higher inflation and possibly higher taxes have given some investors reason to become more cautious on growth shares, earnings may make them think twice about avoiding the group.
""It pays for a lot of investors to be balanced between value and growth,"" said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute in St. Louis.

""We're actually carving out a third group ... defensives,"" he said, adding that those are the areas for investors to avoid for now.

Last week, Aeromexico agreed to purchase two dozen Boeing (NYSE:BA) planes as part of a deal that should yield an estimated $2 billion in savings due to better conditions in some long-term maintenance for its existing fleet and leasing contracts.
The first new planes will be incorporated into its fleet this year, including nine that should be in operation by this summer, while the rest are expected to arrive later in the year as well as in 2022, the airline has said.

Aeromexico which already has 107 planes, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in a U.S. court in June after the coronavirus pandemic slammed the global travel industry.

In an inflationary environment, investors should consider companies with strong pricing power, which is why David Cohne is recommending Lowe's Companies (NYSE:LOW), O'Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY), and Pool (NASDAQ:POOL).As the market continues to hit new highs and many companies report better than expected earnings results, investors need to keep an eye on inflation. Multiple indicators point towards higher inflation ahead, which can erode the value of investment returns over time. But some companies can generate higher profits when prices rise.
That's why we need to pick the right companies in this changing market environment. I suggest companies with higher pricing power. Meaning they have the ability to raise prices faster than their costs. This pricing power can help drive revenue growth and expand profit margins.
To find these companies, all we need to do is take a look at the Nasdaq US Price Setters Index, which includes quality stocks that exhibit growth potential and pricing power. When combined with our proprietary POWR Ratings system, we can unlock Buy-rated stocks such as Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW), O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.

We believe  Weyerhaeuser  (WY) and Rayonier (NYSE:RYN) are well-positioned to capitalize on rising lumber prices. But let’s find out which of these stocks is a better buy now.Weyerhaeuser Company (NYSE:WY) manufactures and sells forest products. The company operates through three main business segments—timberlands, wood products, and real estate, energy & natural resources. Its wood products segment delivers lumber, structural panels, engineered wood products and complementary building products for residential, industrial and light commercial applications.
 Rayonier Inc . (RYN) is a leading timberland real estate investment trust with assets located in some of the most productive softwood timber growing regions in the United States and New Zealand. The company operates through seven segments—Southern Timber, Pacific Northwest Timber, New Zealand Timber, Timber Funds, Real Estate, Trading, Corporate and Other.
The U.S. lumber market has been witnessing a soaring demand since the economy began recovering. Given low inventories, rising demand from industrial and residential activities has caused lumber prices to spike on April 19 to an all-time high of $1,328.50 per thousand board feet. The booming housing market, the country’s anticipated infrastructure developments and home improvement trends should keep driving lumber prices. Indeed, the global reclaimed lumber market size is expected to grow at a 4.6% CAGR to reach $70.37 billion by 2028.

While the EV industry's long-term prospects look bright, many companies in the sector with weak fundamentals are expected to continue retreating in the near term. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) recently downgraded EV manufacturers Fisker (FSR) and Lordstown Motors (RIDE). So, let’s look at those names.Electric vehicle (EV) stocks saw an astonishing rally last year on investors' exuberance over the industry’s huge growth prospects. Worldwide governmental initiatives to shift to zero-emission transport as part of the broader goal to build a sustainable energy-based future motivated investor to bet on EV stocks, in some cases irrespective of their fundamentals. In fact, the industry’s potential growth made has caused it to now be, arguably, overcrowded with new entrants.
Nevertheless, the optimism over the industry and the consequent rally in EV stocks pushed shares of most industry participants to valuations that often don’t justify their current fundamentals and growth prospects. Furthermore, a semiconductor shortage is causing operational disruptions at many established EV manufacturers. Investors also expect a dip in EV demand with an anticipated decline in crude oil prices in the coming quarters.
Consequently, many EV players that lack the fundamental strength to survive these headwinds are expected lose value. Goldman Sachs recently downgraded Fisker Inc (FSR) and Lordstown Motors Corp (RIDE). So, it could be wise to stay away from these stocks now.

(Reuters) - Wall Street ended lower on Friday, with Amazon, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and other tech-related companies weighing on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq despite recent strong quarterly earnings reports.
A day after the S&P 500 closed at a record high, Apple, Google-parent Alphabet and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) each gave back gains following upbeat quarterly reports this week.
Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ended down 0.1% after it posted record profit late on Thursday and signaled that consumers would keep spending in a growing U.S. economy. Amazon had been up over 2% earlier in the session.
 Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) plunged 15% after it offered a tepid revenue forecast for the second quarter, saying user growth could slow as the boost seen during the pandemic fizzles.
While megacap favorites posted largely strong earnings in the first quarter, their shares have struggled to maintain the upward trajectory that many had coming into reporting season. 
""There is a sense that maybe next quarter is as good as it's going to get, and we're going to roll over, particularly among the Nasdaq stocks and Big Tech stocks that benefited from the pandemic,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors in Palm Beach, Florida.
Seven of the 11 major S&P 500 sector indexes fell, with technology and materials down more than 1%, and energy falling almost 3%.
Of the 303 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported so far, 87% have topped analysts' earnings estimates, with Refinitiv IBES data now predicting a 46% jump in profit growth.
Data on Friday showed U.S. consumer spending rebounded in March amid a surge in income as households received additional COVID-19 pandemic relief money from the government. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.54% to end at 33,875.31 points, while the S&P 500 lost 0.72% to 4,181.21. 
The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.85%, to 13,962.68.
Despite Friday's weakness, the Nasdaq completed its sixth consecutive month of gains, rising 5.4% in April. The Dow added 2.7% in April while the S&P 500 rose 5.2%, both gaining for a third month in a row.
For the week, the S&P 500 was about flat, the Dow lost 0.5% and the Nasdaq shed 0.4%.
 Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) dropped 3.6% after its first-quarter profit fell 29%, hit by weaker refining margins and production losses.
 AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV) rose 0.5% after it reported strong results and raised its 2021 earnings forecast, helped by demand for its rheumatoid arthritis drug in the United States.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.13-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.13-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 52 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 84 new highs and 45 new lows.

(NASDAQ:OCGN), Humanigen Inc. (HGEN), and 180 Life Sciences Corp. (ATNF) should be avoided at all costs given questions about their prospects or ability to stay afloat.The Reddit investment community WallStreetBets or WSB has acquired a reputation as a major market mover following the GameStop (GME) short squeeze it drove in January. A unified approach accords Reddit investors the potential to gain significantly by squeezing short sellers out of their positions on fundamentally weak stocks. However, GME’s fundamental weaknesses have caused the short squeeze to be short lived. The stock has declined 2.8% over the past month.
Regarding the healthcare sector, the Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF’s (XLV) 19.7% returns over the past six months reflect investor optimism about the sector’s growth prospects. However, the big rally by many of the sector’s stocks over the last year has come absent investors’ increased focus on the space. Rather, some fundamentally weak stocks have rallied thanks to WSB’s actions.
So, we think speculative biotech stocks Ocugen, Inc. (OCGN), Humanigen Inc. (HGEN), and 180 Life Sciences Corp. (ATNF) that are favorites of investors on Reddit forums are best avoided now.

But now, as EV investors pull back on concerns over overvaluation and a semiconductor chip shortage, traditional vehicle manufactures are performing relatively better due to an expected decline in crude oil prices. We think Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and  Toyota  (TM), two established players in the auto manufacturing space, are poised to deliver whopping returns once short-term market volatility subsides. But let’s find out which of these two stocks is a better buy now.Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) and Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) are two of the biggest car manufacturing giants in the automobile sector. TSLA not only designs, develops, manufactures and sells electric vehicles (EVs), it also manufactures, installs and sells solar energy generation and energy storage products. Headquartered in Japan, TM operates through several business segments, including automobile, finance, house design and manufacturing.
Electrification, autonomous driving and shared mobility are the main trends that are expected to shape the automotive industry over the next decade. As the demand for cars increases—with people much more inclined now to commute and travel generally in personal vehicles for social distancing reasons—we expect established global car manufacturers TSLA and TM to witness greater demand for their vehicles.
While TM has returned 19.2% over the past year, TSLA has gained 322.9%. In terms of their past six-months’ performance, TSLA is a clear winner with 64.8% returns versus TM’s 16.1%. But which of these two stocks is a better pick now? Let's find out.

The jury awarded each of the plaintiffs $2.1 million in punitive damages and a total of $830,500 in compensatory damages for their medical expenses, lost earnings and pain and suffering.
The company was accused of hiding design flaws, fudging test results and failing to instruct the military in proper use of the earplugs, which were used by the Army between 2007 and 2013.
""The evidence is clear: 3M knew their earplugs were defective, yet they allowed our servicemembers to suffer these life-altering injuries,"" said a statement from attorneys Bryan Aylstock and Christopher Seeger. 
3M said in a statement it did not believe the plaintiffs met their burden in proving the plugs were defectively or negligently designed or that the plugs caused injuries. The company said it believed there were multiple grounds for appeal.
""We remain confident in our case and are ready to defend ourselves against plaintiffs’ allegations at the upcoming trials,” 3M said.
Shares of 3M were down 1.4% after the verdict, trading at $196.22 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Most of the lawsuits against 3M over the earplugs have been brought by army veterans between the ages of 30 and 49. The litigation is the largest mass tort ever brought in federal court. 
The ""bellwether"" trial in Florida which consolidated three lawsuits, was meant to test the strength of the evidence and gauge damages so that the parties could potentially shape a deal to resolve the other cases.
The next bellwether trial over the earplugs begins on May 17. Around 240,000 service members have alleged hearing damage from the earplugs and 3,349 have filed lawsuits, according to 3M's most recent quarterly report.

More than 1 million veterans receive compensation for hearing loss, which is the leading service-related disability, according to 2015 government data.

So, we think it’s wise to scoop up these stocks now.

This, along with a renovation and remodeling trend to make current homes more comfortable for living and working, has led to rising demand for home improvement products, such as furniture, wall art, and even garden and outdoor decors.
According to a Brandessence Market Research report, the home improvement market is expected to reach $1155.79 billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 4.5%.
Because most retailers in this space have increased their online presence, their products and services have become much more accessible to a wider range of consumers.

In 2018, BaFin took the extraordinary step of installing the auditor KPMG as a special monitor at Deutsche to oversee progress on money-laundering controls.
It was the first time that the German regulator had made such an appointment and followed a series of money laundering lapses.
Now, BaFin is expanding KPMG's mandate. 
BaFin said in a brief statement that it wanted improved controls particularly regarding ""regular customer reviews,"" applying also to correspondent banking and the monitoring of transactions.
The news comes on the heels of a good week for Deutsche. It posted its best quarterly profit in seven years - following years of losses - and its share price surged to the highest level in three years.
Deutsche Bank said in a statement that it was improving its controls but ""we are also aware that there is still work to be done.""
""The order is the result of a constructive supervisory dialogue with the BaFin and reflects that the bank continues to attach the highest priority to detecting and remedying possible weaknesses in control processes,"" Deutsche Bank said.
""We are working intensively to also comply with the new requirements within the given timeframe,"" Deutsche said.
Under the leadership of Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing, Deutsche Bank has been trying to turn a new leaf by restoring profitability and its reputation after a string of misdeeds.
In 2017, Deutsche Bank was fined nearly $700 million for allowing money laundering. The fines stemmed from a scheme of artificial trades between Moscow, London and New York that authorities said were used to launder $10 billion out of Russia. The U.S. Department of Justice is still investigating the case.

Last year, Deutsche Bank was also sanctioned by New York regulators for ignoring warning signs while processing billions of euros of payments for Danske Bank, whose Estonian branch was embroiled in a money-laundering scandal.
BaFin said in a separate emailed statement that it sought to ""bring about sustainable improvements in money laundering prevention at Deutsche Bank.""

While rising commodity prices are expected to negatively impact food companies, the growing demand for organic food should benefit Sprouts Farmers (NASDAQ:SFM), Natural Grocers (NYSE:NGVC) by Vitamin Cottage (NGVC), and Lifeway Foods (LWAY) in the near term. Let’s discuss.Rising concerns around immunity and hygiene amid the COVID-19 pandemic have motivated many people to shift to organic food products. In response, many food companies have added organic products to their offerings to capitalize on the trend.
However, the huge demand for basic ingredients, like wheat, corn and soya from China, is driving an increase in food prices. In the United States, food prices have risen 3.5% over the past 12 months. However, for companies that are expanding their organic food offerings, the rising demand for organic foods is expected to more than offset the decline in their profits due to the rise in overall food prices According to a Globe Newswire report released last December, the global organic food market is expected to grow at 12.2% CAGR to reach $272.18 billion by 2027.

(Reuters) - The three largest U.S. drug distributors are facing trial on Monday in West Virginia in a lawsuit accusing them of fueling the opioid crisis that has resulted in 500,000 overdose deaths in the United States over two decades.
The suit claims that AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp, McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK) and  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH) ignored red flags that opioids were being diverted to illegal channels, flooding the state with hundreds of millions of highly addictive pills. 
Huntington, a city in opioid-ravaged West Virginia, and Cabell County are expected to seek more than $1 billion to remedy the harms caused by opioids.
The distributors have said that they cannot be held liable for filling orders for drugs prescribed by doctors. They also have argued the plaintiffs' legal theory of public nuisance - more commonly used for damage to public goods like roads or water supply - does not apply to opioids.
""AmerisourceBergen is looking forward to sharing with the Court the facts about our role in the supply chain and our long-standing commitment to fulfilling our regulatory responsibilities and doing our part to combat the opioid crisis,"" AmerisourceBergen said in a statement.
McKesson and Cardinal declined to comment on the case.
The non-jury trial before U.S. District Judge David Faber in Charleston comes after Huntington and Cabell, along with other West Virginia towns and counties, opted out of a proposed $26 billion nationwide settlement with the three distributors and drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). That deal has not been finalized.
A verdict could help lay the groundwork for settlements in the sprawling nationwide litigation over the opioid crisis.
Opioids have resulted in the overdose deaths of nearly 500,000 people in the United States from 1999 to 2019, according to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. West Virginia is among the hardest hit states, recording more opioid prescriptions and overdose deaths per capita than any other in 2018, according to data from the National Institutes of Health.
Next week's trial comes as nationwide opioid litigation picks up momentum after being stalled for a year by the COVID-19 pandemic.
More than 3,300 lawsuits by local governments nationwide are pending against opioid manufacturers, distributors and pharmacies. Many are consolidated before a federal judge in Ohio, who has designated some, including the Huntington case, for trial in hopes of encouraging a broader settlement.
The first trial following pandemic delays began earlier this month in a case brought by California counties against J&J and other drugmakers. Another is expected in New York in June. 
The distributors nearly went to trial once before, against two Ohio counties in 2019, but ultimately settled for $215 million.

1492,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2021 01:45PM ET</span>",Analysis: New meme stocks swing as shorts and retail investors face off again,"By John McCrank, Saqib Iqbal Ahmed and Lawrence Delevingne
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Recent volatility in a handful of so-called meme stocks is putting the spotlight back on the tussle between individual investors and short sellers, months after a wild ride in GameStop captivated Wall Street’s attention.
Stocks that have notched big swings this month include laser-manufacturer MicroVision Inc, a favorite on Reddit’s popular WallStreetBets forum, whose shares have risen as much as 170% since April 20 before tumbling in recent days.
Biopharmaceutical company Ocugen (NASDAQ:OCGN) Inc is up about 110% since April 20 while online video game platform Skillz, which has been added to the portfolio of Cathie Wood’s ARK funds, is up about 45%.
Those moves do not approach the stunning, nearly 1,700% gain in video game retailer  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) in January, which was fueled in part by a flurry of buying that forced hedge funds like Melvin Capital to unwind their bets against the stock, sending it higher. Shares of the video game retailer and many other meme stocks that rallied in its wake are well off their highs, and retail trading has dropped from levels seen earlier in the year.
""We're seeing some return of interest to those Reddit-type stocks but not with the same pace and fervor we saw before,"" said Robert Phipps, a director at Per Stirling Capital Management. 
Still, some market-watchers believe a smaller-scale face-off between retail investors and short sellers may have sparked part of the volatility in MicroVision and other recent movers.
Average short interest in a basket of 50 stocks with market capitalization of under $100 billion monitored by Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research has climbed to levels last seen in January, the firm said in a report earlier this week.
At the same time, cash equity purchases and the premium spent on call options for MicroVision and some of the other gainers soared in recent weeks, an indicator of retail buying, according to analysts at Vanda, which tracks retail activity.
Graphic: Showdown - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jbyvrwgjkpe/Pasted%20image%201619720788001.png
""With the precedent of Melvin Capital in mind, we suspect that the long/short community started to trim bearish bets as soon as they sniffed a potential comeback from the Reddit crowd,"" Vanda’s analysts wrote.
MicroVision, which traded below $1 as recently as June 2020, is up 210% since short seller Hindenburg Research said it was betting against the company’s stock on Dec. 22, illustrating the potential dangers bearish investors face when positioning against meme stocks. Hindenburg Research did not respond to requests for comment. 
“Right now you can have a perfectly logical reason to short a stock and still take a terrible beating if a group of small traders pull together to push the stock in the other direction,"" said Phipps. 
Graphic: Wild ride - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/ygdpzlxqrpw/Pasted%20image%201619724346615.png
WATCHING WSB 
Carson Block, founder of short seller Muddy Waters (NYSE:WAT) Research, said he keeps a keen eye on online chatter and forums such as WallStreetBets, where users often attempt to coordinate their buying in stocks they believe are short-squeeze candidates.
“We are now watching closely,” said Block.
Block said he is now more focused on technical aspects such as companies where a high percentage of stock is owned by insiders and institutional investors that are unlikely to sell the shares.
Whether the stars will align anytime soon for another move on the scale of GameStop's remains to be seen. That stock had a combination of short interest that peaked at about 145% of the float, according to S3 Partners data, a massive following among retail investors and institutions happy to jump in on the shares' wild ride.
Investors are “looking for history possibly to repeat or looking for stocks that are going to go parabolic,” said Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners. However, “GameStop was such an outlier in price moves that (it) is difficult for that to happen again.”
There are signs, however, that broader trading activity among retail investors may be picking up.
In the latest week, there was $700 million in net retail buying of large-cap companies tracked by JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), compared with $500 million in the previous period, the bank said in a report issued on Wednesday. 
Vanda Research said purchases of single stocks by retail investors have ticked higher, though they remain much lower than in previous months. Meanwhile, buying of exchange-traded funds by retail investors fell earlier in the week to its lowest levels since late last year, a potential sign they may be ready to take on more risk, the firm said.

And because the hot housing market faces low inventory and rising prices, we think it could be beneficial to bet now on fundamentally sound homebuilding stocks  Lennar  (LEN), PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM), and Skyline Champion (NYSE:SKY). Let’s evaluate these companies.The housing market has remained red hot amid even the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic thanks to the near-zero interest-rate environment and a rising demand for bigger and better domiciles in suburban areas in response to requisite remote working, learning and entertainment. And because the work-from-home trend is expected to continue even in the post-pandemic world, given its benefits to employees and employers, the demand for new houses should not decline anytime soon.
The NAHB housing market index in the United States edged up one point to 83 in April 2021. Moreover, investors’ interest in the homebuilding stocks is evident in the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF’s (XHB) 27.2% gains over the past three months compared to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) 13.5% returns.
Given the powerful demand for houses, suppliers are challenged by low inventory. Millennial home ownership is also on the rise despite rising home prices. Amid this favorable backdrop, we think it is wise to bet on established homebuilding companies that are positioned to capitalize on the tailwinds. We believe Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), PulteGroup, Inc. (PHM), and Skyline Champion Corporation (SKY) are such companies and are best picks in this space now.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United Auto Workers (UAW) union said Friday it wants tax incentives for electric vehicles (EVs) revised to require U.S. assembly for those vehicles to qualify.
The current $7,500 tax incentive does not require EVs to be made in the United States. ""The UAW is working with the Biden administration and Congress to make sure that the final legislation extending electric vehicle subsidies are clear that those investments subsidize the jobs of U.S. workers,"" said UAW Vice President Terry Dittes.
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) announced Thursday it would invest $1 billion in its Mexico operations and begin building EVs there in 2023.
Representative Debbie Dingell, a Michigan Democrat, said ""electric vehicles must be built here in America by the finest workforce in the world – the American worker. Not one American dollar should support our own jobs being shipped off to Mexico.""
The White House did not immediately comment Friday, but President Joe Biden has called for $174 billion to boost U.S. EV production, sales and infrastructure, including $100 billion in new consumer rebates.
On Wednesday, Biden told U.S. lawmakers ""there's no reason why American workers can’t lead the world in the production of electric vehicles and batteries.""
GM responded to the UAW noting it ""recently announced nearly 9,000 jobs and more than $9 billion in new electric vehicle or battery cell manufacturing facilities in Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee.""
Last month, the UAW criticized Ford Motor (NYSE:F)'s plan to build a new vehicle in Mexico rather than at an Ohio plant. Ford said in November it was planning to build an additional EV at its plant in Cuautitlan, Mexico, where it builds the Mustang Mach-E.
Automotive News cited a person familiar with the matter saying that Ford had been considering building EVs in Ohio and instead decided to assemble them in Mexico. Ford declined to comment.

GM aims to build two Chevrolet electric SUVs at Ramos Arizpe starting in 2023, according to Sam Fiorani, who tracks future vehicle production for AutoForecast Solutions. GM said it also plans to build batteries and electrical components at Ramos Arizpe.
GM already makes EVs at four locations in the United States and Canada. GM has said it aspires to halt U.S. sales of gasoline-powered passenger vehicles by 2035.

In a company-wide report that reveals the first demographic breakdown of its workforce, the planemaker said the employees were terminated between June 2020 and April 21, 2021.
American companies have come under pressure from investors to publicly disclose information about diversity among employees in the wake of racial justice and movements such as Black Lives Matter.
Boeing said about 69% of its U.S. workforce was made of white employees and 31% from other races, including about 6.4% Black employees. Boeing has previously said it aims to take the number of Black employees up by 20%.
Boeing, which has seen the ranks of its senior female executives shrink in recent years, also said data showed women made up 13.6% of its executive council, a drop from about 30% over the past year.
Part of the reason for the gender gap in the council is its expansion to 22 members, with just three female executives, from 13 members, with four female executives, as of March 1, 2020. 

Overall, women represented between 23% and 25% of Boeing U.S. and non-U.S. workforce, the company said. (https://

However, its wild rally has raised the specter of a price bubble and filled investors with apprehension. As such, we think Dogecoin should be treated as a digital currency that lacks the differentiation and utility to be meaningful. Instead, we point to technology stocks Intel (INTC), HP (HPQ), and Fujitsu (FJTSY) that have the potential to outperform the market even in the post-pandemic world, and as such deserve far more attention. Let’s discuss.The meme-inspired cryptocurrency Dogecoin has attracted attention in the past couple of weeks. Although it caught the attention of investors for its crypto-craze-driven rally, its advance is probably not sustainable because of its deficiencies as a real-world digital currency. Even if cryptocurrencies in general eventually become mainstream, Dogecoin may not become widely accepted due its high volatility and limited market presence.
Putting the hype to one side, a much better and safer option for investors now is in technology stocks. They are buoyed by increasing demand for next-generation technologies. The tech industry enjoys favorable investor sentiment, as evidenced by Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF’s (XLK) 54.3% returns over the past year, compared to SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust’s (SPY) 43.3% gains over this period. Surging demand for electronic devices, coupled with the need for good connectivity and performance, has further accelerated the technology industry’s growth.

Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), HP Inc. ((NYSE:HPQ) and Fujitsu Limited (FJTSY) are much less volatile than to Dogecoin and hold solid upside potential. So, we think it could be wise to bet on these stocks now.

1502,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2021 11:50AM ET</span>","On top of zero-emission vehicles, GM looks to clean up its own operations","By Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) is targeting not only the elimination of tailpipe emissions by 2035 on all light vehicles it sells, but the largest U.S. automaker also is looking to clean up its own operations with goals it outlined on Friday.
The Detroit automaker released a series of new goals in its 2020 sustainability report, including reducing how much energy it takes to build vehicles and using returnable packaging. 
""In addition to addressing tailpipe emissions, we're focused on reducing emissions from the inside out,"" GM Chief Sustainability Officer Kristen Siemen said in a statement. ""That means reducing the amount of electricity, water and waste associated with the production of all vehicles and sourcing more sustainable materials, like those using recycled content and more efficient processes.""
In January, GM said it aimed to sell all its new cars, SUVs and light-duty pickup trucks with zero tailpipe emissions by 2035, marking a potential dramatic shift away from gasoline and diesel engines. The company also plans to be carbon neutral by 2040.
In Friday's report, GM said its new sustainability goals include reducing operational energy intensity - or the energy used to make its vehicles - by 35% by 2035 against a 2010 baseline of 2.31 megawatt hours (MWh) per vehicle. That figure was 2.06 MWh per vehicle last year. 
A megawatt hour is equal to 1,000 kilowatts of electricity used continuously for one hour, or the equivalent of the amount of electricity used by about 330 homes in that period, according to CleanEnergyAuthority.com.
GM said it also wants to divert greater than 90% of waste sent to landfills and for incineration globally by 2025. Last year, GM sent more than 176,000 metric tons of waste to landfills and for incineration, down from almost 300,000 metric tons in 2016, according to the report.
The company said it wants to make packaging 100 percent returnable or made from mostly sustainable content by 2030. It did not have comparable numbers from 2020. 
GM previously said it will source 100% renewable energy to power its U.S. sites by 2030 and global sites by 2035, five years ahead of a prior goal.

Separately on Friday, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said it has established a supplier code of conduct relating to expectations for human rights, the environment, responsible material sourcing and lawful business practices, expanding on guidelines established since 2003.

(Reuters) -  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) will struggle to replicate a bumper 2020 dominated by the U.S. political battles, civil unrest and the COVID-19 crisis as people venture out following vaccine rollouts, Wall Street analysts said on Friday.
The lifting of restrictions as people get vaccinated has largely seen benefiting other digital ad firms such as  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google whose stocks soared after reporting blockbuster results this week.
Not so with Twitter. Shares sank more than 12% on Friday after the social media company reported first-quarter revenue and user numbers mostly in line with analyst estimates and warned the current quarter could be its worse as it eyed a weaker 2021.
""The company's weak future guidance suggests that repeating this performance will be extremely difficult,"" said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at Investing.com, adding that more people will look to engage in offline activities as the vaccine rollouts pick up.
Although other tech companies have warned of a drop in users this year, they are still upbeat on ad spending as marketers try to target consumers eager to spend and travel after being locked indoors for over a year.
""Twitter doesn't seem well positioned to actually capture the most dynamic part of the digital advertising economy as they lack both sufficient scale of users and the first party data signals that attract performance based marketers,"" said Michael Nathanson, senior research analyst at MoffetNathanson LLC.
A vow to focus on new products and features by Twitter did little to allay investor concerns on Friday.
However, some analysts found the company's current-quarter revenue forecast conservative as they expect newer app features and return of live events to boost user engagement and monetization in coming months.
At least eight brokerages cut their price targets on Twitter after the company forecast tepid revenue growth for the second quarter.

Of the 40 analysts covering the stock, 29 have a ""hold"" or lower rating and the rest have a ""buy"" or higher rating. The current median price target on the stock is $70, as per Refinitiv data.

1507,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2021 10:55AM ET</span>",UK's Truss expects Airbus-Boeing row to be resolved by July,"By Emma Farge and Cecile Mantovani
GENEVA (Reuters) -British trade minister Liz Truss expects the trade dispute over Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA) to be resolved by July when a freeze on tit-for-tat tariffs expires, she told Reuters on Friday. 
The tariff battle involving the United States, the European Union and Britain relates to a row over state subsidies for the two planemakers. Britain is a party to the talks as a former EU member and manufacturer of key Airbus components.
The parties involved agreed in March to suspend retaliatory tariffs on goods such as Scotch whiskey for four months to give negotiations in the long-running row a chance. 
Truss said they were now working on the details of a draft text of an agreement, with the negotiations focused on ""subsidy disciplines"" in the aerospace industry.
""I am determined to make sure the United Kingdom has a strong aerospace industry, that we reach a resolution with the U.S. - which I think there absolutely is a landing zone for,"" she said in an interview.
Asked if a permanent resolution was possible by the end of the temporary tariff freeze, she said: ""Yes. I do. We are already in detailed discussions.""
U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai's office declined to comment. She told a Senate hearing this week she was ""very serious"" about resolving the dispute.
AUSTRALIAN DEAL
Truss was also upbeat about Britain concluding a free trade agreement with Australia by June, saying that ""huge progress"" had been made. 
""There's just a few outstanding issues to deal with and I'm looking forward to my call with him (Australian Trade Minister Dan Tehan) later today,"" she said, declining to give details. 
Truss held her first in-person meeting with World Trade Organization Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala in an hour-long session at the group's Lake Geneva headquarters on Friday at which they discussed WTO reforms.
Britain gained an independent seat at the WTO last year after it left the EU and has since been more assertive.
Truss said she was ""hugely hopeful"" of progress on reform of the 25-year-old trade body ahead of a major meeting in December, stressing that it was very important that its Appellate Body which rules on trade feuds be fixed.
The WTO's top appeals body was incapacitated in 2019 when President Donald Trump's administration blocked the appointment of new judges, leaving international trade's supreme court unable to issue rulings.
Truss stressed that a solution should be ""binding"", in an apparent contrast to a temporary, voluntary work-around backed by the EU and others.
WTO members are also due to discuss a temporary waiver on intellectual property rights for COVID-19 drugs and vaccines on Friday which London and other wealthy countries oppose.
Asked if she might change her stance amid rising pressure, Truss said: ""I don't think we have the evidence that the TRIPS waiver would actually deliver practical results."" 
Technology transfers should instead be the focus, she said, naming AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s voluntary licensing programme.

Truss also called for a WTO resolution on getting stronger industrial subsidy rules, including for China, a matter she is advocating while Britain holds the presidency of the G7 group of nations this year.
""It is in everyone's interests, including China's interest, that we resolve this issue,"" she said.

Investing.com --  DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG)'s got it going on. That's per Guggenheim, which initiated the company with a buy rating and price target of $75.Shares of the online gambling company are up slightly, to about $57.82. 
""We believe DraftKings is well positioned to capture a significant share of the rapidly growing North American Online Sports Betting (OSB) and iGaming markets,"" analyst Curry Baker wrote in a note, according to StreetInsider. 
More and more states are legalizing online gambling, and DraftKings is expanding operations to new markets as opportunities open up. DraftKings went public via a special-purpose acquisition company in April 2020, and shares have nearly tripled since then, though the stock is below its record.
""Beyond the momentum towards legalization and the inherent tailwinds new states/markets offer, we see several other competitive advantages underpinning our positive outlook for DraftKings: a premier sports gaming brand, a market leading position in OSB and iGaming already, a flexible proprietary technology platform that is scalable and vertically-integrated, and plenty of financial firepower to fund future growth,"" Baker wrote.

(Reuters) - Record demand to invest in sustainable investment funds saw the sector's total assets rise 19% to a fresh high of nearly $2 trillion in the first quarter, data from industry tracker Morningstar showed.
The surge in interest marked the fourth quarter in a row that the sector's assets have hit a record high, amid growing interest from investors for funds focused on environmental, social and governance-related issues.
Morningstar said its data captures all the funds which claim to have a sustainability objective or which use ESG criteria when deciding which assets to buy and sell.
The data showed global sustainable funds attracted a record inflow of $185.3 billion in the opening three months of the year, a 17% bump in new cash being invested compared with the prior quarter.

Europe, at the forefront of ESG investing, saw the biggest jump in demand, with net purchases of $146.7 billion, while funds based in the United States and Asia ex-Japan saw $21.5 billion and $7.8 billion of inflows, respectively.
Of the flows into European funds, the bulk was in actively managed funds, while index-tracking funds took in $44.5 billion, up from $40 billion in the prior quarter.
For a graphic on Sustainable funds' Q1 flows by region:
https://graphics.reuters.com/SUSTAINABLE-FINANCE/yxmpjdadjpr/chart.png
Demand has, in part, been driven by performance, with ESG funds up 4.6% this year on average, compared with a 1.1% gain for non-ESG funds, Refinitiv Lipper data showed. ESG funds have outperformed their non-ESG peers in 7 out of the last 10 years, the data showed.
""Inflows into ESG strategies are largely attributed to strong performance, more developed track records, and further awareness of ESG issues and factors,"" said Loren Asmus, vice president, investment research at Canterbury Consulting. 
""Active ESG and sustainable equity strategies have performed well over the last year given low exposure to traditional energy and high exposure to renewable energy.""
At the end of the quarter, Europe's share of global assets was 81.9%, the data showed, followed by the United States with 13.4% and Asia ex-Japan with 1.8%.
With rising awareness about environmental and social issues
such as climate change and boardroom diversity, demand is set to grow further in the coming months, leading to more funds being launched.
According to a Deloitte report, 200 new funds are expected to be launched in the United States with an ESG investment mandate over the next three years, more than doubling the activity from the previous three years.
According to the Morningstar data, 169 new sustainable funds were launched in the first quarter of 2021, down slightly from the record 215 launched in the last quarter of 2020.
Europe-based funds numbered 3,444, vastly outpacing the United States with 409 and Asia ex-Japan with 237.
After the recent launch of rules in Europe that seek to harmonise standards and increase transparency among sustainable funds, Morningstar said one in four of those it had analysed class themselves as sustainable in some way.

1514,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2021 09:40AM ET</span>",Intel seeks $10 billion in subsidies for European chip plant,"By Douglas Busvine
BRUSSELS/BERLIN (Reuters) - Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) wants 8 billion euros ($9.7 billion) in public subsidies towards building a semiconductor factory in Europe, its CEO was quoted as saying on Friday, as the region seeks to reduce its reliance on imports amid a shortage of supplies. 
The pitch is the first time Pat Gelsinger has publicly put a figure on how much state aid he would want, as Intel pursues a multibillion-dollar drive to take on Asian rivals in contract manufacturing.
""What we’re asking from both the U.S. and the European governments is to make it competitive for us to do it here compared to in Asia,"" Gelsinger told Politico Europe in an interview.
A spokesman for Intel confirmed the interview took place on Friday in Brussels, where Gelsinger was due to meet European Commissioner Thierry Breton for talks on semiconductor strategy.
Gelsinger, on his first European tour since taking charge, announced a new strategy last month for Intel to invest $20 billion in chip production in the United States.
On top of that, Gelsinger is prospecting for a location for a plant in Europe that he says would back Breton's goal of doubling the region's share of global chip output to 20% over the next decade.
Breton also held talks on Friday with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), the world's No.1 chip maker ahead of Korea's Samsung (KS:005930) and Intel.
""To meet current & future semiconductor industry demand, Europe will drastically increase production capacity - both on its own and through selected partnerships to ensure security of supply,"" Breton tweeted after the talks.
Recent disruption to semiconductor supply chains has added urgency to efforts to reduce import dependency, yet analysts caution Europe's shrunken technology base means it doesn't offer a viable market for a leading-edge plant, or 'fab'.
Industry and diplomatic sources say that, of the Big Three chipmakers, Intel is the only one so far to express concrete interest in Breton's goal of producing the most advanced chips in Europe.
Breton's drive to attract a major foreign chipmaker has unnerved home-grown players, and he is also discussing the creation of a European semiconductor alliance that would bundle their interests.
Germany's Infineon (OTC:IFNNY) said on Friday it welcomed Breton's initiative to strengthen chip production in Europe. 
""As financial resources are naturally limited it is important to discuss most urgent needs and the most reasonable ways of investment,” Infineon said.
GERMAN VISIT
Gelsinger, who met German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier on Thursday, was quoted as saying Germany would be a suitable location for a potential European foundry.
""Geopolitically, if you’re in Europe, you want to be in continental Europe,"" he told Politico.
""We think of Germany as a good candidate - not the only, but a good candidate - for where we might build our fabrication capabilities,"" he said, also indicating interest in the Benelux countries.
On the German leg of his visit, Gelsinger also met executives from carmaker BMW and telecoms operator Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY), Intel said.
Sources said he also visited the headquarters of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), although an Intel spokesman said he could not confirm that a meeting took place.
Separately, Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess was quoted on Friday as saying the carmaker planned to design and develop its own high-powered chips for autonomous vehicles. [L8N2MN4YR]
Gelsinger travels on next week to Israel, where Intel is due to announce a $200 million investment in a new chip development campus and the hiring of 1,000 staff.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Friday, retreating from record highs that were hit earlier in the week as Big Tech lived up to ambitious expectations for the first quarter.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rounded off a vintage quarter for Silicon Valley on Thursday evening, posting profits that were over three times the level of a year ago, the embodiment of how the pandemic has accelerated long-term trends toward online shopping and remote working. As with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) earlier in the week, Amazon also profited from rapid growth in its advertising business. Amazon stock rose 0.8% in early trade, defying the broader trend
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 140 points, or 0.4%, at 33,920 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.6%, as was the Nasdaq Composite. 
The main indices are still all on course to end the week higher, and some analysts have already revised up their year-end targets after a better-than-expected first quarter:  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts raised their S&P target for the year to 4,600, implying another 10% upside from current levels. They raised their aggregate earnings per share estimate for the index to $200 from $185.
Data published earlier offered a reminder of how much the current rally – and the economic recovery from the pandemic in general – owes to the vast scale of stimulus measure. U.S. personal income rose 21.1% in March as stimulus checks reached households across the country. Personal spending, meanwhile, rose by 4.2%. There was a frisson of excitement among inflation hawks after other numbers showed core personal consumer expenditures rising by 0.4% in March, more than expected and matching their highest increase in 20 years.
Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) was the standout performer in early trading, albeit for the wrong reasons. The stock fell 12.7% after management warned of slowing user growth in the second quarter, as well as rising costs.  
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was also in focus early, falling 0.7% after EU antitrust authorities said in a preliminary ruling that it had abused a dominant market position in the streaming business. 
Big Oil, meanwhile, failed to impress with its quarterly updates:  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock fell 0.4% and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) stock fell 1.6%, as the former broadly met expectations while the latter missed, thanks to the cold snap that disrupted almost all of the U.S. oil and gas complex in February. Chevron's earnings are more exposed to the U.S. geographically, since its acquisition of Noble last year.

1516,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2021 08:45AM ET</span>",Global funds hold equity allocations at over 3-year high: Reuters poll,"By Tushar Goenka
BENGALURU (Reuters) - The current run-up in stocks has at least another three months to go, according to fund managers in Reuters polls who kept their recommended equity exposure at last month's more than three-year high and trimmed suggested bond holdings further.
Global stocks have been on a tear, buoyed by fiscal stimulus - mainly from the United States - the expected vaccine-driven economic recovery and robust earnings, putting the MSCI world equity index on track for its best monthly performance since November.
That was despite the ongoing health crisis in many countries, especially India and Brazil, which are still facing challenges from the pandemic. The Federal Reserve also acknowledged the virus as a risk to an economic recovery.
The April 14-30 polls of fund managers and chief investment officers in the United States, Europe and Japan showed, of the model global portfolio, equity allocations accounted for 49.8%, the same as in March - which was a more than three-year high.
All but one of 24 fund managers in response to an additional question said the current bull-run in stocks would run for at least another three months, including five who expected it to last beyond six months.
""The factors supporting equity markets are the reopening of economies, the very accommodative central banks' stance, abundant liquidity and strong flows, with retail investors in the U.S. recycling the stimulus cheques into stocks,"" noted the investment team at General Investments Partners.
""On the other hand, equities face very expensive valuations, and company margins may start to deteriorate due to the surge in input costs. These factors should balance each other for a while, and talks about a gradual normalization in policies later this year could eventually weigh on stock markets.""
Those expectations for the rally in stocks to continue were fuelled by unprecedented fiscal stimulus packages, with that optimism also reflected in recent releases of economic indicators.
Data on Thursday showed U.S. economic growth accelerated last quarter, its best first quarter growth since the 1980s, fuelled by massive government aid to households and businesses.
While the Fed took an upbeat view of the economy, it waved off policy shift talks and downplayed the expected rise in inflation as transitory.
Still, nearly 80% of the fund managers, or 19 of 24, responding to another question said Treasury yields were more likely to rise in the coming three months.
Global asset managers recommended cutting bond holdings to 39.5% from 39.7% last month, the lowest since February 2019.
That is the first time in two years where suggested fixed-income allocations have accounted for less than 40% of the model global portfolio for three consecutive months. It was a record high 45.5% in October.
""Treasury bond yields, like equity markets, will be volatile over the rest of the year, but we are fully expecting them to rise gradually as inflationary pressures pick up and the Fed finally begins to reduce its stimulus packages and raise interest rates,"" said Peter Lowman, chief investment officer at Investment Quorum in London.
""Equally, this will not be a short-term concern, it's most likely a late 2022 to early 2023 story.""
Asked about changes to investment portfolios in the next three months, nearly three-quarters of 23 fund managers said they would roughly maintain the current risk positioning or reduce exposure to riskier assets. 
The remaining six suggested staying on the sidelines to capitalise on any pullback in equities from recent highs. 
""Most of the economic momentum is already priced into risk assets, there is little scope to increase risk,"" said Pascal Blanqué, chief investment officer at Europe's largest asset manager, Amundi, in Paris.

""We prefer to keep the same level of risk exposure or to look for some reduction, as risks in the market are asymmetric at this stage.""

1517,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2021 08:35AM ET</span>",New standards board targets mid-2022 for global climate company disclosures,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - A new global board for setting climate-related company disclosures aims to publish its first batch of standards by the middle of next year, officials leading the project said on Friday.
The London-based International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation (IFRS) has been asked by governments and financial regulators to set up the new body for writing standards on how listed companies should disclose risks from climate-change on their operations.
They want a consistent, single set of global norms to replace the current patchwork of public and private-sector approaches that make it harder for investors to compare companies and stop 'greenwashing' by corporates enhancing their green credentials.
""The goal would be by mid 2022 to have something on climate,"" IFRS executive director Lee White told Reuters.
The initial batch of standards will adapt existing norms set by global regulators from the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), already being used voluntarily by some companies.
""We want to consolidate what is out there, we are providing a running start,"" Lucrezia Reichlin, an IFRS trustee who is leading the work of the Sustainability Standards Board (SSB), told Reuters.
The SSB would set voluntary, minimum global standards and it would be up to each member country to decide how they would be applied. This 'building block' approach allows countries to enhance the SSB standards, if they want to.
The SSB will have at least a chair and vice chair, perhaps even a full suite of board members, in time for the UN COP26 climate change conference in Scotland in November that will be attended by world leaders, Reichlin said.
The IFRS was approached because of its experience in writing accounting rules used in over 140 countries, but that took many years and needed the critical mass of European Union backing.
Supporters so far include the International Monetary Fund, Britain, the UN, and global financial regulatory bodies like IOSCO and the Financial Stability Board, which coordinates G20 financial regulation.
Reichlin said there were ""positive signals"" from the United States, whose new administration under President Joe Biden has seen a major shift towards action on climate change. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said she supports setting up the SSB.
The EU, while broadly supportive of IFRS efforts, is pushing ahead with its own set of more comprehensive disclosure rules, saying an SSB could take years to establish itself.
""This concept of a building blocks approach, I am quite confident the EU will support,"" Reichlin said.

The IFRS on Friday said it proposed changing its constitution to accommodate the SSB.

LONDON (Reuters) -JPMorgan's development finance institution, which aims to fund more than $100 billion in activities per year, is looking to back more supply chain deals to help fight COVID-19 in developing countries, a bank executive told Reuters.
Some emerging markets such as India have struggled with supplies of vaccines and other medical equipment during the pandemic.
""We'd like to do more transactions that have development and impact at their heart,"" said Faheen Allibhoy, managing director of the institution.
The vaccine supply chain, gender-focused lending, water and food security, and climate-smart agriculture are areas where the institution will look to focus, Allibhoy said.
The JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Development Finance Institution was set up last year and aims to fund more than $100 billion annually in development activities from investment banking deals, with extra contributions from its markets businesses.
In 2020, the institution was involved in financing 437 development finance transactions worth a total of $146 billion.
It has helped with bonds for the governments of Morocco and the Dominican Republic, where the funds raised are aimed at helping companies affected by the pandemic and financing the state budget, respectively.
In 2021, it is also focusing on more deals where the bank acts as a financing structuring agent, having in February completed its first in Africa, a $620 million deal involving Liquid Telecom, Allibhoy said.
This month, the bank announced plans to finance and facilitate more than $2.5 trillion over 10 years to advance long-term solutions that fight climate change and contribute to sustainable development.

That includes supporting deals that help with improving quality of life in developing countries, with the aim of helping reach the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in emerging economies.
The deals the development finance arm was involved in during 2020 helped with the majority of the 17 SDGs, it said.

1521,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2021 08:01AM ET</span>","Wall Street seen off record peak, dollar on losing streak","By Carolyn Cohn
LONDON (Reuters) - Wall Street futures suggested a softer open on Friday following Thursday's record peak on strong U.S. data and earnings, while demand for risky assets put the dollar on course for its longest weekly losing streak since July. 
U.S. stock futures were down 0.4% after the S&P 500 closed at an all-time high. 
Data on Thursday showed U.S. economic growth accelerated in the first quarter, fuelled by massive government aid to households and businesses.
That came against the backdrop of the Federal Reserve's reassurance on Wednesday that it was not time yet to begin discussing any change in its easy monetary policy.
With just over a half of S&P 500 companies reporting earnings, about 87% beat market expectations, according to Refinitiv, the highest level in recent years.
""The Federal Reserve continues to support, Biden has this huge stimulus programme as well and the earnings season continues -- so far we have seen relatively benign as well as strong earnings,"" said Eddie Cheng, head of international multi-asset portfolio management at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Asset Management. 
MSCI's broadest gauge of world stocks covering 50 markets dipped 0.25% but remained close to a record peak touched the previous day, up 4.9% on the month.
For both the MSCI world index and the S&P500, analysts are expecting earnings in the next 12 months to recover to above pre-pandemic levels. 
In Europe, the euro STOXX index was down 0.22% and Britain's FTSE 100 was flat. 
Euro zone GDP data showed a year-on-year drop of 1.8% in the first quarter, stronger than expectations of a 2% fall, though economists said the bloc was on a recovery path.
""There is increasingly bright light at the end of the tunnel,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analysts said.
""The speed of the vaccinations is picking up and the EU recovery fund is also finally getting off the ground."" 
For a graphic on Euro zone economic growth and stocks:

New coronavirus infections in India surged to a fresh record, however, and France's health minister said the dangers of the Indian variant must not be underestimated.
""Risky assets have had quite a few wobbles within the month,"" said Cheng.
""We need to get used to the fact that this is not going to be a straight line.""
The euro extended its bull run to a two-month high of $1.2150 in the previous session but last stood at $1.2083, down 0.29%, following the euro zone data. 
""The euro is more sensitive to the European economic outlook, than to (what) happens in the U.S."", said Kit Juckes, head of FX strategy at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY).
Germany's 10-year Bund yield, which moves inversely to price, slipped 0.015% to -0.208%.
The dollar gained 0.25% against a basket of currencies, after hitting a two-month low on Thursday, but remained on course for a four-week losing streak, its longest since July.
The Canadian dollar hit a three-year high of C$1.2268 per U.S. unit, boosted by the Bank of Canada's tapering of its bond-buying programme and higher commodities including oil and lumber.
The dollar was steady against the yen at 108.86. 
Mainland Chinese shares lost 0.8% while Japan's Nikkei also shed 0.8% on position adjustments ahead of a long weekend. Both markets will be closed through Wednesday.
Oil prices fell a dollar a barrel on concerns about wider lockdowns in India and Brazil.

Brent reached $67.56 per barrel, after reaching a high of $68.95 on Thursday, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell dropped to $64.01 per barrel.

Humira sales rose 3.5% to $4.87 billion, beating expectations of $4.78 billion. Sales, however, fell 8.3% in markets outside the United States due to rising competition, especially in Europe. 
The world's best selling medicine, approved to treat psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, is also expected to face competition in the United States after 2023. 
AbbVie is now banking on newer treatments such as Skyrizi and rheumatoid arthritis drug Rinvoq to blunt the blow. 
Sales of Skyrizi surged about 91% to $574 million in the first quarter ended March 31, beating estimates of $569.89 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Net revenues rose nearly 51% to $13.01 billion, ahead of estimates of $12.76 billion.
Sales of Botox, which AbbVie gained through its $63 billion deal for Allergan (NYSE:AGN), rose 44.7% to $447 million as a treatment for wrinkles and other cosmetic uses, and the drug generated sales of $532 million as a treatment for conditions such as migraine.
Sales of the anti-wrinkle injection had been hit last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic as people avoided non-urgent medical procedures.
Net earnings rose to $3.55 billion, or $1.99 per share, from $3.01 billion, or $2.02 per share, a year earlier. 

AbbVie raised its full-year adjusted earnings forecast to between $12.37 and $12.57 per share, from its prior estimate of $12.32 to $12.52.

Virgin said that passenger numbers dropped 80% last year compared to 2019 after COVID-19 brought many planes to a standstill. 
Like most airlines, it is keen to return to flying at scale but there are concerns about when that will happen. Britain has said that May 17 is the earliest date travel can restart but it has not yet said which countries people can go to. 
Transatlantic routes formerly accounted for some 80% of Virgin's revenue, and the airline is keen to see the U.S. open. 
""With world leading vaccination programmes in both the UK and US, and evidence to support safe reopening through testing, there is a clear opportunity to open up travel and no reason to delay beyond May 17,"" Virgin's chief executive Shai Weiss said.
Virgin is 51% owned by Richard Branson's Virgin Group and 49% by the U.S.'s Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL). 
For its last financial year, it said revenue came in at 868 million pounds, down 70% on 2019, with an increase in demand for cargo the only bright spot in a year of passenger restrictions. 
Virgin Atlantic cut costs last year, shedding 41% of its workforce and retiring some older aircraft early.

1528,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2021 07:15AM ET</span>","U.S. fast-food chains cash in, seize market share during pandemic","By Hilary Russ
NEW YORK (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD), Taco Bell, Chipotle and other fast-food chains stand to gain yet more market share from sit-down restaurants as consumers stick with the mobile ordering habits they picked up during the pandemic. 
McDonald's Corp said on Thursday its first-quarter U.S. comparable sales soared 13.6% and that it had 40 million active app users in its six largest markets – half of them in the United States – as it seeks to attract even more customers through a loyalty program it expects to launch nationally this year.
Taco Bell and KFC parent Yum Brands Inc plans to use tech acquisitions in the last quarter to drive both ordering via social media platforms and marketing with artificial intelligence.  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (NYSE:CMG) said last week that it still anticipates opening 200 new restaurants this year, 70% of which will have digital drive-thru lanes.
For the 12 months ending in March, fast-food chains dominated the restaurant market – taking in 70.2% of dollars spent eating out and 82.9% of all restaurant traffic, according to data from The NPD Group that has not previously been made public.
Drive-thrus, new crispy chicken sandwiches and ""family meal"" deals helped draw customers that other restaurants lost. During the year ending in March, Americans spent nearly $281.6 billion on fast food – which gained the 7.1% of market share by dollars that full-service restaurants shed, the NPD data show. 
Fast food ""is going to be the bright spot in the restaurant space for a long time to come,"" NPD analyst David Portalatin said, noting that fast food was gaining market share even before the pandemic. 
To be sure, Bloomin' Brands (NASDAQ:BLMN) Inc, which said Thursday that it plans to expand 750 sit-down Outback Steakhouse locations to 1,000, grew its digital ordering 147% over last year.
But many independent restaurants could not ramp up digital operations as quickly. The National Restaurant Association estimates that 110,000 restaurants closed permanently in 2020.
At many fast food outlets, seating areas remain shuttered. 

""With 90%-plus of our business being through the drive-thru, if we can sustain that and return our dining rooms and takeaway to the levels that they were pre-pandemic, we've set ourselves up for a very good run here,"" said Joe Erlinger, head of McDonald's U.S. operations, on a call with analysts Thursday.

(Reuters) - U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital LP said it has raised $11.8 billion from outside investors and employees for its latest flagship North America buyout fund.
The fundraising comes amid a rebound in dealmaking activity among private equity firms as the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines has boosted global economic prospects and markets.
Bain amassed $10 billion from outside investors for its 13th buyout fund, Bain Capital Fund XIII, exceeding an initial $9 billion target. The firm's present and former employees also committed $1.8 billion in additional capital to the fund, a Bain spokeswoman said.
Bain's latest fund will seek to invest in a broad range of assets from consumer and healthcare companies to technology firms mainly in North America.
""We will continue to find interesting, transformational deals by leveraging our global resources and experience, our sourcing network, and vertical industry depth,"" John Connaughton, co-managing partner at Bain Capital, said in an interview.
The prior Bain Capital Fund XII, which had collected $8 billion from investors and raised an additional $1.4 billion from employees, made investments such as Virgin Australia airline, industrial firm Imperial Dade, and chipmaker Kioxia Holdings, which was carved out of Japanese conglomerate Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp in 2017. 
That fund succeeded the Bain Capital Fund XI, which had raised $7.3 billion from investors and its dealmakers.
Bain Capital Fund XII and Bain Capital Fund XI have generated net internal rate of returns (IRR) of 7.2% and 28.5% respectively as of the end of December, according to people familiar with the matter.

Based in Boston, Bain Capital has more than $130 billion in assets under management across private equity, credit, real estate, technology, life science, and public market holdings.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening lower Friday, handing back some recent gains as investors digest a flurry of earnings results, particularly from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), ahead of some key inflation data.
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 155 points, or 0.5%, S&P 500 Futures traded 23 points, or 0.6%, lower, and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 100 points, or 0.7%.
The main indices closed higher Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending up 0.7%, the S&P 500 gaining just under 0.7% to finish at a new closing high, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite up just over 0.2%.
Amazon reported earnings after the close of trading Thursday, and continued the example of peers like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) by posting record profits from pandemic shopping, sending its stock 2.4% higher premarket, to a new record high. The e-commerce giant also indicated sales would keep growing even as the U.S. economy reopened and customers ventured out to shops.
Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), by contrast, disappointed. The social media giant only matched expectations with its revenue and user numbers, and offered lukewarm revenue guidance for the second quarter, warned of rising costs.  
Earnings continue to flow Friday, with the likes of Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL),  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) and  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) scheduled to report. The oil majors could struggle to match the blockbuster numbers offered up by their European peers given the U.S. winter storm that halted output in some of the southern states.
Turning to economic data, investors will keep a wary eye on the Federal Reserve’s favorite gauge of inflation, with personal consumption expenditures figures due at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT).
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has repeatedly stated that the central bank would need to see inflation around 2% for a prolonged period before it decided to tighten its very accommodative monetary policies, but the release could still provide a valuable indication of how quickly prices are rising.
The economic news out of Europe was mixed, as the eurozone economy contracted 0.6% quarter-on-quarter in the first three months of the year, sliding into recession as widely expected. This was mainly caused by a 1.7% quarterly slump in its biggest economy Germany, though mitigated by 0.4% quarterly growth in second biggest France.
Oil prices weakened Friday, handing back some of the week’s hefty gains as signs of economic recovery stoked optimism of a strong rebound in global demand this year.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.8% lower at $63.83 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 1.6% to $66.97. Both contracts are still up around 3% this week, after earlier climbing to their highest levels in seven weeks.
Traders will be keeping an eye out for the Baker Hughes weekly oil rigs count, due for release later Friday, a gauge of future U.S. supply.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,768.90/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% lower at 1.2084.

After a year of ordering in, more Americans have started to go back to restaurants as a $1,400 stimulus payment from the government in March boosted spending, while the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines lifted consumer confidence. 

Total revenue rose to $1.26 billion in the first quarter ended March 31, from $1.23 billion a year earlier, and was above analysts' average estimate of $1.25 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
However, same-store sales at the company's Popeyes restaurant chain rose just 1.5% in the quarter, missing expectations of 1.7% growth. The Cajun-inspired fast-food chicken chain struggled to repeat last year's explosive growth when its social-media favorite chicken sandwich was still fresh in the minds of Americans.

1536,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2021 05:50AM ET</span>",AstraZeneca says on track to deliver on COVID shots as sales hit $275 million,"By Pushkala Aripaka and Ludwig Burger
(Reuters) -AstraZeneca said its COVID-19 vaccine sales were $275 million in the first-quarter and it is on track to deliver 200 million doses a month from April, as better-than-expected results and a second half growth forecast boosted its shares.
Chief Executive Pascal Soriot again defended the vaccine rollout on Friday, saying that Anglo-Swedish drugmaker had not overpromised on its ability to supply shots, as he defended big cuts in deliveries that prompted a European Union lawsuit. 
AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN), which has said it will not make a profit from the shot during the pandemic, was reporting financial details of distribution and sales of the vaccine it developed with Oxford University for the first time.
It said the revenue included delivery of about 68 million doses, adding that European sales were $224 million, emerging markets $43 million and $8 million in the rest of the world.
Sales of $275 million for 68 million doses equates to a price tag of around $4 per shot. 
AstraZeneca was one of the leaders in the global race to develop a COVID-19 vaccine. Its cheap and easily transportable shot was hailed as a milestone in the fight against the crisis, but has since faced a series of setbacks.
""Shipments (of COVID-19 vaccines) are increasing as manufacturing improves,"" Soriot said during a briefing, adding that it was on track to deliver 200 million doses a month.
""We never overpromised, we communicated what we thought we would achieve at the time,"" he said.
AstraZeneca shares were up 3.5% at 7,654 pence at 0942 GMT, putting them on track for their best day since October. The stock, which hit record highs in July 2020 due to optimism around the vaccine, ended last year 4% lower. 
The results come after a bruising start to the year as the drugmaker struggles with production of its vaccine and faces a legal battle after cutting deliveries to Europe, while regulators probe rare blood clots in people who got the shot. 
""Despite the intense operational and political challenges created by AZN’s COVID-19 vaccine roll out, the core business continues to perform above market expectations in a most challenging quarter, demonstrating strength across therapeutic areas and geographies,""  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analysts said in a note.
VACCINE RACE 
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), whose COVID-19 vaccine co-developed with German partner BioNTech is several times more costly than AstraZeneca's, has forecast $15 billion for its share of sales, with analysts expecting as much as $18 billion on average. 
BioNTech expects close to 10 billion euros ($12.1 billion) in revenues from committed vaccine deliveries this year but raised the prospect of more supply deals. 
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) in February said it was expecting sales of $18.4 billion from its own vaccine this year. 
Before AstraZeneca's earnings, market researcher GlobalData said it expected annual sales of $278 million this year and next for the drugmaker's coronavirus vaccine, branded Vaxzevria.
AstraZeneca said it is working as fast as possible to compile data to apply for U.S. approval. Soriot said there was nothing wrong with the data, but the dataset was very large.
RESILIENT 
AstraZeneca's core business has proved resilient, with the drugmaker sticking to its forecast for 2021 on Friday and predicting better times ahead.
This guidance does not include any impact from sales of the vaccine and its $39 billion purchase of Alexion (NASDAQ:ALXN), which is expected to close in the third quarter.
Total revenue of $7.32 billion for the three months to March exceeded analysts' expectations of $6.94 billion, while core earnings of $1.63 cents per share beat a consensus of $1.48. 

Quarterly sales growth was driven by best-selling lung cancer drug Tagrisso, up 17% to $1.15 billion, while revenues from heart and diabetes drug Farxiga jumped to a better-than-expected $625 million, on new prescriptions for heart failure.

1538,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2021 05:30AM ET</span>",Britain proposes easing listed SPAC suspension rule,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's financial watchdog on Friday proposed changing how special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) can list as the City of London seeks to bolster its global attraction after Brexit.
After a surge in what are dubbed ""blank check"" companies on Wall Street and more recently in Europe, Britain is keen that London is not left behind. 
SPACs list on an exchange and must use the proceeds to buy an existing company within a set timeframe.
The UK's Financial Conduct Authority said it was proposing a waiver on the current rule that trading in a listed SPAC should be suspended at the point where it identifies a company to acquire.
Suspension, aimed at preserving market integrity until more information on the target company is made available, can trap investors in the SPAC for potentially many months.
Suspension would be waived if a minimum 200 million pounds is raised when a SPAC initially lists, a proposal aimed at attracting more institutional investors, the FCA said.
Cash raised from public shareholders should also be ring-fenced for an acquisition, and shareholder approval would be needed for any proposed takeover, the FCA said.
There must also be a ""redemption"" option allowing investors to exit a SPAC prior to any acquisition being completed, and a time limit on a SPAC's operating period if no acquisition is completed, the watchdog said.
""We would expect our changes to provide a more flexible regime for larger SPACs, while still ensuring investor protections, potentially resulting in a wider range of large SPACs listed in the UK, increased choice for investors and an alternative route to public markets for private companies,"" said Clare Cole, the FCA's director of market oversight.
The FCA said there are 33 SPACs listed in Britain, with 13 suspended. Among the 20 with live listings, only two have a market capitalisation of more than 100 million pounds.
Charles Howarth, a partner at law firm CMS, said the proposals address the fundamental problem deterring investors from London-listed SPACs - getting stuck with shares in a proposed acquisition they may not like.

Removing the suspension requirement should make SPACs a more attractive prospect on the London market, Howarth said.

1540,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2021 05:20AM ET</span>","Barclays, BNP Paribas see profit spike from stock trading frenzy","By Lawrence White, Matthieu Protard and Iain Withers
LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) -  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) reported bumper first-quarter profits on Friday, as an equities trading boom offset a slump in demand for fixed income products, showing the value of having a broad-based banking business.
The topsy-turvy trading results for two of Europe's biggest remaining investment banks highlighted how volatile markets amid the global pandemic caused seesawing demand for different asset classes.
Barclays' January-March profit more than doubled to 2.4 billion pounds from 923 million pounds a year ago, while its French rival said net profit rose 37.9% to 1.77 billion euros($2.14 billion), both beating analyst forecasts. 
But a relatively sluggish performance by their traditionally strong fixed income trading businesses lagged rivals, including  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
BNP Paribas shares fell 1%, while Barclays shares fell 5% as analysts noted its rising costs, which the bank said was partly due to paying traders more for their strong performance.
Both Barclays and BNP benefited from lower than expected charges for bad loans, as government support measures in their domestic economies helped to defer the economic pain from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Barclays took an impairment charge of just 55 million pounds compared with 2.1 billion pounds in the same period a year ago, while BNP Paribas said its similar measure fell 37% to 896 million euros.
Barclays' approach contrasted however with bullish moves by rivals such as HSBC and Lloyds (LON:LLOY) to release big chunks of provisions set aside for potential soured loans.
European banks have generally been more cautious on provisioning for bad loans than U.S. peers such as JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), which earlier this month released more than $5 billion.
FICC THIN
The bumper equities performances from the two banks partly made up for thin returns from fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC), where client demand slumped.
Barclays reported a 35% decline in FICC income, while at BNP Paribas it fell 16% as interest rate and foreign exchange-related products in particular fell out of favour.
""We would have liked to do better than we did on FICC, we take a prudent approach to risk,"" Barclays CEO Jes Staley told reporters. 
Rival banks which have already published first-quarter earnings seemed to dodge the fixed income decline, with Deutsche Bank's fixed-income and currency sales revenue increasing 34% while Goldman Sachs reported a 31% rise in such trading. 
For Barclays and BNP Paribas, the equities trading boom coincided with a flood of corporate listings in Europe. The turnaround in equities was timely for BNP Paribas in particular, after earnings in the first quarter a year ago were wiped out by losses related to dividend-linked derivatives as European companies suspended payouts.
The listing bonanza bolstered Barclays' banking advisory business within its investment bank, as income rose 35% to 859 million pounds from fees for advising on equity fundraisings.
The generally strong performance in the past few years from Barclays' investment bank has vindicated Staley's backing of the business, during a period when activist shareholder Ed Bramson urged him to cut it back.

Hundreds of top-tier executives at Alibaba are not entitled to salary hikes this year, unless they performed extraordinarily, four sources familiar with the matter said.
The Hangzhou-based company, though, has offered considerable wage increases to junior staff, they said.
The pay moves mark a departure from the usual for Alibaba, which has been the focal point of China's months-long crackdown on the mainland's big and powerful technology companies on worries about their market dominance and ability to sway public opinion.
Its management level executives, over the years, received on average a 5% to 10% pay rise annually and were also given stock incentives, one source said.
In a statement to Reuters, Alibaba did not directly comment on the pay freeze for executives, but said: ""Talent is Alibaba Group's most important asset. We have a robust and competitive compensation system that reflects our priorities in cultivating our next generation of talents.""
The sources declined to be named as they were not allowed to speak to media.
Alibaba's Hong Kong-listed shares fell more than 2.5% on Friday, in line with a weak broader market.
Alibaba, which runs businesses from e-commerce to cloud computing to logistics to entertainment, employed more than 252,000 staff as of 2020. It usually decides pay rises for most employees in April.
The Alibaba business empire has come under intense scrutiny in China since billionaire founder Jack Ma's stinging public criticism of the country's regulatory system in October.

It was fined a record 18 billion yuan ($2.78 billion) earlier in April after an anti-monopoly probe found the e-commerce giant had abused its dominant market position for several years.
China's State Administration for Market Regulation has taken aim recently at China's large tech giants in particular, mirroring increased scrutiny of the sector in the United States and Europe.

Investing.com - Shares in security software group Darktrace soared on their London Stock Exchange debut Friday, as the listing was well received despite the controversy surrounding its links to controversial investor Mike Lynch.
At 4:25 AM ET (0925 GMT), the company’s stock was trading at 330 pence, a sharp increase from the initial listing price of 250 pence a share, which valued the company at 1.7 billion pounds ($2.4 billion).
The company uses artificial intelligence developed by its team of Cambridge mathematicians to understand IT networks and detect attacks by identifying unusual behavior.
The British cyber security firm, in which tech entrepreneur Lynch owns just less than a 25% stake, had been targeting a 3 billion pound ($4.1 billion) valuation. However, some institutional investors appeared to shun the float with Lynch still fighting a U.S. extradition request to face fraud charges related to the sale of Autonomy, which he founded, to Hewlett Packard in 2011. He denies the charges.
Lynch stepped down from Darktrace's board in 2018 after the U.S. filed charges related to Autonomy.

Investing.com - European stock markets edged higher Friday, helped by further evidence that the region is recovering from the pandemic-influenced slump, while the first-quarter earnings season also continues. 
At 3:50 AM ET (0850 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.6% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.2%, and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.3%.
Global stock markets have been pushed to record levels of late by signs of a broad economic recovery, helped by vast amounts of fiscal stimulus and ultra-easy monetary policies.
More evidence of this recovery came from France, as the Eurozone's second-biggest economy grew 0.4% in the first three months of the year from the fourth quarter, when it had shrunk 1.4%.
The news was less impressive in Spain, as its economy contracted 0.5% in the first quarter, down 4.3% on the year, but this still represented an improvement on the 8.9% annual drop the previous quarter. Germany's GDP fell even more sharply, by 1.7%, rather than the 1.5% expected.
Eurozone GDP data are due at 5 AM ET (0900 GMT), and the bloc’s economy is forecast to have shrunk 2% in the first quarter versus a 4.9% fall in the final quarter of last year.
Elsewhere, the earnings season continues, with AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) stock up 2.5% after the much-maligned drugmaker said it expected higher sales in the second half of the year. It reported first-quarter profit and sales ahead of analysts' average expectations, including $275 million in Covid-19 vaccine sales.
The banking sector remained in focus Friday, with  Barclays  (LON:BARC) stock down almost 6% after the U.K. bank reported first-quarter net profit of 1.7 billion pounds ($2.37 billion), but declined to release cash set aside to cover bad loans as its peers had done, suggesting caution going forward.
BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) stock also fell 1.3% after its better than expected first-quarter profit was helped by lower provisions for pandemic-related bad loans. Banco de Sabadell (MC:SABE) stock climbed 4% after its British unit TSB swung back to a profit in the first quarter after speeding up a cost-cutting plan and seeing a rebound in its equity trading business.
Elsewhere, Nestle (SIX:NESN) stock rose 0.6% after the world’s largest food packaging company said it has bought vitamin and supplements maker The Bountiful Company for $5.75 billion.
Oil prices edged lower on profit taking Friday, but are still set to end the week with hefty gains as signs of economic recovery stoked optimism of a strong rebound in global demand this year.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% lower at $64.53 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.5% to $67.68. Both contracts are up around 4% this week, climbing to their highest levels in six weeks.

ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) board member and risk committee chairman Andreas Gottschling will not stand for re-election, the Swiss bank said on Friday, the latest head to roll among top leadership after the Greensill and Archegos debacles. 
Gottschling is leaving after proxy adviser Glass Lewis and some of Credit Suisse's large investors were opposed his re-election to the board at the shareholders meeting due to be held later on Friday. 
They said he needed to be held accountable for the investments made by the bank that have imploded this year.
The annual shareholders meeting, due to start at 0830 GMT, will mark the arrival of former Lloyds Banking (NYSE:LYG) Chief Executive Antonio Horta-Osorio as new chairman, and the exit of Chairman Urs Rohner, whose tenure has been marred by several crises, including a $2.6 billion settlement over helping people evade U.S. taxes and an embarrassing corporate spying scandal that last year forced then-CEO Tidjane Thiam's ouster.
Credit Suisse is now raising capital, has halted share buybacks, cut its dividend and revamped management after losing at least $4.7 billion from the collapse of family office Archegos and suspending funds linked to insolvent supply chain finance company Greensill.
""Andreas Gottschling has informed the Board that he will not stand for re-election at the Credit Suisse 2021 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders,"" Credit Suisse said in a short statement.
David Herro, vice-chair of Harris Associates, which says it owns 10.25% of the bank's stock, and the Ethos Foundation, which advises 225 Swiss pension funds and public utility foundations owning between 3%-5% of the company's stock, wanted Gottschling to be removed at the upcoming shareholders meeting, according to media reports.
Chief Risk and Compliance Officer Lara Warner and investment banking head Brian Chin have already left the bank following the losses.
Ethos is also among investors managing $2.5 trillion who called for the bank to take a tougher stance on coal financing, amid concern its current policies are too lax, according to a letter seen by Reuters.

Norway's oil fund, which at the end of 2020 owned 3.43% of Credit Suisse stock, also said it would vote against Gottschling's re-election.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's Banco Sabadell said on Friday its British unit TSB swung back to a profit in the first quarter after speeding up a cost-cutting plan, however the group's bottom line fell 22% as lending income remained under pressure.
The bank reported a net profit of 73 million euros ($88.5 million), above a 56 million euros forecast from analysts polled by Reuters, as it booked fewer provisions for loan losses.
Banks across Europe are under growing pressure from rising bad debts and record-low interest rates as they grapple with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Sabadell's net interest income, earnings from loans minus deposit costs, fell 5.8% to 833 million, in line with market forecasts.
In the UK, TSB booked a net profit of 10 million euros, its first positive quarterly results in two years, adding 2 million euros to the group's bottom line, after it cut 352 jobs and closed 70 branches in the quarter.
Sabadell bought TSB in 2015, but its acquisition backfired when IT glitches sent costs spiralling in 2018.
Though Sabadell, which will present its new strategic plan on May 28, had said it wanted to sell TSB, the Spanish lender's new management team, headed by Chief Executive Officer Cesar Gonzalez-Bueno, has frozen the process for now.
Sabadell's failure to merge with bigger rival BBVA (MC:BBVA) in November added pressure and its CEO is expected to focus on new cost-cutting measures and a new digital drive.

Investing.com - European stock markets are seen opening slightly lower Friday, ending the week on a cautious note following disappointing Chinese growth data and ahead of key European numbers and the continuing first-quarter earnings season. 
At 3:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% lower, CAC 40 futures in France were flat and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.2%. 
Global stock markets have been pushed to record levels of late by signs of a broad economic recovery, helped by vast amounts of fiscal stimulus and ultra easy monetary policies.
However, earlier Friday, China’s official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index fell to 51.1 in April from 51.9 in March, missing forecasts in April as supply bottlenecks and rising costs weighed on production.
That said, losses are likely to be limited after the broad-based S&P 500 index closed at a record high on Wall Street Thursday, helped by strong earnings from some tech giants as well as U.S. first-quarter GDP rising 6.4%, better than expectations for a 6.1% rise.
Back in Europe, the French economy also grew more than expected in the first quarter, climbing 0.4% from the fourth quarter, as consumer spending and business investment held up despite coronavirus curbs. 
More GDP and inflation data are due from the major European countries and the Eurozone as a whole.
The earnings season also continues, with BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) likely to be in the spotlight after the French banking giant reported a better than expected first-quarter profit, helped by lower provisions for pandemic-related bad loans and a rebound in its equity trading business.
Swiss Re (OTC:SSREY) swung to a profit in the first quarter as the strong underlying performance of all of the reinsurer’s businesses more than offset losses related to Covid-19 and large natural catastrophes, while French aerospace and defense company  Safran  (PA:SAF) reiterated its full-year guidance despite posting a drop in first-quarter revenue.
Elsewhere, Nestle (SIX:NESN) said it has bought vitamin and supplements maker The Bountiful Company for $5.75 billion.
Oil prices edged lower on profit taking Friday, but are still set to end the week with hefty gains as signs of economic recovery stoked optimism of a strong rebound in global demand this year.
Confidence is returning to the market, with the OPEC+ alliance raising its consumption estimates for this year and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) predicting oil demand will post a record jump as vaccination rates increase. This is enabling the market to largely overlook the resurgence in Covid-19 in the Indian subcontinent.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% lower at $64.53 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.6% to $67.65. Both contracts are up around 4% this week, climbing to their highest levels in six weeks.

The KitKat chocolate bar maker bought Bountiful from KKR in a deal which covers the U.S. company's Nature's Bounty, Solgar, Osteo Bi-Flex and Puritan's Pride brands. Nestle had flagged talks on Monday.
The deal, expected to be completed during the second half of this year, did not include the sports and active nutrition brands Pure Protein, Body Fortress and MET-Rx, as well as Dr.Organic and the Canadian over-the-counter business, which did not fit with the rest of Nestle Health Science business.
""This acquisition complements our existing health and nutrition portfolio in terms of brands and channels,"" said Greg Behar, CEO of Nestle Health Science.
""It will establish Nestle Health Science as the industry leader in mass retail, specialty retail, e-commerce and direct-to-consumer in the U.S., while offering significant opportunities for geographic growth,"" he added.

Nestle is paying 3.1 times the value of Bountiful's sales for the brands, and a multiple of 16.8 times of their earnings before interest before tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA).
The acquired brands had sales of $1.87 billion in the year to March 2021, with an EBITDA margin of 18.3%. The margin is expected to increase above the Nestle Group average once synergies are fully implemented by 2024, the Swiss company said.

Net profit was $333 million during the period, compared with a $225 million loss a year earlier. Analysts had expected a small loss, according to a consensus forecast.
Swiss Re and its competitors have faced large claims from the pandemic, such as those for cancelled events. Swiss Re last year posted its first loss since the financial crisis in 2008.
But the company expects to return to profit this year, executives have said.
""We have seen a solid start to 2021 and expect all our businesses to continue delivering a strong underlying performance with diminishing COVID-19 losses,"" Chief Executive Christian Mumenthaler said in a statement.

The euro zone's biggest listed lender said net profit rose 37.9% to 1.77 billion euros ($2.14 billion) from a year earlier, beating a mean forecast for 1.20 billion in a poll of analysts compiled by Refinitiv.
Revenue was up 8.6% at 11.83 billion euros, above the 11.2 billion expected by analysts.
In its corporate and investment banking activities, revenue rose by 24.3%, spurred by a 41.4% jump in its markets business.
BNP Paribas said a rebound in equity trading offset a 15.7% drop in fixed income, currencies and commodities trading.
""Primary, credit and commodity derivatives activities performed very well but the context was less favourable than in the first quarter of 2020 for rates and forex activities,"" the lender said in a statement. 
It reported no impact from the implosion of U.S. investment fund Archegos, which has caused more than $10 billion of losses across other global banks.
BNP's equity business brought in 697 million euros, a strong showing compared with a year ago, when widespread dividend suspensions wiped out all of its earnings. 
However, its larger fixed income, commodity and currency business lagged rivals.  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)'s fixed-income and currency sales revenue increased 34% while Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) reported a 31% rise in such trading.
BNP Paribas, which said two months ago that the worst of the global coronavirus crisis was over for its loan book, said it expected the economy to gradually recover from the pandemic.
Its cost of risk, which reflects provisions for bad loans, was down 37% to 896 million euros.

Shares in BNP Paribas have gained 24.7% so far this year, outperforming a 23.8% rise for the Stoxx Europe 600 Banks Index.

CANBERRA (Reuters) - An Australian court ordered mining magnate Clive Palmer to pay A$1.5 million ($1.2 million) in damages to Universal Music on Friday for breaching the copyright of Twisted Sister's 1984 hit song ""We're Not Gonna Take It"" in political advertising.
The Federal Court heard that Palmer had refused to pay Universal to licence the song but had used it anyway, with modified lyrics, in advertising for his political outfit, United Australia Party (UAP), ahead of a 2019 general election.
Palmer argued the tune in the advertisements was based on the Christian hymn ""Oh Come All Ye Faithful"" and that his lyrics - ""Australia ain’t gonna cop it, no Australia’s not gonna cop it, Aussies not gonna cop it anymore"" - had nothing to do with the U.S. glam rockers' hit song.
Federal Court Justice Anna Katzmann said Palmer's defence was ""fanciful"".
""In the face of the evidence it is, with respect, ludicrous to suggest that the UAP recording was created independently of (We're Not Gonna Take It),"" she wrote in a ruling published.
Palmer had been ""high-handed and contemptuous"" and ""gave false evidence, including concocting a story to exculpate himself,"" she added.
As well as the damages, Palmer was ordered to pay costs and to remove all copies of his song.
Twisted Sister lead singer Dee Snider responded to the ruling on Twitter: ""It's over baby! WE WON BIG!!""
""We're not gonna take copyright infringement any more!!"" he wrote after the verdict. 
A spokesman for Palmer said the businessman would examine the ruling and consider an appeal.
Palmer made a fortune from real estate and mining before entering federal politics in 2013 on a populist platform. 
His party won a handful of seats before imploding in acrimony and in-fighting, and failed to win a single seat in 2019 despite spending A$83 million on advertising.

1557,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2021 12:26AM ET</span>",Vietnam's answer to Tesla has U.S. in its electric sights,"By James Pearson and Phuong Nguyen
HAIPHONG, Vietnam (Reuters) - Move over Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), how about a VinFast?
That's the proposition being offered by the automobile arm of Vietnam's largest conglomerate, Vingroup. It's betting big on the U.S. market with its VinFast line of cars and hoping that electric SUVs and a battery leasing model will be enough to woo consumers away from homegrown market leaders like Tesla and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). 
A recent arrival on the automotive scene and the No. 5 car brand in Vietnam, VinFast is not short on ambition, with its sights set on a U.S. listing and a valuation of as much as $60 billion, according to two sources familiar with its plans. 
(GRAPHIC: VinFast fifth in terms of Vietnam sales in 2020 - https://graphics.reuters.com/VIETNAM-VINFAST/rlgvdzyjgvo/chart.png)
It will launch in North America and Europe in 2022, CEO Nguyen Thi Van Anh told Reuters, joining a crowded field of players seeking to compete with Elon Musk's Tesla, including a slew of loss-making upstarts fuelled by a Wall Street fundraising craze.
""We are going to North America - U.S., Canada - and Europe at the same time. In Europe, we're going to Germany, France and the Netherlands,"" Van Anh said in an interview at the company's sprawling factory complex near the northern port of Haiphong.
Standing behind VinFast is Vingroup, Vietnam's answer to a South Korean chaebol or catch-all conglomerate. Founded as an instant noodle business in post-Soviet Ukraine, the company's trajectory has mirrored that of Vietnam, one of Asia's fastest-growing economies, with interests spanning real estate, resorts, schools, hospitals and smartphones.
Even with such formidable local backing, VinFast has its work cut out as industry giants such as General Motors, Toyota and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) spend tens of billions of dollars to develop electric and driverless vehicles. 
Founded in 2017 with a team led by former General Motors Co executives, the company is aiming to compete on vehicle size and price – pitching an electric SUV that Van Anh described as ""more luxurious"" than those currently on offer.
VinFast cars will also come with a battery leasing scheme that means the cost of the battery, one of the most expensive components of an electric car, will not be included in the final price.
""I'm going to give you a better product. I'm giving you an SUV. I'm giving you a more spacious car,"" said Van Anh, who will relocate next month from Hanoi to Los Angeles to head VinFast's U.S. operations.
According to a presentation prepared by the company for potential investors, VinFast cars will be cheaper compared to other electric-vehicle (EV) models.
A Tesla SUV sells for around $50,000, but Van Anh, who declined to discuss potential competitors, would not be drawn on how much a VinFast SUV would sell for. Two of the company's three electric models are destined for the United States, where the company is targeting annual sales of 45,000 cars, she said. 
(GRAPHIC: Sales of battery electric vehicles in the U.S. market - https://graphics.reuters.com/VIETNAM-VINFAST/rlgvdzdojvo/chart.png)
AN EDGE OVER THE COMPETITION?
There is precedent for Asian carmakers cracking the U.S. market. Toyota in the 1970s and Hyundai in the 1980s overcame initial scepticism with products that eventually stole market share from U.S. manufacturers.
VinFast, which achieved annual sales of around 30,000 units last year in Vietnam and has yet to make a profit, faces an uphill battle. 
""Their biggest challenge is convincing consumers that they have a solid product and a compelling value proposition,"" said Bill Russo, head of Shanghai-based consultancy Automobility Ltd and a former Chrysler executive.
""The product itself looks to have the right appearance and features, but this will only get you in the game. Winning requires a technology or business model edge over the competition."" 
(GRAPHIC: VinFast finances - https://graphics.reuters.com/VIETNAM-VINFAST/dgkvlyobmpb/chart.png)
The company is betting its battery leasing scheme – where customers would pay a monthly amount roughly equivalent to what the average consumer might spend on petrol – will win over U.S. customers.
When the battery, which uses cells from South Korea's Samsung (KS:005930) SDI, is at 70% of its full lifespan, VinFast will replace it, Van Anh said.
A similar scheme has already been rolled out in China by Tencent-backed electric vehicle maker Nio (NYSE:NIO), whose ES6 SUV has a starting price of around 358,000 yuan ($55,272).
No EV maker can compete with Tesla in the near future, according to Michael Dunne, chief executive of automotive consulting firm ZoZo Go, pointing to the U.S. company's across-the-board strengths.
""But the good news is that companies like VinFast do not have to beat Tesla to win. All they really need to do is convert a portion of the 65 million consumers who bought gasoline-powered cars in 2020 to switch over the electrics,"" said Dunne.
VinFast, whose manufacturing facility in Vietnam has the capacity to churn out 250,000 cars a year, is planning on conducting most of its U.S. sales online, removing the need for a costly dealership network. It has had 15,000 advance orders so far for its VF (NYSE:VFC) e34 electric car in Vietnam.
The company has hired Jeremy Snyder, a 10-year Tesla veteran, as its U.S. Chief Growth Officer. 
Snyder told Reuters he was VinFast's first employee on the ground in the United States but, between full-time employees and consultants, the company now has around 100 people working there.
""It's very exciting to bring Vietnam and the United States closer through VinFast,"" he said. 
TAPPING THE SPAC?
Vingroup's founder, Pham Nhat Vuong, Vietnam's richest man, has pledged to invest $2 billion of his own money into the car division and Vingroup has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into VinFast by issuing international bonds and selling off stakes in other units.
But expansion over the years has pushed up Vingroup's debt and losses at some of its ventures have squeezed its cashflow. To turbocharge its growth, VinFast will need more cash. The company is looking at tapping into a funding frenzy in the United States, where investors, including some of the world's biggest money managers, have poured billions into auto startups via blank-check companies known as special-purpose acquisition companies or SPACs.
Three sources with direct knowledge of the plans said VinFast was leaning towards a SPAC, although Van Anh declined to comment on when or how the company would generate funding in the United States.
Officials from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will visit Vietnam soon to meet with Vingroup executives about its efforts to list, two separate sources said. If VinFast does list in the United States it will be the first Vietnamese company to do so. ""When it happens, how it happens, whether by SPAC or by another method, we'll make the right decision at the same time,"" said Van Anh.
There are hundreds of SPACs searching for companies to take public and investors are desperate to identify the next Tesla, whose stratospheric market rally has made Musk one of the world's richest men. 
Nio, which made a net loss last year of $860 million, has a market cap of around $67 billion, according to its New York stock listing and sold just under 44,000 cars last year, close to what VinFast is targeting in the United States.
A stream of EV-related startups notched up multi-billion dollar valuations last year despite not having products ready to sell but their shares have taken a knocking recently.
VinFast likes to distinguish itself from other EV startups.
""If you look at some of the SPAC deals that already happened, they do not really have what we currently have,"" said Van Anh.
""Even if we don't have a product in the world market, we have the products here.""

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were down Friday morning despite another record run for U.S. stocks overnight, as investors digested a slew of end-of-month economic data in the region.
China’s Shanghai Composite fell 0.61% by 10:14 PM ET (2:14 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component was down 0.47% ahead of a weeklong holiday beginning on Saturday. The manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for April was 51.1, below the 51.7 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and March’s 51.9 figure. The non-manufacturing PMI was 54.9, also below March’s 56.3 reading.
In the private sector, the Caixin manufacturing PMI for April was 51.9, above the 50.8 in forecasts prepare by Investing.com and April’s 50.6 reading. Investors now await the Caixin services PMI, due in the following week.
In Japan, the Nikkei 225 was down 0.50% as the country returned from a holiday. Industrial production increased 2.2% month-on-month in March, higher than the 2% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and February’s 1.3% contraction. The Tokyo core Consumer Price Index contracted 0.2% year-on-year in April as per expectations but was lower than March’s 0.1% contraction.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.55%. Data released earlier in the day said that the Producer Price Index rose 0.2% year-on-year, and 0.4% quarter-on-quarter, in the first quarter of 2021.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid 1.55% as the city recorded its first untraceable case of a COVID-19 mutant variant on Thursday. South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.89%.
U.S. shares ended the previous session on a downward note, even as the S&P 500 recorded a new high. Investors digested mixed corporate earnings as well as concerns that a global chip shortage could wipe out Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) earnings-driven gains. U.S. Treasuries also weakened.
Investors are expecting U.S. government support to continue even after Thursday’s positive economic data. The U.S. GDP rose 6.4% quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter of 2021 and 553,000 initial jobless claims were filed over the past week.
They also continue to digest President Joe Biden’s proposed $1.8 trillion social package and infrastructure plans, as well as the Federal Reserve’s continued dovish monetary policy.
“All evidence still points to continued support from both fiscal and monetary policy against a backdrop of accelerating corporate earnings,” UBS Global Wealth Management chief investment officer Mark Haefele told Bloomberg.
“This reinforces our view that markets can advance further, with cyclical parts of the market -- such as financials, energy, and value stocks -- likely to benefit most from the global upswing,” he added."
1559,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 29, 2021 10:09PM ET</span>",Hong Kong Bourse Bets on New IPO Inflow From Eased Listing Rules,"(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong is counting on a fresh inflow of overseas firms selling shares in the financial hub as it proposes to ease its listing rules.
The exchange is seeking to lure more firms, in particularly those from mainland China amid tension over their ability to trade on U.S. exchanges. It has proposed expanding listing rules to include secondary listings to all companies as long as they have one vote per share. Currently, only innovative and high growth dual-class share firms are eligible for secondary listings in Hong Kong. It also wants to lower the minimum market capitalization for secondary listings.
Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. has estimated about 18 Chinese companies currently listed elsewhere could take advantage of the new rules. “Through these changes, HKEX will become more welcoming and accommodating to overseas potential issuers,” Christina Bao, head of global issuer services, said in an interview with Bloomberg on Thursday.
Even so, it faces formidable competition from the U.S., whose depth of capital has long been a potent lure for Chinese companies. Despite tensions and U.S. sanctions being imposed, Chinese firms are listing in the U.S. at the fastest pace ever.
Bao, however, said Hong Kong offers advantages, and those that have chosen to sell shares in the city this year have a larger average float size than those which opted for the U.S. “If issuers are seeking a wide recognition from both mainland China and the rest of the world, Hong Kong is the place,” she said.
The exchange this week reported record quarterly earnings in the first three months of the year driven by a boom in listings. Funds raised in initial public offerings jumped ninefold in the period. Big name Chinese companies such as streaming platform Bilibili (NASDAQ:BILI) Inc. and search giant Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU). sold shares.
The new rules are the next step after the exchange operator in 2018 introduced major reforms to allow companies with weighted voting rights and pre-revenue biotech firms to list in Hong Kong. That brought tech giants such as  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd., Meituan and Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) Corp. to the city and made it the world’s second largest biotech fundraising hub.
Since the new rules were introduced, 146 new economy companies have listed in Hong Kong, accounting for 61% of the IPO funds raised, according to HKEX’s data. Among them were 31 pre-revenue biotech companies and 13 secondary listings.
These companies made up 95% of funds raised in the first quarter of this year, Bao said.
The consultation period on the new proposal runs until May 31.

1562,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2021 07:50PM ET</span>","Gig companies oppose U.S. push for worker employee status, suggest compromise","By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - Under growing threat by a new U.S. administration insistent on reclassifying ride-hail and food delivery workers as employees with full benefits, gig economy companies including Uber,  Lyft , Doordash and Instacart are pushing to keep drivers' independent contractor status, albeit with additional benefits.
The companies, whose business model relies on low-cost flexible labor, argue that surveys show the majority of their workers do not want to be employees, saying a new generation of workers wants to choose when and how much to work.
They hope to convince U.S. officials and lawmakers to drop attempts to reclassify gig workers as employees, efforts that have gained urgency with the election of U.S. President Joe Biden, who campaigned on the promise of delivering benefits to gig workers.
U.S. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh on Thursday intensified the debate, telling Reuters in an interview that ""a lot of gig workers should be classified as employees.""
Shares in Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc, Lyft Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) and DoorDash Inc fell as much as 12% on Thursday following Walsh's comments. Turning gig workers into employees would jeopardize the companies' business model, which relies on millions of largely part-time workers who do not receive any benefits, such as unemployment or sick pay.
Less than two weeks after Biden was declared the winner of the 2020 presidential election, Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, Instacart and Postmates banded together to form the App-Based Work Alliance, a Washington-based advocacy group.
In response to Walsh's remarks, the Alliance in a statement on Thursday said it looked forward to coming together with the secretary to have ""much-needed discussions about advancing modern policies that protect worker independence and flexibility, while strengthening benefits and protections.""
The group says its goal is to achieve changes in U.S. labor law that allow workers to maintain flexibility while also receiving more modest benefits than required for employees, including minimum pay standards, healthcare subsidies and accident insurance.
Uber sent a letter to the Biden transition team in December and one to all members of Congress in February, calling on them to support what the company calls its ""third-way"" proposal.
Labor groups say that proposal would create a new underclass of workers with fewer rights and protections.
Gig Workers Rising, a group of workers that advocates for greater benefits, on Thursday called on regulators to step in and protect working people.
CALIFORNIA VOTE
The gig economy companies scored a decisive win in California in November, when voters of the Democratic-leaning state supported a company-sponsored ballot measure that cemented gig workers' status as independent contractors, overwriting a state law that would have made them employees.
Gig workers in the state now have access to limited benefits, including healthcare subsidies, accident insurance and minimum pay while passengers are in their car.
Those benefits are significantly less costly than employee benefits. Turning California ride-hail drivers into employees would have left Uber and Lyft each with more than $392 million in annual payroll taxes and workers' compensation costs alone, a Reuters calculation showed. 
But absent from the proposals companies have put forward so far is the provision of unemployment pay, one of the most costly employer benefits. 

The lack of gig workers' access to unemployment coverage was thrown in the spotlight during the coronavirus pandemic, when an act of Congress saw taxpayers foot the unemployment bill for such workers.

1563,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2021 07:45PM ET</span>","Twitter breaks tech's blockbuster streak, shares fall on tepid outlook","By Elizabeth Culliford and Sheila Dang
(Reuters) -Twitter Inc shares sank 11% in post-market trading on Thursday as it offered tepid revenue guidance for the second quarter, warned of rising costs and expenses and said user growth could slow as the boost seen during the coronavirus pandemic fizzles.
The social media company posted revenues and user numbers mostly in line with analyst estimates in stark contrast to the better performing digital ad firms like  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's. 
It said it expected second quarter revenue between $980 million and $1.08 billion, lower than Wall Street estimates of $1.06 billion on average, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. It also said stock based compensation for new hires would be more than expected this year. 
Twitter says it wants to reset after years of product stagnation, announcing in February bold goals to expand its user base, speed up new features for users, and double its revenue by 2023.
""The explosive growth that Twitter experienced during the pandemic is slowing rather rapidly in the aftermath of an eventful 2020 in which the microblogging site benefited immensely from the U.S. elections and a pandemic-driven surge,"" said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at Investing.com.
Ad revenue for the first quarter were $899 million, up 32% from the same period a year ago and beating analyst estimates of $890 million. Total revenue for the quarter was $1.04 billion, up 28% year-over-year and slightly higher than estimates of $1.03 billion.
Google and Facebook, the top two largest digital advertising platforms, both blew past revenue expectations in their first quarters. Advertisers consider both to have more ad formats and better ad targeting capabilities than Twitter.
Asked on a conference call with analysts why Twitter did not see the same growth surge as other digital ad firms, CFO Ned Segal said the company, which relies more on brand advertising, typically sees a slow start after the holidays, which was exacerbated by real-world events like the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.
Twitter reported 199 million daily active users, up 20% year-over-year, compared to analysts' estimates of 200 million, according to FactSet data. 
The San Francisco-based company repeated its warning that growth of its monetizable daily active users (mDAU) - its term for daily users who can view ads - could reach ""low double digits"" in the next quarters, likely hitting a low point in Q2. 
Segal said Twitter wanted to retain the users it added during the COVID-19 pandemic, so that ""as economies open up, as the events that they've been watching from their sofas are now available in person...they continue to come to Twitter.""
'TOO EARLY' TO TELL
The company said in a letter to shareholders it was too early to understand the full impact of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s privacy policy change which began rolling out on Monday, but said its integration with a new ad measurement tool from Apple has increased the number of iOS devices it can target certain types of ads to by 30%. 
Twitter pledged in February a goal to double its annual revenue to $7.5 billion in 2023 from $3.7 billion in 2020. Responding to criticism that was summed up by CEO Jack Dorsey this year as ""we're slow, we're not innovative, and we're not trusted,"" the company has recently snapped up newsletter platform Revue and podcast company Breaker and teased a litany of new products.
The company is also testing a live audio feature ""Spaces"" to compete with Clubhouse. It is also working on ways for users to find topics of interest and has teased new ways for creators to make money on the site, from tipping to ""super follows"" where fans can pay for exclusive content. 
Twitter, which banned former U.S. President Donald Trump following the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, remains in the spotlight over its content policies and algorithmic systems. Both Dorsey and Twitter's head of U.S. public policy appeared in front of Congress in recent weeks as lawmakers mull changes to social media platforms' liability protections. 
Twitter said it expected total revenue to grow faster than expenses this year, assuming that the coronavirus is less of a factor and that it sees ""modest impact"" from Apple's changes. 

But it said in its outlook that stock-based compensation expenses for this year will amount to $600 million, up from its previous guidance of between $525 million to $575 million, as the company ramps up hiring. It forecast capital expenditures to be $900 million and $950 million for the full year.
Twitter said it expects headcount, as well as total costs and expenses, to increase at least 25% in 2021 on a year-over-year basis.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. regulators should strengthen their oversight of insurers to prevent potential overcharging and discrimination in selling coverage for cars and homes, a consumer watchdog group said on Thursday.
The campaign by the Consumer Federation of America (CFA) comes after an industry group removed protections that required rates for coverage to reflect the costs, a principle the industry has adhered to since 1988.
The Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS), a trade organization, in December rescinded three related principles that govern how insurance companies calculate the rates they charge for property and casualty coverage. 
CAS said the principles were largely duplicated by later actuarial standards, so they ""were no longer necessary and rescinding them will eliminate any confusion.""
The CFA said some insurers have been trying since 2013 to change or eliminate the principles to make way for broader use of ""price optimization"" algorithms ""that raise premiums above the cost of the risk for those who do not shop around"" for the best rates. 
When the CAS board eliminated the principles, without public comment, the action ""shocked and infuriated many members of CAS and state insurance regulators,"" CFA said.
The CAS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
""People who don't shop will see higher prices if price optimization is applied,"" Robert Hunter, director of insurance at CFA, told Reuters. ""Groups the insurers are less interested in - such as lower-income people and communities of color - would be at risk."" 
Since the principles helped enforce state laws that require rates be ""not excessive,"" ""everyone is at risk to a degree, but particularly communities with lower competition,"" Hunter said.
Pressure for tougher enforcement also may come from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, an organization of state regulators. The organization said on Thursday it is considering establishing its own set of principles for setting rates for property and casualty insurance. 
""The task force will discuss the issue on its May conference call,"" spokeswoman Laura Kane told Reuters.

1565,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2021 07:21PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Credit Suisse investors call for tougher coal finance policy - letter,"By Simon Jessop and Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi
LONDON/ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) investors managing $2.5 trillion have called for the bank to take a tougher stance on coal financing, amid concern its current policies are too lax, a letter seen by Reuters showed.
The role of lenders in financing the activities of companies responsible for the major share of greenhouse gas emissions has increasingly been the focus of investors and policymakers, keen to accelerate climate action.
Thermal coal, used to generate electricity, has been a focal point as it is one of the heaviest-emitting fossil fuels and investors are eager to see it phased out. A similar investor group has already won a pledge to do so from HSBC and is urging  Barclays  (LON:BARC) to follow suit.
While backing Credit Suisse's pledge to align its financing with the Paris Agreement on climate and set science-based emissions-reduction targets within two years, the investors said they also wanted ""firm"" operational steps to curb coal lending.
Since shareholders cannot ask questions of the board at the company's virtual annual general meeting on Friday - which will be overshadowed by the bank's losses from investment fund Archegos - the investors, including one of Europe's biggest, Amundi, wrote to the board on Thursday laying out their demands.
Coordinated by responsible investment NGO ShareAction, the group also includes the Ethos Foundation, which advises 225 Swiss pension funds and public utility foundations and whose members hold between 3%-5% of the company's stock, as well as BMO Global Asset Management, Actiam and Folksam.
In the letter, the group said the expansion of the coal industry had ""long been recognised as being incompatible with the goals of the Paris Agreement"", which requires countries to get to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.
Citing research from the Rainforest Action Network showing Credit Suisse to be Europe's third-biggest funder of coal power and Europe's largest backer of coal mining between 2016 and 2020, the letter said the bank was lagging peers on the issue.
Last July, the bank said it would stop funding or underwriting companies with a coal share of revenue greater than 25%, unless they had a ""credible"" strategy to diversify away from thermal coal.
""However, the bank does not disclose what it considers to be a 'credible transition strategy away from thermal coal extraction or coal power', as opposed to some of its European peers,"" the letter said.
In its 2020 sustainability report, the bank said its new restrictions had already seen it turn down some business, adding it had further decided against deals above and beyond those policies, including a bond issuance for a large thermal coal mining and power generation company, on the basis of sustainability.
It said it had also developed sector-specific energy transition frameworks for clients active in a number of fields, including coal mining.
Despite that, the investors said they wanted the bank to set a firm date by which it will have phased out lending to coal companies, in line with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recommendations to do so in OECD countries by 2030 and the rest of the world by 2040.
A spokeswoman for Credit Suisse said in response to a request for comment, “We are in continued close contact with ShareAction about our energy policy and climate strategy, appreciate their constructive engagement and their recognition of the significant progress we have made”. 
For Credit Suisse clients currently involved in the sector or using coal in some way, the investors called on the bank to help them develop, publish and implement coal phase-out plans in line with the IPCC recommendations no later than December 2023.

Lastly, the group said Credit Suisse should curb its general corporate financing, underwriting and advisory services to companies developing new coal mines and coal-fired power plants.

1566,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2021 07:21PM ET</span>","Ground control out, remote control in at London City Airport","By Sarah Young
LONDON (Reuters) - At London City Airport, the air traffic controllers have gone. Rising over the terminal building, the old control tower with its panoramic windows is deserted, with screens, a few pens and some hand sanitiser all that remains.
City quietly switched to a remote, digital air traffic control centre earlier this year, the first major international airport to do so, and on Friday it went public with the news.
The point is to improve efficiency and allow for smooth future expansion, because the same number of controllers can deal with a larger number of plane movements thanks to new technology that provides them with more data than before.
Located beside former dockyards a few miles east of the Canary Wharf financial district, City is the smallest of London's airports. Before the pandemic, it served 5 million passengers a year, mostly travelling on business to European destinations like Frankfurt and Amsterdam.
Now, planes take off and land guided by air traffic controllers who are based 90 miles (144 km) away, in an office block in Swanwick, southwest of London.
""Not being at the airport anymore, you don't have that smell of jet fuel when you arrive at work,"" said controller Lawrie McCurrach from his new base. 
""But fundamentally, the job hasn't changed. It's still about the controller's eyes finding the aircraft and monitoring it visually. The difference is we're using screens instead of windows.""
The switch to remote air traffic control has ""raised a few eyebrows"", says Alison FitzGerald, London City's chief operating officer, but she adds so far it has worked seamlessly. 
The controllers direct traffic using information that comes to them from a newly built, taller control tower at the airport, equipped with 16 high-definition cameras and multiple lenses.
The tower has metal spikes on top to protect its cameras from birds, and each camera has a self-cleaning mechanism to stop insects and debris from blurring the lenses.
The images they produce travel down multiple high-speed fibre links to the new remote control centre, where they come up on 14 screens which together provide a panoramic view of the runway.
""In the remote event that we lost one of those links, there's always a back-up,"" said FitzGerald.
ROAR OF ENGINES
The live sound of the airport is piped into the new control centre so that controllers still hear the planes' engines roaring into life and the reverse thrust of touch down.
Jonathan Astill, director of airports at the UK's National Air Traffic Services added: ""We think we've got all the risks well covered. So cybersecurity is well covered, for example.""
For City Airport, the new remote tower, which cost just under 20 million pounds ($28 million) to design and build, is not primarily about saving money. 
""It benefits safety, and it also benefits efficiency. It enables us to grow in a more efficient way,"" FitzGerald said. 
""It's more safe because actually what we're doing is providing air traffic controllers with more data.""
Once flying recovers after the pandemic, City will be able to handle 45 plane movements per hour, up from 40 in 2019.
Britain has banned most travel due to COVID-19 but is set to allow people to fly again from May 17. FitzGerald said she was ""cautiously optimistic"" about the summer. City's August capacity is forecast to be at about 27% of 2019 levels. 
The airport's plan for a remote tower dates back to 2016, when it realised that in order to go ahead with a 500-million-pound expansion plan to fit in extra, bigger planes, it would need to significantly invest in the old control tower. 
It decided instead to build a new one given the efficiency benefits offered by new remote technology developed by Swedish company Saab.
FitzGerald said that City's new tower had attracted interest from big airports and that remote air traffic controllers will become more common in future.
Heathrow, Britain's busiest airport, is considering remote control towers in its future plans. 
""When we look at our expansion plans that includes remote control towers,"" chief executive John Holland-Kaye told Reuters.

1567,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2021 07:10PM ET</span>",GM to invest $1 billion in Mexico to build electric vehicles,"By Sharay Angulo and David Shepardson
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -General Motors Co said on Thursday it will invest $1 billion in a manufacturing complex in Mexico, drawing immediate criticism from the union for U.S. autoworkers as it prepares to build electric vehicles in 2023 in the border state of Coahuila.
GM said it is building a new high-tech paint shop that will start operations from June at the Ramos Arizpe site, which currently assembles conventional internal-combustion vehicles, including the Chevrolet Equinox and Blazer models, along with engines and transmissions.
The United Auto Workers criticized GM's decision to build EVs in Mexico instead of using the union's members in the United States when Washington is considering large new incentives for electric vehicles.
""At a time when General Motors (NYSE:GM) is asking for a significant investment by the U.S. government in subsidizing electric vehicles, this is a slap in the face for not only UAW members and their families but also for U.S. taxpayers and the American workforce,"" said UAW Vice President Terry Dittes in a statement, calling it ""unseemly"" to accept U.S. government subsidies and make vehicles outside the United States.
GM responded to the UAW statement by noting it has ""recently announced nearly 9,000 jobs and more than $9 billion in new electric vehicle or battery cell manufacturing facilities in Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee.""
The White House did not immediately comment, but President Joe Biden has called for $174 billion to boost U.S. EV production, sales and infrastructure.
On Wednesday, Biden told U.S. lawmakers ""there's no reason why American workers can’t lead the world in the production of electric vehicles and batteries.""
GM issued a news release about the Mexican investment only in Spanish on its website and later provided an English translation when asked.
GM said it also plans to build batteries and electrical components at Ramos Arizpe and is making other improvements to its manufacturing complex.
GM did not say when it began building its new paint shop but previously came under criticism from former President Donald Trump for its Mexican operations. Trump had threatened to tax GM vehicles imported from Mexico.
GM aims to build two Chevrolet electric SUVs at Ramos Arizpe starting in 2023, according to Sam Fiorani, who tracks future vehicle production for AutoForecast Solutions.
A GM spokesman said the company was not announcing or confirming the electric vehicles that will be built in Coahuila, describing Fiorani's comment as speculation.
The automaker already makes electric vehicles at four locations in the United States and Canada. GM has said it aspires to halt U.S. sales of gasoline-powered passenger vehicles by 2035.
GM's Ramos Arizpe expansion will include new capacity to make batteries and other electronic components, which will begin during the second half of this year, the company said.
""I'm sure this investment will contribute to continue boosting Mexican manufacturing while bringing development to the region, the industry and the country,"" said Francisco Garza, president of GM's Mexican unit, during a webcast announcement.

Garza said he could not rule out adding a third production shift to the Ramos Arizpe facility in the near term, which would depend on meeting certain economic conditions.
The facility's current workforce has 5,600 direct employees.

(Reuters) - Wall Street financiers let out a cautious cheer on Thursday after hearing New York City aims to fully reopen on July 1, craving the meetings and meals of work life before the pandemic, but also loathing the grind of mass transit, packed office elevators and conventional business attire.
    New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on Thursday announced his intention to get things back to normal. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who controls reopening decisions, voiced optimism it might happen even before July 1.
    If their timelines hold up, some Wall Street workers look forward to frequenting the restaurants, bars, workout studios and entertainment venues that they have missed.
    ""After more than a year in isolation, I am prepared to have drinks with just about anyone who breathes,"" said Kai Liekefett, who defends corporations against hedge fund managers pushing for changes as co-chair of law firm Sidley Austin's Shareholder Activism Practice.
    ""Even activists,"" he added.
Rob Dicks, head of Accenture’s capital markets talent and organization practice, said: ""Video is an evolution ... and is effective, but there are some topics that just need to be covered face-to-face.”
    Fund managers, bankers and lawyers who spoke to Reuters joked about a run on reservations at restaurants like Marea or Casa Lever, high-end Italian restaurants in Midtown Manhattan where billionaires and Wall Street bigwigs are often sighted.
    At the same time, people expressed concerns about office conditions, whether companies can require employees to get vaccinated, and whether the working-from-home comforts will fly out the window.
The most populous U.S. city, New York was the early epicenter of the pandemic more than a year ago. The mayor said his optimism reflected the progress of a massive drive to get New Yorkers vaccinated.
Financial companies including JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and T. Rowe Price Group Inc have announced plans to have most employees back in the office by July, while Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB) and others are considering allowing employees to work in the office three days a week.
Will major financial firms keep workspaces clean, separate and airy?    
""A lot of people are really nervous and aren't sure what this will actually mean,"" said one person at a private equity firm who is not allowed to speak publicly about internal matters.
    And what about the dress code? Another person who works at a hedge fund recalled having his first in-person professional meeting since the pandemic. He wore athletic pants – a “business comfortable” attire he is not eager to abandon.
    ""It was very casual and I went in Lulus,"" he said, referring to Lululemon-brand trousers.
    For others, a year of remote work has created habits so deep that they are here to stay.
    Hedge-fund manager David Tawil who co-founded Maglan Capital collected his personal belongings from the office in August. He has not returned and does not plan to, even when things open up.

""I am available to travel into New York City whenever needed, but I haven't had a need,"" Tawil said. ""I've been handling all my meetings virtually and it's been great. It's truly a new life.""

1572,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2021 05:50PM ET</span>","Amazon expects spring windfall as U.S. economy reopens, posts record profits","By Jeffrey Dastin and Akanksha Rana
(Reuters) -Amazon.com Inc posted record profits from pandemic shopping and indicated sales would keep growing even as customers emerged from their homes in the reopening U.S. economy.
Since the start of the coronavirus outbreak, shoppers have relied increasingly on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) for delivery of home staples and supplies. While brick-and-mortar stores closed, Amazon has now posted four consecutive record quarterly profits, attracted more than 200 million Prime loyalty subscribers, and recruited over 500,000 employees to keep up with surging demand.
Amazon said it expects operating income for the current quarter to be between $4.5 billion and $8 billion, which assumes about $1.5 billion of costs related to COVID-19.
Shares rose 4% in after-hours trade.
Throughout the pandemic, the world's largest online retailer has been at the center of safety and workplace issues, with a failed attempt by organized labor to unionize an Amazon warehouse in Alabama and litigation in New York over whether it put profit ahead of employee safety.
Net sales climbed to $108.5 billion in the first quarter ended March 31 from $75.5 billion, beating analysts' average estimate of $104.5 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Bezos touted the results of the company's cloud computing unit Amazon Web Services (AWS) in a press release, saying, ""In just 15 years, AWS has become a $54 billion annual sales run rate business competing against the world’s largest technology companies, and its growth is accelerating.""
AWS's long-time chief Andy Jassy is scheduled to succeed Bezos as Amazon's CEO this summer. His unit continues to be a bright spot. Just last week, for instance, Dish Network (NASDAQ:DISH) Corp announced a deal to build its 5G network on AWS. The division increased revenue 32% to $13.5 billion, ahead of estimates of $13.2 billion.
Brian Olsavsky, Amazon's chief financial officer, said many businesses want to outsource their technology infrastructure to AWS. 
""We expect this trend to continue as we move into the post-pandemic recovery,"" he said.
Adding to Amazon's revenue was its growing chain of physical stores, including Whole Foods Market and its first overseas cashier-less convenience shop, opening last month in the London Borough of Ealing. Amazon delved further into healthcare as well with an online doctors-visit service for employers, representing another area it is aiming to disrupt after retail, enterprise technology and Hollywood.
Profit more than tripled to $8.1 billion.
AD SALES GROWTH
Amazon, which saw its stock price nearly double in the first part of 2020 as it benefited from the pandemic, has this year underperformed the S&P 500 market index. Its shares were up about 8.5% year to date versus the index's 13% gain.
At the same time, spending on COVID-19 and logistics has chipped away at Amazon's bottom line. The company has poured money into buying cargo planes and securing new warehouses, aiming to place items closer to customers to speed up delivery. It said Wednesday it planned to hike pay for over half a million employees, costing more than $1 billion - and it is still hiring for tens of thousands more positions.
Olsavsky told reporters the company intends to increase spending on video content this year as well. Consumers have been watching content for more hours on Amazon, he said.
While far behind ad sales leaders  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, Amazon is growing its ad business because brands' placements often result directly in sales, reaching customers who are on Amazon with an intention to shop.
Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com, said, ""Outside of its core retail and cloud units, advertising revenue is increasingly becoming another substantial growth driver for Amazon.""

Amazon said ad and other sales rose 77% to $6.9 billion, ahead of analysts' estimate of $6.2 billion.
The company also announced its intention to host its marketing blitz Prime Day in the current quarter. Olsavsky said the reason for this was to attract more customers' attention and be better for business partners than the company's more typical July scheduling.

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc will hold its annual meeting on May 1 in Los Angeles. As in 2020, the meeting will be held virtually because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, a Californian who missed the 2020 meeting, held in Omaha, Nebraska, will rejoin Buffett on stage to answer 3-1/2 hours of shareholder questions.
Here are some facts about Buffett and Berkshire. 
FACTS ABOUT WARREN EDWARD BUFFETT
Born: Aug. 30, 1930
Education: University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Columbia Business School
Family: Buffett has been married to Astrid Menks since August 30, 2006. His first wife Susan Thompson Buffett died in 2004. They had three children: Susan, Howard and Peter. 
Net worth: $103.3 billion on April 28, 2021, ranking sixth worldwide. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Chief Executive Jeff Bezos ranked first. (Source: Forbes)
Berkshire ownership stake: 16.2% as of March 3, 2021
Berkshire voting power: 32.1% as of March 3, 2021
How Buffett took charge: In 1965, Buffett was a shareholder in Berkshire, then a struggling New England textile company. He planned to sell back his shares for $11.50 each, but the term sheet showed $11.375. An angered Buffett responded by buying all the shares he could, and won control of Berkshire on May 10, 1965. The textile business closed in 1985.
Famous Buffett quotation: ""Lose money for the firm, and I will be understanding. Lose a shred of reputation for the firm, and I will be ruthless."" - Sept. 4, 1991 congressional testimony about Salomon Inc, where Buffett became interim chairman to restore order after a Treasury auction bidding scandal.
Philanthropy: Buffett has since 2006 donated more than $37.4 billion to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and four family charities. His Berkshire stock will go to philanthropy after he dies.
Home: Buffett has lived since 1958 in the same house on a well-trafficked Omaha street, and does much of his work there. The five-bedroom, 2-1/2-bath home on 0.72 acres was assessed at $935,300 in 2021, down 12% from 2020. (Source: Douglas County, Nebraska)
Diet: Likes steaks, and eats candies from See's, which Berkshire owns. Estimates that one-fourth of his caloric intake comes from Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), a longtime Berkshire investment.
Buffett on the pandemic: ""Nothing can basically stop America. We faced great problems in the past. We haven't faced this exact problem. In fact, we haven't really faced anything that quite resembles this problem, but we faced tougher problems, and the American miracle, the American magic has always prevailed, and it will do so again.""

In an unusual hearing of the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel on Thursday, lawmakers from both parties and from both the Senate and the House said that they had introduced bills aimed at stopping practices that pharmaceutical companies use to fend off generic competition, which studies show tend to push down prices.
""Millions of Americans started their day with a dose of prescription medication. Unfortunately, for many patients, those drugs aren't affordable. Prescriptions are left at the pharmacy counter. Doses are skipped or rationed until the next paycheck. 
That's unacceptable,"" said Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican, at the House hearing. 
Two of the bills, one in the House and another in the Senate, is aimed at stopping product-hopping, or making a minor change to a medication to win a new patent.
Others would seek to ban pay-for-delay patent settlements, where brand name drug companies pay generics to delay entering the market. Another enables the Federal Trade Commission to ban sham citizen petitions, where drug companies petition the Food and Drug Administration about a generic company seeking approval for a rival drug with the goal of delaying its approval.
And a last pair are aimed at making it easier to bring biosimilars, essentially generic versions of biologic drugs, to market. These medicines are more complicated than chemical medicines because they include living organisms.

Each of the bills has a Republican lawmaker and a Democrat as a sponsor of both the House and Senate versions. To become law, bills must pass the House and Senate and be signed by the president.

1576,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2021 04:50PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Forbes pursues SPAC talks amid new takeover interest - sources,"By Joshua Franklin, Krystal Hu and Echo Wang
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Business news and information publisher Forbes Media LLC is in talks to go public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) as it attracts new acquisition interest, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. 
Forbes' owner is also fielding offers from bidders including investment vehicle Borderless Services Inc, which has bid $700 million, and from a consortium led by tech investor Michael Moe, the sources said. Both of these bids would result in Forbes remaining a privately held company. 
A deal could result in Forbes' ownership changing hands seven years after Hong Kong-based investor group Integrated Whale Media Investments purchased 95% of the company. The remainder of Forbes is owned by the Forbes family. 
A proposed deal with a SPAC would take Forbes public on the U.S. stock market, enabling the existing owners to benefit from any share price increase on their remaining stakes. 
The identity of the SPACs in talks with Forbes was not immediately clear.
A Forbes spokesman said: ""We have no comment, but investors have consistently shown interest in Forbes, which has produced three years of record results. 2021 is shaping up to be a strong year as well."" 
Integrated Whale Media could not immediately be reached for comment. Moe and Borderless Services declined to comment.
Moe is founder and CEO of GSV Ventures. Borderless Services is an investment vehicle specializing in blockchain technology and is led by entrepreneur Patrick McConlogue. 
The Borderless Services bid has a debt financing commitment from private equity firm Ares Management (NYSE:ARES) Corp, the sources added. Were it to acquire Forbes, Borderless Services would install a new management team and introduce cryptocurrency products such as a Forbes digital wallet, where users could manage digital currencies, some of the sources said.
Ares Management declined to comment.
The sources, who requested anonymity because the matter is confidential, cautioned it is still possible no deal for Forbes will materialize or another bidder could emerge. 
Forbes joins other media companies including Bustle Digital Group and BuzzFeed in pursuing a SPAC deal. SPACs are shell companies that raise funds in an initial public offering with the aim of merging with a private company, which becomes public as result. In the past year, they have become a popular alternative to a traditional IPO. 
The digital media industry has been consolidating as media brands try to build scale in order to sell subscriptions and appeal to advertisers. Industry executives and dealmakers see SPACs as a popular option to help finance acquisitions for multiple media properties. 
Forbes was valued at $475 million in 2014 when Integrated Whale Media bought a majority stake in the company from the Forbes family and investment group Elevation. Chinese conglomerate HNA Group made an unsuccessful bid to acquire a majority stake in Forbes in 2017, Reuters reported at the time. 
As one of the oldest media outlets in the United States, Forbes publishes its flagship magazine which reaches 6 million readers. Founded by B.C. Forbes in 1917, it has long championed capitalism and entrepreneurship and is known for its annual list of the world's wealthiest people.

The company has been undergoing a digital transformation amid declining print revenue. It has been doubling down on expanding key franchises like Under 30 and live events, most of which have become virtual during the COVID-19 pandemic. It says its digital platform now reaches more than 140 million people with 40 global editions.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is auditing Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's process for making minor design changes across its product line after a 737 MAX manufacturing issue grounded dozens of planes, the regulator said on Thursday.
The FAA is also investigating the origin of the electrical manufacturing issue disclosed on April 7 that led to the grounding of 109 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft worldwide, including 71 in the United States, it added. The audit's goal is to identify ""areas where the company can improve its processes,"" it said.
Boeing responded that it looks ""forward to ongoing engagement with, and direction from, the FAA as we continuously improve safety and quality in our processes.""
The FAA has scrutinized other Boeing production issues.
In September, the FAA said it was investigating manufacturing flaws involving some Boeing 787 Dreamliners. Last month, the agency confirmed it was retaining authority to issue airworthiness certificates for four 787 aircraft.
The FAA on Wednesday ordered Boeing to fix bonding issues in the electrical systems in some 737 MAX planes that could lead to a loss of engine ice protection loss and critical functions on the flight deck.
The FAA warned the issue could impact ""engine ice protection, and result in loss of critical functions and/or multiple simultaneous flight deck effects, which may prevent continued safe flight and landing.""
The FAA said the affected airplanes were made after a design change in early 2019. Boeing must also fix more than 300 additional undelivered planes, according to FAA documents and people briefed on the matter.

Boeing said Wednesday it had ""been working closely with the FAA and our customers to finalize two service bulletins that will ensure a sufficient ground path in those areas.""

The Danish state prosecutor filed preliminary charges against nine former managers in 2019 accused of breaching Danish money laundering laws.
Danske Bank is under investigation in Denmark and several countries over some 200 billion euros ($242 billion) of suspicious transactions that passed through the bank's Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015.
The prosecutor said in January charges against six of them had been dropped, without naming those charged.
On Thursday, lawyers representing Borgen, former finance chief Henrik Ramlau-Hansen and former head of business banking Lars Stensgaard Mørch told Borsen charges against their clients had been dropped.
A spokesman for the prosecution service confirmed to Reuters that charges against all nine former Danske Bank managers had been dropped. 
Individuals must have shown gross negligence in order to be convicted under the Danish money laundering act. 
""It is the prosecutor's overall legal assessment that there is no evidence that any individuals have shown negligence to such an extent that it can be characterized as gross and that they have thus violated the law,"" the spokesman said.
A criminal investigation against Danske Bank for possible violation of money laundering legislation is still ongoing, he said.

(Reuters) -  Gilead Sciences Inc  (NASDAQ:GILD) on Thursday said its first-quarter product sales rose 16%, including $1.46 billion in sales of its COVID-19 antiviral drug remdesivir, but sales of flagship HIV and hepatitis C drugs were down due to the effects of the pandemic.
The biotech company reported adjusted earnings of $2.08 per share, edging out the average analyst estimate of $2.07 as compiled by Refinitiv. Net income rose to $1.72 billion from $1.54 billion.
The 16% rise in revenue for the quarter to $6.4 billion was still short of Wall Street estimates of $6.73 billion. 
Gilead said the COVID-19 pandemic continued to hurt sales of its treatments for hepatitis C and HIV, due to fewer people going to their doctors during the pandemic. It now expects a more gradual recovery in the market starting in the current quarter.
Excluding remdesivir, its product sales fell 11% to $4.9 billion. 
Sale of remdesivir, which is sold under the brand name Veklury, were also below analysts' estimates of $1.56 billion. The company said Veklury sales would continue to be subject of significant volatility and uncertainty.
Gilead earlier this week said it would provide support to local manufacturing facilities in India, where the COVID-19 pandemic is raging out of control, and donate active pharmaceutical ingredient to scale up remdesivir production. 

For full-year 2021, the California-based company said it still expects adjusted earnings per share of $6.75 to $7.45 on product sales of $23.7 billion to $25.1 billion.

However, some stocks were able to achieve price highs due solely to a short squeeze triggered by Reddit’s WallStreetBets (WSB) forum. For example, despite possessing weak financials, Clover Health (CLOV) and COMPASS Pathways (CMPS) witnessed solid gains thanks to the actions of WBS. Both stocks have lost some value lately, and we think that they do not have the potential to rebound. So, they are best avoided now.The entire healthcare sector, ranging from drugstores to biotech companies, strived to survive the COVID-19 pandemic by inventing vaccines and fulfilling urgent market demand for protection equipment and safe healthcare facilities, for example. And because several countries are now experiencing a resurgence of COVID-19 infections, the healthcare sector is expected to play a significant role this year again. In fact, the sector has immense potential to grow beyond this year thanks to technological advancements and a growing need for better healthcare products and facilities. The global healthcare IT market is projected to grow at a 14% CAGR over the next eight years.
Vanguard Health Care Index Fund ETF’s (VHT) 27.8% returns over the past year reflect significant investor interest in the sector. However, not all stocks in this space have gained because of a favorable industry backdrop. Reddit’s WallStreetBets (WSB)—which captured headlines thanks to its participants' huge success in squeezing short sellers out of their positions in GameStop (NYSE:GME) earlier this year—gamed weak players with high short interest in the healthcare space too.
But WBS favorites Clover Health Investments, Corp. (CLOV) and COMPASS Pathways plc (CMPS) have lost significant value lately and could witness further declines. Given their high valuations versus their financial strength, or lack thereof, we think that these stocks are best avoided now.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 closed at record highs Thursday as tech steadied from its intraday malaise and a Facebook-led rally in communication services supported investor sentiment. 
The S&P 500 climbed 0.7% to end the day at a closing record high of 4,211.60, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.2%, after rising to an intraday record high of 14,211.57. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7%, or 242 points.
U.S. first-quarter GDP rose 6.4%, better than expectations for a 6.1% rise, and growth is expected to pick up in the quarters ahead.

Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) was up 7% after reporting blowout quarterly earnings of $3.30 per share that markedly beat estimates for $2.33 a share.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) also delivered better-than-expected results, led by strong services and iPhone sales growth. The shares ended flat after cutting intraday losses amid a slew of positive upgrades from Wall Street.

Investing.com -- Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) helped guide the market higher, surging after earnings surprised the market. 
The major indices rose amid growth in the U.S. gross domestic product that accelerated in the first quarter and jobless claims that are the lowest since the pandemic shattered the U.S. economy in March 2020.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was little changed despite reporting exceptional sales for the quarter. On the downside, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) tumbled as it gave guidance that failed to inspire. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s up next, reporting after the bell.
A rally in oil boosted crude prices by nearly $3 per barrel or 5% from Monday’s close. Oil including  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) and Exxon (NYSE:XOM) Mobile report quarterly earnings tomorrow morning.Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Inflation
The Commerce Department will publish data on personal income and spending for March, which include the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation figures, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT) Friday. The consensus is that the report will show the inflation metric inched up 0.3%, after rising by 0.1% a month earlier. On an annualized basis, core PCE prices are expected to rise 1.8%. 
2. Spending
Personal Spending, which measures the change in the inflation-adjusted value of all spending by consumers, is expected to increase 4.1% versus the previous drop of 1% in February. That drops at 8:30AM ET Friday. Personal Income may have soared 20% in March from a 7% drop for the previous month.
3. Another tech beat?
Amazon reports earnings tonight, on the heels of peers like Facebook and Apple that blew it out of the water. Can Amazon do that same? Analysts forecast earnings per share of $9.49 on sales of $104.5 billion. Indeed, the company beat, with EPS of $15.79 on revenue of $108.5 billion.

1595,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2021 03:31PM ET</span>","Exclusive: India's oxygen crisis to ease by mid-May, output to jump 25% - executive","By Shivani Singh and Devjyot Ghoshal
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's severe medical oxygen supply crisis is expected to ease by mid-May, a top industry executive told Reuters, with output rising by 25% and transport infrastructure ready to cope with a surge in demand caused by a dramatic rise in coronavirus cases.
Dozens of hospitals in cities such as New Delhi and Mumbai have run short of the gas this month, sending relatives of patients scrambling for oxygen cylinders, sometimes in vain.
Medical oxygen consumption in India has shot up more than eight-fold from usual levels to about 7,200 tonnes per day this month, said Moloy Banerjee of Linde (NYSE:LIN) Plc, the country's biggest producer.
""This is what is causing the crisis because no one was prepared for it, particularly the steep curve up,"" Banerjee, who heads the company's South Asia gas business, told Reuters on Thursday.
Linde - whose two affiliates in the country are Linde India and Praxair (NYSE:PX) India - and other suppliers are ramping up production to a total of more than 9,000 tonnes per day by the middle of next month, he said.
A logistics crisis impeding the speedy movement of oxygen from surplus regions in eastern India to hard-hit northern and western areas would also be resolved in the coming weeks as more distribution assets are deployed, Banerjee said.
""My expectation is that by the middle of May we will definitely have the transport infrastructure in place that allows us to service this demand across the country,"" he said.
Banerjee said India was importing around 100 cryogenic containers to transport large quantities of liquid medical oxygen, with Linde providing 60 of those. Some are being flown in by Indian Air Force aircraft.
Many of these containers will be placed on dedicated trains that would cut across the country, each carrying between 80-160 tonnes of liquid oxygen and delivering to multiple cities.
The company is also looking to double the number of oxygen cylinders in its distribution network to at least 10,000, which would improve supply to rural areas with weak infrastructure.
""We are trying to create a hub-and-spoke type of system so that we make a lot of liquid oxygen available at the local area, from where the local dealers can pick it up,"" Banerjee said.

India's total COVID-19 cases passed 18 million on Thursday after another world record number of daily infections.

1598,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2021 02:50PM ET</span>",Berkshire annual meeting to showcase Munger as he rejoins Buffett,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc's widely anticipated annual meeting on Saturday will be held virtually for a second year but reclaim one bit of normalcy as Charlie Munger rejoins fellow billionaire Warren Buffett to answer shareholder questions.
The meeting gives Buffett, 90, and Munger, 97, a stage to explain over 3-1/2 hours what to expect from Berkshire's dozens of businesses, markets and the economy, and whether the company will continue aggressive share repurchases. 
Still, with no shareholders in attendance, it will be shorn of the festivities that normally draw about 40,000 annually to Omaha, Nebraska for what Buffett calls Woodstock for Capitalists.
""The Berkshire event, it's hard to describe to someone who's never been there,"" said Jim Weber, chief executive of the company's fast-growing Brooks Running unit. ""Nonetheless, the meeting will go on, and I'll be watching it, probably on my treadmill.""
Buffett has run Berkshire since 1965, and Munger has been vice chairman since 1978.
The other vice chairmen, Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, who respectively oversee Berkshire's non-insurance and insurance businesses, will be on hand to answer some questions. They are top contenders to succeed Buffett as Berkshire chief executive. 
Saturday's meeting should illustrate how Buffett and Munger have thrived together for so long, despite differences in politics - Buffett is a Democrat, Munger a Republican - and often investment ideas.
Munger, a Californian, did not travel to last year's meeting in Omaha, which was disrupted by the pandemic.
This year, Buffett said in his shareholder letter https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2020ltr.pdf he is traveling to Los Angeles to reunite with his friend and business partner of more than six decades. 
""Charlie's perspective often may challenge Warren's,"" said Paul Lountzis, president of Lountzis Asset Management LLC in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania and a Berkshire shareholder. ""But he often augments what Warren says, in a more direct way and with a great sense of humor.""
Like Buffett, Munger tries to teach as he speaks, thinks long-term, and eschews investments whose main attribute is being in vogue.
""He's reassuring,"" said Tom Russo, who invests more than $10 billion at Gardner, Russo & Quinn in Lancaster, Pennsylvania and has invested in Berkshire since 1982. ""For people who follow that reassurance, the rewards have been mighty.""
BUYBACKS ON MY MIND
The meeting will be broadcast on Yahoo Finance, which said last year's meeting drew 2.5 million streams.
It comes with Berkshire shares on a roll, outpacing the Standard & Poor's 500 by seven percentage points in 2021 through Wednesday.
That's an improvement from 2019 and 2020, when ""value"" stocks lagged and Berkshire, which pays no dividend, trailed the index by 36 percentage points.
Graphic: Berkshire Hathaway vs S&P 500 - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yxmvjdmadvr/Pasted%20image%201619710636565.png
Saturday's meeting will begin a few hours after Berkshire releases first-quarter results. Analysts expect operating profit, which excludes stock holdings such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), to be similar to last year.
Berkshire will also say how much of its own stock it repurchased, following $24.7 billion of buybacks last year.
Buybacks will be ""on everyone's mind,"" Russo said.
James Armstrong, president of shareholder Henry H Armstrong Associates in Pittsburgh, hopes Buffett and Munger will discuss how Berkshire can be managed over the long term to address its ""most important investment problem,"" its large size.
Shareholders will likely reject two proposals requiring more disclosures about climate change and diversity. Berkshire and Buffett, who has nearly one-third of its voting power, oppose both.
While Berkshire's Omaha office never closed during the pandemic, many of its businesses suffered, and Buffett and Munger will likely address their plans for better times ahead.
Precision Castparts is trying to rebound from a plunge in travel that erased demand for its aircraft parts, causing a $9.8 billion writedown and 13,400 job losses.
And while the Geico car insurer, led by Todd Combs, one of Buffett's investment managers, saw accident losses decline, it drew criticism for offering drivers only credits on policy renewals when other insurers rebated premiums.
Other possible issues are Berkshire's failed venture with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) to cut healthcare costs, and its $8 billion proposal to build 10 Texas power plants to avert more devastating blackouts in that state.
Shareholder questions aren't limited to Berkshire.
It would be no surprise to hear disdain for bitcoin, which Buffett has called ""rat poison squared"" and Munger termed ""the pursuit of the uneatable by the unspeakable.""

Munger, meanwhile, has said the craze for special-purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) that take private companies public signaled ""an irritating bubble.""

Demand for it has been increasing, driven primarily by increased demand for electric vehicles (EVs). For investors seeking to capitalize on the rising demand for the element, Sociedad (SQM) and Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) could be solid bets. Wall Street Analysts strongly recommend these companies.As the demand for electric vehicles (EVs) increases with a growing global desire to transition to zero-carbon-emissions transportation, the demand for lithium has been increasing too. That’s because most EVs rely on lithium-ion batteries for power.
Investors’ interest in the lithium market is evident in the Global X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF’s (LIT) 50.4% returns over the past six months versus the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust’s (SPY) 27.8% gains. And, according to Mordor intelligence, the lithium market is expected to grow at a CAGR of more than 10% over the next five years.
Lithium is not only an important component for EV batteries, it is also used for energy storage in batteries for many other devices, such as cell phones, laptops, and grid storage. Consequently, lithium has become one of the most highly sought-after commodities. Given the commodity’s promising prospects, analysts are very optimistic about the performance prospects of Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. (SQM) and Lithium Americas Corp. (LAC) shares in the near term. So, we think it could be wise to bet on these stocks now.

So, we think it could be wise to bet on mid-cap stocks Brunswick (NYSE:BC) and Axalta (AXTA) that have recently be accorded rating upgrades by analysts.While large-cap stocks tend to outperform during periods of economic uncertainty, small- and mid-cap stocks tend to outperform during economic recoveries. And compared to small-caps, mid-cap stocks typically possess lesser risk because their businesses are relatively more diversified. Moreover, mid-cap stocks usually have better access to capital compared to their small-cap counterparts. Given the ongoing fast-paced economic recovery and easy access to capital thanks to an accommodative monetary policy, several mid-cap stocks could be well positioned to outperform their small- and large-cap counterparts.
In fact, the mid-cap stocks have outperformed the small-cap ones over the past three months, a period which witnessed a steady economic recovery. This is evident from the iShares Core S&P Mid-Cap ETF’s (IJH) 15% returns over this period compared to the iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF’s (IJR) 13% gains. The returns also compare favorably to the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF’s (IVV) 10.5% returns over the same time frame.

As such, we believe BHP Group (NYSE:BHP), Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO), and Labrador Iron Ore (LIFZF) are in an excellent position to benefit. So, let’s pore over these names.The recovery in steel demand with the fast-paced economic recovery has been driving iron ore prices to record highs. Now that China, one of the world's largest importers of iron ore, is back in the market in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic disruptions and is experiencing a construction boom, the demand for the commodity is expected to continue rising. The iron ore industry’s solid performance over the past year is evident in iShares MSCI Global Select Metals & Mining Producers ETF’s (PICK) 126.1% returns over the past year versus the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF’s (SPY) 46.1% gains over this period.
High iron ore prices are encouraging mass production, which is spurring increasing investor interest. Overall, a recovering economy, soaring demand and high business confidence have been driving solid industry growth. The global market for iron ore pellets is expected to grow at a 3.7% CAGR of 3.7% over the next six years.

1603,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2021 01:25PM ET</span>",Ford to decide on India investment plan in second half of 2021,"By Aditi Shah
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co expects to firm up capital allocation plans for India in the second half of 2021, a senior executive said in an email to staff, as the automaker overhauls its strategy in a loss-making market.
Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford has tasked senior executive Steven Armstrong with evaluating investment plans for India in his new role as transformation officer, South America and India, the automaker said in a separate statement this week. 
""We have a lot of work to do as we continue to assess our capital allocations in the market,"" Dianne Craig, president of Ford's International Markets Group (IMG), said in an email to staff on Wednesday, referring to India.
""While we expect to have an answer in the second half of this year, the appointment of Steven...will help focus our efforts and speed up the process,"" she said.
IMG includes India, where the company employs more than 16,000, and 100 other markets. 
Ford India head Anurag Mehrotra will report to Armstrong, who previously headed the Changan Ford joint venture in China and will take on his new role from May 1, the company said. 
Confirming that the company expects to reach a capital allocation decision in the second half of the year, a Ford India spokesman said that the country is an important market and a source of global powertrains for its Ranger SUV.
Ford has said previously it will allocate capital consistent with its plan to generate consistently strong cash flows and achieve an 8% company adjusted EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) margin.
The automaker beat Wall Street's first quarter profit estimate late on Wednesday, telling investors all its markets under IMG were profitable except for India. 
CEO Jim Farley, who is overseeing an $11 billion global restructuring of Ford, wants to boost profits in India but the country is a lower priority than some other markets, sources told Reuters previously.
STRUGGLE 
Ford is not the first western automaker to struggle to win over India's frugal buyers and turn a profit in a market dominated by Suzuki Motor Corp's and Hyundai Motor's extensive line-up of mainly low-cost cars. 
General Motors (NYSE:GM) exited the domestic market in 2017 after 20 years, while Harley-Davidson Inc (NYSE:HOG) packed up last year after a decade of unsuccessful efforts to gain a foothold.
Ford entered India 25 years ago but has a less than 2% share of the passenger vehicles market in the world's second most populous nation, where car penetration is lower than in the U.S. and China. 
A tie-up with domestic automaker Mahindra & Mahindra, now called off, would have ended most of Ford's independent operations in India but allowed it to launch new vehicles faster, at a reduced cost and with lower investment.
The two companies planned to develop at least three new SUVs and share powertrains.
Ford will now need to pick vehicles from its global portfolio to sell in India, or develop new ones, a source said. 
The joint venture would have also helped Ford tackle low plant utilisation in the country, which remains one of its biggest problems, the person added.

Two years ago Ford used only around 60% of its total annual production capacity of 440,000 units across two Indian plants, with the pandemic reducing it to as little as 20% last fiscal year.

Investing.com --  Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) rose 2.8% as pandemic-driven home dining helped results. 
First quarter profit of 72 cents a share beat the expected 60 cents on sales of $6.39 billion, which compares to analysts' forecast of $6.25 billion. 
Sales have been supported by lockdowns that shuttered restaurants and had us eating at home all the time. The company has seen revenue stalled for the past several years, although the maker of mac and cheese has profited steadily in that time.
Kraft Heinz has a price to earnings ratio -- a measure of the value of a company -- of 193 times compared to the industry average of 36, indicating that the ketchup purveyor may be overpriced.

""They’ve had to go back several years to try and find an excuse to deny me what’s mine. I’ve left it to my lawyers to deal with."" WPP declined to comment on Sorrell's response. 
Sorrell, the most famous advertising boss of his generation, built WPP into the world's biggest advertising company through a string of major deals over three decades to offer advertising, media buying services, public relations and data analytics to global brands such as Ford, HSBC and Unilever (NYSE:UL). 
In the process he became one of Britain's most high-profile businessman, mingling with politicians and presidents around the world. 
He left the British firm in 2018 over a complaint about personal misconduct which he has always denied. His new firm has a market value of 3 billion pounds ($4.2 billion) and a large roster of clients. 
WPP, now led by the one-time Sorrell protege Mark Read, said in its annual report that its compensation committee had exercised its discretion to deny giving the former CEO share awards from a 2016 and 2017 scheme. 
It said the decision was made due to ""Sir Martin Sorrell’s disclosure of confidential information belonging to WPP and certain of its clients to the media during his tenure as a WPP director."" 

WPP published a trading update on Wednesday that showed the goup had returned to organic quarterly growth for the first time since the third quarter of 2019. Sorrell's S4 reports next Tuesday.

1606,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2021 01:00PM ET</span>","GM launches recall fix for 69,000 Bolt EVs","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -General Motors Co said it would launch a recall and software update on Thursday to address a callback of nearly 69,000 Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicles for fire risks and will replace battery module assemblies as necessary.
The largest U.S. automaker announced the recall in November after five reported fires and two minor injuries covering 2017-2019 model year Chevrolet Bolt EVs with high voltage batteries produced at LG Chem Ltd's Ochang, South Korea facility. 
GM said dealers will use ""diagnostic tools to identify potential battery anomalies and replace battery module assemblies as necessary.""
They will install ""advanced onboard diagnostic software into these vehicles that, among other things, has the ability to detect potential issues related to changes in battery module performance before problems can develop"" it added.
GM said in November the vehicles pose a fire risk when charged to full, or nearly full capacity. The Detroit automaker said it had developed software that will limit vehicle charging to 90% of full capacity to mitigate the risk, while it determines the appropriate final repair.

GM said Thursday that once the software update is complete, dealers will remove the 90% state of charge limitation and return the battery to its previous 100% charging capability.
Owners of 2019 model year Chevrolet Bolt EVs will be able to update the software starting on Thursday and 2017 and 2018 Bolt EVs owners will be eligible by the end of May. GM said it will make the diagnostic software standard in the 2022 Bolt EV and EUV, as well as future GM electric vehicles, and will offer the update for all other Bolt EVs on the road at a future date.

Indeed, remote working dynamics are said to have deepened human-pet bonds, which is contributing in-part to increased pet care spending. The trend has bolstered the performance of pet care companies Zomedica (ZOM) and Zoetis (ZTS). But let’s find out which of these stocks is a better buy now.Zomedica Corp. (ZOM) and  Zoetis Inc . (NYSE:ZTS) are two popular veterinary healthcare companies engaged in the development, manufacture, and commercialization of animal health medicines in the United States and internationally. ZOM’s lead drug product candidate ZM-007 is used for the treatment of acute diarrhea in small dog breeds and puppies. ZTS offers vaccines to prevent respiratory, gastrointestinal and reproductive tract diseases.
With people spending far more time at home, coping with stress and isolation amid the pandemic, there has been a significant increase in pet ownership. This has driven a surge in demand for pet care services, diagnostics and medicine. Since pet owners are now paying more attention to their companions’ health and wellness, and spending more on medical care amid the uncertainties surrounding the pandemic, the demand for veterinary services is expected to grow even more in the coming months. This bodes well for ZOM and ZTS.
While ZOM lost 34.9% over the last month, ZTS surged 8.7%. However, in terms of their past year’s performance, ZOM’s 570.7% makes it a clear winner given ZTS’ 33.2% returns. But, which of these stocks is a better pick now? Let’s find out.

While some names remain investor favorites, many of those that became overvalued during last year’s rally have been selling off with an investor shift to cyclical stocks that are much cheaper and have the potential to benefit from an economic recovery. Given increasing lawsuits and their poor financial performance over recent quarters, we think it best to now avoid Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corporation (CCL), Peloton (PTON), and Lemonade (LMND). Read on.Increasing demand for products and services due to pandemic-driven trends or pent-up demand created by restrictions on several business activities helped many stocks capture solid investor participation over the past year. However, these stocks’ scintillating rally in some instances has caused a disconnect between the growth prospects and the current valuations of some stocks.
When the economy began recovering earlier this year, investors started rebalancing their portfolios, taking profits from overvalued stocks and moving to capitalize on the economic recovery by betting on cheaper cyclical stocks. While some of these overvalued stocks remain investor favorites given their potential to keep growing, many have been witnessing a sell-off.
We believe popular stocks Carnival Corporation (CCL), Peloton Interactive, Inc. (NASDAQ:PTON), and Lemonade Inc. (LMND) will continue hemorrhaging investors, given their poor financials, which don’t justify their current valuations. So, naturally, we think they are best avoided now.

1612,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2021 12:15PM ET</span>",Basildon to Bergamo: Euronext data move seen as headache for traders,"By Huw Jones and Valentina Za
LONDON/MILAN (Reuters) - Euronext's decision to move its huge data centre from Britain to Italy because of Brexit could mean a costly headache for banks and other stock traders who measure competitiveness in nanoseconds.
The pan-European bourse said on Thursday it would move its data centre from Basildon, a town east of London, to Bergamo near the Italian financial capital of Milan in the second quarter of 2022.
Bergamo is where Borsa Italiana has a disaster recovery site, and Euronext completed its acquisition of the Milan exchange on Thursday and is keen to show Italy the takeover's benefits.
Italian company Aruba, which runs a 200,000 square-metre cloud data centre in Bergamo, will become the main provider of Euronext's data centre services. Aruba built Italy's biggest data centre on the site of a former cotton factory, taking over also a nearby hydroelectric plant to power operations.
Euronext CEO Stephane Boujnah said regulators were eager to have Euronext's data centre in the European Union following Britain's departure from the bloc, which has left the UK's financial sector largely cut off from the continent.
Amsterdam, where Euronext runs the main exchange, became Europe's biggest share trading centre in January after swathes of euro stock trading moved there from London.
""All the talk about the shift of trading to Amsterdam missed the fact that UK data centers still host a large amount of EU equity trading,"" said Anish Puaar, market structure analyst at Rosenblatt Securities.
Euronext said it had considered migrating the data centre from Basildon back to Paris, where it was located between 2000 and 2011, or Amsterdam.
The choice has instead fallen on Italy, which will become the bloc's largest trading venue, accounting for a quarter of all European equity trades.
Traders who compete on speed ""co-located"" near the Basildon server to cut the latency, or time difference, between inputting and executing a trade to the smallest fraction of a second possible.
Boujnah said Euronext's large sell-side clients with an interest in latency, not just high-frequency traders, would move their physical infrastructure to Italy to be as close as possible to the exchange's servers.
""It's a coordinated effort,"" he said.
Puaar said the move to Bergamo will require such market makers to install new kit at some cost. ""It also redraws trading routes and will require market participants to think about the latency changes,"" he said.

Boujnah said relocating the Euronext server to Bergamo was a ""very material decision"" for the group, one of its biggest IT investments in recent years with details provided in October.

1614,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2021 12:15PM ET</span>",European shares dip on high yields and profit-taking; banks rally,"By Sruthi Shankar and Ambar Warrick
(Reuters) - European stocks ended lower on Thursday, even as bank shares hit 14-month highs on strong quarterly earnings, as a rise in euro zone bond yields saw investors lock in profits at near-record levels. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.3% to 438.77, coming further off a record peak of 443.61 hit last week.
Traders cited the pullback to investors taking in profits after ""stellar results"". The STOXX 600 had surged to record highs on anticipation of a strong earnings season, as well as optimism over steady COVID-19 vaccination programs.
Bank stocks were the best performers for the day, as Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) added another notch to a series of strong earnings reports this week, including those from HSBC and Santander (MC:SAN). 
The sector was also supported by a jump in euro zone bond yields, after U.S. economic growth and German inflation data came in higher than expected, strengthening the case for a pullback in central bank stimulus. Treasury yields also hit a two-week high. [GVD/EUR] [US/] 
But the rise in yields put pressure on other European sectors, particularly cyclical stocks that have rallied this year. Travel and leisure stocks, the best-performing European sector this year, fell 0.7%, coming off record highs.
Automobile stocks led losses on Thursday with a 2.6% fall after U.S. carmaker Ford said a global semiconductor shortage may slash second-quarter production by half.
Still, European earnings are seen jumping 71.3% in the first quarter, according to Refinitiv IBES data. Almost a third of the STOXX 600 companies have reported so far, and a higher-than-usual 68% have topped profit estimates. 
Consumer goods giant Unilever (NYSE:UL) rose 3.3% as a pick-up in home cooking and a strong economic recovery in China drove better-than-expected quarterly sales.
Finnish telecom network equipment maker Nokia (NYSE:NOK) surged 8.4% to the top of the STOXX 600, as growth in sales of network and 5G equipment boosted its earnings.
""The majority of the reported firms sound constructive on the outlook for the remainder of the year,"" European equity strategists at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) wrote in a note, but added that the high expectations had been priced in. 
Among decliners, steel pipe maker Tenaris' Milan shares fell 6.8% and were among the top losers on the STOXX 600 after the company posted a bigger-than-expected 30% fall in first-quarter core profits.

Danish wind farm developer Orsted (OTC:DOGEF) fell 6.7% after lower wind speeds and cable problems hit its first-quarter earnings.

Investing.com -- Considering McDonald's (NYSE:MCD)'s first quarter earnings came in better than pre-pandemic times, one would think shares would be exploding today. Alas, they are not quite 1% higher.
Revenue jumped 7.5% from a year earlier, to $5.12 billion, with the U.S. market leading growth for the burger purveyor. Profit of $1.92 per share beat the forecasted $1.18.
We're spending more at MickeyD's, which helped boost results, probably alongside the new chicken sandwich. For the pandemic quarter last year, the maker of crisp french fries saw its worst profit and sales in at least seven years because french fries don't travel well and we got involuntarily hooked on delivery.
International sales rose slightly, with lockdowns in France and Germany hurting strong revenue from the U.K., Australia and Canada. That'll probably change with Europe lightening up a bit on pandemic measures.

Analysts said the chip shortage is getting worse as Ford also reduced its full-year earnings before interest and taxes outlook even after handily beating Wall Street's profit estimate for the first quarter, helped by pricing gains.
""Ford joins a growing chorus saying the semiconductor issue won't be resolved until 2022,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak wrote in a note.
The chip shortage has forced U.S. automakers to cut production of less profitable vehicles, while allowing them to raise prices on their most profitable ones as demand surges, offsetting the production loss.
Analysts say that trend won't last long and prices will come down later in the year, as the supply of chips becomes normal.
Shares of Ford's larger rival General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) also fell over 4% on Thursday.
Ford's lower second-quarter production is likely to weigh on suppliers such as  Visteon  (NASDAQ:VC), BorgWarner (NYSE:BWA), Tenneco,  Lear  (NYSE:LEA) Corp, Adient (NYSE:ADNT) Plc, RBC's Spak said.

(Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd reclaimed its crown as the world's biggest smartphone maker from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the first quarter, cornering a fifth of overall global shipments.
China's Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) Corp rounded out the top three positions with its best quarterly performance ever as shipments surged 62% to 49 million phones and its market share rose to 14%, market research firm Canalys said.
Overall, global shipments surged 27% to 347 million units in the first quarter as the Chinese economy opened up after the pandemic and a swift vaccine rollout in the United States raised hopes of an economic recovery.
South Korea's Samsung (KS:005930) shipped 76.5 million smartphones in the quarter to grab a 22% share of the market, Canalys said. The company on Thursday reported a 66% surge in quarterly profit in its mobiles business, thanks to robust sales of its flagship Galaxy S21 smartphone series.
Canalys said Apple shipped 52.4 million iPhones in the January-March period, falling to the second spot with a 15% share of the market.
Apple still grabbed record market share in the United States, China, India and Japan, Counterpoint analyst Varun Mishra said, adding that the iPhone Pro Max was a top seller in the United States.
Smartphone sales have surged over the past year as people stayed and worked from home. But the shopping frenzy has fuelled a global shortage in semiconductor chips that has roiled industries including autos and large appliances.
""Supply of critical components, such as chipsets, has quickly become a major concern, and will hinder smartphone shipments in the coming quarters,"" Canalys analyst Ben Stanton said.
Apple said on Wednesday that the chip shortage could cost the company $3 billion to $4 billion in revenue in the April-June quarter, affecting primarily iPads and Macbooks.
March-quarter smartphone shipments for China's Oppo and Vivo brands also surged, Canalys said. But Huawei, the former No. 1 that remains shackled by U.S. sanctions, took only seventh place after selling its Honor brand last year.

1621,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2021 11:05AM ET</span>",U.S. passenger railroad Amtrak asks Congress for $5.4 billion,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. passenger railroad Amtrak on Thursday asked Congress for $5.4 billion in the budget year starting Oct. 1 as it still grapples with the impact of COVID-19.
President Joe Biden, who plans to attend a 50th anniversary event on Friday for Amtrak in Philadelphia, has called for $80 billion in new spending on high-speed rail projects.
Amtrak asked for $3.88 billion for ""base needs"" and to address the impact of COVID-19 and $1.55 billion in additional U.S. funding needed to address Northeast Corridor infrastructure projects and begin advancing new corridor routes across the country.
Amtrak, which received about $2 billion from Congress in the year before the pandemic, has been awarded $3.7 billion in emergency funding since March 2020.
The Biden administration's April 9 budget called for $2.7 billion for Amtrak, a 35% jump over pre-COVID levels.
Amtrak is seeking $31 billion from Congress over five years to overhaul the Northeast Corridor, the Boston to Washington, D.C., corridor that is the busiest passenger rail route in the country. It wants about $16 billion alone for a series of projects in the New York City area called ""Gateway.""
Amtrak wants to expand across the United States and by 2035 add up to 39 new corridor routes and up to 166 cities. It hopes to serve 20 million additional people annually.
Amtrak said in its letter to Congress that railroad travel is a way for U.S. states to connect more people to more places without further reliance on overburdened highways.

""A timely investment in America’s mobility would provide far-reaching economic stimulus to help struggling local economies while creating jobs in the railroad, 
construction, and supporting industries that will result in growth across the country,"" it said.

1624,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2021 10:45AM ET</span>",New chairman Horta-Osorio well-schooled for Credit Suisse tests,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi and Oliver Hirt
ZURICH (Reuters) - Antonio Horta-Osorio will need to draw deeply on the lessons he learned in turning around British bank Lloyds (LON:LLOY) when he joins  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) as its new chairman on Friday.
As one of Europe's longest-serving bank CEOs, he has received plaudits for bringing Lloyds back from the brink in 2011, when in an interview this month he said it was ""about to die"" after having to be bailed out during the financial crisis.
At Credit Suisse another one of banking's toughest jobs awaits ""AHO"", as the 57-year-old was known at Lloyds, dealing with damage from both the implosion of U.S. investment firm Archegos and the ramifications of the insolvency of British supply chain finance firm Greensill.
Combined, these have triggered multi-billion dollar losses, sackings and bonus cuts at Credit Suisse, just as other banks are riding bumper trading and dealmaking profits.
While Switzerland's second-largest bank is investigating what went wrong, its chief executive Thomas Gottstein has flagged a deeper review of the bank once Horta-Osorio arrives.
""At Lloyds he was quite efficient in reorganizing. He sold non-core and toxic assets relatively successfully, cut costs to the core and restored the bank to profitability and full private ownership,"" said Guy de Blonay, a fund manager at Jupiter. 
PARALLEL LIVES
The Portuguese banker's Lloyds tenure spans the same decade as the outgoing Credit Suisse chairman, but Urs Rohner's time has been marked by upheaval and doubts over the Swiss bank's long-term direction.
A lawyer by training, and CEO of German television and radio broadcaster ProSieben before joining Credit Suisse as general counsel in 2004, Rohner faced fierce criticism as it endured a series of losses and scandals in the last five years.
While Lloyds shares have fallen around 25% under Horta-Osorio, Credit Suisse's stock has lost nearly three-quarters of its value under Rohner.
With the appointment of Tidjane Thiam as CEO in 2015, Rohner had set his sights on de-risking the bank and making wealth management its focus, two sources familiar with the matter said.
Yet despite the turnaround kickstarted by Thiam, who left last year after a clash with Rohner over a spying scandal, Credit Suisse remains exposed to risky trades and relationships.
It lost over $5 billion related to prime brokerage client Archegos and faces further fallout from more than $10 billion in Greensill-related funds.
Including the Archegos charge, writedowns and penalties paid by Credit Suisse since late 2015 total more than $15 billion, while it is facing at least three enforcement proceedings by Swiss financial market supervisor FINMA.
Rohner has largely steered clear of the spotlight following the bank's most recent run of problems. But he and Horta-Osorio have been in contact in recent months, one source familiar with the matter said, in order to secure a smooth handover.
Credit Suisse declined comment.
EXHAUSTION
Horta-Osorio focused on expanding relatively sedate retail banking, insurance and wealth management businesses at Lloyds and during his final results call on Wednesday, said returning it to private ownership in 2017 was the highlight of his tenure.
""More important than that was the journey along the way ... achieving the purpose of helping the real economy of the UK to the extent we could,"" he said during a media call.
However Horta-Osorio has not had an easy ride, facing scrutiny over his high pay relative to other British bank bosses, his handling of a historic fraud case and an industry-wide payment insurance mis-selling scandal that ultimately cost Lloyds 22 billion pounds and took years to resolve.
And he has talked publicly about struggles with stress and insomnia as Lloyds was roiled by the 2011 eurozone crisis.
""That led me to a period of exhaustion as you know where I had to take a few weeks out and then came back. Those were very bad days,"" Horta-Osorio said this week. 
Analysts say his experience working through misconduct issues should prove helpful as he enters Credit Suisse at a moment of risk management crisis.

""He is known for very strong attention to detail and drive and we assume that risk management will be at the top of his agenda,"" Maria Rivas, Senior Vice President of Global Financial Institutions at DBRS Morningstar, said.

1632,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2021 09:45AM ET</span>",Activist investors post strong returns with board campaigns in first quarter,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Activist investors have been outperforming their peers and the broader market this year by pushing for board-room changes rather than dramatic business overhauls, breakups or mergers, according to performance data and industry sources.
The average activist hedge fund returned 8.76% in the first quarter, ahead of the broader hedge-fund industry's 6% gain and a 5.8% rise in the S&P 500 stock market index, Hedge Fund Research data show.
Brand-name firms like Third Point (NYSE:SPNT) LLC and Engaged Capital, as well as smaller players like Ancora Alternatives and newcomers including Honest Capital LLC, did even better, posting double-digit gains, investors familiar with the numbers said.
A year-long rally in asset prices has made it harder to find hidden gems, said Engaged Capital Chief Investment Officer Glenn Welling. Even so, the firm, which has $1.5 billion under management, is still hunting for companies whose management teams can do more to boost sales or cut costs, he said.
""We continue to see opportunities in the small-mid cap universe in under-managed businesses that need a catalyst for change,"" said Welling, whose firm posted a 22% gain during the first quarter.
Activists try to generate supreme returns by agitating for change with a capital ""C."" Sometimes they work quietly with boards and management teams to install new leaders or orchestrate new business plans, as they have been doing lately, but they are better known for splashy presentations that accuse companies of missteps or show how they can generate more profits for shareholders by cutting costs, merging with a rival or spinning off businesses.
In 2020, activists largely laid low to let companies navigate the coronavirus pandemic. In the first few months of 2021, though, prominent investors targeted Kohl's Corp (NYSE:KSS), FirstEnergy Corp (NYSE:FE) and  Elanco Animal Health  (NYSE:ELAN).
Retailer Kohl's, which was publicly targeted in March and then settled for two board seats earlier this month, has seen its shares climb 27% in the last three months.
Two of the Kohl's activists are among those with above-average returns: James Chadwick's Ancora climbed 11%, while Legion Partners, run by Chris Kiper and Ted White, gained 15.6%, according to investors in their funds. Kurt Wolf, whose Hestia Capital Partners, pushed for a board seat at  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) a year ago, scored a 223.7% gain in the first quarter.
First-quarter performance was also notable at Shawn Badlani's Honest Capital, which posted an 11.2% rise; Daniel Loeb's Third Point, which gained 11%; and William Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management, which rose 7.2%.
All told, activist investors have demanded change at 169 U.S.-based companies in the first quarter, compared with 178 companies in the first three months of 2020 early in the pandemic, according to Insightia data.
Roughly 41% of their 2021 campaigns focused on boards, up from 37% a year ago. Only 7% of them pushed for mergers or breakups, down from 12% a year ago.
It is still early, but activist hedge funds are on track to do better than last year, when they lagged hedge fund peers and astounding stock-market gains.
If the economy recovers from the pandemic as predicted, management teams will have fewer excuses for subpar performance, said Lawrence Elbaum, co-head of law firm Vinson & Elkins' Shareholder Activism Practice.

""2021 shouldn’t give boards a false sense of security going forward,"" he said.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Thursday, supported by another blast of record earnings from Silicon Valley and further signs of a broader recovery in the economy.
The U.S. economy grew at an annualized rate of 6.4% in the first quarter of the year, up from a rate of 4.3% three months earlier, as massive stimulus spending supported household consumption at a time when nearly 20 million people were claiming benefits related to unemployment.
The number of jobless has come down since the end of the first quarter, and initial jobless claims inched down to a new post-pandemic low of 553,000 last week, according to the Labor Department. The government's broadest measure of those claiming unemployment benefits - including under programs set up to deal with the pandemic - dropped by another 845,000 to 16.2 million. The high number of jobless is the main reason why Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell once again refused to countenance tightening monetary policy at his press conference on Wednesday.
By 9:35 AM ET (1435 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 163 points, or 0.5%, at 33,984 points.
The S&P 500 was up 0.7% and the Nasdaq Composite was outperforming with a gain of 0.9%, thanks largely to blowout earnings announced late on Wednesday by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM).  
Facebook stock gained over 5% at the open in response to a surge in advertising revenue in the quarter that echoed the performance of Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) on Tuesday night.
The news also lifted Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) stock by over 1% each. The two companies are set to report their earnings after the close on Thursday.
Yet again, the major platform companies outperformed more niche names that had also been lifted last year by the same trend towards digitization and remote working and shopping. After Pinterest (NYSE:PINS)'s disappointment on Tuesday, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) stock fell 11.4% after warning of a slowdown in growth in the current quarter, suggesting that pandemic-related gains won't be uniformly consistent going forward, as people regain their freedom to go out and spend in person.
Elsewhere, Nokia (NYSE:NOK) ADRs surged 12.1% after the underperforming Finnish provider of network equipment finally reported quarterly numbers that gave hope in a turnaround under its relatively new CEO Pekka Lundmark. 
The global chip shortage reared its ugly head again, with Ford Motor (NYSE:F) stock falling nearly 9% after the company warned it may slash production by nearly half in the current quarter, while  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) stock fell over 2% to its lowest in over a month after it, too, warned that this year's production targets may not be met as a result of the shortage. "

The company also posted a return to top line growth, with overall revenue rising for the first time in four quarters. Net revenue grew 4% to $4.2 billion from last year, coming in ahead of estimates of $3.99 billion. 
""We started the year with good momentum, delivering positive net revenue growth this quarter, and are encouraged by the return of domestic spending levels to pre-pandemic trends,"" Chief Executive Officer Michael Miebach said in a statement.
Mastercard (NYSE:MA)'s optimism on spending was in line with what peers  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V) and  American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP) had said earlier in April. 
A rebound from last year's pandemic-fueled recession has lifted consumer spending in parts of the world and boosted card companies.
Visa, the world's largest payments processor, beat quarterly profit estimates on Tuesday, helped by a surge in online shopping that countered sluggish travel spending.
Mastercard's gross dollar volumes, which represents the dollar value of the transactions processed, rose 8% on a local currency basis from a year earlier to $1.7 trillion. 
However, cross-border spending remains weak, as a resurgence in the number of COVID-19 cases in some parts of the world weighs on travel spending. 
Mastercard's cross-border volume, one of the key measures that track spending on its cards beyond the country of its issue, tumbled 17% on a local currency basis in the first quarter. 

Net income, excluding exceptional items, fell to $1.7 billion, or $1.74 per share, from $1.8 billion, or $1.83 per share, a year earlier. 
Still, profit still came in ahead of estimates. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.57 per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

(Reuters) - Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA) on Thursday reported quarterly revenue ahead of Wall Street estimates, buoyed by steady demand for its internet and wireless services due to remote work despite pandemic-related weakness in its theme park and film businesses.
Revenue for the first-quarter rose 2.2% from a year earlier to $27.21 billion, beating analysts' estimates of $26.70 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The media company gained 461,000 broadband customers in the quarter, topping analysts' average estimate of 396,000 net additions, according to research firm FactSet. It lost 491,000 video customers in the quarter, more than the 418,000 Wall Street expected, according to FactSet.
Comcast is experiencing an uptick in movie theater and theme park ticket sales as those venues reopen at a limited capacity. The company has also benefited from remote work and e-learning, which have driven demand for broadband and streaming video services.
Comcast said it had 42 million sign-ups to its Peacock streaming service, which launched in July, up from 33 million last quarter. Peacock competes against streaming giants Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). and Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's Disney+, among other services.
The company's NBCUniversal segment, which includes NBC Entertainment and Universal Pictures, reported revenue of $7.02 billion, down about 9% from a year earlier, owing to pandemic-related delays in production and theatrical releases of big-budget films.
Media revenue rose 3.2%, buoyed by higher affiliate fees and strength in the company's news business even as ad sales fell during the quarter.
Theme parks revenue fell 33.1% to $619 million.

1639,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2021 08:05AM ET</span>",Bristol Myers first-quarter earnings miss expectations as cancer drugs underperform,"By Michael Erman
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bristol Myers (NYSE:BMY) Squibb Co reported lower-than-expected first-quarter profit on Thursday as sales of its high margin cancer drugs Revlimid and Opdivo fell short of Wall Street estimates.
The underperformance of the cancer drugs was partially offset by better-than-expected sales of the blood thinner Eliquis that Bristol Myers shares with  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE)
Excluding one-time items, the New York-based drugmaker said it earned $3.95 billion in the quarter, or $1.74 a share, compared with $3.96 billion, or $1.72 a share, a year ago.
Analysts on average expected $1.82 a share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Chief Financial Officer David Elkins said in an interview that the sales mix - in particular, the outperformance in lower margin Eliquis versus higher margin Revlimid - accounts for most of the gap between the results and analysts' expectations.
Bristol Myers still expects full-year earnings in the range of $7.35 to $7.55 a share, Elkins said.
Revenue in the quarter of $11.07 billion was basically in line with analysts' projections. 
Eliquis sales were $2.89 billion, beating analyst expectations by about $300 million. Revlimid had sales of $2.94 billion, around $150 million lower than Wall Street projections.
Sales of cancer immunotherapy Opdivo fell 3% to $1.72 billion, also around $150 million shy of analysts' estimates.
""Overall, I think we're in a good place,"" Elkins said, adding that he expects Eliquis' growth to continue and Opdivo to return to growth in the second half of the year due to approvals in new tumor types and its increasing use as an initial treatment for advanced lung cancer.
The company reported net earnings of $2.02 billion, or 89 cents per share, for the quarter, versus a net loss of $775 million a year ago, due in part to costs associated with the Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) acquisition.

Bristol Myers shares closed at $66.03 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. The company's shares are up around 7.6% this year, underperforming the Standard and Poor's 500 index, which is up around 13% over the same period.

Pandemic-induced curbs led people to eat at home and rely on packaged meals that proved to be a boon for the Chicago-based company, which has been struggling with tepid sales and was also forced to write down the value of several brands by billions of dollars over the past two years.
Sales in the Jell-O maker's international markets including the UK, Australia and Latin America, which account for a fifth of its revenue, were up 7.2% as the company saw a surge in demand with stuck-at-home consumers buying more condiments and sauces and boxed dinners. Net sales in the United States, its biggest business, rose 2.5%. 
Net sales rose to $6.39 billion in the three months ended March 27, from $6.16 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected sales of $6.24 billion, according to IBES Refinitiv.
Net income attributable to the company rose to $568 million, or 46 cents per share, from $381 million, or 31 cents per share, a year earlier.

Excluding items, Kraft earned 72 cents per share, beating analysts' average estimate of 59 cents. 
Shares of Kraft, which projects current-quarter organic net sales to rise by a mid-single-digit percentage, were up marginally in premarket trading.

1641,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2021 07:56AM ET</span>",Europe's oil majors leave pandemic blues behind,"By Shadia Nasralla
LONDON (Reuters) - Europe's major energy companies profited from a rise in oil prices to report big increases in first-quarter earnings on Thursday, putting the worst of the pandemic-driven slump in fuel demand behind them.
Last year's demand collapse forced BP (NYSE:BP), Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) and Equinor to slash their dividends and preserve cash as they to try to transform themselves into companies that can thrive in a low-carbon world.
With benchmark oil prices recovering from an April 2020 low of $16 a barrel to about $67 a barrel this month, most of the companies managed to drive profits back above levels seen before the coronavirus pandemic first struck. 
BP's first-quarter headline profit figure of $2.6 billion exceeded its first-quarter profit of $2.4 billion in 2019 and was more than 200% higher than in 2020.
France's Total reported headline profits of $3 billion in the first three months of 2021, up 69% from last year and 9% above the first quarter of 2019.
Norway's Equinor, meanwhile, came in with a first-quarter profit of $5.5 billion on Thursday, also exceeding its pre-pandemic profit of $4.2 billion.
Shell's first-quarter profit climbed 13% from last year to $3.2 billion though that was still below 2019's $5.3 billion.
But despite recovering profits, payouts were still below pre-pandemic levels with the exception of Total, which had kept its dividend steady throughout the pandemic.
""(Total's) dividends are held flat but the buyback question will now arise given the sub 20% gearing (debt-to-equity ratio),"" Bernstein analysts said.
While Shell has increased its dividend twice in the past six months, the 17.35 cents it paid per share in the first quarter was below the 47 cents it paid out before the pandemic.
Shell, which is set to increase its dividend by 4% next year, has flagged share buybacks once its debt falls to $65 billion which  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and Bernstein say is possible this year.
Equinor also raised its payout to 15 cents per share, but again this was short of 2019's 26 cents per share. 
""The suggestion is that capital is being preserved to allow for an acceleration of new energy investment,"" Citi said.
BP's 3.8 pence per share first-quarter dividend was about half of what it paid in 2019. However, it is starting share buybacks which analysts expect to increase in the third quarter.
""BP should be able to buy back at least $10 billion between 2021 and 2025,"" said analysts at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF).
Spain's Repsol (OTC:REPYY) reported a 5.4% rise in first-quarter adjusted net profit to 471 million euros, though this was 24% below earnings in the first three months of 2019.

It decided in November to cut its 2021 and 2022 cash payouts to 0.60 euro from 1 euro per share, but said share buybacks could push returns above 1 euro per share by 2025.

First-quarter global comparable sales growth of 7.5% surpassed pre-pandemic 2019 levels, Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski said. Those numbers trounced expectations of a 4.71% growth, according to analysts polled by Refinitiv IBES data.
An intense vaccination drive and the distribution of relief checks are encouraging more people in the United States to eat out. 
McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) also rolled out its chicken sandwiches earlier this year in the United States, looking to tap into a frenzy kicked off by privately owned Chick-fil-A and Restaurant Brands' Popeyes in 2019.
That together helped power a 13.6% jump in sales at restaurants open for more than a year, trouncing expectations of 9.25%, according to analysts polled by Refinitiv IBES data.
McDonald's also showed strong growth in its international markets, with the UK, Australia and Canada recording a rise in sales. Comparable sales in France and Germany, where lockdowns and restrictions were placed to curb the spread of the virus, lagged.
Net income rose to $1.54 billion, or $2.05 per share, for the first quarter ended March 31 from $1.11 billion, or $1.47 per share, a year earlier.

Revenue rose 9% to $5.12 billion, above estimates of $5.03 billion.

1649,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2021 07:35AM ET</span>","China's Big Five banks boost profits, but margins shrink","BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Five of China's largest state-owned banks have reported higher first-quarter net profits, helped by a rebound in the country's economy from the coronavirus pandemic.
But margins - a key indicator of profitability for banks - shrank almost across the board as these remain under pressure from low interest rates.
The banks have benefited as economic activity recovers in China, with the country's GDP up 18.3% in the first quarter versus the same quarter last year. 
Lending still makes up the bulk of the five banks' earnings, unlike their rivals in the West, many of which have big investment banking and securities trading businesses that helped to drive big gains in their first-quarter earnings. 
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd (ICBC), the world's largest bank by assets, reported a net profit rise of 1.5% in the quarter year-on-year. 
The Bank of Communications Co Ltd (BoCom), Agricultural Bank of China (OTC:ACGBF) Ltd (AgBank), and Bank of China Ltd (BoC) followed suit, all logging first quarter net profit rises of more than 2%.[
China Construction Bank (OTC:CICHF) Ltd (CCB), on Wednesday, also produced higher earnings for the quarter. 
However, net interest margins shrank at four of the five banks partly resulting from reforms by the central bank to lower the benchmark loan interest rate.
AgBank did not disclose its first quarter net interest margin, the difference between what banks pay on deposits and earn on loans.
Chinese banks have begun to pull back on lending, amid Beijing's worries about exuberance in some sectors such as property.
The banking regulator has fined lenders for instances where borrowers have funnelled loans meant for other purposes into property.
Industry regulator CBIRC said earlier this month that China's banking industry recorded a 1.5% year-on-year profit growth in the first quarter, while the bad loan ratio dropped to 1.89% in Q1 from 1.92% at the end of 2020.
CCB and ICBC posted flat non-performing loan ratios from the end of the prior quarter, while the other three logged slight falls. 
Analysts, however, said that China's banks face a spike in NPLs once a government-mandated grace period for calling in soured debt expires at the end of this year.
""We would expect a significant increase in the NPL [ratio] when this policy comes due,"" said Qi Wen, Beijing-based analyst with the economics and strategy unit of Asian Development Bank.
This is very challenging for many banks, especially the rural commercial banks, added Qi.

1651,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2021 07:31AM ET</span>",Class of COVID-19: Next generation of bankers fear for future,"By Dhara Ranasinghe, Saikat Chatterjee and Scott Murdoch
LONDON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - It wasn't the introduction to high finance that Adi Patel had once anticipated.
The stage fright of walking into the imposing offices of a $607 billion asset manager in the heart of a historic financial district? Pandemic era: a five-day induction on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Teams.
The rip-roaring intensity of the trading floor replete with sharp-suited money managers? Not quite - hunched over a laptop with comfy clothes in a flat-share. Client lunches, and perhaps swapping stories after work with fellow graduates embarking on first steps in finance? Not likely.
The pandemic has put paid to many initial expectations of the financial industry's Class of COVID-19.
That group includes new recruits at finance firms around the world, such as 22-year-old graduate analyst Patel and two dozen or so others hired by Aberdeen Standard Investments.
Six months on, Patel has only been in the office in central Edinburgh a handful of times; like many companies in Britain and beyond, Aberdeen has kept employees largely at home since last March.
""I wasn't worried that the training was virtual, I was just upset that I didn't get to go into the office. Because as a new joiner, as a grad, we want to make those connections,"" he said, adding that the virtual training went smoothly.
""It's that little social chat that matters. It's very much that sort of thing we've missed out on.""
His worries are unlikely to have been soothed by the words of David Solomon, a titan of finance as CEO of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), who called working from home ""an aberration"".
Working from home may be here to stay for many finance workers, to a greater or lesser extent.
Reuters interviewed executives at 14 financial firms, including some of the world's top banks and asset management companies. Most said that, while about 80% of their trading floor staff were back in the office, flexible working was in place with employees spending some days at home.
FEAR OF MISSING OUT
On the surface, remote working has worked well in the industry. Deals turnover hit a record $2.4 trillion in the second half of 2020 according to Refinitiv data, while Goldman Sachs,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and many others reported stellar first-quarter earnings.
But for the star rainmakers and fund managers of tomorrow, the change is disconcerting. And senior executives are worried about these juniors missing out on important experience that could constrain their careers or see them leave for rivals. 
Traditionally, new starters learn on the job, observing deals being clinched and performing tasks under supervision. Industry events and client meetings, often in other global finance hubs, offer opportunities to network.
Yet banks such as HSBC and Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) say they may shed up to 40% of their premises. Drastic cuts to international travel are likely. 
Kunal Shah, global head of emerging markets trading at Goldman Sachs, said that while trainees learned by performing tasks such as compiling reports, booking completed trades or writing commentary, senior traders were forced to take back many of those responsibilities during lockdown.
""It is much harder to ask the junior to help with a task when you are sitting at home,"" he added. ""We had to remind managers to put the juniors in such situations so they can learn.""
When lockdown restrictions have been relaxed in Britain, many junior traders wanted to return to the office ""because they learn from that apprenticeship culture"". 
VIRTUALLY FALL BEHIND
One key concern is that screen-sharing and video meetings, however helpful, may be a poor substitute for in-person training, especially for those keen on a trading career. 
""There's a reason that trading desks have evolved as a centralized hub at the heart of investment teams,"" said Tom Stevenson, head of EMEA equity trading at Fidelity International.
""You can't get away from the fact that doing it virtually is perhaps not as productive as being all together physically.""
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s committee for the development of junior markets employees has held video calls to enable trainees to chat with global team members, said Sophie Warrick, EMEA equity research head and co-head of the committee. 
Others such as UBS and Deutsche are using a hybrid approach. In Hong Kong, UBS' 49 graduate trainees can mostly go into the office, but in many other centres around the world the training programmes are virtual, according to Maria Chan, the bank's Asia-Pacific head of human resources.
That could create a two-track system. 
Warrick said employers would need to wait and see how somebody who had been virtually trained went on to develop in their role, ""having not had the in-person training that someone else has had"".
At Goldman Sachs, according to Shah, managers tried to virtually replicate the trading floor vibe for the benefit of younger staff.
""So many teams had a rolling Zoom across trading and sales teams where people were just talking in the same way they would if they were in the office,"" he added. 
Some such as  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) hope more money will help; it plans a $20,000 ""lifestyle"" allowance for junior members of its capital markets and deals teams to maintain morale. 
BRIGHT MINDS, BIG PAY
Despite pandemic predicaments, finance does not want for bright graduates.
Demand for fresh talent at banks in Britain is at its strongest in years, according to figures compiled for Reuters by recruitment specialists Morgan McKinley and Vacancysoft. 
There were 429 vacancies advertised for interns in the first three months of 2021, the highest quarterly number since the beginning of 2018, and about double the levels seen in 2019, before the pandemic struck, the study shows.
The pay packets are part of the draw.
A UK-based investment banking intern can earn around 49,000 pounds ($68,000), rising to 200,000 pounds after a decade on a trading floor, according to Glassdoor, a website where users anonymously submit and view salaries.
Yet it's been tougher to learn the ropes. The leader of currency trading at a global multinational firm, who declined to be named, spoke of the need in the job for ""understanding risks, managing risks and managing human behaviours"".
""A new grad joined us just before the pandemic and we made it work, but do I think he's got the full worth of his graduate assignment having left university? No."" 
Finance firms also have a duty of care to safeguard the mental health of younger staff, in particular. 
The industry is under scrutiny following reports about overwork and burnout, underlined last month by a memo about the 95-hour working weeks endured by some junior Goldman staff in New York.
Some new starters, accepting that a five-day office week may never return, are getting creative. 
Patel and his Aberdeen cohorts use bi-weekly ""lunch and learn"" meetings to catch up with other graduate hires, the peers who will form the basis of their future professional networks. 

""You know, you can't just go for coffee in the middle of the day if your boss lives 20 miles south of the office,"" he said.

(Reuters) -Caterpillar Inc reported quarterly earnings that exceeded analyst estimates on Thursday, as demand for its machines was propelled by the fastest global economic growth since the 1970s.
The Illinois-based manufacturer of heavy machinery, a bellwether for economic activity, said stronger retail demand led dealers to boost inventories more in the latest quarter than a year ago, driving sales across all its three primary segments.
Adjusted profit was $2.87 per share, up from $1.65 per share a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv, on average, expected earnings of $1.94 per share.
The company's shares were up about 3% at $239.25 in premarket trading. The stock has surged 27% since its last earnings report, outperforming the broader blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average.
Equipment sales rose 13% year-on-year to $11.2 billion, led by a 72% surge in construction machine sales in Asia.
""We're encouraged by improving conditions in our end markets and are proactively managing supply chain risks,"" said  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) Chief Executive Jim Umpleby.

The International Monetary Fund said earlier this month that unprecedented public spending to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily by the United States, would push global growth to 6% this year, the fastest pace since 1976, after the steepest annual downturn of the post-war era last year.
Investors are also betting rising commodity prices and the U.S. administration's proposed infrastructure stimulus will lift demand for Caterpillar's yellow bulldozers, mining trucks and other equipment.

1656,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2021 07:10AM ET</span>","Merck misses profit estimates, forecasts larger hit to 2021 sales from pandemic","(Reuters) -Merck & Co Inc on Thursday missed estimates for first-quarter profit and forecast a bigger hit to 2021 sales than its previous estimate as the pandemic hurt demand for its drugs that need to be administered in a clinic.
Shares fell nearly 3% to $74.95 before the opening bell as the company also disclosed a roughly $600 million hit to first-quarter sales from the health crisis. 
Merck now expects the COVID-19 pandemic will hurt its 2021 sales by 3%, up from 2% previously, as many of the company's drugs need to be administered at the doctor's office, which largely remained shut due to COVID-19 lockdowns. 
A large blow was seen on sales of non-COVID-19 vaccines, including Gardasil, a vaccine to prevent cancers caused by the human papillomavirus virus, in the United States and Europe. Gardasil sales tumbled 16.4% to $917 million. 
The company said it expected the impact to vaccines sales would persist during the first half of 2021, and that it would allocate doses of Gardasil to markets outside the United States to soften the blow.
Sales of blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda rose 18.7% to $3.90 billion, but missed Wall Street estimates of $3.98 billion.

Net earnings fell to $3.18 billion, or $1.25 per share, in the first-quarter ended March 31, from $3.22 billion, or $1.26 per share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, the company earned $1.40 per share, missing the average analyst estimate of $1.63, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Thursday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite set to outperform on the back of a dovish Federal Reserve and positive earnings reports from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 155 points, or 0.5%, S&P 500 Futures traded 28 points, or 0.7%, higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 130 points, or 1%.
Apple delivered a blowout first quarter late Wednesday, sending its stock up 2.7% premarket, with sales jumping 54% fueled by 5G iPhone upgrades and the company adding that it would increase its existing share buyback program by $90 billion.  
Facebook also beat Wall Street expectations for both quarterly revenue and profit on Wednesday, prompting gains of over 7% premarket, helped by a surge in digital ad spending during the pandemic when consumers shopped online, along with higher ad prices.
Thursday will be the busiest day of the earnings season, with roughly 11% of the S&P 500 scheduled to provide quarterly updates.  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD), Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and Merck are among the names on deck before the market opens, with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) the star after the market closes.
The cruise operators will also be in focus Thursday after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said late Wednesday that cruising could restart in American waters by mid-summer  if 98% of crew and 95% of passengers were fully vaccinated.
The Federal Reserve upgraded its view of the economy and held its line that any near-term inflation rises will be temporary, while keeping rates near zero and asset purchases steady as it concluded its latest meeting on Wednesday.
Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden used his first joint address to Congress to outline his new $1.8 trillion plan aimed toward children and families while proposing raised taxes on corporations and rich Americans.
Turning to economic data, in addition to the weekly data on jobless claims, Thursday brings us the first quarter GDP number, at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), which is expected to show growth of 6.1% on a yearly basis after growing 4.3% in the fourth quarter of 2020, fueled by unprecedented monetary policy support and fiscal stimulus.
Oil prices traded higher Thursday, climbing to their highest in seven weeks, supported by loose monetary policy and a cheaper dollar, as well as a smaller-than-expected rise in U.S. crude stockpiles last week.
U.S. crude futures traded 1.4% higher at $64.77 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.5% to $67.76.
U.S. inventories rose by 90,000 barrels last week, according to data from the Energy Information Administration on Wednesday, much smaller than forecasts for a 659,000-barrel build and the previous week’s 594,000-barrel build.

U.S. President Joe Biden has proposed a flat defense budget for 2022, despite calls from progressive Democrats to cut Pentagon spending, removing a potential hurdle to profits at defense companies, including Northrop.
""Our team booked competitive new awards and generated higher sales, earnings and cash,"" Chief Executive Officer Kathy Warden said in a statement.
Northrop said it now expects full-year adjusted earnings per share between $24 and $24.50, up from its prior range of $23.15 to $23.65, and above analysts' average estimate of $23.65, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company raised it 2021 sales outlook to between $35.3 billion and $35.7 billion from $35.1 billion to $35.5 billion.
Sales in Northrop's aeronautics systems unit, which makes the center fuselage for the F-35 jets, rose 5% to $2.99 billion, while operating income increased 17% to $308 million in the first quarter ended March 31. 
Higher demand in the F-35 program and E-2 early warning aircraft boosted sales in the unit, the company said.
Sales in Northrop's space systems business jumped 29% to $2.52 billion and operating income surged 37% to $276 million, aided by the production ramp up of its GBSD intercontinental ballistic missiles and higher demand for Next Gen OPIR missile-warning radars.
Excluding the sale of its IT services business, Northrop earned $6.57 per share in the quarter, up from $5.15 per share, a year earlier, topping analysts' average estimate of $5.48 per share.

Total sales rose 6% to $9.16 billion, beating Wall Street's estimate of $8.53 billion.

Lidar, which stands for light detection and ranging, is a remote sensing system that generates a three-dimensional map of the road ahead for vehicles and also helps with applications such as augmented reality in smart devices.
San Jose, California-based Velodyne, an early entrant into the lidar market, said Faraday's FF 91 cars would use the Velarray H800 lidar sensors to power their autonomous driving system.
The deal comes days after the sensor maker signed a multi-year sales agreement with Silicon Valley self-driving startup Gatik, to use its lidar technology in on-road transportation networks.
Faraday Future, which agreed to be taken public by the blank-check firm Property Solutions Acquisition Corp in January, initially planned to launch its FF 91 car in 2019. However, it faced multiple production delays owing to financing issues.

The Los Angeles-based electric vehicle maker now plans to launch the FF 91 within 12 months of closing its merger with Property Solutions.

(Reuters) -  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) Inc said on Thursday its first quarter after-tax distributable earnings rose 23% year-on-year, driven by strong growth in asset sales from its private equity business that was partly offset by a decline in its credit unit.
Washington, D.C.-based Carlyle reported after-tax distributable earnings of $215 million, up from $175 million in the previous year. That translated to after-tax distributable earnings per share of 58 cents, higher than the 52 cents that Wall Street analysts estimated on average, according to financial data provider Refinitiv.
Private equity firms like Carlyle have benefited from rising corporate valuations in the public and private markets, which have allowed them to cash out investments at higher profits.
Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) Inc, the world's largest private equity firm, also reported earlier this week that its distributable earnings more than doubled in the first quarter owing to a surge in asset sales.
Carlyle said it sold $6.4 billion worth of assets in the first quarter, allowing the firm post a net income of $869 million under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), compared with a $612 million loss a year earlier. 
Its divestments included the sale of a majority stake in PA Consulting to Jacobs Engineering Group Inc (NYSE:J), which valued the Britain-based advisory firm at 1.82 billion pounds ($2.54 billion). Carlyle also exited its entire shareholding in Japanese enterprise software developer WingArc1st via an initial public offering on the Tokyo Stock Exchange for about $175 million.
Carlyle said its credit funds appreciated by 8% in the first quarter. Its corporate private equity, real estate and natural resources funds rose 15%, 4%, and 7%, respectively.
Total asset management rose to $260 billion, up from $246 billion in the previous quarter owing to the appreciation of its funds. Carlyle closed the quarter with $75 billion in unspent capital and declared a quarterly dividend of 25 cents.

1670,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2021 06:05AM ET</span>","Daimler, Volvo plan hydrogen fuel cell production in Europe in 2025","By Nick Carey
LONDON (Reuters) -Daimler AG's truck unit and Volvo AB (OTC:VLVLY) said on Thursday they would start making hydrogen fuel cells in Europe in 2025 via a joint venture, and called for EU policies to help make the zero-emission technology commercially viable.
The rival German and Swedish makers of large freight-hauling trucks formed their venture, cellcentric, in March. They said they would provide more details on large-scale fuel production in 2022, but said cellcentric was already scaling up prototype output.
""Partnerships like cellcentric are vital to our commitment to decarbonising road transport,"" Volvo Chief Executive Martin Lundstedt said in a statement.
Aside from the fuel-cell joint venture, the two companies remain competitors. Both hope to test fuel-cell trucks in about three years and start mass producing trucks in the second half of this decade.
The European Union has been pushing tighter emission standards, fuelling a boom in zero-emission electric cars.
But batteries in electric vehicles are very heavy and hydrogen fuel cells are seen as a potentially more viable zero-emission power systems for long-haul freight in the future. Fuel cells produce electricity from hydrogen, emitting only water. 
The two truck makers called for the construction of around 300 hydrogen refueling stations suitable for heavy-duty vehicles in Europe by 2025 and about 1,000 stations by 2030.
During a video conference with the two firms, European Commissioner for Transport Adina Vălean said the commission would this summer propose a revised alternative fuels directive.
She said this ""will include binding requirements for rolling out hydrogen fueling infrastructure ... and financial support will be available where needed.""
Automaker Stellantis said this year it would begin deliveries in Europe of its first medium-sized vans powered by hydrogen fuel cells by the end of 2021.
Stellantis said at the time that Germany had 90 hydrogen stations and France had 25 - a tiny fraction of the thousands of petrol stations available for fossil-fuel vehicles today.

As zero-emission trucks are significantly more expensive than fossil-fuel models, Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) and Volvo said a ""policy framework is needed to ensure demand and affordability.""
The two companies said policies should include subsidies for ""CO2-neutral technologies and a taxation system based on carbon and energy content.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Chicago-based Cboe said on Thursday it would launch its delayed equity derivatives trading hub in Amsterdam in September, the latest move by financial markets to base their European footprint in the Dutch capital after Brexit.
Cboe, already one of the biggest pan-European share trading platforms with operations in London and Amsterdam, said ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd) Clearing, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) had signed up to participate. 
Cboe's in-house clearing arm, Amsterdam-based EuroCCP, will clear the equity derivatives trades.
""We have listened to the needs of market participants and are designing this new market from a pan-European point-of-view,"" said David Howson, Cboe's president for Europe and Asia Pacific at Cboe Global Markets (NYSE:CBOE).
The venture, which had been due to launch in the first half of this year, will initially offer trading in futures and options based on six Cboe Europe indices that cover top euro zone shares, and top British, Dutch, Swiss, German and French shares.
Cboe's decision is a further boost to Amsterdam, which became Europe's biggest share trading centre in January after trading in euro shares moved there from London.
Euro swaps trading has also moved from London to Amsterdam, with trading in carbon emissions due to follow.
Cboe faces tough competition from long-established rivals such as Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn)'s Eurex and Euronext, but hopes to grow the market overall in a region where futures and options are largely traded along national lines.

The exchange seeks to apply its long experience in U.S. futures and options trading out of Chicago to develop a European market with more of a U.S. approach.

PARIS (Reuters) -Airbus on Thursday confirmed plans to raise production of its most-sold jets as airlines begin an uneven recovery from the pandemic, despite setbacks in Europe and a rapidly worsening wave of infections in India.
Unveiling a stronger than expected turnaround in first-quarter profit, CEO Guillaume Faury said domestic air travel is rebounding in China and the United States while cross-border travel is likely to remain weak for some time.
Conflicting policies on quarantines, lockdowns and testing have disrupted Europe's single aviation market: one reason why Faury said he remained cautious even while planning to raise output in the second half to serve travel demand elsewhere.
""The lack of coordination of the measures taken primarily in Europe....is leading to a travel situation that is far worse in Europe than in other comparable markets,"" Faury said.
""That is a concern and headwind for the recovery in aviation.""
India, one of Airbus' biggest markets, is an ""area of great concern"" as the country faces a deadly second wave of COVID-19, with record daily infection rates and deaths.
""We have not yet seen a direct impact on us but that is probably one of the regions where we should not expect (things to be) as good as was expected before,"" Faury said.
Airbus plans to increase production of single-aisle medium-haul jets to 43 a month in the third quarter and to 45 in the fourth, from a current rate of 40 a month - down from 60 before the crisis.
Airbus is also exploring a ""steep"" further ramp-up in 2022 and 2023, but that depends in part on the ability of suppliers to keep up, he said.
SUPPLIER RISKS
Shares in Airbus rose 2.8% as it maintained its production and financial goals for this year.
Some industry executives have expressed concerns about raising output too quickly. Faury said the balance of risks was shifting from demand to the supply chain.
Airbus is not directly affected by a global shortage of semiconductors but is monitoring the situation, he added.
The head of U.S. rival Boeing (NYSE:BA), which is wrestling with new technical problems with its competing 737 MAX, pledged on Wednesday to raise output in the ""most stable fashion"".
Airbus first-quarter operating profit rose 147% to 694 million euros ($841.6 million), led by commercial jets and helicopters, as revenue slipped 2% to 10.46 billion euros.
It generated a positive free cashflow of 1.2 billion euros in the first quarter, compared with an 8-billion-euro outflow in the same period last year when Airbus had to pay a record corruption fine to Britain, France and the United States.
Part of the cash boom stems from a discrepancy between the timing of goods received and payments to suppliers, Airbus said.

For the full-year, Airbus expects deliveries equal to last year's 566 jetliners, adjusted operating profit of 2 billion euros and breakeven free cashflow.

LONDON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Global shares extended gains on Thursday after the Federal Reserve said it was too early to consider rolling back emergency support for the economy, and U.S. President Joe Biden proposed a $1.8 trillion stimulus package.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, was 0.2% higher, on course for its best month since November.
The pan-European STOXX 600 opened 0.4% firmer, while E-mini futures for the S&P 500 index rose 0.4% and Nasdaq futures advanced 0.6%. 
U.S. Treasury yields advanced 1.8 basis points to 1.6486, still short of Wednesday's two-week high, while euro zone government bond yields remained below two-month highs.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that ""it is not time yet"" to begin discussing any change in policy after the U.S. central bank left interest rates and its bond-buying programme unchanged, despite taking a more optimistic view of the country's economic recovery.
The Fed's stance, strong U.S. corporate earnings and the notion that Biden is going big on infrastructure were all supportive for markets, said François Savary, chief investment officer at Swiss wealth manager Prime Partners.
""The Fed confirmed the roadmap for any change in policy, which is a reassuring factor,"" he said. ""It looks like tapering won't materialise until 2022 and that has induced weakness for the dollar, is supportive of market liquidity and means less pressure on emerging markets.""
HUGE STIMULUS
Biden proposed the sweeping new $1.8 trillion plan in a speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, pleading with Republican lawmakers to work with him on divisive issues and to meet the stiff competition posed by China. 
He also made an impassioned plea to raise taxes on corporations and rich Americans to help pay for what he called the ""American Families Plan"" in his maiden speech to Congress.
He has also proposed nearly doubling the tax on investment income, which knocked stock markets last week.
Stephen Dover (NYSE:DOV), Franklin Templeton's chief market strategist in California, said the effect of the tax package on markets is hard to measure for now.
""If it passes, I think it will have an impact on individual stocks that will pay a higher rate of tax or companies with founders who will pay capital gains and could sell stocks,"" he said. 
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan built on early gains and added 0.48%.
Australia's S&P/ASX 200 edged up 0.25%, as strong oil prices lifted energy stocks, closing at their highest level in nearly 14 months.
China's blue-chip CSI300 index was 0.88% higher.
Markets in Japan were closed for a holiday but Nikkei futures rose 0.48%.
For the rest of the day, investors will focus on the first estimate of U.S. GDP for the first quarter, which is expected at 13:30 GMT. 
DOLLAR IN DOLDRUMS
The Fed's doggedly dovish outlook and the White House's spending plans hampered the dollar, which traded just off nine-week lows.
Against a basket of currencies, the greenback was at 90.622, and a long way from the rally peak of 93.439 hit at the end of March. 
The euro hit its highest since late February at $1.2150, before steadying at $1.2121. 
Oil prices extended gains on Thursday as bullish forecasts for a demand recovery this summer offset concerns of rising COVID-19 cases in India, Japan and Brazil.
Brent crude for June rose 0.39% to $67.53 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for June was at $64.06 a barrel, up 0.31%.

(Reuters) -Unilever beat quarterly sales forecasts on Thursday, helped by a pick up in home cooking in coronavirus lockdowns and a strong economic recovery in China, and said it would buy back up to 3 billion euros ($3.6 billion) of shares from May. 
Shares in the maker of Dove soap and Ben and Jerry's ice cream climbed 4% in early trade, and were among the top gainers on the UK's benchmark FTSE 100 index. 
Underlying sales rose 5.7% in the three months to the end of March, topping analysts' average forecast of 3.9%, according to a company supplied consensus.
""These are encouraging numbers,"" said Steve Clayton, portfolio manager of  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV)'s Select UK Shares funds. ""Unilever (NYSE:UL) gains much of its strength through the group's diversity."" 
Unilever said it was confident of delivering full-year underlying sales growth within its mid-term target range of 3-5%, with the first half around the top of the range. Some analysts had doubted whether it would hit that goal this year. 
Emerging markets saw growth of 9.4% in the quarter, led by double-digit increases in China and India following strict lockdowns the previous year. 
Pitkethly said easier comparables than last year, a resurgence in out-of-home ice cream sales in some emerging markets, a return of sales to cafes and restaurants in places like China, and U.S. retailer restocking of high-end beauty products underpinned its confidence for the rest of the year. 
He also noted some changes in consumer behaviour a year into the pandemic, with demand for hair, skin and oral care products remaining strong, but deodorants weaker, indicating more time being spent at home. 
FOOD LEADS THE WAY
Unilever also said it expected a slight increase in underlying operating margin this year, and that it was making good progress in separating its slower-growth Elida beauty and tea businesses, which could lead to sales or spin-offs. 
Elida beauty will consist of brands predominantly sold in Europe and North America, including Q-Tips, Caress, Tigi, Timotei, Impulse and MonSavon, which together generated revenues of around 600 million euros in 2020, the company said.
Underlying sales in the group's food and refreshments business, where brands include Hellmann's mayonnaise and Knorr soups, jumped 9.8% in the quarter, helped by strong demand for home consumption in North America and Europe.
That performance echoes Nestle, the world's biggest food group, which last week reported the biggest jump in quarterly group sales for a decade. 
Activia maker Danone, however, saw its first-quarter sales drop 3.3%.

Unilever noted the devastating surge in COVID-19 infections currently sweeping India, another key market, but said it was not seeing any material impact on its business from that so far.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded largely higher Thursday, helped by positive corporate earnings, particularly in the heavily-weighted oil sector, following the Federal Reserve’s decision to keep to its easy money policies in place.
At 3:40 AM ET (0840 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% lower, but the CAC 40 in France rose 0.6%, to a new 52-week high, and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.5%.
The first-quarter corporate earnings season continued apace Thursday, with the oil & gas sector in the spotlight.
Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) stock rose 1.7% after the oil major reported net income of $3.23 billion, its highest profit since the third quarter of 2019, following the recovery in global oil and gas markets. The company also reduced its debt burden and went ahead with a planned 4% increase to its dividend payout. Equinor ASA (OL:EQNR) also raised its dividend after reporting a sharp rebound in profit.
 Total  (PA:TOTF) stock also rose 1.4% after the French energy group reported net income of $3 billion, similar to the levels it was generating before the coronavirus pandemic hit profits. 
Elsewhere, Airbus (PA:AIR) stock rose 2.7% after the aircraft manufacturer posted higher first-quarter core earnings, Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) stock rose 2.8% after the U.K.-based bank posted a higher-than-expected 18% rise in quarterly pretax profit, and Nokia (NYSE:NOK) soared over 11% after the Finnish telecom network equipment maker reported better-than-expected first-quarter revenue and profit, helped by a growth in sales of 5G equipment.
On the flip side, German carrier Deutsche Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) stock fell 0.6% after the German carrier posted another net loss in the first quarter, albeit a smaller one thanks to drastic cost cuts.
 Euronext  (PA:ENX) stock fell 2.2% after the European exchange operator completed its acquisition of Borsa Italiana from the  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSEG) in a deal worth 4.4 billion euros ($5.34 billion), a deal that was first announced in October and received the green light from European regulators in March. The stock was hit by the announcement that it is issuing 579 million of new equity to Italian banks CDP and  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) as part of the deal.
The U.S. Federal Reserve left its benchmark rate unchanged in the range of 0% to 0.25% on Wednesday and maintained its monthly pace of bond buying at $120 billion, as widely expected.
In the press conference that followed the policy statement, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell continued to signal that the central bank was in no rush to adjust its accommodative stance even as vaccine rollouts and fiscal stimulus bolster the country’s economic recovery.
Economic data releases from Europe Thursday will center around German unemployment and inflation numbers for April.
Oil prices edged higher Thursday, with a smaller-than-expected rise in crude stockpiles last week adding to the general market confidence of a strong rebound in global demand this year.

It said only 1.7 million passengers travelled through the London airport in the three months to March 31, down 91% compared to the first quarter of 2019.
Heathrow, which during the pandemic lost its crown as Europe's busiest hub to Paris, said continuing uncertainty over British government policy meant it had reduced its passenger forecast for the year to a range of between 13 million and 36 million, compared to 81 million in 2019.
Britain's aviation industry is hoping that flying will rebound in late May once COVID-19 restrictions are eased, but uncertainty remains about where people will be able to go, and how digital vaccine passports will work.
British transport secretary Grant Shapps has said he will chair a meeting of G7 transport ministers next week to discuss vaccine passports before announcing which countries would be open to Britons for travel in early May.
Heathrow reiterated that Britain's summer economic recovery depended on travel restarting from May 17.
It said it would be ready to scale-up operations as demand returned but repeated concerns about the UK Border Force's ability to prevent a long wait for arriving passengers at passport checks.
""Ministers will need to ensure every desk is staffed to avoid unacceptable queues,"" it said.
Britain's aviation regulator said on Tuesday that Heathrow could charge airlines 30 pence more per passenger to help recover up to 3 billion pounds of pandemic losses, a fraction of what Heathrow had asked for but enough to infuriate the owner of British Airways.

Heathrow is owned by investors including Spain's Ferrovial the Qatar Investment Authority and China Investment Corp.

As investors demand higher returns, Shell took another step toward giving them what they want. After slashing its dividend last year, the company went ahead with a planned 4% increase to the payout. It also managed to pay off $4.1 billion of net debt, moving closer to the level of borrowing that will allow it return extra cash to shareholders.
“Shell has made a strong start to 2021,” Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden said in a statement on Thursday. “We have reduced net debt by more than $4 billion this quarter, progressing towards the $65 billion milestone to increase shareholder distributions.”
First-quarter adjusted net income was $3.23 billion, up from $2.86 billion a year earlier, Shell said. That compares to an average analyst estimate of $3.06 billion. It was the highest profit since the third quarter of 2019, joining Total SE, BP (NYSE:BP) Plc and Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR) in restoring earnings to pre-pandemic levels.
The results come two days after BP posted a much higher profit than expected and started share buybacks, thanks in large part to “exceptional” earnings from natural gas trading related to the big freeze in Texas.
Shell said its gas trading results were lower in the first quarter, but the company’s chemicals business really shone. The unit delivered $730 million in adjusted net income, almost double the amount of a year earlier and about a quarter of the company’s total first-quarter earnings.
Chemicals is an area that Shell -- and its U.S. peer  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). which reports earnings on Friday -- really excels. Prices for the products are rising strongly around the world with the rebound in the manufacturing industry.

1681,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2021 02:25AM ET</span>","Exclusive-Huawei deepens dive into EVs, seeks control of small automaker- sources","By Julie Zhu
HONG KONG (Reuters) -China's Huawei Technologies is in talks to take control of a small domestic automaker's electric vehicle unit, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said, in what is seen as a strategic shift for the world's largest telecom equipment maker.
Huawei, which has been battered by U.S. sanctions, is in talks with Chongqing Sokon to acquire a controlling stake in the latter's Chongqing Jinkang New Energy Automobile, said the sources.
The move will allow Huawei to make intelligent cars bearing its own nameplate, they added. Jinkang counts U.S. EV brand Seres, formerly known as SF Motors, as its main asset.
It would also provide the first evidence that Huawei is looking to go beyond just offering auto operating systems and have an end-to-end presence in the EV business. 
Huawei and Sokon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The push into smart cars, if finalised, would signal a major shift in business focus for Huawei after two years of U.S. sanctions that have cut its access to key supply chains, forcing it to sell a part of its smartphone business.
Underscoring the shift, the company's rotating chairman Eric Xu announced pacts with three state-owned Chinese carmakers, including BAIC Group, to supply ""Huawei Inside"", a smart vehicle operating system, at the Shanghai Auto Show earlier this month.
Huawei's foray into EVs comes as technology firms such as Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) Corp have been stepping up efforts in the world's biggest market for such vehicles, as Beijing heavily promotes greener vehicles to reduce carbon emissions.
""As individual consumer demand for smart EVs has been picking up notably since mid-last year, the track is now clear and solid in front of the tech giants,"" said Yale Zhang, managing director of Automotive Foresight. 
""Despite of their years of success and experience in smartphone markets, it will still take a few years for them to build a car brand acceptable in the EV sector.""
As part of the deal, Huawei also plans to buy an undetermined stake in privately-owed Chongqing Sokon Holdings, the biggest shareholder of Shanghai-listed Sokon, said one of the sources.
Richard Yu, head of Huawei's consumer business group who led the company to become one of the world's largest smartphone makers and has recently shifted his focus to EVs, is leading the talks with Sokon, said the two people. 
The telecom giant looks to finalise the deal as soon as July, said the other source.
MASS PRODUCTION
Huawei is also seeking to control the EV brand ArcFox of BAIC's BluePark New Energy Technology, which recently launched its Alpha S model equipped with the ""Huawei Inside"" system, said the two people and another person with direct knowledge. 
But BAIC is more keen to have Huawei just as a minority shareholder in ArcFox, they added. 
A BAIC representative referred the query to BluePark which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
All the sources declined to be named.
In February, Reuters reported that Huawei plans to make EVs under its own brand and could launch some models this year.
Sales of new energy vehicles, including pure battery electric vehicles as well as plug-in hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, are expected to make up 20% of China's overall annual auto sales by 2025.
For months, Huawei has been deeply involved in the operation and manufacturing of the little-known Sokon and its loss-making Seres unit.
Under the tie-up, Seres's first model, ""Huawei Smart Selection"" SF5, debuted at the Shanghai Auto Show and received over 3,000 orders within two days after the pre-sale started last week, according to Seres. 
Huawei is selling SF5 vehicles in its stores across China including its online store VMall.com. 
The company aims to launch the first intelligent car under its own brand for mass production at the earliest by the end of this year, said one of them. 

Huawei has high expectations for the model, which is under development based on the Seres SF5, but the existing supply chain of Sokon is struggling to meet such expectations, said the same person. 
""The supply chain for the auto industry is very long and complicated,"" said the person. ""Huawei does have its strength in software and platform but its ideas can't be realized without solid technology improvements in the supply chain.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - In Hong Kong's famed party zone Lan Kwai Fong, dormant bars and clubs are revving up to serve customers again, but only if they have had at least one vaccine shot - one of the few examples globally of offering greater freedom for the vaccinated. 
Bar staff need to have gotten at least one coronavirus vaccine dose too, and patrons must register with a government mobile tracking application as they enter. 
The Chinese special administrative region has kept COVID-19 transmission largely under control. Hong Kong has recorded more than 11,700 coronavirus cases, far lower than other developed cities. The new rules come as authorities there try to encourage the city's 7.5 million residents to get vaccinated; only about 12% have received their first dose. 
""The re-opening of bars and the extension of opening hours are incentives for people to receive the vaccination, while the most important thing ... is to prevent the spread of the infection, should it hit us again,"" said Professor Lau Chak Sing, head of department of Medicine at the University of Hong Kong (HKU). 
""In an ideal situation, one should complete the course of vaccination to ensure protection,"" he said, adding that with Hong Kong's adequate supply of vaccines, people eager to go to bars would complete both their first and second doses. 
Venues including nightclubs, karaoke lounges and bathhouses, can stay open until 2 a.m. but must operate at half capacity, Sophia Chan, the city's Health Secretary said. Bars can only seat two people per table. 
COMPLEX RULES
Customers must scan the government's app and show their vaccination record - stored electronically on their mobile phones - when they enter. Many residents have declined to use the app because of privacy concerns, choosing instead to write down their details. 
Restaurants can stay open until 2 a.m. and seat up to 8 people at a table, provided they have received both vaccine doses. But they must have a separate area for unvaccinated customers, and depending on whether staff have been vaccinated, might be required to close 10 p.m. or midnight. 
The multi-tiered rules are tough to implement immediately, industry executives said, and many venues cannot open fully as they cannot force staff to get vaccinated. 
Allan Zeman, chairman of Lan Kwai Fong Group, a property owner and developer in the nightclub district, said that bar owners were desperate to reopen but that there remained a lot of apprehension among staff about vaccinations. 
""The restrictions will not be easy. Customers themselves need to have one vaccine, that in itself is very limiting,"" he said, adding that the measures were a baby step forward and an experiment for both the government and the industry. 
Simon Wong, chief executive of LH Group, which operates dozens of restaurants and employs hundreds of staff, wrote on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page that the new arrangement was ""so complicated"". Wong said his restaurants would only be able to seat 4 people per table and stay open until 10 p.m., as many staff did not want to get vaccinated. 
Hong Kong residents have been hesitant since the vaccination programme began in February because of a lack of confidence in China's Sinovac vaccine and fears of adverse reactions. 

Some residents have shown greater take-up for the vaccine offered by Germany's BioNTech in the city but overall figures remain far below satisfactory, said the city's leader, Carrie Lam.

1683,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2021 02:06AM ET</span>","Biden's EU trade dilemma: more pain for Harley, distillers or back off metals tariffs?","By David Lawder and Rajesh Kumar Singh
WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - The Biden administration faces a major dilemma in its dispute with the European Union over Trump-era steel and aluminum tariffs: back down to avoid acute pain for Harley-Davidson Inc (NYSE:HOG) and whiskey distillers or stick with the duties even though they are now exacerbating acute shortages for U.S. manufacturers.
The EU has threatened to double the tariffs on Harley-Davidson motorcycles, American-made whiskey and power boats to 50% on June 1, cutting off any residual hope of exports to the continent. 
President Joe Biden has pledged that he will maintain the tariff protections for the steel and aluminum industries until the problem of global excess production capacity - largely centered in China - can be addressed.
His sentiments were echoed by U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai on Wednesday, and his Commerce secretary, Gina Raimondo, said https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-tariffs-biden/update-1-u-s-commerce-chief-metals-tariffs-helped-save-some-u-s-jobs-idUSL1N2M027O earlier this month that the tariffs ""helped save American jobs in steel and aluminum industries.""
Harley-Davidson has also been hit by a European court ruling that its bikes produced in Thailand will be treated as U.S. made, subjecting them to the 50% tariff as well - on top of the normal 6% tariff.
""If not for the tariffs, which are now threatening our recovering export potential, we could be investing in jobs at our American facilities,"" Harley Chief Executive Jochen Zeitz told an earnings call. ""Instead, we are facing huge tariffs in a trade war - in a trade war not of our making.""
The Milwaukee-based company is betting heavily on Europe, its second-largest market, to help fuel its turnaround strategy. But higher tariffs would give its rivals including Triumph, Honda and Suzuki a massive pricing advantage.
In Bristol, Pennsylvania, the craft distiller of Dad's Hat Pennsylvania Rye Whiskey recently managed to ship its first pallet to a European distributor in over two years after the current 25% tariffs stunted a growing export business in 2018.
""If you double those tariffs, forget about it. It would be done,"" Mountain Laurel Spirits LLC owner Herman Mihalich said of his export prospects.
STEELWORKERS: HOLD THE LINE
The United Steelworkers union and the mills that employ its members are urging the administration to continue backing the Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum, arguing that lifting them would allow subsidized Chinese steel to flood back into the U.S. market via third countries. 
USW President Tom Conway acknowledged the pain for Harley but said the protections needed to remain in place until Chinese excess capacity was reduced.
""Some people get hurt when this sort of stuff goes on. So, I understand what they're saying. But I don't think the 232 can be lifted,"" Conway told Reuters, adding that perhaps the issue could be settled with steel import quotas for Europe.
U.S. Trade Representative Tai told senators that she is working with EU counterparts to find a solution, but they must address the issue of excess capacity in China, which produces half the world's steel. 
She said she hopes that EU officials see the problem ""as serious a challenge to their ability to produce and compete in steelmaking as we see it, and working together we will be able to resolve these sets of tariffs so that we can join forces on the bigger picture.""
The EU has never accepted the premise of the 25% steel and 10% aluminum tariffs imposed by former president Donald Trump in March 2018, duties based on a Cold War-era trade law to protect domestic industries deemed critical to national security.
Critics from the EU to metals-consuming industries and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce argued that the metals were commodities available in ample quantity to meet U.S. defense needs and that European producers in countries that are trusted U.S. allies present no threat to U.S. security.
Sabine Weyand, director general of the European Commission's trade section, said earlier this month that she feared the two sides were ""running out of time.""
TIGHT MARKET 
When the tariffs were imposed, the steel industry looked very different from its current supply-constrained condition. Imports were flooding in, taking nearly 30% of the U.S. market, and holding U.S. Midwest hot-rolled steel spot prices below $600 per ton.
The goal of the tariffs was to return U.S. steel mills to 80% of capacity use, a level at which they could thrive, and imports sank to around 15% of the U.S. market in January. 
But this week, amid severe shortages caused by the coronavirus pandemic, that spot price is pushing $1,500 a ton, making it cheaper in some cases to import steel and pay the 25% tariff, some steel users say.
Steel imports jumped 20.7% in March over February to 2.3 million tons, even though the year-to-date total was up just 3.1%, according to American Iron and Steel Institute data https://www.steel.org/2021/04/steel-imports-up-more-than-3-year-to-date-through-march.
""I think you just have a perfect storm going on in terms of capacity constraints with demand surging. And the mills, rightly or wrongly, are managing it with price,"" said Todd Leebow, president of Majestic Steel USA, a Cleveland-based steel service center firm that specializes in supplying American-made steel.
""If we want to go buy spot (steel) from the mills right now, we can't get it,"" Leebow said, adding that supplies are tight worldwide, with long waits for imports.
The industry had shut down as much as 30% of its capacity during the coronavirus pandemic, and it has been slow to reopen. Several blast furnaces shut last year remain idled, and newly built electric-arc furnace mills prompted by the tariffs have been slow to ramp up production.
The industry has also consolidated, increasing its pricing power, with iron ore miner Cleveland-Cliffs (NYSE:CLF) Inc last year acquiring both AK Steel and the U.S. assets of Arcelor Mittal, while U.S. Steel bought Arkansas mini-mill producer Big River Steel. Both are still idling older plants.
 Nucor  Corp (NYSE:NUE), the largest U.S. steelmaker, last week reported the highest-ever first quarter profit in its history, citing strong demand and higher prices.
JOBS MIRAGE
The Trump administration had promised a rust belt jobs revival when it imposed the tariffs in 2018. But after rising in 2019 followed by COVID-19 shutdowns, iron and steel mill employment in February was down about 2,300 jobs from pre-tariff levels, according to Labor Department data.
Graphic: Impact of Tariffs on Steel Employment , https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ELECTION/STEEL/bdwvkkxyxvm/chart.png
Kevin Dempsey, president of AISI, which represents major steelmakers, argues that the consolidation is a sign of health and increased investment for the industry, and the current supply shortage is a temporary bottleneck being experienced by many other industries, including semiconductors.
He cited a March study https://www.epi.org/publication/why-global-steel-surpluses-warrant-u-s-section-232-import-measures by the Economic Policy Institute showing the industry has committed to $15.7 billion in new or upgraded American steel facilities since the tariffs were implemented in 2018, which will add 3,200 direct new jobs.
With the Biden administration now pushing a massive $2 trillion infrastructure plan, the demand for steel is expected to grow, and some doubt that demand can be met if the tariffs remain in place. 
""It's going to become largely unaffordable to build all of these new infrastructure assets or upgrade infrastructure assets if the price of steel is $1,300 a ton,"" said Kip Eideberg, who heads government and industry relations at the Association of Equipment Manufacturers, which represents over 1,000 companies including  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT) and Deere (NYSE:DE) & Co.
Leebow, the Cleveland steel distributor, said he supported the Section 232 tariffs, but it was now time to modify them.

""I would remove the tariffs from Europe and put a quota system in place for Europe and keep the tariffs in place on countries that are bad actors,"" he said.

1684,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 29, 2021 02:00AM ET</span>",European Stock Futures Higher; Dovish Fed Message Helps,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets are seen edging higher at the open Thursday, as investors digest the Federal Reserve’s decision to keep to its easy money policy while the first-quarter earnings season continues. 
At 3:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.5% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.2%. 
The U.S. central bank left its benchmark rate unchanged in the range of 0% to 0.25% on Wednesday and maintained its monthly pace of bond buying at $120 billion, as widely expected.
In the press conference that followed the policy statement, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell continued to signal that the central bank was in no rush to adjust its accommodative stance even as vaccine rollouts and fiscal stimulus bolster the country’s economic recovery.
“Powell...certainly didn’t sound scared of inflation expectations overshooting target, as the Fed seems to find most, if not all, reflationary factors transitory,” said analysts at Nordea, in a note.
It’s also a busy day for European corporate earnings.
Aircraft manufacturer Airbus (PA:AIR) posted higher first-quarter core earnings on Thursday but kept its forecasts unchanged amid uncertainty while the Covid-19 pandemic lingers. The problems of its customers were evident in German carrier Deutsche Lufthansa's (DE:LHAG) results, which showed another first-quarter net loss , albeit a smaller one thanks to drastic cost cuts. Lufthansa said it expects a significant market recovery in the second half of the year.
U.K.-based bank Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) posted a higher-than-expected 18% rise in quarterly pretax profit.
Additionally, Finnish telecom network equipment maker Nokia (NYSE:NOK) reported better-than-expected first-quarter revenue and profit, helped by a growth in sales of 5G equipment.
Earnings are also expected from oil giants  Total  (PA:TOTF) and Shell (LON:RDSa), and expectations are positive following on from rival  BP  's (LON:BP) strong first quarter numbers.
Economic data releases from Europe Thursday will center around German unemployment and inflation numbers for April.
Oil prices edged higher Thursday, with a smaller-than-expected rise in U.S. crude stockpiles last week adding to the general market confidence of a strong rebound in global demand this year.
U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% higher at $64.18 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.5% to $67.11.
U.S. inventories rose by 90,000 barrels last week, according to data from the Energy Information Administration on Wednesday, much smaller than forecasts for a 659,000-barrel build and the previous week’s 594,000-barrel build.
Supply data from the industry body American Petroleum Institute the day before showed an increase of 4.3 million barrels.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.6% to $1,784.35/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.2135.

1685,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2021 01:51AM ET</span>",Exclusive: China readies Tencent penalty in antitrust crackdown - sources,"By Pei Li and Julie Zhu
(Reuters) - China is preparing a substantial fine for Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) as part of its sweeping antitrust clampdown on the country's internet giants, but it is likely to be less than the record $2.75 billion penalty imposed on  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) earlier this month, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Tencent should expect a penalty of at least 10 billion yuan ($1.54 billion), significant enough for the State Administration of Market Regulation (SAMR) to make an example of it, both people said.
Tencent faces penalties for not properly reporting past acquisitions and investments for antitrust reviews, an offence with a fine capped at 500,000 yuan per case, and for anticompetitive practices in some of its businesses, with music streaming in particular focus, said the sources.
Neither SAMR nor Tencent immediately responded to Reuters' requests for comment.
""The attitude from the regulator is that unlike Alibaba you are not the biggest target here, but it would be impossible not to penalise Tencent now that the campaign is in action,"" said one of the people.
China has in recent months sought to curb the economic and social power of its once loosely regulated internet giants, in a clampdown backed by President Xi Jinping.
Tencent and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd are China's two biggest tech conglomerates, with market values of $776 billion and $642 billion, respectively.
Earlier this month, SAMR imposed its record fine on Alibaba after an investigation found the e-commerce firm had abused its dominant market position for several years.
Tencent's vast businesses include video games, content streaming, social media, advertising and cloud services.
SAMR's investigation partly focuses on  Tencent Music Entertainment Group  (NYSE:TME), which was spun off and listed in the United States in late 2018, two of the people and an additional two sources close to the business said. Tencent Music Entertainment did not immediately respond to request for comment.
The regulator has informed Tencent that it should expect a fine, give up exclusive music rights, and may even be forced to sell the acquired Kuwo and Kugou music apps, said the people.
However, Tencent's core businesses, video games and WeChat, are likely to remain intact, said one of the people.
STREAMING STRANGLEHOLD
Tencent Music, China's answer to Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), acquired competitor apps Kugou and Kuwo in 2016, and pursued exclusive streaming rights with record labels including Universal Music Group,  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Music Group and Warner Music Group Corp.
It then sublicensed some of the rights to competitors including NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) Cloud Music, which complained that the arrangement was unfair and prices too high.
SAMR launched a probe into Tencent Music in 2018 but dropped it in 2019 after the company agreed to stop renewing some of the exclusive rights, which normally expire after three years, two sources told Reuters previously.
However, it kept exclusive rights to Jay Chou, the most influential pop star in the Chinese-speaking world, using it as a competitive edge against smaller rivals NetEase Cloud Music and Alibaba-backed Xiami Music.
SAMR has told Tencent Music that it should expect to give up some of the remaining exclusive rights, two of the people said.
It may also be required to sell Kugou and Kuwo to competitors or other investors, one of the options being proposed to senior government officials in Beijing, three sources said.
A forced sale of those units would set a precedent and might be hard to execute, two of them cautioned.
Final confirmation of Tencent's punishment will need a nod from China's central leadership, the people said.
Tencent is lobbying for a more lenient penalty, they added.
""Tencent doesn't mind paying a hefty fine and is willing to pay more if it needs to, as long as its core businesses remain intact,"" said one of the people, referring to its video games and WeChat app units.
Last month, Reuters reported that Tencent will need to meet certain conditions in its plan to merge Huya (NYSE:HUYA) and Douyu, two leading video game streaming platforms, including giving up exclusivity to broadcast Tencent games to competing streaming sites.
SAMR said this week it is investigating Tencent-backed Meituan over claims the food delivery giant forced vendors to use their platform exclusively, the same offence Alibaba was penalised for.

1686,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2021 01:35AM ET</span>","Global EV sales accelerating, but government help needed - IEA","By Nick Carey
LONDON (Reuters) - Global electric vehicle (EV) sales picked up speed in the first quarter, but more government action is needed on charging stations and fossil-fuel vehicle bans to keep the momentum going, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Thursday.
""We still see no sign of a slowdown in global electric car markets,"" said Timur Gül, head of the IEA's energy technology policy division, in a presentation on the global outlook for EVs.
While the COVID-19 pandemic drove global car sales down 16% in 2020, EV sales jumped 41% to around 3 million vehicles. 
First quarter global EV sales soared 140% to 1.1 million vehicles, with strong growth in China, Europe and the United States, the IEA said.
A Munich Mobility Show study released last week showed huge disparities in global EV ownership, with very few electrified vehicles on the roads in large markets like Russia, South America and Africa.
EV sales growth in Europe and China has been fueled by tightening CO2 emissions standards and government subsidies.
Globally, consumers spent around $120 billion on EVs in 2020, while governments forked out around $13 billion in subsidies, or equivalent to around 10% of total spending, down from 20% of total spending in 2015. 
That will fall further as battery prices drop and EVs reach cost parity with fossil-fuel vehicles, which IEA energy analyst Jacopo Tattini said should happen by 2030.
""But policies must be strengthened to enable a larger electric vehicle deployment,"" Tattini said. 
He said governments need to further tighten fuel economy standards and join the 20 or so countries that have already announced plans to ban on sales of new fossil-fuel vehicles - such as the United Kingdom, which has announced a ban from 2030. 

Governments also need to keep up spending on charging infrastructure, Tattini said. Carmakers and environmental groups say more spending on EV chargers is needed to foster consumer confidence in the technology and support sales.

1687,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2021 01:32AM ET</span>",Nokia Q1 beats expectations on higher 5G gear demand,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Finnish telecom network equipment maker Nokia (NYSE:NOK) on Thursday reported better-than-expected first-quarter revenue and profit, helped by a growth in sales of 5G equipment.
Quarterly revenue rose 3% to 5.08 billion euros ($6.16 billion), beating a consensus figure of 4.72 billion, Refinitiv data showed. 
""We expect our typical quarterly earnings seasonality to be less pronounced in 2021,"" Chief Executive Pekka Lundmark said in a statement, adding that sales growth was strong across its network infrastructure business. 
After taking over the top job last year, Lundmark has streamlined the company's operation, cut jobs, and made changes to recover from product missteps under the company's previous management that hurt its 5G ambitions and weighed on its shares.
Nokia and its Nordic rival Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) have been gaining more customers as more telecom operators start rolling out 5G networks and China's Huawei is increasingly shunned by several governments over security concerns.
Nokia forecast full year net sales of between 20.6 billion euros to 21.8 billion euros, largely in line with expectations of 21.28 billion euros.
Quarterly profit rose to 5 euro cents per share while adjusted profit was 7 euro cents per share. Analysts had expected 1 euro cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Its comparable gross margin rose to 38.2% from 36.4% a year earlier, mainly driven by 5G growth. 
Rival Ericsson last week reported quarterly core earnings above market estimates, helped by higher margins and 5G rollout in China.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's first 100 days in office have left an imprint on financial markets, as stocks extended last year's gains, the dollar stagnated and bond yields rose.

The S&P 500 has is on pace to rise 10% during Biden's first 100 days, surpassing gains in the same time period for any president in the last four decades.
Counting the benchmark stock index's advance from election day to Biden's 100th day in office, the index has risen about 25%, making for ""the greatest post-election equity gains of any incoming president in at least 75 years,"" according to analysts at J.P. Morgan.
Of course, the market has been on a strong upward path since tumbling last March in the wake of the coronavirus, with the S&P rallying 90% from its lows in 2020 on a combination of massive stimulus from the Federal Reserve and U.S. lawmakers and helped by strong interest from homebound retail investors.
Still, many market watchers believe at least some of the market’s gains this year are attributable to the $1.9 trillion in stimulus Biden has already pushed through, as well as a proposed $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan.

While stocks soared on growing investor appetite for risk, the safe haven dollar languished. The greenback is on pace for a gain of 0.1% gain against a basket of six major currencies, the smallest change ever in the first 100 days for any president over the last four decades.
Near zero U.S. interest rates and the Fed’s assurances of maintaining an accommodative stance for as long as it takes for the U.S. economy to heal have been among the factors weighing the dollar down.
The greenback did receive some support from a sharp climb in Treasury yields over the first quarter that pushed speculative investors to cut bearish bets on the U.S. currency.
That move in yields has stalled in the second quarter, however, leaving the dollar floundering once again.

Expectations for a stronger “green energy” push under a Biden administration drove investors to pour money into stocks in the alternative energy sector.
Shares of the Invesco Solar ETF rose 65% between election day and Jan. 20, when Biden took office. Shares of cannabis ETF ETFMG Alternative Harvest advanced nearly 70% over the same period.
That rally, however, has cooled with shares of both ETF's peaking soon after Biden took office.

One of the strongest sectors during the first 100 days of Biden's term has been communication services, which includes Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), despite calls from lawmakers for greater regulation.
Meanwhile, a rotation into the shares of financials, energy companies and other so-called value stocks on expectations of a powerful economic rebound accelerated in 2021.

1690,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2021 01:10AM ET</span>",StanChart Q1 profit beats view as it begins recovery from virus hit,"HONG KONG (Reuters) -Standard Chartered PLC posted on Thursday a higher- than-expected 18% rise in quarterly pre-tax profit, as the emerging markets-focused bank began recovering from the economic hit caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Pre-tax profit for January-March was $1.4 billion, versus $1.2 billion a year earlier, and compared with an average analyst forecast of $1.08 billion compiled by the British bank. 
The improvement was driven by StanChart setting aside less cash to cover bad loans than it had done one year ago, as well as strong performance in its wealth management business. 
However, unlike other British-based lenders such as HSBC and Lloyds (LON:LLOY) that reported earlier this week, StanChart released only a small amount of the funds it holds against bad loans. 
The lender took a $20 million credit impairment, down a hefty $354 million from the previous quarter.
In common with HSBC, StanChart's results showed how rock-bottom interest rates globally are squeezing banks' profits, with its cash management division - usually a steady earner - seeing income fall 32%. 
And unlike U.S. rivals such as JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) that booked bumper trading profits in the first quarter, StanChart's financial markets division also saw revenues fall due to fading client demand.
One bright spot for StanChart was its often underperforming wealth management business, which saw a record quarter with income up 21% on strong sales of foreign exchange and equities-related products.

StanChart said it expected income to be similar this year to 2020, and to grow more the following year. 
Last year the bank pushed back its long-standing profitability goal of reaching a return on tangible equity of 10%, as it increased charges for bad loans due to the economic damage following the COVID-19 pandemic.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is ""committed"" to the resumption of cruise industry passenger operations in the United States by mid-summer, the agency said on Wednesday, announcing new steps to speed approvals.
The assurance comes after the state of Alaska last week joined Florida's April 8 suit to overturn a CDC decision to bar the industry from immediately resuming operations halted for a year because of the coronavirus pandemic.
""If a ship attests that 98% of its crew and 95% of its passengers are fully vaccinated,"" the agency told the industry in a letter released publicly, that ship may skip simulated voyages and move directly to open water sailing. 
The CDC said it would respond within five days to applications for simulated voyages, down from an anticipated 60 days.
It added that it would update testing and quarantine requirements for passengers and crew to align with its guidance for fully vaccinated individuals, among other steps.
The industry did not immediately comment.
However, the CDC said in its letter that the mid-summer timeline envisaged compliance with a conditional sail order (CSO) it issued this month and ""aligns with the goals announced by many major cruise lines.""
It said, ""Cruising will never be a zero-risk activity,"" adding that the goal of the CSO phased approach was to resume operations in a way that cuts the risk of COVID-19 transmission onboard ships and across port communities.
The agency looks forward to reviewing plans from cruise lines, it said.

Cruise company chief executives met this month with health experts and White House staff to consider ways for the pandemic-battered industry to return to business.
This month, largest player Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp called the CDC instructions ""unworkable"", threatening to shift the home ports of its cruise ships to other parts of the world if the United States did not allow it to start sailing.

“You are seeing markets pricing in Fed rate hikes even though the Fed is signaling they don’t think they need to take action through 2023,” Natwest Markets chief U.S. economist and co-head of global economics Michelle Girard told Bloomberg.
The central bank’s view that inflation pressures are likely “transitory” did give U.S. Treasuries a boost during the previous session. However, strong corporate earnings are not enough to sustain the bullish momentum in global stocks and investors are already searching for the next catalysts.
The focus shifted to Biden’s address, his first in his role as president, which he started by declaring that the U.S. is “on the move again.” He also pushed for a new spending and tax-credit package, which together with an earlier infrastructure and jobs plan will cost the country around $4 trillion, but is a “once-in-a-generation investment.”
The Fed’s continued dovish stance and the prospect of more U.S. stimulus have raised investor’s expectations for both inflation and interest rates.
“We are looking at an economy that with the help of vaccinations is gathering momentum and yet we are continuing to see on the monetary and fiscal front the amount of support is ongoing,” said Natwest’s Girard.
Investors will also look to the U.S. GDP for the first quarter of 2021, which will be released on Friday, for further clues about the U.S. economic recovery from COVID-19."

DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co on Wednesday said it expects a global semiconductor shortage could ease this summer but may not be fully resolved until 2022, as the automaker reported a strong first-quarter profit but said the shortage may slash second-quarter production by half.
Ford said the ongoing chip shortage would cost it about $2.5 billion and about 1.1 million units of lost production in 2021.
The No. 2 U.S. automaker handily beat Wall Street's profit estimate for the quarter, earning 81 cents a share, compared with the consensus 21 cents, according to Refinitiv IBES data. In last year's first quarter, the company lost 50 cents a share.
Ford shares were down 2.9% in after-hours trade on Wednesday.
Ford Chief Executive Jim Farley told analysts: ""There are more whitewater moments ahead for us that we have to navigate. The semiconductor shortage and the impact to production will get worse before it gets better. In fact, we believe our second quarter will be the trough for this year.""
Chief Financial Officer John Lawler said Ford's outlook was driven largely by a factory fire suffered by Japanese chipmaker Renesas. The flow of chips from Renesas is expected to be restored in July, but the global shortage of automotive semiconductors may not be fully resolved until next year, Lawler said.
Ford said its net income of $3.3 billion was the best since 2011, and adjusted pre-tax profit was a record $4.8 billion, including a $900 million non-cash gain on its investment in Rivian, the electric vehicle start-up. Ford lost $2.0 billion in the first quarter of 2020.
The company said the chip shortage will slash full-year earnings before interest and taxes to $5.5 billion-$6.5 billion. 
In February, CFO Lawler said the company was on course to earn $8 billion to $9 billion in adjusted EBIT.
Revenue in the quarter increased to $36.2 billion, from $34.3 billion a year earlier. 
Ford was able to offset some of the impact of lost production in this year's quarter by boosting the average transaction price per vehicle sold to nearly $48,000, compared with just over $44,000 a year ago, according to research firm Edmunds.com.
Ford dealers were able to command higher prices because of chip-induced shortages of popular models, such as the best-selling F-150 pickup.
Lawler said Ford in the future may stick with leaner inventories of F-150 and other models ""because it's a better way to run our business.""
Overseas, Ford reported revenue in Europe up 13% to $7.1 billion, and $341 million in pre-tax profit, reversing a year-ago loss.

Revenue climbed 39% to $800 million in China, where Ford narrowed its loss to $15 million, compared with a loss of $241 million a year earlier.

(Reuters) -Facebook Inc beat Wall Street expectations for both quarterly revenue and profit on Wednesday but warned that growth later this year could ""significantly"" decline as new Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) privacy policies will make it more difficult to target ads.
A surge in digital ad spending during the pandemic when consumers shopped online, along with higher ad prices, helped Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) revenue surge 48%. Looking ahead, the world's largest social network said it will focus on building e-commerce features to expand beyond its ad business.
Shares of Facebook rose 6.5% to $326.00 in extended trading.
""We have a long way to go to build out a full-featured commerce platform...but I am very committed to getting there,"" said Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, during an earnings call with analysts.

The digital advertising industry has boomed during the pandemic as consumers stayed home and shopped online, benefiting Facebook and others including Google, whose parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc reported record quarterly profit on Tuesday.
""Despite several headwinds - such as ongoing antitrust scrutiny, lingering privacy concerns, as well as looming changes which could negatively impact its advertising business - Facebook delivered another blockbuster quarter,"" said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com. 
Zuckerberg said the company plans to focus on three key areas: building augmented and virtual reality, e-commerce features and helping content creators earn money on Facebook's platforms. 
Monthly active users on Facebook rose 10% to 2.85 billion.
Net income for the first quarter came in at $9.5 billion, or $3.30 per share, compared with $4.9 billion, or $1.71 per share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected a profit of $2.37 per share.  
Facebook said its total expenses for the year would be in the range of $70 billion to $73 billion, as it invests in consumer hardware products like Oculus virtual reality headsets and infrastructure. 
APPLE CHANGES
On Wednesday, Facebook said it expects the iPhone privacy change to impact the second quarter, but third and fourth quarter revenue growth could slow sequentially.
Facebook has blasted Apple over its requirement that iPhone app developers begin asking users' permission to collect certain data for ads. Facebook says the change would harm its business and hurt small companies that rely on personalized advertising.
Its push to build shopping and e-commerce features within Facebook and Instagram are expected to bring additional revenue to the company and make its ad inventory more valuable.
The company recently teased a slew of new features, including an affiliate program to let content creators earn a cut of sales generated from recommending products on Instagram.

Earlier this month, Facebook announced it was building a bevy of audio products including live audio rooms to rival the popular app Clubhouse plus in-app music and podcast players. 
The company remains under scrutiny over its power as it faces major antitrust lawsuits from a large group of U.S. states and the Federal Trade Commission, and is under regular fire from lawmakers and rights groups for its content moderation policies, algorithmic systems and handling of users' data.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Evidence submitted by a retail union that raised objections to Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s conduct at this month's union election in Alabama ""could be grounds for overturning the vote"", the National Labor Relations Board said on Wednesday.
The labor board has overturned several union elections over the years. In 2016, the board overturned an election the United Steelworks union lost by a decisive vote - a decision criticized by large U.S. business lobbies. 
The NLRB will hold a hearing on May 7 to consider objections filed by the Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), which failed to secure enough votes from Amazon warehouse workers to form a union. The vote count announced on April 9 showed that workers at Amazon's Bessemer, Alabama, warehouse rejected the union by a more than 2-to-1 margin. 
""The evidence submitted by the union in support of its objections could be grounds for overturning the election if introduced at a hearing,"" the labor board said.
The RWDSU submitted nearly two dozen objections to Amazon's conduct during the election, which it said prevented employees from a ""free and uncoerced exercise of choice"" on whether to create the company's first U.S. union.
The RWDSU alleged that Amazon's agents unlawfully threatened employees with closure of the warehouse if they joined the union and that the company emailed a warning it would lay off 75% of the proposed bargaining unit because of the union.

Amazon, which has denied the allegations, did not respond to requests for comment.
For much of its history, the NLRB has used its decision-making authority to change labor policy by establishing new precedents. The board has repeatedly overturned cases decided by prior administrations. Under the Trump administration, it overturned cases detrimental to employers which had been decided during the preceding Obama presidency.

And yes, it’s a China-based technology with a global market at a time of increasing acknowledgment that the demand for tech solutions could well increase post pandemic rather than decrease. But do the company’s financials and growth prospects support its stocks’ high valuation? Read on.Investing in a stock that has recently gone public can be tricky. Information on companies can be limited and analyst coverage can be sparse. Generally, however, companies administer initial public offers to raise capital to fund product development and expansion. In an IPO, investors can buy shares of companies with the potential to grow their top-lines quickly and benefit from market-beating returns over the long-term. But it’s an investment for people with a higher risk appetite. New company dreams can easily turn to disasters.
China-based technology firm UTime Limited (UTME) conducted a blow-the-doors-off IPO earlier this month, in which its stock opened with triple-digit percentage price gains. The stock has delivered a 12x return in less than a month. So, the question is, do UTME’s financials and market prospects justify the exuberance of its IPO investors and can the stock sustain its initial upward trajectory?
Let’s look at what the company does and if it makes sense to invest in this stock right now.
